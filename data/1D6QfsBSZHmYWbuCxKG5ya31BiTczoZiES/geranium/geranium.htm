          Natural Way To Fight Infection, Inhibit Replication</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>By John Ericson</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Geranium extracts may represent a natural way of treating HIV and
      preventing it from progressing to AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      German researchers have found that geranium extracts can inhibit
      HIV type 1 by preventing the virus from invading human cells,
      raising the possibility that the next big thing in AIDS prevention
      may be found in your own backyard.<br>
      <br>
      The new study, which is published in the journal PLOS ONE, shows
      that the extracts from the geranium plant Pelargonium may
      represent a previously overlooked method of fighting HIV-1 with
      natural substances. “Global HIV-1 treatment would benefit greatly
      from safe herbal medicines with scientifically validated novel
      anti-HIV-1 activities,” lead author Dr. Ruth Brack-Werner and her
      colleagues at the German Research Center for Environmental Health
      in Munich wrote in the study.<br>
      <br>
      “The root extract from the medicinal plant Pelargonium sidoides
      (PS) is licensed in Germany as the herbal medicine EPs®7630, with
      numerous clinical trials supporting its safety in humans,” they
      added. “Here we provide evidence from multiple cell culture
      experiments that PS extract displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity.”<br>
      <br>
      HIV-1, one of the two known viral strains that cause AIDS,
      accounts for virtually all infections in the U.S. The other
      strain, HIV-2, is not widely seen outside Africa. Together, the
      two subtypes infect nearly three million people every year.<br>
      <br>
      What the new study shows is that the PS extract can attack HIV
      particles and inhibit so-called viral replication — the process
      whereby the virus hijacks healthy cells. In an experiment with
      cell cultures, the researchers were able to trace the protective
      effect back to polyphenols, a class of naturally occurring
      compounds. According to Brack-Werner, the extracts thus set the
      stage for the world’s first HIV therapy based on phytomedicine, or
      plant-based medicine. “PS extracts attack HIV-1 with a
      mode-of-action that is different from all anti-HIV-1 drugs in
      clinical use,” she explained in a press release. “Therefore a
      PS-based phytomedicine may be a valuable supplement for
      established anti-HIV therapies.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Natural HIV Treatment?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Today, HIV affects 33.4 million people globally. Since the first
      case was recorded in 1981, more than 25 million people have died
      from AIDS, the final and typically terminal stage of the
      infection.<br>
      <br>
      The new study adds to the growing number of recent breakthrough in
      HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. In another study from last
      year, researchers finally solved the mystery of how HIV progresses
      to AIDS, illuminating for the first time the tremendously complex
      process whereby the virus tricks the body’s immune cells into
      committing suicide. Similarly, a potential vaccine candidate from
      the OHSU Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute was shown to clear the
      infection in nine out of 16 monkeys afflicted with a simian model
      of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      “PS extracts are attractive candidates for increasing anti-HIV-1
      therapy options in resource-limited settings, since they are easy
      to produce and do not require refrigeration,” Brack-Werner
      concluded. “The results of our study and the proven safety of PS
      extracts encourages their testing in HIV-1 infected individuals as
      next step."<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Global HIV-1 treatment would benefit greatly from safe herbal
      medicines with scientifically validated novel anti-HIV-1
      activities. The root extract from the medicinal plant Pelargonium
      sidoides (PS) is licensed in Germany as the herbal medicine
      EPs7630, with numerous clinical trials supporting its safety in
      humans. Here we provide evidence from multiple cell culture
      experiments that PS extract displays potent anti-HIV-1 activity.
      We show that PS extract protects peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and macrophages from infection with various X4 and R5 tropic
      HIV-1 strains, including clinical isolates. Functional studies
      revealed that the extract from PS has a novel mode-of-action. It
      interferes directly with viral infectivity and blocks the
      attachment of HIV-1 particles to target cells, protecting them
      from virus entry. Analysis of the chemical footprint of anti-HIV
      activity indicates that HIV-1 inhibition is mediated by multiple
      polyphenolic compounds with low cytotoxicity and can be separated
      from other extract components with higher cytotoxicity. Based on
      our data and its excellent safety profile, we propose that PS
      extract represents a lead candidate for the development of a
      scientifically validated herbal medicine for anti-HIV-1 therapy
      with a mode-of-action different from and complementary to current
      single-molecule drugs.<br>

      Pelargonium sidoides is a medicinal plant native to South Africa.
      Its common names include Umckaloabo and South African Geranium.
      Root extract of Pelargonium sidoides is used as cold and flu
      medicine under various brand names including Kaloba, Umcka and
      Zucol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal uses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Studies have suggested that extracts from the plant could be used
      in treating acute bronchitis,[1][2][3] acute non-GABHS
      tonsillopharyngitis (sore throat) in children,[4] and the common
      cold.[5]<br>
      <br>
      A 2008 systematic review of these findings by the Cochrane
      Collaboration concluded that extracts of the plant might be
      effective in treating adults for acute rhinosinusitis and the
      common cold in adults, but they noted that this conclusion is not
      certain. They also wrote that it might be effective in relieving
      the symptoms of acute bronchitis in adults and children, and also
      the symptoms of sinusitis in adults.[6]<br>
      <br>
      A 2009 systematic review concluded "There is encouraging evidence
      from currently available data that P. sidoides is effective
      compared to placebo for patients with acute bronchitis."[7]<br>
      <br>
      A 2013 update summary of the Cochrane Collaboration however states
      they "considered the quality of the evidence low or very low for
      all major outcomes as there were few studies per disease entity,
      and all were from the same investigator (the manufacturer) and
      performed in the same region (Ukraine and Russia). Thus, in
      summary, there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of P.
      sidoides in the treatment of ARIs."[8]<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown to be antimycobacterial with significant
      antibacterial properties against multi-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus strains.[9] Gallic acid and its methyl ester present in
      large amounts in P. sidoides and in its active extracts, were
      identified as the prominent immunomodulatory principle.[10]<br>
      <br>
      The Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs 7630 is an approved drug for
      the treatment of acute bronchitis in Germany. Determination of
      virus-induced cytopathogenic effects and virus titres revealed
      that EPs 7630 at concentrations up to 100 µg/ml interfered with
      replication of seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2),
      respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus, parainfluenza
      virus, and coxsackie virus but did not affect replication of
      highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), adenovirus, or
      rhinovirus.[11]<br>
      <br>
      "Pelargonium sidoides extract modulates the production of
      secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, both interleukin-15 and
      interleukin-6 in serum, and interleukin-15 in the nasal mucosa.
      Secretory immunoglobulin A levels were increased, while levels of
      IL-15 and IL-6 were decreased. Based on this evidence, we suggest
      that this herbal medicine can exert a strong modulating influence
      on the immune response associated with the upper airway
      mucosa."[12]<br>
      <br>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of
      200 patients concluded "EPs 7630 was shown to be efficacious and
      safe in the treatment of acute bronchitis in children and
      adolescents outside the strict indication for antibiotics with
      patients treated with EPs 7630 perceiving a more favorable course
      of the disease and a good tolerability as compared with
      placebo."[13]<br>

      </b><b>Introduction:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For hundreds of years the Zulu, Basuto, Xhosa and Mfengi cultures
      have used Pelargonium sidoides as a curative for coughs, upper
      respiratory tract irritations and gastrointestinal concerns.
      Today, with the advantages of modern science and clinical
      research, we are able to better understand what makes this
      traditional remedy work so effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Pelargonium sidoides has been successfully used for the treatment
      of:<br>
      <br>

      <b>General:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pelargonium sidoides occurs throughout the eastern Cape, Lesotho,
      Free State and southern and south-western Gauteng in the Republic
      of South Africa.<br>
      <br>
      Pelargonium sidoides is called by Kalwerbossie or Rabassamin South
      Africa. However, the name Umckaloabo is most commonly known and
      originates from the Zulu language "heavy cough".<br>
      <br>
      The Englishman Charles Stevens already acknowledged the successful
      treatment of tuberculosis with umckaloabo in the early 1920’s.
      Extracts of the root have been available in German pharmacies
      since 1983 without prescription and have found widespread usage
      against infections of the sinus, throat and respiratory tract.<br>
      <br>
      The traditional use of Pelargonium sidoides for coughs and chest
      troubles may be explained by the presence of essential oils. It
      has not yet been established which ingredients contribute to its
      antibacterial properties.<br>
      <br>
      Extracts of Pelargonium sidoides have clear antibacterial
      characteristics against Streptococci, Staphylococci and Bacillus
      cereus.<br>
      <br>
      Pelargonium sidoides is also rich in phytochemicals, vitamins,
      minerals and amino acids that enhance the body’s functioning and
      protects it against diseases. Treatment with Pelargonium sidoides
      rapidly improves the typical symptoms associated with infections
      such as cough, fever, sore throat, fatigue and weakness.<br>

      How a Zulu remedy became a best-selling new medicine:<br>
      <br>
      With phenomenal growth, it's gone from being an obscure herbal
      remedy to become one of Germany's top new medicines. In the past
      two years sales have jumped over 700%--growing faster than any
      other brand. It's success is attributed to impressive clinical
      results, high consumer satisfaction and a fascinating history.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Fascinating Story:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1897, an Englishman named Charles Stevens went to South Africa
      hoping to cure himself of tuberculosis. He consulted with a Basuto
      tribal healer who gave him a decoction of a local medicinal plant.
      Fully recovered, Charles Stevens returned to England with his
      mysterious remedy--which became popular throughout Europe as
      "Steven's Consumption Cure". In 1920, a former missionary doctor,
      Adrien Sechehaye, learned of Steven's cure. During the next nine
      years he treated over 800 patients in Switzerland with a
      homeopathic preparation of the medicine. In 1929 he published the
      medical case studies.<br>
      <br>
      But with the introduction of synthetic tuberculosis drugs,
      Steven’s remedy became largely forgotten in Western
      medicine--until its recent "rediscovery" by European researchers.<br>
      <br>
      What the Basuto healer gave Charles Stevens was a traditional
      remedy made from the roots of Pelargonium sidoides - a species of
      geranium unique to South Africa. Among the Zulu, the medicine was
      described as "umKhulkane' (denoting respiratory infection) +
      'uHlabo' (roughly meaning chest pain).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Works Differently:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While most other cough, cold and sinus medications simply mask
      outward symptoms, the mechanisms and actions of Pelargonium
      sidoides actually support faster recovery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shortens Duration and Reduces Severity:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Clinical trials show that Pelargonium sidoides shortens the
      duration and reduces the severity of upper respiratory
      irritations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>High Satisfaction:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a physician assessment of adults and children suffering from
      common cold, chest and throat irritations, was rated effective in
      nearly 90% of cases!<br>
      <br>
      Its success is attributed to impressive clinical results, high
      consumer satisfaction and a fascinating history that has its roots
      in South African heritage and culture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chemistry &amp; Pharmacology:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The bioactive ingredients in P.sidoides are the tri- and
      tetra-oxygenated coumarins, gallic acid and gallic acid methyl
      ester (polyphenols), various flavonoids, as well as significant
      levels of calcium and silica. <br>
      P.sidoides contains two distinct coumarins: umckalin and its
      7-O-methyl ester, together with four other methoxycoumarins and
      three unique coumarin sulphates. Scopoletin and
      6,7,8-trihydroxycoumarin are also found. Most of the coumarins
      contain a methoxy function at the C7 position and an OH group at
      either the C6 or C8 positions; functionality that is responsible
      for their antibacterial activity.<br>
      <br>
      Gallic acid and its methyl ester are present in large amounts.
      These were identified as the prominent immunomodulatory principle
      for this herbal medicine. Macrophage activation was confirmed by
      an in vitro study based on Leishmania parasites (Phytother Res
      2001 Mar; 15(2): 122-6). The same authors, Kayser, O. and
      Kolodziej, H. (Planta Medica 63, 508-510) also studied the
      antibacterial performance of the various coumarins and gallic acid
      compounds found in Pelargonium sidoides and found that with the
      exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially
      active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. These
      results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of
      umckaloabo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Studies:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on patients with acute
      bronchitis confirmed that extracts of p.sidoides were effective in
      treating this ailment. Similar studies have also shown the
      effectiveness of p.sidoides extracts for treating
      tonsillopharyngitis in children in the age group 6-10 years
      (Phytopharmaka VII, October 2001). Encouraging results have also
      been achieved with children, especially those who have not
      responded well to repeated treatment with antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      The alcoholic extract of the root has been shown to have a
      three-way effect:<br>
      <br>
      1.) Anti-bacterial: The p.sidoides extract prevents bacteria from
      attaching to cells in the mucous membranes.<br>
      <br>
      2.) Antiviral effect: Similarly, p.sidoides prevents viruses from
      attaching to the mucous membrane cells and stimulates the body’s
      immune system in such a way that both bacteria and viruses are
      prevented from multiplying.<br>
      <br>
      3.) Expectorant: the extract acts as an expectorant, allowing the
      body to expel contaminated mucous making conditions less suitable
      for the multiplication of the bacteria and viruses.<br>
      <br>
      The three-way effect attacks the acute infection at its root, the
      stabilization of the immune system prevents a re-infection and the
      vicious circle of infection, short recovery phase and new
      infection is broken. Due to its bacteriostatic and
      immune-modulating characteristics p.sidoides appears to be a good
      alternative to the conventional therapy of treating respiratory
      illnesses with antibiotics.<br>

      The extract solution may either directly incurred in the

      [0006] extracts of Pelargonium species, in particular from
      Pelargonium sidoides and / or Pelargonium reniforme can be used in
      medicines or food and be ingested orally, usually as solid or
      liquid dosage forms.<br>
      Major components of these extracts are proanthocyanidins and
      substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones (coumarins).<br>
      [0007] solutions of pelargonium extracts, such liquid
      pharmaceutical dosage forms which contain these extracts from
      Pelargonium sidoides and / or reniforme in solution, however, have
      the drawback of an insufficient storage stability.<br>
      When storing a decrease in the content of proanthocyanidins and
      2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones is detected.<br>
      [0008] The object of the present invention is therefore to provide
      storage-stable solutions of Pelargonium extracts available.<br>
      The content of proanthocyanidins and the content of
      2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones for the desired storage time under defined

      C and a relative humidity of 60% within nine months to a maximum
      of 10%, preferably not more than 7%, more preferably at most 5%,
      and more than 3%, based on the weight decrease.<br>
      [0009] This object is erfindungemäss achieved by a process for the
      preparation of solutions of pelargonium extracts, characterized in
      that the oxygen quantity at atmospheric pressure in the head space
      of the package used for storing the solution of pelargonium
      extracts to a maximum of 0.025 parts by volume per volume part of
      the solution is reduced, wherein the content of proanthocyanidines
      and 2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones after 9 months of storage at 25 deg.<br>
      C and a relative humidity of 60% to a maximum of 10 weight -% is
      reduced.<br>
      [0010] proanthocyanidins are understood to be mono-, oligo-and
      polymeric flavone derivatives, which are composed of flavan-3-ol
      units, preferably from gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, catechin
      and epicatechin, and usually with group determination methods,
      such<br>
      Example, be measured photometrically according to Folin-Ciocalteu.<br>
      [0011] contained in Pelargonium species and stabilizing
      2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones are 5 - to 8-position of two-to
      tetrasubstituted by hydroxy, methoxy and / or Sulfooxy
      2H-1-benzopyran-2-one .<br>
      The quantification is typically effected by HPLC with UV
      detection, wherein one or more lead compounds such<br>
      B. 6,8-bis-(sulfooxy)-7-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one (compound I)
      and 7-hydroxy-5 ,6-dimethoxy-8-sulfooxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2 -one
      (compound II) can be selected for the determination.<br>
      [0012] It has surprisingly been found that such storage-stable
      solutions of pelargonium extracts can be obtained if the volume of
      oxygen is limited or reduced in the head space of the package used
      for storage.<br>
      It is particularly surprising that this stabilization also in the
      case of 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one succeeds, as these are not
      considered as sensitive to oxygen.<br>
      [0013] The 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one basic structure is in neutral or
      weakly acidic medium usually very stable, so that an instability
      expects if by hydrolytic cleavage of sulfate residues in the
      aforementioned substituted 2H-1-benzopyran-2-ones could be.<br>
      Thus, for example, should be to eliminate by adjustment of the pH,
      the hydrolysis is not, however, be achieved by the inventive
      measures to stabilize the compounds I and II.<br>
      It is therefore particularly surprising that with the process of
      this invention, stabilization in the case of the
      2H-1-benzopyran-2-one.<br>
      [0014] The inventive method for the reduction of the oxygen
      content comprises selecting a container with a correspondingly
      small head space and / or the displacement of oxygen by means of
      modified atmosphere and / or the removal of oxygen from the
      headspace of the container by an oxygen-removing agent ("oxygen
      scavenger") , said means may consist of one or more substances,
      and is such that it does not react or only to an insignificant
      extent with ingredients of the solution of pelargonium extracts.<br>
      [0015] According to the invention the head space volume of the
      container and / or the conditions of the protective gas to be
      selected so that the oxygen volume in the headspace at atmospheric
      pressure, a maximum of 0.025 parts by volume (preferably 0.015
      parts by volume, more preferably 0.005 parts by volume) of oxygen
      per part by volume of the solution of pelargonium species amounts.<br>
      As a protective gas, in particular nitrogen, carbon dioxide or
      noble gases such as are<br>
      As argon and in mixtures, into consideration.<br>
      [0016] oxygen-removing agent ("oxygen scavenger") containing one
      or more substances that are alone and / or in combination in a
      position included in the headspace of the container oxygen by
      adsorption and / or absorption and / or chemical reaction to
      remove .<br>
      The composition of the oxygen-removing agent according to the
      invention to be selected so that the oxygen content in the package
      headspace to a maximum of 0.025 parts by volume (preferably 0.015
      parts by volume, more preferably 0.005 parts by volume) of oxygen
      per part by volume of the solution of pelargonium extracts is
      reduced.<br>
      [0017] As part of the oxygen scavenging agents are for example the
      following substances are suitable: ascorbic acid, salts of
      ascorbic acid such as sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, or
      calcium ascorbate, esters of ascorbic acid with fatty acids such
      as palmitic or stearic acid, metals or metal salts in low
      oxidation states, such as iron, iron (II ) oxide, iron (II)
      hydroxide or iron (II) chloride or oxidizable polymers such as
      MXD6, a condensed polymer of m-xylylenediamine and adipic acid.<br>
      [0018] From the literature are known numerous possible embodiments
      of suitable oxygen scavenging agent.<br>
      [0019] The JP3014481 for example, discloses an oxygen-permeable,
      iron and possibly other substances containing bags with low
      moisture permeability, which can be used to remove oxygen from the
      filled containers with liquids.<br>
      [0020] From JP2003081353 are adhesive films having a multilayer
      structure including an oxygen-absorbing layer, are known which can
      be fixed to the inside of the packaging used for the storage of an
      oxygen sensitive material.<br>
      [0021] Screw caps with oxygen-absorbing insoles are described for

        DRY EXTRACTS OF PELARGONIUM SIDOIDES AND PELARGONIUM RENIFORME.</b><br>
      <b>US2010112096</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to production methods for obtaining dry
      extracts from Pelargonium sidoides and/or Pelargonium reniforme,
      extracts obtainable according to said method, and pharmaceutical
      products comprising such extracts.<br>
      <br>
      001] The present invention relates to production methods for
      obtaining dry extracts from Pelargonium sidoides and/or
      Pelargonium reniforme, extracts obtained by said methods and
      preparations containing such extracts.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The preparations obtained from the pelargonium species
      Pelargonium sidoides and/or Pelargonium reniforme native to
      southern Africa are traditionally used in this region for the
      therapeutic treatment of respiratory disorders and
      gastrointestinal symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The efficacy of an aqueous-ethanolic liquid extract of the
      roots of Pelargonium sidoides, EPs 7630, in the treatment of
      infections of the respiratory tract and the ENT region has
      meanwhile been proven by numerous clinical studies and
      observations of practical application (Kolodziej et al., Deutsche
      Apotheker Zeitung 143 (12): 55-64 (2003)).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The effect of the extract is caused by several
      therapeutically active components. Tanning agents and coumarin
      derivatives are considered important therapeutic components in
      Pelargonium sidoides. Such components are also contained in
      extracts from Pelargonium reniforme.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Depending on their consistency, the European Pharmacopoeia
      classifies extracts into liquid (liquid extracts and tinctures),
      semi-solid (viscous extracts) and solid (dry extracts)
      preparations. Dry extracts are prepared by evaporation or removal
      of the solvent used for preparation and usually have a loss in
      drying or water content of 5 wt.-% maximum. They have many
      advantages vis-à-vis liquid and semi-solid extracts. They have
      better stability, are easier to handle and may be used for
      preparing solid galenic dosage forms. In particular, direct use of
      an aqueous-ethanolic liquid extract is ruled out in those cases
      where a liquid dosage form without alcohol is desirable, for
      example in the administration to children.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Dry plant extracts are, for example, known from EP 0 589
      921 B 1 and EP 1 037 674. These dry extracts contain carrier
      substances, among other things.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] EP 0 589 921 B 1 relates to thick and/or dry plant extracts
      having the same or a very similar active ingredient spectrum as a
      corresponding liquid extract, the use thereof and a method for
      producing the same. EP 0 589 921 B 1 is based on the problem that
      not all of the volatile drug ingredients of liquid extracts may be
      contained in the resulting thick and/or dry extracts due to
      evaporation of the solvent in case of conventional drying. In
      addition, the extracts disclosed may contain pharmaceutical
      excipients, carrier media and/or disintegrants. Preferred
      substances cited are, among others, mono- and/or polysaccharides
      and cellulose, cellulose derivatives, starch and starch
      derivatives. The addition of the excipients which takes place
      after removing the solvent of the original liquid extracts has the
      object of preventing the escape of volatile components to any
      significant extent during the subsequent processing to obtain
      pharmaceuticals.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] EP 1 037 647 B 2 relates to dry medicinal plant extracts
      from Passiflora, Agnus castus, Crataegus, Gingko, stinging nettle
      extract, valerian, Cimicifuga root or rootstock and/or Cynara for
      peroral application wherein the non-volatile phase of the extract
      is bonded to a carrier I which is solid at room temperature and is
      selected from polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvidone
      acetate and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone as well as a carrier II which
      is selected from alcohol-insoluble, water-insoluble,
      water-swellable carriers solid at room temperature and or alkaline
      earth metal and/or alkali metal carbonates including hydrogen
      carbonates in micro-disperse form and/or in the form of a
      semi-solid or solid solution, optionally in addition to other
      excipients and/or additives. Such extracts are characterised by a
      release of the plant ingredients which is defined with regard to
      extent and speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] However, we are faced with a problem in the preparation of
      pelargonium dry extracts, namely that the dry extracts obtained by
      direct drying of pelargonium liquid extracts will not dissolve
      completely even in a large solvent excess in physiologically
      compatible, primarily aqueous and or aqueous-alcoholic solvents
      including mixtures of water and polyols and, optionally, alcohols
      (cf. comparative examples 1-2). On the one hand, this makes the
      production of liquid preparations from these dry extracts
      difficult, while the efficacy of the dry extracts may be generally
      affected on the other.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to
      provide dry extracts from Pelargonium sidoides and/or reniforme
      having improved solubility.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Dry extracts prepared by the method of the invention are at
      least somewhat soluble in physiologically compatible solvents.
      According to the European Pharmacopoeia, 5thed., they dissolve
      practically without residues at a ratio of at least 1 g of dry
      extract to 100 ml of solvent and thus yield a clear or opalescent
      solution without any sediment. Said opalescence is not higher than
      the opalescence reference suspension of the European
      Pharmacopoeia, 5thed. (corresponding to 60 NTU=Nephelometric
      Turbidity Units).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Surprisingly, it has now been found that the solubility of
      dry extracts from Pelargonium sidoides and/or Pelargonium
      reniforme is significantly improved if carrier substances selected
      from the group of saccharides and sugar alcohols are added to the
      extract solutions used before conversion to a solid form by
      drying. This effect is particularly surprising as the solution
      characteristics of dry extracts prepared by the conventional route
      in physiologically compatible solvents cannot be improved by
      simple admixing of these carrier substances (see comparative
      examples 3-8).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The improved solubility of the dry extracts of the
      invention is particularly advantageous if the dry extracts are
      processed with the customary excipients to obtain (coated)
      tablets. In this case, a particularly favourable release of the
      active ingredient can be achieved by using the dry extract of the
      invention. Typically, this will be demonstrated in accordance with
      the method 2.9.3.5 of the European Pharmacopoeia, 5thed., "Prüfung
      der Wirkstofffreisetzung aus festen Arzneiformen" (testing the
      release of active ingredients from solid dosage forms). A good
      release of the active ingredient from the dosage form is a
      prerequisite for a good efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The extract solutions of Pelargonium sidoides and/or
      Pelargonium reniforme (i.e. solutions of the starting extract) to
      be used in the method for preparing the dry extracts of the
      invention may be obtained, for example, by first extracting dried
      and comminuted roots of Pelargonium sidoides and/or Pelargonium
      reniforme with water and one or more aqueous-alcoholic solvents or
      one or more aqueous-ketonic (i.e. aqueous-acetonic) solvents by
      the conventional route, for example at temperatures of 10 to
      100[deg.] C. Where necessary, the drug residue is slightly
      squeezed out and the crude extract optionally filtered. It is
      preferred to use mixtures of water and a monohydric C1-C3 alcohol
      selected from methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol and 2-propanol for
      preparing the solution of the starting extract.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The water portion of the aqueous-alcoholic or
      aqueous-ketonic solvents is preferably at least 50 wt.-% and
      preferably at most 95 wt.-%. It is preferred to prepare the liquid
      extract by percolation with an aqueous-ethanolic solvent,
      optionally after prior mashing with an aqueous-ethanolic solvent
      in accordance with EP 1 429 795.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Other suitable extract solutions are also described in DE
      10 2004 063 910, for example, especially in para. [0017] and
      examples 3 and 4. The disclosure of the two latter publications is
      expressly included by reference with regard to the preparation of
      extract solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] After that, a solid carrier substance is dissolved in the
      liquid extract thus obtained. Alternatively, several solid carrier
      substances may be used. The mass ratio of the carrier substance(s)
      to the dry residue (determined in accordance with the European
      Pharmacopoeia, 5thed., by three hours of drying at 100 to
      105[deg.] C.) of the extract solution is 1:4 to 9:1, preferably
      1:1 to 6:1, especially 2:1 to 5:1. The solution is concentrated
      and dried by the usual methods, for example at a pressure of 0.001
      bar to atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 20 to 100[deg.]
      C. Alternatively, the carrier substance(s) may be added during the
      concentration step.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Suitable carrier substances are monosaccharides such as
      fructose, galactose, glucose, xylose and/or oligosaccharides such
      as [alpha]-cyclodextrin, [beta]-cyclodextrin,
      [gamma]-cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl betadex, lactose, lactulose,
      maltose, raffinose, saccharose, trehalose and/or polysaccharides
      such as chitosan, chitosan hydrochloride, dextran, dextrin
      guargalactomannan, gum arabic, hydroxyethyl cellulose,
      hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, inulin,
      maltodextrin, methylcellulose, methylhydroxyethyl cellulose,
      polydextrose and/or sugar alcohols such as erythritol, isomalt,
      lactilol, maltitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Another subject matter of the invention are dry extracts
      from Pelargonium sidoides and/or reniforme that may be obtained by
      the method of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Another subject matter of the invention are preparations
      containing said dry extracts, optionally in combination with other
      substances such as active ingredients and/or excipients.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] These preparations may be drugs, food products, medical
      products, cosmetic products or consumer products, for example.
      Food products should especially be interpreted as dietetic food
      products, food supplements as well as medical food, health food
      and dietary supplements.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The dry extracts of the invention may be processed together
      with the customary excipients to obtain solid preparations such as
      powders, granulates, pellets, tablets, capsules or coated tablets.
      Excipients suitable for use may be the customary fillers, binders,
      disintegrants, lubricants and, optionally, aroma and flavouring
      agents and coating agents for coated tablets. The customary
      excipient oils and fats may be used as fillers in the preparation
      of soft capsules; the shell of the soft capsules may be made of
      gelatine, for example. The dry extracts according to the invention
      may be processed with the customary excipients to obtain liquid
      preparations such as solutions, sprays, emulsions and suspensions.
      Common solvents, solubilisers, stabilisers as well as aroma and
      flavouring agents may be used as excipients. Dosing is selected in
      such a manner that a quantity of the dry extract is taken per day
      which corresponds to 2 to 1,000 mg, preferably 5 to 400 mg, and
      especially preferably 10 to 200 mg of dry residue of the liquid
      extract used for preparation.<br>

      [0030] 28 kg of ethanol (35 wt.-%) were added to 14 kg of ground
      root of Pelargonium sidoides and stored at room temperature for 20
      hrs. Afterwards, the mixture was percolated with 112 kg of ethanol
      (6 wt.-%) for 10 hrs and then filtered. The dry residue of the
      filtrate was 1.78 wt.-%.<br>
