      A monocopter or gyropter is a rotorcraft that uses a single
      rotating blade. The concept is similar to the whirling helicopter
      seeds that fall from some trees. The name gyropter is sometimes
      applied to monocopters in which the entire aircraft rotates about
      its center of mass as it flies. The name "monocopter" has also
      been applied to the personal jet pack constructed by Andreas
      Petzoldt.[1] <br>

      Papin and Rouilly's "Gyropter" possessed only a single hollow
      blade with a plan area of 12 square metres. The counterweight was
      a fan worked from a Le Rhone 80hp rotary engine revolving at 1.200
      r.p.m. to give an output of just over 7 cubic metres of air per
      second. At the centre of gravity between the blade and the fan was
      the pilot's cab. The fan drove air through the hollow blade, from
      which it escaped through an L-shaped tube at a speed of 100 metres
      per second.<br>

      <br>
      Including the float on which it was mounted the aircraft weighed
      500kg. Directional control was to be achieved by means of a small
      auxiliary pipe through which some of the air was driven, and which
      could be directed in whatever direction the pilot wished.<br>

      Tests were carried out on 31st March 1915 on Lake Cercey on the
      Cote d'Or, and a rotor speed of 47 r.p.m. was reached.
      Unfortunately the aircraft became unstable and the pilot had to
      abandon it, after which it sank.<br>

        <b>By William Pearce</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Gyroptere was designed in France from 1911-1914 by Alphonse
      Papin and Didier Rouilly. Their monocopter was based on the
      sycamore seed; a single blade extends from the seed to spin the
      seed and slow its descent as it falls. Though unsuccessful, the
      machine was the first air-jet helicopter. Papin and Rouilly
      obtained French patents 440,593 and 440,594 for their invention
      and later obtained U.S. patent 1,133,660 in 1915 (filed in 1912).<br>
      <br>
      Construction of Papin and Rouilly’s Gyroptere began in February
      1914 and was completed in June of the same year. The prototype was
      named Chrysalis (Chrysalide). Constructed of molded wood, the
      Gyroptere was well built with compound curves and a smooth sweep
      of its single, long, airfoil-shaped blade. The fabric-covered
      blade was hollow and approximately 19.5 ft (5.9 m) long and 4.4 ft
      (1.33 m) wide, giving it an area of 130 sq ft (12 sq m). The blade
      was counterbalanced by an 80 hp (60 kW), nine-cylinder Le Rhone
      rotary engine. The pilot occupied a nacelle between the blade and
      engine. The bottom of the nacelle included a structure to support
      the machine while it was on the ground or act as a float when on
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The Le Rhone engine was started with a pulley system. The engine,
      turning at 1,200 rpm, drove a fan that produced an output of just
      over 250 cu ft (7 cu m) of air per second. The air, along with the
      engine’s hot exhaust for thermal expansion, was directed through
      the length of the blade and exited the blade’s tip through a
      nozzle on the trailing edge at 330 ft/s (100 m/s). This jet of air
      would turn the blade, and the gyroscopic force of the motor would
      lift the blade into a positive angle of attack. The nacelle that
      carried the pilot was centered on the axis of rotation. The
      nacelle was mounted on ball-bearings and was centered against four
      horizontal rollers. The entire machine weighed 1,100 lb (500 kg),
      which was 220 lb (100 kg) more than originally planned.<br>

      This image offers a good view of the Gyroptere. The blade does not
      have its covering, the float and directional control tube can
      clearly be seen in the center nacelle, and the Le Rhone engine in
      its fan housing is on the right.<br>
      <br>
      The pilot controlled the Gyroptere through the use of two foot
      pedals: one pedal opened a valve to admit air to the blade; and
      the second pedal allowed air into an L-shaped tube above the craft
      that served as a rudder for directional control. The L-shaped tube
      was directed by the pilot; its discharge provided forward thrust,
      steering, and stabilized the center drum to prevent it from
      spinning with the blade. A switch in the nacelle allowed the pilot
      to engaged or disengaged the engine.<br>

      The outbreak of World War I delayed testing until 31 March 1915.
      During tests on Lake Cercey (Reservoir de Cercey), near
      Pouilly-en-Auxois, France, the craft achieved a rotor speed of
      only 47 rpm, well below the 60 rpm calculated as necessary for
      liftoff. Even so, the machine was wildly out of balance, and the
      blade repeatedly contacted the water, damaging itself and shaking
      up the pilot. In addition, the Le Rhone engine used was not
      powerful enough; the Gyroptere had been designed to use a 100 hp
      (75 kW) engine which could not be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      A military commission observing the test determined that such a
      machine could not aid the war effort and halted further
      evaluation. The Gyroptere remained at Lake Cercey until it was
      sold for scrap in 1919.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Line-throwing apparatus. -Relates principally to helicopters, but
      is also applicable for use as rocket and line throwing apparatus,
      in which the car is carried in axial alinement with the sustaining
      screw propeller, which is of the Barker'smill type, being rotated
      by tangential jets of gas, and consists principally in using a
      propeller with only one blade ; but where more than one blade is
      used, special apparatus is provided for drawing in the air which
      is forced out at the tips for rotating the screw. With two blades,
      the motor unit is at the centre, but with one blade, the unit is
      placed so as to balance the blade. The boss 2, Fig. 6, enables the
      machine to rest on the ground or on water, while the blades are
      still revolving. The engine 4 may be of any type, and when of the
      rotary radial cylinder form, or turbine type, the fan-wheel 5 is
      mounted on the engine. The fan is enclosed, and the delivery
      passage, which is controlled by a valve 6&lt;b&gt;, is connected
      by a duct 8 to the nozzles. The exhaust gases may be passed into
      the fan. The fan inlet is on the tcp of the casing, and provision
      is made for drawing in small quantities of water, and the delivery
      passage may pass around the boss on the sime side as or opposite
      to the position of the discharge nozzles. The rudders or steering-
      planes situated at the blade top are actuated by compressed air.
      The car 2&lt;a&gt; is mounted on the boss of the propeller, Figs.
      20 and 21, on a footstep bearing and with three side rollers 11, a
      packing- ring 13 reducing air leakages. The footstep is hollow for
      the control rods 14, 15, which act on the valve of the
      compressed-air steering-gear. Outside rods 16 coact with a cam
      edge 2&lt;b&gt; when this is lowered by the hand-lever 19. The
      rods 16 actuate a valve on the gear which produces an inclination
      of the screw relative to the car for the purpose of getting a
      propelling as well as a lifting effect. Rings 20, brushes 21, and
      a switch are used for controlling the ignition current of the
      engine. For keeping the car fixed, a rudder vane 23 is opened out
      and closed as desired when the propeller revolves. A second rudder
      25 is raised and feathered so as to bring the car automatically
      head to wind.<br>
