      It is possible to create steam within seconds by focusing sunlight
      on nanoparticles mixed into water, according to new research.<br>
      <br>
      That observation, reported Monday by scientists at Rice University
      in Texas, suggests myriad applications in places that lack
      electricity or burnable fuels. A sun-powered boiler could
      desalinate sea water, distill alcohol, sterilize medical equipment
      and perform other useful tasks.<br>
      <br>
      "We can build a portable, compact steam generator that depends
      only on sunlight for input. It is something that could really be
      good in remote or resource-limited locations," said Naomi J.
      Halas, an engineer and physicist at Rice who ran the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the rig she and her colleagues describe would work on an
      industrial scale is unknown. If it does, it could mark an advance
      for solar-powered energy more generally.<br>
      <br>
      "We will see how far it can ultimately go. There are certainly
      places and situations where it would be valuable to generate
      steam," said Paul S. Weiss, editor of the American Chemical
      Society's journal ACS Nano, which published the paper online in
      advance of the journalís December print publication.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment is more evidence that nanoscale devices -- in this
      case, beads one-tenth the diameter of a human hair -- behave in
      ways different from bigger objects.<br>
      <br>
      In the apparatus designed by the Rice team, steam forms in a
      vessel of water long before the water becomes warm to the touch.
      It is, in effect, possible to turn a container of water into steam
      before it gets hot enough to boil.<br>
      <br>
      "There is a disconnect between what happens when we heat a pot of
      water and what happens when we put nanoparticles in that water,"
      said Weiss, who is a chemist and director of the California
      Nanosystems Institute at UCLA.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a novel proposed application of nanoparticles," said A.
      Paul Alivisatos, director of the Lawrence Berkeley National
      Laboratory and a nanotechnology expert. ìI think it is very
      interesting and will stimulate a lot of others to think about the
      heating of water with sunlight."<br>
      <br>
      In the Rice experiment, the researchers stirred a small amount of
      nanoparticles into water and put the mixture into a glass vessel.
      They then focused sunlight on the mixture with a lens.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoparticles -- either carbon or gold-coated silicon dioxide
      beads -- have a diameter shorter than the wavelength of visible
      light. That allows them to absorb most of a wave of light's
      energy. If they had been larger, the particles would have
      scattered much of the light.<br>
      <br>
      In the focused light, a nanoparticle rapidly becomes hot enough to
      vaporize the layer of water around it. It then becomes enveloped
      in a bubble of steam. That, in turn, insulates it from the mass of
      water that, an instant before the steam formed, was bathing and
      cooling it.<br>
      <br>
      Insulated in that fashion, the particle heats up further and forms
      more steam. It eventually becomes buoyant enough to rise. As it
      floats toward the surface, it hits and merges with other bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      At the surface, the nanoparticles-in-bubbles release their steam
      into the air. They then sink back toward the bottom of the vessel.
      When they encounter the focused light, the process begins again.
      All of this occurs within seconds.<br>
      <br>
      In all, about 80 percent of the light energy a nanoparticle
      absorbs goes into making steam, and only 20 percent is "lost" in
      heating the water. This is far different from creating steam in a
      tea kettle. There, all the water must reach boiling temperature
      before an appreciable number of water molecules fly into the air
      as steam.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomenon is such that it is possible to put the vessel
      containing the water-and-nanoparticle soup into an ice bath, focus
      light on it and make steam.<br>
      <br>
      "It shows you could make steam in an arctic environment," Halas
      said. "There might be some interesting applications there."<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus can also separate mixtures of water and other
      substances into their components -- the process known as
      distillation -- more completely than is usually possible. For
      example, with normal distillation of a water-and-alcohol mixture,
      it isn't possible to get more than 95 percent pure alcohol. Using
      nanoparticles to create the steam, 99 percent alcohol can be
      collected.<br>
      <br>
      Halas said the nanoparticles are not expensive to make and,
      because they act essentially as catalysts, are not used up. A
      nanoparticle steam generator could be used over and over. And, as
      James Watt and other 18th-century inventors showed, if you can
      generate steam easily, you can create an industrial revolution.<br>
      <br>
      The research is being funded in part by the Bill &amp; Melinda
      Gates Foundation in the hope it might prove useful to developing
      countries. Halas and her team recently spent three days in Seattle
      demonstrating the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      "Luckily," she said, "it was sunny."<br>

      <br>
      Rice University nanotechnology researchers have unveiled a
      solar-powered sterilization system that could be a boon for more
      than 2.5 billion people who lack adequate sanitation. The “solar
      steam” sterilization system uses nanomaterials to convert as much
      as 80 percent of the energy in sunlight into germ-killing heat.<br>
      <br>
      The technology is described online in a July 8 paper in the
      Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Early Edition. In
      the paper, researchers from Rice’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics
      (LANP) show two ways that solar steam can be used for
      sterilization — one setup to clean medical instruments and another
      to sanitize human waste.<br>
      <br>
      “Sanitation and sterilization are enormous obstacles without
      reliable electricity,” said Rice photonics pioneer Naomi Halas,
      the director of LANP and lead researcher on the project, with
      senior co-author and Rice professor Peter Nordlander. “Solar
      steam’s efficiency at converting sunlight directly into steam
      opens up new possibilities for off-grid sterilization that simply
      aren’t available today.”<br>
      <br>
      In a previous study last year, Halas and colleagues showed that
      “solar steam” was so effective at direct conversion of solar
      energy into heat that it could even produce steam from ice water.<br>
      <br>
      “It makes steam directly from sunlight,” she said. “That means the
      steam forms immediately, even before the water boils.”<br>
      <br>
      Halas, Rice’s Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and
      Computer Engineering, professor of physics, professor of chemistry
      and professor of biomedical engineering, is one of the world’s
      most-cited chemists. Her lab specializes in creating and studying
      light-activated particles. One of her creations, gold nanoshells,
      is the subject of several clinical trials for cancer treatment.<br>

      ultra-small-scale system to treat human waste in developing
      nations without sewer systems or electricity. Photo by Jeff Fitlow<br>
      <br>
      Solar steam’s efficiency comes from light-harvesting nanoparticles
      that were created at LANP by Rice graduate student Oara Neumann,
      the lead author on the PNAS study. Neumann created a version of
      nanoshells that converts a broad spectrum of sunlight — including
      both visible and invisible bandwidths — directly into heat. When
      submerged in water and exposed to sunlight, the particles heat up
      so quickly they instantly vaporize water and create steam. The
      technology has an overall energy efficiency of 24 percent.
      Photovoltaic solar panels, by comparison, typically have an
      overall energy efficiency of around 15 percent.<br>
      <br>
      When used in the autoclaves in the tests, the heat and pressure
      created by the steam were sufficient to kill not just living
      microbes but also spores and viruses. The solar steam autoclave
      was designed by Rice undergraduates at Rice’s Oshman Engineering
      Design Kitchen and refined by Neumann and colleagues at LANP. In
      the PNAS study, standard tests for sterilization showed the solar
      steam autoclave could kill even the most heat-resistant microbes.<br>
      <br>
      “The process is very efficient,” Neumann said. “For the Bill &amp;
      Melinda Gates Foundation program that is sponsoring us, we needed
      to create a system that could handle the waste of a family of four
      with just two treatments per week, and the autoclave setup we
      reported in this paper can do that.”<br>
      <br>
      Halas said her team hopes to work with waste-treatment pioneer
      Sanivation to conduct the first field tests of the solar steam
      waste sterilizer at three sites in Kenya.<br>
      <br>
      “Sanitation technology isn’t glamorous, but it’s a matter of life
      and death for 2.5 billion people,” Halas said. “For this to really
      work, you need a technology that can be completely off-grid,
      that’s not that large, that functions relatively quickly, is easy
      to handle and doesn’t have dangerous components. Our Solar Steam
      system has all of that, and it’s the only technology we’ve seen
      that can completely sterilize waste. I can’t wait to see how it
      performs in the field.”<br>

      Dong, Kevin Schell, Benjamin Lu, Eric Kim, Mary Quinn, Shea
      Thompson, Nathaniel Grady, Maria Oden and Nordlander, all of Rice.

      <br>
      Rice University scientists have unveiled a revolutionary new
      technology that uses nanoparticles to convert solar energy
      directly into steam. The new “solar steam” method from Rice’s
      Laboratory for Nanophotonics (LANP) is so effective it can even
      produce steam from icy cold water. <br>
      <br>
      Details of the solar steam method were published online today in
      ACS Nano. The technology has an overall energy efficiency of 24
      percent. Photovoltaic solar panels, by comparison, typically have
      an overall energy efficiency around 15 percent. However, the
      inventors of solar steam said they expect the first uses of the
      new technology will not be for electricity generation but rather
      for sanitation and water purification in developing countries.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      “This is about a lot more than electricity,” said LANP Director
      Naomi Halas, the lead scientist on the project. “With this
      technology, we are beginning to think about solar thermal power in
      a completely different way.”<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of solar steam is due to the light-capturing
      nanoparticles that convert sunlight into heat. When submerged in
      water and exposed to sunlight, the particles heat up so quickly
      they instantly vaporize water and create steam. Halas said the
      solar steam’s overall energy efficiency can probably be increased
      as the technology is refined.<br>
      <br>
      “We’re going from heating water on the macro scale to heating it
      at the nanoscale,” Halas said. “Our particles are very small —
      even smaller than a wavelength of light — which means they have an
      extremely small surface area to dissipate heat. This intense
      heating allows us to generate steam locally, right at the surface
      of the particle, and the idea of generating steam locally is
      really counterintuitive.”<br>
      <br>
      To show just how counterintuitive, Rice graduate student Oara
      Neumann videotaped a solar steam demonstration in which a test
      tube of water containing light-activated nanoparticles was
      submerged into a bath of ice water. Using a lens to concentrate
      sunlight onto the near-freezing mixture in the tube, Neumann
      showed she could create steam from nearly frozen water.<br>
      <br>
      Steam is one of the world’s most-used industrial fluids. About 90
      percent of electricity is produced from steam, and steam is also
      used to sterilize medical waste and surgical instruments, to
      prepare food and to purify water.<br>
      <br>
      Most industrial steam is produced in large boilers, and Halas said
      solar steam’s efficiency could allow steam to become economical on
      a much smaller scale.<br>
      <br>
      People in developing countries will be among the first to see the
      benefits of solar steam. Rice engineering undergraduates have
      already created a solar steam-powered autoclave that’s capable of
      sterilizing medical and dental instruments at clinics that lack
      electricity. Halas also won a Grand Challenges grant from the Bill
      and Melinda Gates Foundation to create an ultra-small-scale system
      for treating human waste in areas without sewer systems or
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      “Solar steam is remarkable because of its efficiency,” said
      Neumann, the lead co-author on the paper. “It does not require
      acres of mirrors or solar panels. In fact, the footprint can be
      very small. For example, the light window in our demonstration
      autoclave was just a few square centimeters.”<br>
      <br>
      Another potential use could be in powering hybrid air-conditioning
      and heating systems that run off of sunlight during the day and
      electricity at night. Halas, Neumann and colleagues have also
      conducted distillation experiments and found that solar steam is
      about two-and-a-half times more efficient than existing
      distillation columns.<br>
      <br>
      Halas, the Stanley C. Moore Professor in Electrical and Computer
      Engineering, professor of physics, professor of chemistry and
      professor of biomedical engineering, is one of the world’s
      most-cited chemists. Her lab specializes in creating and studying
      light-activated particles. One of her creations, gold nanoshells,
      is the subject of several clinical trials for cancer treatment.<br>
      <br>
      For the cancer treatment technology and many other applications,
      Halas’ team chooses particles that interact with just a few
      wavelengths of light. For the solar steam project, Halas and

      Solar illumination of broadly absorbing metal or carbon
      nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid produces vapor without the
      requirement of heating the fluid volume. When particles are
      dispersed in water at ambient temperature, energy is directed
      primarily to vaporization of water into steam, with a much smaller
      fraction resulting in heating of the fluid. Sunlight-illuminated
      particles can also drive H2O–ethanol distillation, yielding
      fractions significantly richer in ethanol content than simple
      thermal distillation. These phenomena can also enable important
      compact solar applications such as sterilization of waste and
      surgical instruments in resource-poor locations.<br>

      When an Au nanoparticle in a liquid medium is illuminated with
      resonant light of sufficient intensity, a nanometer scale envelope
      of vapor—a “nanobubble”—surrounding the particle, is formed. This
      is the nanoscale onset of the well-known process of liquid
      boiling, occurring at a single nanoparticle nucleation site,
      resulting from the photothermal response of the nanoparticle. Here
      we examine bubble formation at an individual metallic nanoparticle
      in detail. Incipient nanobubble formation is observed by
      monitoring the plasmon resonance shift of an individual,
      illuminated Au nanoparticle, when its local environment changes
      from liquid to vapor. The temperature on the nanoparticle surface
      is monitored during this process, where a dramatic temperature
      jump is observed as the nanoscale vapor layer thermally decouples
      the nanoparticle from the surrounding liquid. By increasing the
      intensity of the incident light or decreasing the interparticle
      separation, we observe the formation of micrometer-sized bubbles
      resulting from the coalescence of nanoparticle-“bound” vapor
      envelopes. These studies provide the first direct and quantitative
      analysis of the evolution of light-induced steam generation by
      nanoparticles from the nanoscale to the macroscale, a process that
      is of fundamental interest for a growing number of applications.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The lack of readily available sterilization processes for medicine
      and dentistry practices in the developing world is a major risk
      factor for the propagation of disease. Modern medical facilities
      in the developed world often use autoclave systems to sterilize
      medical instruments and equipment and process waste that could
      contain harmful contagions. Here, we show the use of broadband
      light-absorbing nanoparticles as solar photothermal heaters, which
      generate high-temperature steam for a standalone, efficient solar
      autoclave useful for sanitation of instruments or materials in
      resource-limited, remote locations. Sterilization was verified
      using a standard Geobacillus stearothermophilus-based biological
      indicator.<br>
      <br>
      According to the World Health Organization, healthcare-associated
      infections are the most prevalent adverse consequence of medical
      treatment worldwide (1⇓–3). Although this problem is disconcerting
      and costly in developed countries, its impact in developing
      regions is devastating (4). More than one-quarter of the human
      population worldwide lacks access to electricity, let alone the
      high power requirements necessary for modern sterilization
      systems. Because more than one-half of all people in developing
      regions lack access to all-weather roads, the channeling of a
      consistent supply of disposable sterilizing resources into these
      areas presents an even more daunting challenge (5). Consequently,
      addressing the problem of resource-constrained sterilization can
      be viewed as an effort to provide solutions to both power and
      supply chain constraints.<br>
      <br>
      The underlying cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial)
      infections is prolonged or focused exposure to unsanitary
      conditions. Such conditions can be ameliorated through the use of
      sanitation and sterilization methods. Sterilization involves the
      destruction of all microorganisms and their spores, whereas
      disinfection is a less robust process that involves the removal of
      microorganisms without complete sterilization (6). One of the
      simplest, most effective, and most reliable approaches for the
      sterilization of medical devices and materials is the use of an
      autoclave. The fundamental concept of an autoclave is to expose
      the media to be sterilized to saturated steam at an elevated
      temperature. On coming into contact with the medium to be
      sterilized, the saturated steam condenses from the gas phase to
      the liquid phase, transferring its latent heat of vaporization to
      the material to be sterilized and thus, any associated microbes on
      its surface. Such a rapid transfer of heat is extremely effective
      for denaturing proteins and may be used to destroy most known
      types of infectious agents, including bacteria, viruses, or viral
      spores.<br>
      <br>
      Steam-based autoclave systems neutralize potentially infectious
      microorganisms localized on solid surfaces or in liquid-phase
      media by exposing them to high-temperature pressurized steam. The
      process of steam sterilization relies on both steam temperature
      and time duration of steam exposure to ensure irreversible
      destruction of all microorganisms, especially bacterial
      endospores, which are considered particularly thermally stable.
      Although steam-based sterilization is the primary method of choice
      for the processing of medical waste in the developed world, the
      large energy requirement for operation is the fundamental
      limitation for its adoption in developing countries, with limited
      or nonexistent access to sources of electricity sufficient to
      power such systems.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, we reported the use of broadband light-absorbing
      particles for solar steam generation (7). A variety of
      nanoparticles such as metallic nanoshells, nanoshell aggregates,
      and conductive carbon nanoparticles, when dispersed in aqueous
      solution and illuminated by sunlight, has been shown to convert
      absorbed solar energy to steam at an efficiency of just over 80%,
      where less than 20% of the energy contributes to heating the
      liquid volume (7). This effect depends on the highly localized,
      strong photothermal response of these types of nanoparticles, a
      characteristic that is being used to effectively ablate solid
      tumors by irradiation with near-IR laser light with near-unity
      tumor remission rates (8⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–16). In the solar steam generation
      process, broadband light-absorbing nanoparticles create a large
      number of nucleation sites for steam generation within the fluid.
      As light is absorbed by a nanoparticle, a temperature difference
      between the nanoparticle and the surrounding fluid is established
      because of a reduced thermal conductivity at the metal–liquid
      interface: this local temperature increase may become sufficient
      to transform the liquid in the direct vicinity of the nanoparticle
      into vapor. On sustained illumination, the vapor envelope
      surrounding the nanoparticle grows, eventually resulting in
      buoyancy of the nanoparticle–bubble complex. When this complex
      reaches the surface of the liquid, the vapor is released,
      resulting in vigorous nonequilibrium steam generation that does
      not require the bulk fluid temperature to have reached its boiling
      point. If the fluid is kept in an ice bath, steam is produced,
      even when the fluid temperature remains at 0 °C (7). Over
      prolonged exposure to sunlight, however, both the more-efficient
      process of nanoparticle-based steam generation and the
      less-efficient process of bulk fluid heating occur, eventually
      resulting in simultaneous nanoparticle-based steam generation and
      boiling of the bulk fluid. The combination of these two processes
      results in solar steam production that occurs at higher steam
      temperatures than can be achieved using nonparticle-based fluid
      heating (Fig. 1). The nanoparticles are neither dispersed into the
      vapor phase nor degraded by the steam generation process.<br>

      </i><br>
      The temperature–time evolution of the nanoparticle-dispersed fluid
      and steam produced during solar irradiation is shown in Fig. 1A
      with and without the presence of nanoparticles. A detailed
      characterization of the nanoparticles is shown in Fig. S1. With
      nanoparticle dispersants, temperatures of both the liquid and the
      steam increase far more rapidly than the temperature of pure water
      (Fig. 1A, i and ii), with the liquid water reaching 100 °C more
      rapidly with nanoparticle dispersants than water without
      nanoparticles. Measurable steam production occurs at a lower water
      temperature for the case with nanoparticle dispersants, because
      nanoparticle-dispersed steam generation can occur at any fluid
      temperature. For the case shown here, measurable steam production
      appears at a water temperature of ∼70 °C, well below the steam
      production threshold for pure water. Perhaps most importantly,
      however, is the large difference in steady-state temperature
      achieved for the two systems: with the inclusion of nanoparticle
      dispersants, the temperature of both the water and the vapor
      increase well above the standard boiling point of water. In this
      case, an equilibrium temperature of 140 °C is easily achieved in
      the nanoparticle-dispersed water–steam system. This elevated
      temperature enables the use of nanoparticle-generated solar steam
      for medical sterilization applications.<br>
      <br>
      The evolution of solar steam generation from Au nanoshells
      dispersed in water was quantified in an open-loop system (Fig. 1B)
      consisting of a 200-mL vessel isolated with a vacuum jacket to
      prevent heat loss, a pressure sensor, and two thermocouples to
      monitor both the liquid and vapor temperatures. The vessel was
      illuminated with solar radiation focused by a 0.69-m2 Fresnel lens
      into the glass vessel containing 100 mL nanoparticles at a
      concentration of 1010 particles/m3 or alternatively, water with no
      nanoparticles as a control. On solar illumination, vapor was
      allowed to escape through a 16-µm-diameter nozzle, while the
      pressure and temperature were recorded.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we show two different compact solar autoclaves driven by
      nanoparticle-based solar steam generation that are well-suited to
      off-grid applications. Using a solar concentrator (Fresnel lens or
      dish mirror) to deliver sunlight into the nanoparticle-dispersed
      aqueous working fluid, this process is capable of delivering steam
      at a temperature of 115–135 °C into a 14.2-L volume for a time
      period sufficient for sterilization. Sterilization was verified
      using a standard Geobacillus stearothermophilus-based biological
      indicator.<br>

      <b>Experimental Section</b><br>
      <br>
      Two solar sterilization designs have been developed. One is a
      portable, closed-loop solar autoclave system suitable for
      sterilization of medical or dental tools; the second design is a
      solar dish collector autoclave system that can serve as a
      standalone, off-grid steam source suitable for human or animal
      waste sterilization systems or other applications. Steam from the
      closed-loop system (Fig. 2A) is produced under solar illumination,
      transported into the sterilization volume, condensed, and then
      delivered back into the fluid vessel. The design consists of three
      main subsystems: the steam generation module (Fig. 2A, I), the
      connection module (Fig. 2A, II), and the sterilization module
      (Fig. 2A, III). More detailed schematics of the system are
      presented in Figs. S1, S2, and S3.<br>

        thermocouple sensors, a steam relief valve, and two hand pumps
        and valves that control the input and output of waste. The solar
        concentrator dish system has a dual tracking system powered by a
        small car battery recharged by a solar cell unit.</i><br>
      <br>
      The particle solution is contained in a custom-built insulated
      glass vessel with two inlets that lead to the connection module.
      Solar collection is accomplished with a relatively small and
      inexpensive Fresnel lens. The hot solar steam generated within
      this module is channeled out one nozzle of the connection module
      into the sterilization module, where it condenses on the objects
      to be sterilized, returning as condensate to the steam generation
      module. A check valve at one port of the steam generation module
      ensures a unidirectional flow of steam throughout the entire
      system.<br>
      <br>
      The sterilization module consists of an insulated pressure vessel
      (a converted stovetop autoclave with a 14.2-L capacity). A
      condensate return hole (diameter of 0.86 cm) was milled on the
      bottom face of the autoclave vessel 10 cm away from the center.
      Similarly, a steam inlet hole (diameter of 0.86 cm) was milled on
      the lid of the sterilizing vessel 10 cm away from the center. A
      finite element analysis (SolidWorks using the Tresca maximum) was
      performed to identify the mechanically weakest portions of the
      pressure vessel when placed under high-stress conditions (Fig.
      S3). By varying the radial position of the hole in the base of the
      pressure vessel, a minimum factor of safety (vessel material
      strength/design load) under many different machining
      configurations was determined. A 0.86-cm-diameter hole positioned
      10 cm from the center of the pressure vessel was determined to be
      the optimal location, with a minimum factor of safety of 3.35. To
      minimize heat losses from the steam generation module and the
      sterilization module, the system was insulated with a sealant
      (Great Stuff Fireblock Insulating Foam Sealant) applied to the
      surfaces of the vessels and covered with aluminum foil to further
      minimize heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      The connection module consists of two parts: the steam connection,
      which allows steam to flow from the steam generation module to the
      sterilization module, and the condensate connection, which returns
      the condensate from the sterilization module (Fig. S3). The steam
      connection consists of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing
      insulated in fiberglass pipe wrap and a ball valve; the condensate
      connection consists of a ball valve, PTFE tubing insulated in
      fiberglass pipe wrap, a check valve, and a pressure release valve.
      Both units contain an adaptor to connect to the steam generation
      module.<br>
      <br>
      The solar-generated steam enters the sterilization module at the
      top of the vessel, forcing the unsterile air down and out of the
      vessel through the air exhaust tube, which is connected to the
      control valve. Trapped unsterile air can have an insulating effect
      and prevent complete sterilization; therefore, it is critical that
      as much air as possible be removed from the sterilization module.
      After the unsterile air is purged from the system, the control
      valve is closed to allow pressure to build up in the vessel. The
      cycle is maintained at a minimum of 115 °C and 12 psig and a
      maximum of 140 °C and 20 psig in all regions of the sterilization
      module throughout the duration of a sterilization cycle. The
      condensate is channeled back to the steam generation module by a
      check valve when the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the maximum
      pressure of the valve (rated at 0.3 psi).<br>
      <br>
      An optimized, open-loop, prototypical compact solar autoclave for
      human waste sterilization is presented in Fig. 2B. Using a 44-in
      solar dish collector to focus sunlight into the
      nanoparticle-dispersed aqueous working fluid, we deliver steam
      into a 14.2-L capacity sterilization volume (a commercially
      available stovetop autoclave). This volume could easily
      accommodate the 10-L capacity volume of a mobile sanitation
      (moSAN) toilet, for example (a personal-use toilet designed for
      Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH and
      originally developed for the urban poor in Bangladesh), and if
      operated three times per week, it could process the weekly amount
      of both solid and liquid waste produced by a household of four
      adults (∼35 L). Solar energy is supplied to this unit through a
      reflective parabolic dish that tracks the sun, is powered by a
      small car battery, and is rechargeable with a small solar panel.
      The generated steam is transmitted to the autoclave through
      silicon tubing. Unprocessed waste is delivered to the autoclave by
      means of a mechanical hand pump, which can be easily operated by a
      single person. After the sterilization process, the sanitized
      waste is removed by gravity. Because of its simple, modular
      design, the system can easily be expanded to provide
      high-temperature steam for larger-scale applications.<br>
      <br>
      The nanoparticle solution is contained in a custom-designed
      vacuum-insulated vessel positioned at the focus of the parabolic
      reflector. The steam generated within this module is channeled
      into the waste sterilization module. Under typical operation, the
      steam temperature is maintained at 132 °C for 5 min, the duration
      of time required for an International Organization for
      Standardization (ISO) standard sterilization cycle. The steam
      temperature was monitored at the output of the steam generation
      module, and the waste solution temperature was monitored inside
      the sterilization module. These two locations are expected to
      reach the sterilization temperature with slight thermal (gas and
      liquid phases) differences inside the sterilization module during
      the sterilization process.<br>
      <br>
      The steam temperature was monitored in both geometries at the
      steam connection and the condensate connection directly adjacent
      to the sterilization module. These two locations are expected to
      have the highest and lowest steam temperatures, respectively,
      allowing us to measure the overall temperature gradient generated
      inside the sterilization module during the sterilization process.
      The steam temperature before and during a sterilization cycle is
      shown in <br>

      <i>The autoclave temperature distribution of the (A) closed-loop
        and (B) open-loop solar autoclaves. The temperature of steam vs.
        time measured in two different locations in autoclave: top (red
        curve) and respective bottom (blue curve). The dashed line
        indicates temperature required for sterilization, and the red
        box indicates the sterilization regime (115 °C for 20 min or 132
        °C for 4.6 min). The ambient temperature (green) was monitored
        as reference.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The red curve in Fig. 3 is the temperature of the steam at the
      inlet valve to the sterilization vessel, the blue curve in Fig. 3
      is the temperature of the condensate at the sterilization vessel
      output, and the ambient temperature in Fig. 3 is the green curve.
      The dashed gray line in Fig. 3 represents the temperature required
      for sterilization (115–132 °C). In the case of the closed-loop
      system (Fig. 3A), the irregular spikes in the temperature curves
      correspond to when the steam begins to enter the vessel. The
      bottom thermocouple shows two major spikes during warm-up that are
      generated by the release of unsterilized air from the
      sterilization module. The first spike induced turbulence into the
      system, which exposed the thermocouple briefly to hotter steam.
      The second jump in the temperature data of the output thermocouple
      corresponds to the release of the remaining unsterilized insulated
      air. The monitoring data clearly show that the autoclave is easily
      capable of maintaining a temperature over 115 °C for more than 30
      min of the sterilization time required at that temperature. In the
      case of the open-loop system (Fig. 3B), the red curve is the gas
      temperature of the steam measured at the vessel inlet valve, the
      blue curve is the temperature inside the vessel contents
      (artificial fecal material), and the ambient temperature is the
      green curve. The dashed gray line represents the desired
      temperature required for sterilization (132 °C). After an initial
      ramp-up period of ∼20 min, the sterilization temperature is
      reached, and the temperature–time curve continues to oscillate
      around this value because of the frequent release of steam from
      the sterilization vessel through the pressure safety valve. The
      solar thermal evolution data show that the autoclave is capable of
      maintaining a temperature around 132 °C for more than 5 min.<br>
      <br>
      To test whether our systems can achieve the Sterility Assurance
      Level defined by the Food and Drug Administration (17), we
      operated the system through a cycle with the sterilization vessel
      containing commercial biological indicator strips for G.
      stearothermophilus (EZTest Self-Contained Biological Indicator
      Strips; SGM Biotech), a reference strain commonly used for
      sterilization testing. The test strips were secured in the
      sterilization module near the inlet stream and outlet stream taps
      or immersed in a fecal simulator solution. After completion of the
      cycle, the strips were incubated for 36 h at 55–60 °C. The results
      are shown in Fig. 4.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 4.</b><br>

      <i>Biological indicators used to test solar autoclave
        sterilization. Test vials of G. stearothermophilus placed in
        various locations in the sterilization module: (A) the
        top/bottom of vessels were sealed for solid material and
        unprocessed control and (B) placed in fecal stimulant sealed for
        liquid–solid material and unprocessed control. They were used to
        test solar autoclave sterilization. The sterilization is
        confirmed by color change of vial contents.</i><br>
      <br>
      The color change shown by the vials in Fig. 4, relative to the
      control vial, indicates that sterilization is achieved by
      operating the solar autoclave through one 30-min cycle at 115 °C
      for the closed-loop system and one 5-min cycle at 132 °C for the
      open-loop system. If some spores survive a sterilization cycle,
      the biological indicator culture medium undergoes a color change
      from purple to yellow. The observed color change indicates that
      spore survival did not occur.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, we have shown two compact solar autoclaves enabled
      by solar steam generation using broadband, light-absorbing
      nanoparticles. The systems maintain temperatures between 115 °C
      and 132 °C for the time period sufficient to sterilize the
      contents of a 14.2-L volume, which is in accordance with Food and
      Drug Administration sterilization requirements. Using a parabolic
      dish solar collector enables a faster heat-up time and higher
      operating temperatures, which shorten the sterilization cycle time
      significantly (from 15 min at 121 °C to 5 min at 132 °C). The
      nanoparticles are not consumed by the heating process and can be
      reused indefinitely; the only consumable is water, which need not
      be sterilized before use. This type of system can easily be
      expanded to provide direct steam generation for additional
      applications, which may include distillation-based water
      purification, cooking, waste remediation, or electricity
      generation.<br>

      A method of producing bioethanol that includes receiving a
      feedstock solution that includes polysaccharides in a vessel
      comprising a complex is described. The complex may be copper
      nanoparticles, copper oxide nanoparticles, nanoshells, nanorods,
      carbon moieties, encapsulated nanoshells, encapsulated
      nanoparticles, and/or branched nanostructures. The method also
      includes applying electromagnetic (EM) radiation to the complex
      such that the complex absorbs the EM radiation to generate heat.
      Using the heat generated by the complex, sugar molecules may be
      extracted from the polysaccharides in the feedstock solution, and
      fermented. Then, bioethanol may be extracted from the vessel.<br>

      61/775,751, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The production of bioethanol from cellulosic feedstock,
      such as switchgrass, may require that the feedstock be processed
      such that the fermentable carbohydrates and sugars are released
      from the initial material. This is an intensive processing step
      that currently requires the input of energy in the form of heat,
      the use of caustic chemicals to break down plant cell walls, or
      the use of enzymes for that purpose, all of which add cost to the
      final product, currently rendering it noncompetitive with respect
      to fossil-derived fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a
      method of producing bioethanol that includes receiving a feedstock
      solution that includes polysaccharides in a vessel comprising a
      complex. The complex may be copper nanoparticles, copper oxide
      nanoparticles, nanoshells, nanorods, carbon moieties, encapsulated

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described
      in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like
      elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference
      numerals for consistency.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In the following detailed description of embodiments of the
      invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to
      provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However,
      it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the
      invention may be practiced without these specific details. In
      other instances, well-known features have not been described in
      detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In general, embodiments of the invention relate to the
      production of bioethanol using a steam generation process, where
      the steam is generated using nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The solar steam production using nanonparticles as
      described, for example, in U.S. Application No. 13/326,482, U.S.
      Patent Application No. 13/514,762, and PCT Application No.
      US2011/062497, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by
      reference in their entirety, along with multiple applications
      thereof, may be used to process cellulosic feedstock either as
      steam or as a high pressure, high temperature liquid. In one or
      more embodiments of the invention, the application of solar steam
      may reduce the energy cost for processing the cellulosic
      feedstock. Moreover, the processing method for extraction of
      fermentable biomass may be also take advantage of this essentially
      free source of high temperature/high pressure steam using our
      earlier disclosed methods. The solar steam source may be adapted
      to provide both elevated temperatures and pressures as needed for
      a liquid water batch extractor. [0029] In accordance with one or
      more embodiments of the invention, a second important processing
      step for biofuels, most specifically bioethanol, is distillation
      of the fermented extract to produce ethanol of the appropriate H2O
      concentration, for a particular application, such as for use in
      vehicles. In one or more embodiments of the invention,
      nanoparticle-enabled solar steam generation may be performed on
      mixtures of liquids for distillation purposes. In these
      embodiments, the method may produce a richer ethanol distillate
      than normal thermal heating methods, which may simplify and
      streamline the final distillation step in bioethanol production.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In accordance with embodiments of the invention, bioethanol
      production from lignocellulosic biomass such as hay or straw may
      be used to generate fuel. Alfalfa and Coastal Bermudagrass are
      known non-food feeds. A pretreatment of the feedstock prior to
      fermentation is crucial in order to achieve a high ethanol yield.
      The cell walls of grass contain cellulose and hemicellulose. These
      polysaccharides need to be degraded into smaller units which are
      accessible to yeast to perform fermentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one or more embodiments of the invention,
      nanoparticle-generated solar steam may be used for the hot water
      pretreatment of feedstock. If the solar steam is kept in a closed
      system, high temperature and a significant pressure builds up. The
      conditions that embodiments of the invention may reach are
      sufficient for the pretreatment process. A slurry of the feedstock
      in water is kept in a pretreatment module where the steam streams
      into so the temperature and pressure rises to a regime where the
      polysaccharides degrade into smaller units. This improves the
      fermentability of the raw material and will lead to higher ethanol
      yield.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Embodiments of the invention use complexes (e.g.,
      nanoshells) that have absorbed EM radiation to produce the energy
      used to generate the heated fluid. The invention may provide for a
      complex mixed in a liquid solution, used to coat a wall of a
      vessel, integrated with a material of which a vessel is made,
      and/or otherwise suitably integrated with a vessel used to apply
      EM radiation to the complex. All the piping and associated
      fittings, pumps, valves, gauges, and other equipment described,
      used, or contemplated herein, either actually or as one of
      ordinary skill in the art would conceive, are made of materials
      resistant to the heat and/or fluid and/or vapor transported,
      transformed, pressurized, created, or otherwise handled within
      those materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] A source of EM radiation may be any source capable of
      emitting energy at one or more wavelengths. For example, EM
      radiation may be any source that emits radiation in the
      ultraviolet, visible, and infrared regions of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. A source of EM radiation may be manmade or occur
      naturally. Examples of a source of EM radiation may include, but
      are not limited to, the sun, waste heat from an industrial
      process, and a light bulb. One or more concentrators may be used
      to intensify and/or concentrate the energy emitted by a source of
      EM radiation. Examples of a concentrator include, but are not
      limited to, lens(es), a parabolic trough(s), mirror(s), black
      paint, or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Embodiments of this invention may be used in any
      residential, commercial, and/or industrial application where
      heating of a fluid may be needed. Examples of such applications
      include, but are not limited to, alcohol production (e.g.,
      ethanol, methanol) as for a biofuels plant, chemical treatment,
      chemicals and allied products, (e.g., rubber, plastics, textile
      production), laboratories, perfumeries, air products (e.g., argon,
      hydrogen, oxygen), drug manufacturing, and alcoholic beverages.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In one or more embodiments, the complex may include one or
      more nanoparticle structures including, but not limited to,
      nanoshells, coated nanoshells, metal colloids, nanorods, branched
      or coral structures, and/or carbon moieties. In one or more
      embodiments, the complex may include a mixture of nanoparticle
      structures to absorb EM radiation. Specifically, the complex may
      be designed to maximize the absorption of the electromagnetic
      radiation emitted from the sun. Further, each complex may absorb
      EM radiation over a specific range of wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In one or more embodiments, the complex may include metal
      nanoshells. A nanoshell is a substantially spherical dielectric
      core surrounded by a thin metallic shell. The plasmon resonance of
      a nanoshell may be determined by the size of the core relative to
      the thickness of the metallic shell. Nanoshells may be fabricated
      according to U.S. Patent 6,685,986, hereby incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. The relative size of the dielectric
      core and metallic shell, as well as the optical properties of the
      core, shell, and medium, determines the plasmon resonance of a
      nanoshell. Accordingly, the overall size of the nanoshell is
      dependent on the absorption wavelength desired. Metal nanoshells
      may be designed to absorb or scatter light throughout the visible
      and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example,
      a plasmon resonance in the near infrared region of the spectrum
      (700nm-900 nm) may have a substantially spherical silica core
      having a diameter between 90nm-175 nm and a gold metallic layer
      between 4 nm-35nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] A complex may also include other core-shell structures, for
      example, a metallic core with one or more dielectric and/or
      metallic layers using the same or different metals. For example, a
      complex may include a gold or silver nanoparticle, spherical or
      rod-like, coated with a dielectric layer and further coated with
      another gold or silver layer. A complex may also include other
      core-shell structures, for example hollow metallic shell
      nanoparticles and/or multi-layer shells.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In one or more embodiments, a complex may include a
      nanoshell encapsulated with a dielectric or rare earth element
      oxide. For example, gold nanoshells may be coated with an
      additional shell layer made from silica, titanium or europium
      oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In one embodiment of the invention, the complexes may be
      aggregated or otherwise combined to create aggregates. In such
      cases, the resulting aggregates may include complexes of the same
      type or complexes of different types.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In one embodiment of the invention, complexes of different
      types may be combined as aggregates, in solution, or embedded on
      substrate. By combining various types of complexes, a broad range
      of the EM spectrum may be absorbed.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 1 is a schematic of a nanoshell coated with an
      additional rare earth element oxide in accordance with one or more
      embodiments of the invention. Typically, a gold nanoshell has a
      silica core 102 surrounded by a thin gold layer 104. As stated
      previously, the size of the gold layer is relative to the size of
      the core and determines the plasmon resonance of the particle.
      According to one or more embodiments of the invention, a nanoshell
      may then be coated with a dielectric or rare earth layer 106. The
      additional layer 106 may serve to preserve the resultant plasmon
      resonance and protect the particle from any temperature effects,
      for example, melting of the gold layer 104.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 2 is a flow chart of a method of manufacturing the
      coated nanoshells in accordance with one or more embodiments of
      the invention. In ST 200, nanoshells are manufactured according to
      known techniques. In the example of europium oxide, in ST 202, 20
      mL of a nanoshell solution may be mixed with 10 mL of 2.5M
      (NH2)2CO and 20 mL of 0.1M of Eu(N03)3xH20 solutions in a glass
      container. In ST 204, the mixture may be heated to boiling for 3-5
      minutes under vigorous stirring. The time the mixture is heated
      may determine the thickness of the additional layer, and may also
      determine the number of nanoparticle aggregates in solution. The
      formation of nanostructure aggregates is known to create
      additional plasmon resonances at wavelengths higher than the
      individual nanostructure that may contribute to the energy
      absorbed by the nanostructure for heat generation. In ST 206, the
      reaction may then be stopped by immersing the glass container in
      an ice bath. In ST 208, the solution may then be cleaned by
      centrifugation, and then redispersed into the desired solvent. The
      additional layer may contribute to the solubility of the
      nanoparticles in different solvents. Solvents that may be used in
      one or more embodiments of the invention include, but are not
      limited to, water, ammonia, ethylene glycol, and glycerin.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In addition to europium, other examples of element oxides
      that may be used in the above recipe include, but are not limited
      to, erbium, samarium, praseodymium, and dysprosium. The additional
      layer is not limited to rare earth oxides. Any coating of the
      particle that may result in a higher melting point, better
      solubility in a particular solvent, better deposition onto a
      particular substrate, and/or control over the number of aggregates
      or plasmon resonance of the particle may be used. Examples of the
      other coatings that may be used, but are not limited to silica,
      titanium dioxide, polymer-based coatings, additional layers formed
      by metals or metal alloys, and/or combinations of materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 3 is an absorbance spectrum of three nanoparticle
      structures that may be included in a complex in accordance with
      one or more embodiments disclosed herein. In FIG. 3, a gold
      nanoshell spectrum 308 may be engineered by selecting the core and
      shell dimensions to obtain a plasmon resonance peak at -800 nm.
      FIG. 3 also includes a Eu2O3-encapsulated gold nanoshell spectrum
      310, where the Eu2O3-encapsulated gold nanoshell is manufactured
      using the same nanoshells from the nanoshell spectrum 308. As may
      be seen in FIG 3, there may be some particle aggregation in the
      addition of the europium oxide layer. However, the degree of
      particle aggregation may be controlled by varying the reaction
      time described above. FIG. 3 also includes a -100 nm diameter
      spherical gold colloid spectrum 312 that may be used to absorb
      electromagnetic radiation in a different region of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. In the specific examples of FIG. 3, the
      Eu2O3-encapsulated gold nanoshells may be mixed with the gold
      colloids to construct a complex that absorbs any EM radiation from
      500 nm to greater than 1200 nm. The concentrations of the
      different nanoparticle structures may be manipulated to achieve
      the desired absorption of the complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and/or energy
      dispersive x- ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements may be used to
      investigate the chemical composition and purity of the
      nanoparticle structures in the complex. For example, FIG. 4 A
      shows an XPS spectrum in accordance with one or more embodiments
      of the invention. XPS measurements were acquired with a PHI
      Quantera X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. FIG. 4A shows the XPS
      spectra in different spectral regions corresponding to the
      elements of the nanoshell encapsulated with europium oxide. FIG.
      4A shows the XPS spectra display the binding energies for Eu (3d
      5/2) at 1130 eV 414, Eu (2d 3/2) at 1160eV 416, Au (4f 7/2) at
      83.6 eV 418, and Au (4f 5/2) at 87.3 eV 420 of nanoshells
      encapsulated with europium oxide. For comparison, FIG. 4B shows an
      XPS spectrum of europium oxide colloids that may be manufactured
      according to methods known in the art. FIG. 4B shows the XPS
      spectra display the binding energies for Eu (3d 5/2) at 1130 eV
      422 and Eu (2d 3/2) at 1160eV 424 of europium oxide colloids.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the complex
      may include solid metallic nanoparticles encapsulated with an
      additional layer as described above. For example, using the
      methods described above, solid metallic nanoparticles may be
      encapsulated using silica, titanium, europium, erbium, samarium,
      praseodymium, and dysprosium. Examples of solid metallic
      nanoparticles include, but are not limited to, spherical gold,
      silver, copper, or nickel nanoparticles or solid metallic
      nanorods. The specific metal may be chosen based on the plasmon
      resonance, or absorption, of the nanoparticle when encapsulated.
      The encapsulating elements may be chosen based on chemical
      compatibility, the encapsulating elements ability to increase the
      melting point of the encapsulated nanoparticle structure, and the
      collective plasmon resonance, or absorption, of a solution of the
      encapsulated nanostructure, or the plasmon resonance of the
      collection of encapsulated nanostructures when deposited on a
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In one or more embodiments, the complex may also include
      copper colloids. Copper colloids may be synthesized using a
      solution-phase chemical reduction method. For example, 50 mL of
      0.4 M aqueous solution of L- ascorbic acid, 0.8M of Polyvinyl
      pyridine (PVP), and 0.01M of copper (II) nitride may be mixed and
      heated to 70 degree Celsius until the solution color changes from
      a blue-green color to a red color. The color change indicates the
      formation of copper nanoparticles. FIG. 5 is an experimental and
      theoretical spectrum in accordance with one or more embodiments of
      the invention. FIG. 5 includes an experimental absorption spectrum
      526 of copper colloids in accordance with one or more embodiments
      of the invention. Therefore, copper colloids may be used to absorb
      electromagnetic radiation in the 550 nm to 900 nm range.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 5 also includes a theoretical absorption spectrum 528
      calculated using Mie scattering theory. In one or more
      embodiments, Mie scattering theory may be used to theoretically
      determine the absorbance of one or more nanoparticle structures to
      calculate and predict the overall absorbance of the complex. Thus,
      the complex may be designed to maximize the absorbance of solar
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Referring to FIG. 6, an EDS spectrum of copper colloids in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention is shown.
      The EDS spectrum of the copper colloids confirms the existence of
      copper atoms by the appearance peaks 630. During the EDS
      measurements, the particles are deposited on a silicon substrate,
      as evidenced by the presence of the silicon peak 632.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In one or more embodiments, the complex may include copper
      oxide nanoparticles. <b>Copper oxide nanostructures may be
        synthesized by 20 mL aqueous solution of 62.5mM Cu(NO3)2being
        directly mixed with 12 mL NH4OH under stirring. The mixture may
        be stirred vigorously at approximately 80°C for 3 hours, then
        the temperature is reduced to 40°C and the solution is stirred
        overnight. The solution color turns from blue to black color
        indicating the formation of the copper oxide nanostructure. The
        copper oxide nanostructures may then be washed and re-suspended
        in water via centrifugation. </b>FIG. 7 shows the absorption of
      copper oxide nanoparticles in accordance with one or more
      embodiments of the invention. The absorption of the copper oxide
      nanoparticles 734 may be used to absorb electromagnetic radiation
      in the region from -900 nm to beyond 1200 nm. In one or more
      embodiments of the invention, the complex may include branched
      nanostructures. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
      that embodiments of the invention are not limited to strict gold
      branched structures. For example, silver, nickel, copper, or
      platinum branched structures may also be used. FIG. 8 is a flow
      chart of the method of manufacturing gold branched structures in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. In ST
      800, an aqueous solution of 1% HAuCl4may be aged for two-three
      weeks. In ST 802, a polyvinyl pyridine (PVP) solution may be
      prepared by dissolving 0.25 g in approximately 20 mL ethanol
      solution and rescaled with water to a final volume of 50mL. In ST
      804, 50 mL of the 1% HAuCl4and 50 mL of the PVP solution may be
      directly mixed with 50 mL aqueous solution of 0.4M L-ascorbic acid
      under stirring. The solution color may turn immediately in dark
      blue-black color which indicates the formation of a gold
      nanoflower or nano-coral. Then, in ST 806, the Au nanostructures
      may then be washed and resuspended in water via centrifugation. In
      other words, the gold branched nanostructures may be synthesized
      through L-ascorbic acid reduction of aqueous chloroaurate ions at
      room temperature with addition of PVP as the capping agent. The
      capping polymer PVP may stabilize the gold branched nanostructures
      by preventing them from aggregating. In addition, the gold
      branched nanostructures may form a porous polymer-type matrix.
      [0052] FIG. 9 shows the absorption of a solution of gold branched
      nanostructures in accordance with one or more embodiments of the
      invention. As can be seen in FIG. 9, the absorption spectrum 936
      of the gold branched nanostructures is almost flat for a large
      spectral range, which may lead to considerably high photon
      absorption. The breadth of the spectrum 936 of the gold branched
      nanostructures may be due to the structural diversity of the gold
      branched nanostructures or, in other works, the collective effects
      of which may come as an average of individual branches of the gold
      branched/corals nanostructure.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] FIG. 10 shows the EDS measurements of the gold branched
      nanostructures in accordance with one or more embodiments of the
      invention. The EDS measurements may be performed to investigate
      the chemical composition and purity of the gold branched
      nanostructures. In addition, the peaks 1038 in the EDS
      measurements of gold branched nanostructures confirm the presence
      of Au atoms in the gold branched nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 11 shows a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area
      and pore size distribution analysis of branches in accordance with
      one or more embodiments of the invention. The BET surface area and
      pore size may be performed to characterize the branched
      nanostructures. FIG. 11A presents the nitrogen
      adsorption-desorption isotherms of a gold corral sample calcinated
      at 150 C for 8 hours. The isotherms may exhibit a type IV isotherm
      with a N2hysteresis loops in desorption branch as shown. As shown
      in FIG. 11 A, the isotherms may be relatively flat in the
      low-pressure region (P/P0&lt; 0.7). Also, the adsorption and
      desorption isotherms may be completely superposed, a fact which
      may demonstrate that the adsorption of the samples mostly likely
      occurs in the pores. At the relative high pressure region, the
      isotherms may form a loop due to the capillarity agglomeration
      phenomena. FIG. 11B presents a bimodal pore size distribution,
      showing the first peak 1140 at the pore diameter of 2.9 nm and the
      second peak 1142 at 6.5 nm. FIG. 11C shows the BET plots of gold
      branched nanostructures in accordance with one or more embodiments
      of the invention. A value of 10.84 m /g was calculated for the
      specific surface area of branches in this example by using a
      multipoint BET-equation.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the gold
      branched nanostructures dispersed in water may increase the
      nucleation sites for boiling, absorb electromagnetic energy,
      decrease the bubble lifetime due to high surface temperature and
      high porosity, and increase the interfacial turbulence by the
      water gradient temperature and the Brownian motion of the
      particles. The efficiency of a gold branched complex solution may
      be high because it may allow the entire fluid to be involved in
      the boiling process.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] As demonstrated in the above figures and text, in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention, the
      complex may include a number of different specific nanostructures
      chosen to maximize the absorption of the complex in a desired
      region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition, the complex
      may be suspended in different solvents, for example water or
      ethylene glycol. Also, the complex may be deposited onto a surface
      according to known techniques. For example, a molecular or polymer
      linker may be used to fix the complex to a surface, while allowing
      a solvent to be heated when exposed to the complex. The complex
      may also be embedded in a matrix or porous material. For example,
      the complex may be embedded in a polymer or porous matrix material
      formed to be inserted into a particular embodiment as described
      below. For example, the complex could be formed into a removable
      cartridge. As another example, a porous medium (e.g., fiberglass)
      may be embedded with the complex and placed in the interior of a
      vessel containing a fluid to be heated. The complex may also be
      formed into shapes in one or more embodiments described below in
      order to maximize the surface of the complex and, thus, maximize
      the absorption of EM radiation. In addition, the complex may be
      embedded in a packed column or coated onto rods inserted into one
      or more embodiments described below. [0057] FIGS. 12A-12C show
      charts of the mass loss and temperature increase of different
      nanostructures that may be used in a complex in accordance with
      one or more embodiments of the invention. The results shown in
      FIGS. 12A- 12C were performed to monitor the mass loss of an
      aqueous nanostructure solution for 10 minutes under sunlight (FIG.
      12B) versus non-pulsed diode laser illumination at 808 nm (FIG.
      12A). In FIG. 12A, the mass loss versus time of the laser
      illumination at 808 nm is shown for Eu203-coated nanoshells 1244,
      non-coated gold nanoshells 1246, and gold nanoparticles with a
      diameter of -100 nm 1248. Under laser exposure, as may be expected
      from the absorbance shown in FIG. 3, at 808 nm illumination, the
      coated and non-coated nanoshells exhibit a mass loss due to the
      absorbance of the incident electromagnetic radiation at 808 nm. In
      addition, as the absorbance is lower at 808 nm, the 100 nm
      diameter gold colloid exhibits little mass loss at 808 nm
      illumination. In Figure 12 A, the Au nanoparticles demonstrated a
      lower loss rate that was nearly the same as water because the
      laser wavelength was detuned from plasmon resonance frequency. The
      greatest mass loss was obtained by adding a layer around the gold
      nanoshells, where the particle absorption spectrum was
      approximately the same as the solar spectrum (see FIG 3.)<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In FIG, 12B, the mass loss as a function of time under
      exposure to the sun in accordance with one or more embodiments of
      the invention is shown. In FIG. 12B, the mass loss under sun
      exposure with an average power of 20 W is shown for Eu2O3-coated
      nanoshells 1250, non-coated gold nanoshells 1252, gold
      nanoparticles with a diameter of - 100 nm 1254, and a water
      control 1256. As in the previous example, the greatest mass loss
      may be obtained by adding a rare earth or dielectric layer around
      a nanoshell.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The resulting mass loss curves in FIGS. 12A and 12B show
      significant water evaporation rates for Eu2O3-coated gold
      nanoshells. The mass loss may be slightly greater under solar
      radiation because the particles were able to absorb light from a
      broader range of wavelengths. In addition, the collective effect
      of aggregates broadens the absorption spectrum of the oxide-coated
      nanoparticles, which may help to further amplify the heating
      effect and create local areas of high temperature, or local hot
      spots. Aggregates may also allow a significant increase in boiling
      rates due to collective self organizing forces. The oxide layer
      may further enhance steam generation by increasing the surface
      area of the nanoparticle, thus providing more boiling nucleation
      sites per particle, while conserving the light-absorbing
      properties of the nanostructure.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 12C shows the temperature increase versus time under
      the 808 nm laser exposure in accordance with one or more
      embodiments of the invention. In FIG. 12C, the temperature
      increase under the 808 nm laser exposure is shown for Eu2O3-coated
      nanoshells 1258, non-coated gold nanoshells 1260, gold
      nanoparticles with a diameter of -100 nm 1262, and a water control
      1264. As may be expected, the temperature of the solutions of the
      different nanostructures that may be included in the complex
      increases due to the absorption of the incident electromagnetic
      radiation of the specific nanostructure and the conversion of the
      absorbed electromagnetic radiation in to heat.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 13 A is a chart of the solar trapping efficiency in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. To
      quantify the energy trapping efficiency of the complex, steam is
      generated in a flask and throttled through a symmetric
      convergent-divergent nozzle. The steam is then cooled and
      collected into an ice bath maintained at 0°C. The nozzle serves to
      isolate the high pressure in the boiler from the low pressure in
      the ice bath and may stabilize the steam flow. Accordingly, the
      steam is allowed to maintain a steady dynamic state for data
      acquisition purposes. In FIG. 13 A, the solar energy capture
      efficiency (η) of water (i) and Eu203 -coated nanoshells (ii) and
      gold branched (ii) nanostructures is shown. The resulting thermal
      efficiency of steam formation may be estimated at 80% for the
      coated nanoshell complex and 95% for a gold branched complex. By
      comparison, water has approximately 10% efficiency under the same
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the
      concentration of the complex may be modified to maximize the
      efficiency of the system. For example, in the case where the
      complex is in solution, the concentration of the different
      nanostructures that make up the complex for absorbing EM radiation
      may be modified to optimize the absorption and, thus, optimize the
      overall efficiency of the system. In the case where the complex is
      deposited on a surface, the surface coverage may be modified
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In FIG. 13B, the steam generation efficiency versus gold
      nanoshell concentration for solar and electrical heating in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention is shown.
      The results show an enhancement in efficiency for both electrical
      1366 and solar 1368 heating sources, confirming that the bubble
      nucleation rate increases with the concentration of complex. At
      high concentrations, the complex is likely to form small
      aggregates with small inter-structure gaps. These gaps may create
      "hot spots", where the intensity of the electric field may be
      greatly enhanced, causing an increase in temperature of the
      surrounding water. The absorption enhancement under electrical
      energy 1366 is not as dramatic as that under solar power 1368
      because the solar spectrum includes energetic photons in the NIR,
      visible and UV that are not present in the electric heater
      spectrum. At the higher concentrations, the steam generation
      efficiency begins to stabilize, indicating a saturation behavior.
      This may result from a shielding effect by the particles at the
      outermost regions of the flask, which may serve as a virtual
      blackbody around the particles in the bulk solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 14 shows a system in accordance with one or more
      embodiments of the invention. The bioethanol producing system 1400
      demonstrated in FIG. 14 includes a bioethanol extracting system
      1420. The bioethanol extracting system 1420 includes a vessel 1424
      and concentrator 1422. The EM radiation source 1414 supplies the
      radiation to the concentrator 1422 to provide the energy to
      produce the bioethanol from the feedstock. The bioethanol
      producing system 1400 also includes a feedstock supply system 1450
      that includes a feedstock source 1452 and pump 1454. The feedstock
      supply system 1450 may mix the feedstock into with a solution
      prior to pumping the feedstock solution into the vessel 1424. The
      bioethanol producing system 1400 may optionally include a water
      heater 1412 to preheat the feedstock solution in accordance with
      one or more embodiments of the invention. The bioethanol producing
      system 1400 may also include an optional condenser 1440 for
      collecting the bioethanol produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In one or more embodiments of the invention, each EM
      radiation source (e.g., EM radiation source 1414) is any other
      natural and/or manmade source capable of emitting one or more
      wavelengths of energy. The EM radiation source may also be a
      suitable combination of sources of EM radiation, whether emitting
      energy using the same wavelengths or different wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention,
      each EM radiation concentrator (e.g., EM radiation concentrator
      1422) is a device used to intensify the energy emitted by an EM
      radiation source. Examples of an EM radiation concentrator
      include, but are not limited to, one or more lenses (e.g., Fresnel
      lens, biconvex, negative meniscus, simple lenses, complex lenses),
      a parabolic trough, black paint, one or more disks, an array of
      multiple elements (e.g., lenses, disks), or any suitable
      combination thereof. An EM radiation concentrator may be used to
      increase the rate at which the EM radiation is absorbed by the
      complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In one or more embodiments of the invention, a vessel
      (e.g., vessel 1 1424) holds the feedstock solution and facilitates
      the transfer of energy (e.g., heat) to the feedstock solution to
      extract sugars present in the polysaccharides of the feedstock
      solution. A vessel may be designed and configured to operate under
      a pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] A vessel (e.g., vessel 1 1424), or a portion thereof, may
      include the complex. For example, a vessel may include a liquid
      solution (e.g., the feedstock, water, some other material, liquid
      or otherwise, such as ethylene glycol or glycine) that includes
      the complex, be coated on one or more inside surfaces with a
      coating of the complex, be coated on one or more outside surfaces
      with a coating of the complex, include a porous matrix into which
      the complex is embedded, include a packed column that includes
      packed, therein, a substrate on which the complex is attached,
      include rods or similar objects coated with the complex and
      submerged in the liquid solution, be constructed of a material
      that includes the complex, or any combination thereof. A vessel
      may also be adapted to facilitate one or more EM radiation
      concentrators (not shown), as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A vessel may be of any size, material, shape, color, degree
      of translucence/transparency, or any other characteristic suitable
      for the operating temperatures and pressures to produce the amount
      and concentration of bioethanol. For example, a vessel may be a
      large, stainless steel cylindrical tank holding a quantity of
      solution that includes the complex and with a number of lenses
      (acting as EM radiation concentrators) along the lid and upper
      walls. In such a case, the solution may include the feedstock to
      be heated to extract the sugars from the feedstock and/or vaporize
      (distill) the bioethanol. Further, in such a case, the feedstock
      solution may include properties such that the complex remains in
      the solution when a filtering system (described below) is used.
      Alternatively, a chemical vessel may be a translucent pipe with
      the interior surfaces coated (either evenly or unevenly) with a
      substrate of the complex, where the pipe is positioned at the
      focal point of a parabolic trough (acting as an EM radiation
      concentrator) made of reflective metal. <br>
      <br>
      [0070] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a
      bioethanol extracting system 1420 may include one or more
      temperature gauges (not shown) to measure a temperature at
      different points inside a vessel and/or at other components of the
      bioethanol producing system 1400. For example, a temperature gauge
      may be placed at the point in a vessel where a vapor element exits
      the vessel (e.g., a vapor collector). Such temperature gauge may
      be operatively connected to a control system (not shown) used to
      control the amount and/or quality of vapor element produced in
      heating the feedstock solution. In one or more embodiments of the
      invention, a vessel may be pressurized where the pressure is read
      and/or controlled using a pressure gauge (not shown). Those
      skilled in the art will appreciate one or more control systems
      used to create heated fluid in heating the cool fluid may involve
      a number of devices, including but not limited to the temperature
      gauges, pressure gauges, pumps, agitators, fans, and valves,
      controlled (manually and/or automatically) according to a number
      of protocols and operating procedures. In one or more embodiments
      of the invention, the control system may be configured to maintain
      a maximum temperature (or range of temperatures) of a vessel so
      that the chemical mixture maintains (or does not exceed) a
      predetermined temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention,
      one or more of the components of the bioethanol producing system
      1400 may also include a filtering system (not shown). For example,
      a filtering system may be located inside a vessel and/or at some
      point before the chemical mixture enters the vessel. The filtering
      system may capture impurities (e.g., dirt and other solids) in the
      feedstock solution that may not be useful or that may inhibit the
      bioethanol production process. The filtering system may vary,
      depending on a number of factors, including but not limited to the
      configuration of the vessel, the configuration of the chemical
      mixture source, and the purity requirements of a vapor element.
      The filtering system may be integrated with a control system. For
      example, the filtering system may operate within a temperature
      range measured by one or more temperature gauges.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention,
      one or more pumps may be used in the bioethanol producing system
      1400. A pump 1454 may be used to regulate the flow of the
      feedstock solution from the feedstock solution source 1452 into a
      vessel 1424 and/or the flow of the fluid element from a condenser
      (e.g., condenser 1 1440). A pump may operate manually or
      automatically (as with a control system, described above). Each
      pump may operate using a variable speed motor or a fixed speed
      motor. The flow of the feedstock solution, a vapor element from a
      vessel, and/or a fluid element from a condenser may also be
      controlled by gravity, a fan, pressure differential, some other
      suitable mechanism, or any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a
      storage tank of may be configured to store one or more fluid
      elements and/or vapor elements after the vapor element has been
      extracted from a vessel. In some embodiments of the invention, the
      storage tank may be a vessel or a vapor collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Optionally, in one or more embodiments of the invention, a
      supplemental water heater 1412 may be used in the bioethanol
      producing system 1400 to preheat the feedstock solution, or the
      solution used to make the feedstock solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 15 shows a flowchart for a method for producing
      bioethanol in accordance with one or more embodiments of the
      invention. While the various steps in this flowchart are presented
      and described sequentially, one of ordinary skill will appreciate
      that some or all of the steps may be executed in different orders,
      may be combined or omitted, and some or all of the steps may be
      executed in parallel. Further, in one or more of the embodiments
      of the invention, one or more of the steps described below may be
      omitted, repeated, and/or performed in a different order. In
      addition, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
      that additional steps, omitted in FIG. 15, may be included in
      performing this method. Accordingly, the specific arrangement of
      steps shown in FIG. 15 should not be construed as limiting the
      scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] One or more embodiments of the invention heat a feedstock
      solution to extract one or more sugars of the feedstock solution.
      The amount of feedstock solution that is heated by embodiments of
      the invention may range from a few ounces to thousands of gallons
      (or more) of feedstock solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Referring to FIG. 15, in Step 1502, EM radiation from an EM
      radiation source is concentrated and sent to the steam generating
      system. In Step 1504, the EM radiation irradiates a complex. The
      complex absorbs the EM radiation and generates heat. The heat is
      then used to heat a feedstock solution in Step 1506. The feedstock
      solution may have impurities (e.g., other elements and/or
      compounds) that are not needed or wanted when the fluid is in
      vapor form. The vessel containing the fluid may be any container
      capable of holding a volume of the fluid. For example, the vessel
      may be a pipe, a chamber, or some other suitable container. In one
      or more embodiments of the invention, the vessel is adapted to
      maintain its characteristics (e.g., form, properties) under high
      temperatures and pressures for extended periods of time. The
      complex may be part of a solution inside the vessel, a coating on
      the outside of the vessel, a coating on the inside of the vessel,
      integrated as part of the material of which the vessel is made,
      integrated with the vessel in some other way, or any suitable
      combination thereof. The fluid may be received in the vessel using
      a pump, a valve, a regulator, some other device to control the
      flow of the fluid, or any suitable combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the EM
      radiation is concentrated using an EM radiation concentrator, as
      described above with respect to FIG. 14. For example, the EM
      radiation may be concentrated using a lens or a parabolic trough.
      In one or more embodiments of the invention, the EM radiation is
      concentrated merely by exposing the vessel to the EM radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the complex
      absorbs the EM radiation to generate heat. The EM radiation may be
      applied to all or a portion of the complex located in the vessel.
      The EM radiation may also be applied to an intermediary, which in
      turn applies the EM radiation (either directly or indirectly, as
      through convection) to the complex. A control system using, for
      example, one or more temperature gauges, may regulate the amount
      of EM radiation applied to the complex, thus controlling the
      amount of heat generated by the complex at a given point in time.
      Power required for any component in the control system may be
      supplied by any of a number of external sources (e.g., a battery,
      a photovoltaic solar array, alternating current power, direct
      current power).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In Step 1508, sugar molecules are extracted from
      polysaccharides in the feedstock solution. In one or more
      embodiments of the invention, the heat generated by the complex is
      used to heat the feedstock solution to extract the sugars. In Step
      1510, the sugar molecules extracted from the feedstock solution
      are fermented. The sugar molecules may be fermented using known
      techniques, for example through the addition of saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, a yeast. In Step 1512, the bioethanol is extracted. In
      one or more embodiments of the invention, the bioethanol may be
      extracted using the techniques described in PCT Application No.
      US2011/062497. After completing Step 1510, the process may end.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Consider the following example, shown in FIG. 16, which
      describes a system that produces steam used to heat the feedstock
      solution in accordance with one or more embodiments described
      above. This example is not intended to limit the scope of the
      invention. Turning to the example, the EM radiation source 1614
      irradiates the complex 1604 through the use of the concentrator
      1610 as part of the complex based bioethanol extracting system
      1620. In this specific embodiment, the concentrator 1610 is
      parabolic mirror concentrating the EM radiation from the EM
      radiation source 1614 to a vessel containing the complex 1604. The
      complex based bioethanol extracting system 1620 may be used to
      supply steam to the chamber 1636. The chamber 1636 may include a
      temperature sensor 1632, a pressure sensor 1634, and a safety
      valve 1660. The chamber may also optionally include a heater 1612.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In one or more embodiments of the invention, steam is
      generated in the complex based bioethanol extracting system 1620.
      One of ordinary skill will appreciate that the chamber 1636 may
      include valves to isolate the chamber 1636 from the rest of the
      apparatus for the insertion or removal of the feedstock in the
      chamber 1636. At the conclusion of a cycle, a pump 1654 may be
      used to recycle the fluid for the next cycle. Alternatively, the
      pump 1654 may be used during the cycle to maintain the appropriate
      temperature and pressure necessary for heating the feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 17 illustrates an alternative configuration of the
      complex based bioethanol extracting system in accordance with one
      or more embodiments of the invention. The system shown in FIG. 17
      includes a chamber 1736 with a temperature sensor 1732, a pressure
      sensor 1734, a supply valve 1770, and a safety valve 1760. The
      supply valve 1770 may be used to supply or maintain the supply of
      fluid in the chamber 1736. The complex 1704 may be disposed inside
      the chamber 1736, with the complex being accessible to EM
      radiation 1714, via the concentrator 1710. In one or more
      embodiments of the invention, the concentrator may be a lens or
      transparent material capable of handling the temperatures and
      pressures necessary to extract the sugar molecules from the
      feedstock within the chamber 1736. One or more embodiments of the
      invention may include an optical system 1780 designed to direct
      the EM radiation 1714 to the complex 1704, depending on the
      relative position of the EM radiation source. In one or more
      embodiments of the invention, such as that shown in FIG 17, the
      system may be self-contained and portable. [0084] FIG. 18
      illustrates a system for bioethanol extraction from feedstock in
      accordance with one or more embodiments of the invention. The
      system 1800 includes an EM radiation source 1814 that applies the
      radiation, via a concentrator 1810, to a complex 1804 located
      within the chamber 1836. The closed loop system 1800 may include
      one or more temperature sensors 1832, pressure sensors 1834, and
      safety valves 1860. The safety valves 1860 may open or close a
      loop containing a condenser 1840. During operation, feedstock, or
      feedstock solution, may be disposed inside the chamber 1836, at a
      position so as not to impede the EM radiation from the EM
      radiation source 1814 reaching the complex 1804. The EM radiation
      from the EM radiation source 1814 is absorbed by complex 1804. As
      a result of the irradiation, the complex 1804 generates heat in
      the chamber 1836 and, thus, increases the temperature of the fluid
      in the chamber 1836 and pressure in the chamber 1836. The fluid is
      converted to steam and may be applied to the feedstock to extract
      the sugar molecules and/or distill the bioethanol produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIGs. 19A-19B illustrate the temperature and pressure that
      may be achieved in accordance with one or more embodiments of the
      invention. In FIG. 19 A, the complex is a gold branched structure
      as described above in relation to FIGs. 8—11. The EM radiation
      source is the sun. In FIG. 19A, the safety relief valve begins to
      vent to the atmosphere when the solution inside the chamber
      reaches ~170°C and the pressure reaches - 110 psi. In FIG. 19A,
      the temperature of the solution 1901 as a function of time
      indicates that the system may safely reach autoclave conditions.
      FIG 19A also includes the temperature as a function of time before
      1903 and after 1905 the condenser 1840. FIG. 19B is the pressure
      1907 inside the chamber 1836 as a function of time. The
      irregularity of the pressure and temperature curves shown in FIGs.
      19A and 19B are a result of clouds momentarily obstructing the
      sunlight which reduce the boiling intensity at different moments.
      [0086] Embodiments of the claimed invention produce bioethanol
      from lignocellulosic biomass to generate fuel. The cell walls of
      grass contain cellulose and hemicellulose. These polysaccharides
      are degraded into smaller units in accordance with embodiments of
      the invention, which are accessible to yeast to perform
      fermentation.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Cellulose consists of D-Glucose units linked via a β-1,4
      glycosidic bond.<br>
      <br>
      Hemicellulose contains Xylose, Mannose, Glucose and Galactose
      units. Glucose and Galactose are sugars which can be fermented by
      unmodified Saccharomyces cerevisiae, so their amount may be
      maximized in the pretreatment hydrolyzate.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The theoretically available amount of sugar in the
      feedstock may be deduced from a quantity of cellulose and
      hemicellulose. The amounts of hemicellulose and cellulose as well
      as other sugars available in feedstock are known. The amount of
      Glucose and Galactose available in Coastal hay may exceed the
      corresponding value for Alfalfa hay, which means Coastal may
      provide a more promising feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] A pretreatment with pressurized hot water may be used to
      liberate sugars from polysaccharides. Referring to FIG. 20,
      several experiments with different temperatures and pretreatment
      times have been performed with a 5% w/v solid loading on a dry
      matter basis in accordance with embodiments of the invention. A
      Parr Instruments Model 4621 pressure vessel equipped with an
      electrical heating unit was used to determine the values in FIG.
      20. The loaded vessel was heated to a certain temperature, which
      was kept constant for a defined time period. Thereafter the
      pressure was released whereby the temperature of the contents
      dropped rapidly. The sugar analysis of the pretreatment samples
      shown in FIG. 20 was carried out with a HPLC system.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In accordance with one or more embodiments of the
      invention, the temperature and pressure ranges shown in FIG. 19
      may be used to liberate the sugars in a feedstock solution, as
      demonstrated in FIG. 20. In one or more embodiments of the
      invention, complex based distillation may be used to in the
      extraction of bioethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the complex
      based bioethanol production system may be a solar, portable
      system. For example, the complex based bioethanol production
      system may be used in the fields that provide the feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Embodiments of the invention may provide for bioethanol
      production without the use of caustic chemicals to break down
      plant cell walls, or the use of enzymes for that purpose.
      Embodiments may also provide for more economical production of
      bioethanol. Embodiments of the invention may provide an
      alternative to fossil-derived fuels.<br>

      A new hybrid nanoparticle, i.e., a nanorice particle, which
      combines the intense local fields of nanorods with the highly
      tunable plasmon resonances of nanoshells, is described herein.
      This geometry possesses far greater structural tunability than
      previous nanoparticle geometries, along with much larger local
      field enhancements and far greater sensitivity as a surface
      plasmon resonance (SPR) nanosensor than presently known
      dielectric-conductive material nanostructures. In an embodiment, a
      nanoparticle comprises a prolate spheroid-shaped core having a
      first aspect ratio. The nanoparticle also comprises at least one
      conductive shell surrounding said prolate spheroid-shaped core.
      The nanoparticle has a surface plasmon resonance sensitivity of at
      least 600 nm RIU-1. Methods of making the disclosed nanorice
      particles are also described herei<br>
