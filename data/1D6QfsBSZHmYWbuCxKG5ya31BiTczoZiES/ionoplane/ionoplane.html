A revolutionary electronic aircraft propulsion system inspired by Star
Trek has been tested on a working model for the first time.<br>
  <br>
The five metre (16ft) wingspan glider-like plane has no propellers,
turbines or any other moving parts, and is completely silent.<br>
  <br>
Instead, an 'ionic wind' of colliding electrically charged air
molecules provides the thrust needed to make it fly. <br>
  <br>
It could eventually prove to be the future of air travel, bringing an
end to the noise nightmare of living under a flight path or close to a
major airport.<br>
  <br>
And unlike conventional planes, it also produces no greenhouse gases or
other pollutants.<br>
  <br>
  <b>HOW DOES IT WORK? </b><b><br>
  </b><br>
The test aircraft carries an array of thin wires strung beneath the
front end of its wings.<br>
  <br>
These wires, which carry a positive charge of 20,000 volts, strips
electrons, which have a negative charge, from air molecules.<br>
  <br>
The cloud of positively charged molecules left behind rush towards
negatively charged wires at the back of the plane.<br>
  <br>
As they flow towards the negative charge, the ions collide millions of
times with other air molecules, creating the thrust that pushes the
aircraft forward.<br>
  <br>
One of the biggest challenges was designing a power supply that would
generate 40,000 volts from the plane's battery output.<br>
  <br>
The team is working on ways of producing more ionic wind with less
voltage.<br>
  <br>
In the tests, the battery-powered unmanned aircraft, that weighs just
five pounds, managed sustained flights of 60 metres (197ft) at an
average height of just 0.47 metres (18 inches). <br>
  <br>
But its inventors believe that, like the early experiments of the
Wright brothers more than 100 years ago, such small beginnings will
eventually transform the face of aviation.<br>
  <br>
In the near future, ion wind propulsion could be employed to power
quiet drones, the team predicts.<br>
  <br>
Further down the line, the technology could be paired with more
conventional propulsion systems to produce highly fuel efficient hybrid
passenger planes.<br>
  <br>
Lead researcher Dr Steven Barrett, from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the US, said: 'This is the first-ever sustained flight of
a plane with no moving parts in the propulsion system. <br>
  <br>
'This has potentially opened new and unexplored possibilities for
aircraft which are quieter, mechanically simpler, and do not emit
combustion emissions.'<br>
  <br>
He revealed that he was partly inspired by the TV sci-fi series Star
Trek, which he watched avidly as a child.<br>
  <br>
He was especially impressed by the show's futuristic shuttle crafts
that skimmed through the air producing hardly any noise or exhaust.<br>
  <br>
'This made me think, in the long-term future, planes shouldn't have
propellers and turbines,' said Dr Barrett.<br>

blue glow and silently glide.'<br>

Test flights were made across the gymnasium at MIT's duPont Athletic
Centre, the largest indoor space the scientists could find.<br>
  <br>
Dr Barrett said: 'It took a long time to get here. Going from the basic
principle to something that actually flies was a long journey of
characterising the physics, then coming up with the design and making
it work.<br>
  <br>
'Now the possibilities for this kind of propulsion system are viable.'<br>

  </div>
  <br>
Researchers from MIT have flown a plane without moving parts for the
first time. It is powered by an ‘ion drive’ which uses high powered
electrodes to ionise and accelerate air particles, creating an ‘ionic
wind’. This wind drove a 5m wide craft across a sports hall. Unlike the
ion drives which have powered space craft for decades, this new drive
uses air as the accelerant. The researchers say it could power silent
drones.<br>

  <b>Abstract</b><br>
Since the first aeroplane flight more than 100 years ago, aeroplanes
have been propelled using moving surfaces such as propellers and
turbines. Most have been powered by fossil-fuel combustion.
Electroaerodynamics, in which electrical forces accelerate ions in a
fluid1,2, has been proposed as an alternative method of propelling
aeroplanes—without moving parts, nearly silently and without combustion
emissions3,4,5,6. However, no aeroplane with such a solid-state
propulsion system has yet flown. Here we demonstrate that a solid-state
propulsion system can sustain powered flight, by designing and flying
an electroaerodynamically propelled heavier-than-air aeroplane. We flew
a fixed-wing aeroplane with a five-metre wingspan ten times and showed
that it achieved steady-level flight. All batteries and power systems,
including a specifically developed ultralight high-voltage
(40-kilovolt) power converter, were carried on-board. We show that
conventionally accepted limitations in thrust-to-power ratio and thrust
density4,6,7, which were previously thought to make electroaerodynamics
unfeasible as a method of aeroplane propulsion, are surmountable. We
provide a proof of concept for electroaerodynamic aeroplane propulsion,
opening up possibilities for aircraft and aerodynamic devices that are
quieter, mechanically simpler and do not emit combustion emissions.<br>

  </b></b><b>Abstract:</b><b><br>
  </b>Recent studies in electro-aerodynamic (EAD) propulsion have
stimulated the need for lightweight power converters providing outputs
at tens of kilovolts and hundreds of watts. This paper demonstrates a
design of a lightweight high-voltage converter operating from a 160-200
V dc input and providing dc output of up to 600 W at 40 kV. It operates
at around 500 kHz and achieves a specific power of 1.2 kW/kg. This is
considerably lighter than comparable industrial and academic designs at
this power level. High voltage converters generally comprise an
inverter, a step-up transformer and a rectifier, with the large needed
voltage gain distributed among these stages. Several means of realizing
these stages are compared in terms of weight. The weight of the
converter is minimized by properly selecting and optimizing the design
and the voltage gain of each stage within the constraints of device
limitations and losses. A prototype circuit is developed based on this
approach and used to drive an EAD-propulsion system for an unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV). In addition to addressing the power conversion
needs for EAD, this research can potentially benefit the development of
lightweight high-voltage converters in many other applications where
weight and size are important.<br>
