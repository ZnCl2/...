      </center>
      <p>is a loose term which refers to methods of birth control that
        are considered "natural"; though what is considered "natural"
        varies widely. Generally, natural birth control does not involve
        hormonal contraception, nor synthetic chemicals including
        synthetic spermicide. Other methods may also be excluded,
        depending on how the term "natural" is defined. </p>
      <p>Some definitions of "natural" are more lenient and include
        barrier contraception used without synthetic spermicide, and
        occasionally the copper IUD, which contains no hormones. Some
        definitions exclude the use of devices, but include the use of
        herbs, natural substances, and behavioral methods. Natural
        family planning is the most exclusive in its definition of what
        is "natural". </p>
      <p>Naturally occurring substances are chemicals, but some
        distinguish them from synthetic substances and consider them
        "natural". Herbs and substances may be ingested, to interfere
        with ovulation or implantation. Some are used to encourage
        menstruation... </p>
      <p>Other substances are inserted vaginally, for use as natural
        spermicides. Examples of these include lemon juice,[1] wild
        yam,[2] Queen Anne's Lace (wild carrot),[3] and neem[4]). A
        website called Sister Zeus describes many of these methods in
        detail. </p>

      <p>...Silphium, was an herbal morning-after pill, readily
        available to our ancestors a hundred generations ago. </p>
      <p>In the seventh century BC, Greek colonists established the city
        of Cyrene on the Libyan coast. Shortly after their arrival,
        wrote the Greek botanist Theophrastus (ca. 370-288 BC), they
        discovered silphium -- the plant that would make them rich and
        the city famous. A member of the genus Feula, (commonly known as
        giant fennel), a large group of plants with deeply divided
        leaves and yellow flowers, the pungent sap from silphium's stems
        and roots was used in cough syrups. It also gave food a rich
        distinctive taste when used as an additive. Of far greater
        importance was its value as a birth control agent. </p>
      <p>Contemporary medical authorities were universal in their praise
        for silphium's value as a contraceptive. The Roman physician
        Soranus, antiquity's foremost gynecologist, wrote that women
        should drink the juice from an amount of silphium about the size
        of a chick pea, with water, once a month since "it not only
        prevents conception but also destroys anything existing." The
        herbalist and pharmacist, Dioscorides, author of Materia Medica,
        recommended silphium for contraceptive and abortive purposes. </p>
      <p>...Another member of the Ferula species, asafoetida, which
        gives Worcestershire sauce its distinctive aroma, was also
        widely used (though considered less effective) since it was
        cheaper and more abundant. </p>
      <p>Besides silphium and asafoetida, other plants were recognized
        as having both contraceptive and abortificant properties by
        ancient women. Hippocrates "the father of medicine" stated the
        seeds of Queen Anne's Lace, or wild carrot, when taken orally
        both prevented and terminated pregnancy and recommended their
        use. </p>
      <p><b>Herbal Contraceptives in Ancient Literature</b> </p>
      <p>Other plants used in classical times as contraceptives included
        pennyroyal, artemisia, myrrh and rue. In Aristophanes' 421 BC
        comedy The Peace, Hermes provides Trigaius with a female
        companion. Trigaius wonders if the woman might become pregnant.
        "Not if you add a dose of pennyroyal," advises Hermes.
        Hippocrates also mentions the value of pennyroyal as a birth
        control agent though cautions that it is toxic and has to be
        taken in precisely calculated amounts. </p>
      <p>Galen (AD 129-199), the foremost physician in the Roman world,
        and Dioscorides also recommended the use of pomegranate for
        birth control. The seeds were typically used as a pessary,
        (vaginal suppository), though one contemporary medical text
        documents use of pomegranate seed being taken orally as a
        post-coital contraceptive. The best known literary reference to
        the pomegranate's contraceptive power is the Greek myth of
        Persephone and Hades. Persephone had eaten six pomegranate
        kernels while in the underworld and for that many months the
        land was infertile during the fall and winter... </p>
      <p>Silphium cannot be tested but experiments using crude extracts
        of asafoetida in rats, showed that it inhibited implantation of
        fertilized ova at rates up to 50 percent. Extracts of
        asafoetida's close relatives were nearly 100 percent effective
        in preventing pregnancy when given within three days of mating.
        In 1986 it was shown that compounds in Queen Anne's Lace blocked
        the production of progesterone, necessary for preparation of the
        uterus for a fertilized ovum. Women in rural North Carolina and
        Rajasthan, India both use the seeds to prevent pregnancy.
        Pennyroyal contains a substance, pulegone, that terminates
        pregnancies in both humans and animals. </p>

      <p><b>Rina Nissim: <i>Natural Healing in Gynaecology: A Manual
            for Women</i></b> (Pandora/Harper-Collins, 1996) </p>
      <p>"Our Experience at the Women's Health Center </p>
      <p>We have obtained between 60 and 80 percent effectiveness among
        women who suspected an undesired pregnancy. Clearly this figure
        does not tell us much because we do not know how many of these
        women were in fact pregnant. The women always used two herbs at
        one time (most often using either pennyroyal or mugwort, plus
        one other herb). The best association has been shown to be
        pennyroyal - blue cohosh. </p>
      <p>These herbs seem to be very effective for small delays in
        menstrual bleeding.&nbsp; Their effectiveness drops noticably
        after the 6th day of delay, but still can be useful as long as
        an inability to confirm the pregnancy makes abortion impossible.
      </p>
      <p>It might be mentioned that these herbs seem ineffective for
        periods delyaed after going off the Pill, and only slightly
        effective with irregular cycles. </p>
      <p>According to the research and experience of a collective of
        women in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a better result is obtained with
        cotton root bark than with pennyroyal.&nbsp; We have therefore
        integrated this 6th herb into our practice. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that the earlier the herbs are taken
        [as tea infusions], the more effective they are. There is just
        one limitation: that the cycle be at its end.&nbsp; Herbs are
        not effective just after ovulation because it is not possible to
        loosen mucus which is not yet 'mature'. You can therefore begin
        to drink infusions the day before the period would normally
        begin, the same day, or up until the 10th day thereafter. The
        percentage of success is very good (60-80 percent) the first 6
        days. If you begin drinking the infusions only after the 6th day
        overdue, however, the percentage of effectiveness falls to 20
        percent. </p>
      <p>For this reason, after our years of experience, we rarely
        propose infusions after the 6th day overdue.&nbsp; On the other
        hand, for those who are among the 20 percent, it is worth it!
        The development of early pregnancy tests, however, will probably
        change our practice and permit a more precise study. </p>
      <p>What are the possible side effects? Essentially, contractions
        whose strength increases in proportion to the length of delay.
        Sometimes nausea or a light dizziness may result. It is
        recommended to eat lightly during these days. </p>
      <p>Practically speaking --- We always prescribe two associated
        herbs:&nbsp; cotton root bark&nbsp; or&nbsp; pennyroyal&nbsp;
        or&nbsp; mugwort&nbsp; to be used with&nbsp; parsley&nbsp;
        or&nbsp; blue cohosh&nbsp; or&nbsp; black cohosh. </p>
      <p>Using one teaspoonful of each plant, separately, per cup liquid
        - in infusion for the leaves (mugwort and pennyroyal), and in
        decoction for the roots (the others) - drink one cup of each of
        the 2 herbs three timesa day. This means 6 cups to drink each
        day for a maximum of 6 days. (more information below) </p>
      <p>BE CAREFUL: do not overdose. Do not continue treatment more
        than six days. Do not begin after the 10th overdue day. The
        better informed women are, the earlier they will begin.&nbsp; It
        is not necessary to continue taking the herbs once the period
        has truly begun." </p>
      <p><b>Group A</b> (choose one): </p>

        Part used: bark of the root, cut and broken up like tea <br>
        Properties: emmenagogue, imitates oxytocin (childbirth hormone
        that triggers labor) <br>
        Preparation: decoction,1 teaspoon of bark per cup of water, 3
        cups per day for a maximum of 6 days. <br>
        We suggest to use only organically-grown cotton root bark, as
        cotton plants grown for fabric production are heavily sprayed
        with pesticides. </p>

        Properties: emmenagogue, aids gall bladder and digestive tract <br>
        Preparation: infusion,1 teaspoon per cup of water, 3 cups per
        day for a maximum of 6 days. <br>
        CAUTION:Do Not Use extracted pennyroyal oil, which is toxic and
        potentially lethal! The tea recipe as given above, consumed for
        that limited amount of time, is safe. </p>
      <p>Mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris) <br>
        Part used: entire plant, broken up, dried <br>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Eve's Herbs: A History of Contraception
              and Abortion in the West</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by </b><b>John M. Riddle</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p>Editorial Reviews --- <i>Library Journal</i> </p>
      <p>Even in ancient times, people limited the size of their
        families. Since the major responsibilities of pregnancy, birth,
        and child rearing fell on women, they found methods for
        controlling fertility and aborting unwanted children, and they
        have passed down this knowledge as an oral tradition that
        survives worldwide. Using early manuscripts of medical and
        botanical texts and the proceedings of court cases, historian
        Riddle examines the use of plants as contraceptives, offering a
        fascinating view of the early knowledge of reproduction and
        attempts to regulate it. As formal medical training evolved and
        the Roman Catholic Church gained power, these preparations were
        forbidden, and women offering or using them were tried as
        witches. The information remained available in disguised form,
        and, in many parts of the world, Queen Anne's Lace, Pennyroyal,
        and other botanicals are still used to "regulate menses." More
        scholarly than Shirley Green's The Curious History of
        Contraception (LJ 8/72), this work is recommended for academic
        and large public libraries. </p>
      <p><b>Product Description</b> </p>
      <p>In Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the
        Renaissance, John Riddle showed, through extraordinary scholarly
        sleuthing, that women from ancient Egyptian times to the
        fifteenth century had relied on an extensive pharmacopoeia of
        herbal abortifacients and contraceptives to regulate fertility.
        In Eve's Herbs, Riddle explores a new question: If women once
        had access to effective means of birth control, why was this
        knowledge lost to them in modern times? </p>
      <p>Beginning with the testimony of a young woman brought before
        the Inquisition in France in 1320, Riddle asks what women knew
        about regulating fertility with herbs and shows how the new
        intellectual, religious, and legal climate of the early modern
        period tended to cast suspicion on women who employed "secret
        knowledge" to terminate or prevent pregnancy. Knowledge of the
        menstrual-regulating qualities of rue, pennyroyal, and other
        herbs was widespread through succeeding centuries among
        herbalists, apothecaries, doctors, and laywomen themselves, even
        as theologians and legal scholars began advancing the idea that
        the fetus was fully human from the moment of conception. </p>
      <p>Drawing on previously unavailable material, Riddle reaches a
        startling conclusion: while it did not persist in a form that
        was available to most women, ancient knowledge about herbs was
        not lost in modern times but survived in coded form. Persecuted
        as "witchcraft" in centuries past and prosecuted as a crime in
        our own time, the control of fertility by "Eve's herbs" has been
        practiced by Western women since ancient times. </p>

      <p>Disclaimer: This is not anything you should try at home without
        supervision from a knowledgeable herb person. </p>
      <p>Current and reliable information on herbal birth control is
        rare. In the Western tradition much information on birth control
        as well as safe birthing techniques was destroyed during the
        European Witch hunts circa 1450-1700. Having such knowledge was
        proof positive that you were a witch. Other historical
        information is often incomplete, with only a local common name,
        or no exact dosages. Researchers often discard supportive
        techniques such as fasting or ritual as mere superstition.
        Current studies tend to be anecdotal rather than strictly lab
        controlled data. This does not mean they are not of value, but
        again pertinent info may be missing. Such as was the woman
        pregnant in the first place? Anecdotal info can give us ideas on
        where to start and what the possibilities are. They have also
        shown us that herbal abortives are not themselves without side
        effects, often severe. All herbal info on abortives should be
        thoroughly researched before use. Some herbalists feel that
        herbal abortions are more dangerous than clinical abortions.
        Abortive herbs are toxic and do have side effects. They are not
        safer because they are natural. Clinical abortions are certainly
        more effective. Most importantly an herbal abortion should never
        be undertaken unless a women is willing to follow up with a
        clinical abortion if the herbs fail. </p>
      <p><b>Effectiveness</b> </p>
      <p>Varying success rates have been claimed for herbal birth
        control. Estimates vary from 20%-80%. It is important to
        remember that most of these rates are based on the incidence of
        successfully bringing on a delayed period, not in aborting a
        definite pregnancy. Since many herbs seem to work the best close
        to the time of the first missed menstrual period, many women
        have not had a pregnancy test at the time they took herbal
        abortives. Studies on the success rate of herbal abortives in
        non-confirmed pregnancies is quite high (70%-80%). Success rates
        with confirmed pregnancies is substantially lower, 20% or less.
        Also there's not as much research on herbal abortives with
        confirmed pregnancy. </p>
      <p><b>Specifics</b> </p>
      <p>Rina Nissim, founder of the Dispensaire des Femmes in
        Switzerland claims a success rate of 60%-80% in women who
        believed they were pregnant (non-tested). Their method involved
        the use of at least two herbs at a time. Generally one
        emmenagogue (bleeding stimulator) with an oxytocic (uterine
        contraction stimulator) for no more than six days starting as
        soon as a woman's period is late. They have found that starting
        the herbal regimen later than six days overdue drops the success
        rate to 20%. </p>
      <p>In a survey I conducted (appendix A) with a small group of
        women there appeared to be a high success rate (about 75%).
        However only one of the women had a positive pregnancy test, so
        actual success rates were certainly much lower. My experience
        with women where there has been more complete information, such
        as positive pregnancy tests and follow up leads me to guess at a
        realistic success rate of 20% at this time. In a highly quoted
        New Mexico study, Cotton root bark had a very high success rate,
        with a fairly low toxicity. However it appears that very few of
        the women were actually pregnant based on blood tests and
        screening. </p>
      <p>Less info is available on prevention of pregnancy with herbs.
        In an informal study (appendix B) by Robin Bennett with Wild
        Carrot Seed used on a semi- regular basis as an implantation
        preventer she had a 98% success rate with few side effects.
        There is also a much quoted seven year study involving one
        hundred women in Alaska that also claimed high success rates for
        wild carrot seed. But no one seems to have any specifics on it.
      </p>
      <p><b>Safety</b> </p>
      <p>In general many herbal abortives are mildly poisonous to
        potentially fatal in large doses. <br>
        Almost all women report at least one of the following side
        effects: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Increased bleeding <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Dizziness and nausea sometimes extreme
        enough to cause fear. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Visual disturbances <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sweats or chills <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Diarrhea </p>
      <p>Less commonly reported side effects: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Incomplete abortion <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Irregular cycles for 1-3 months </p>
      <p>The above can also occur in clinical abortions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Kidney irritation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Breast Lumps (Tansy) </p>
      <p>Almost all women reported heavier bleeding and clotting than
        normal and felt that this was an indication of an aborted
        pregnancy. While this is indeed a sign of aborted pregnancy it's
        also common with use of emmenagogues. Common sense would
        indicate that when using emmenagogues there would be the chance
        of hemorrhage, but it appears to be a not very common side
        effect compared to the other effects. Most side effects appear
        to be of short duration. I do know of one case where a women
        experienced severe long term endocrine imbalance after using
        herbal abortives. </p>
      <p><b>Serious side effects</b> </p>
      <p>The most serious side effects seem to occur when women use
        herbal abortives, remain pregnant and attempt to carry to term.
        There is a high enough rate of reported instances to call for
        extreme caution. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Incomplete or low implantation of the
        placenta <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reported frequently by many
        practitioners) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Premature detachment of the placenta before
        or during birth </p>
      <p>Consequences of these side effects can be severe and
        potentially fatal. Severe hemorrhage can and does occur under
        these circumstances. In one case a women lost 1/3 of her blood
        volume before bleeding could be stopped. Treatment consists of
        total bed rest and staying close to a hospital. The risks to
        both mother and fetus are extreme. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A few isolated reports of toxaemia
        possibly related to herbal abortives. </p>
      <p>One final very subjective note: </p>
      <p>Clinic workers who see many clinical abortions note that women
        who used herbal abortives on their current pregnancy seem to
        have darker, thicker blood with more clotting. </p>
      <p><b>Use of herbal abortives as a labor facilitator</b> </p>
      <p>A few of the herbs that are used as herbal abortives maybe
        safely used in the last trimester of pregnancy under specific
        conditions to help facilitate healthy labor. While safe if
        properly used they should not be used unless a problem exists
        and only with the help of a practitioner. <br>
        Herbal specifics </p>
      <p>There are two main types of herbs used as abortives.
        Emmenagogues and oxytocics. </p>
      <p><b>Emmenagogues</b> </p>
      <p>Emmenagogues stimulate blood circulation to the pelvic area and
        uterus and help to stimulate menstruation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Vitamin C - no buffers or fillers. Dose:
        500 mg every hour for 12 hours up to 5 days. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: possible kidney
        irritation, loose bowels. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ginger - Zingiber officinale, Dose: 1 oz.
        fresh or dry root to pint of water. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: possible
        light-headedness. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Pennyroyal - Mentha pulegium &amp; Hedeoma
        pulegiodes, Dose: 1/4 cup of herb to 1 quart water once a day
        for no more than 6 days. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: nausea, numbness in
        hand and legs, liver irritation, kidney and bladder irritation,
        diarrhea, The essential oil is fatal internally.
        Contraindications: kidney conditions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Angelica root - Angelica archangelica,
        Dosage: 1/4 cup herb to 1 quart water as tea. Tincture - 10-20
        drops every two hours. Dried root less toxic than fresh. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: irritant to kidney and
        liver, not studied as much as pennyroyal. Contraindicated in
        diabetes as it raises blood sugar levels. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Mugwort Leaf - Artemisia vulgaris, Dosage:
        3 teaspoon per cup tea, 3 cups per day, for no more than six
        days. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: higher doses can cause
        liver damage and convulsions. Nausea. Contraindications: Uterine
        inflammation or recent pelvic infection. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Black Cohosh Root - Cimicifuga racemosa,
        Dosage: 3 teaspoons per cup, 4 times a day. Tincture 20 drops
        every 6 hours. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: Diarrhea, dizziness,
        headache, decreased pulse rate, tremors, fatalities can occur in
        large enough doses. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Tansy - Tanacetum vulgare. Note: Do not
        confuse with tansy ragwort, Senecio jacobaea, which is a
        poisonous plant known to cause death in cattle thru liver
        failure. Dosage: Tea, 4-8 teaspoons per qt. sipped throughout
        day. 10 drops tincture in warm water every two hours til
        bleeding commences, for no more than 5 days. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: breast lumps, possible
        hemorrhage, liver irritant. Essential oil is fatal - do not
        ingest. </p>
      <p><b>Oxytocic herbs</b> </p>
      <p>They imitate oxytocin in the body to stimulate uterine
        contractions and release prostaglandin hormones. All oxytocic
        herbs are toxic to some degree. Women can experience very
        painful contractions. They are generally hard on the liver.
        Women with a history of liver disease such as hepatitis may wish
        to avoid them all together. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Blue Cohosh root - Caulophyllum
        thalictroides, Dosage: Tea - 3 teaspoons herb per cup, 3 cups
        per day, tincture - 20 drops every 4 hours, for six days or til
        bleeding commences. Toxicity: nausea, vomiting, headaches,
        convulsions in large doses, kidney and liver irritant,
        Contraindications: low blood pressure. Some of the constituents
        of Cohosh are more soluble as tincture. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Angelica - see emmenagogues. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cotton root bark - Gossypium herbacetum,
        Dosage: 12 teaspoons per quart, 1/2 - 1 quart thru day. Tincture
        10 drops every few hours til bleeding commences, for no more
        than 6 days. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity : seemingly low based on
        the New Mexico study. Cotton is a heavily sprayed crop with
        pesticides that are only used on non food crops. Those
        pesticides can cause liver irritation, and other problems.
        Organic cotton root bark may be difficult to find. </p>
      <p><b>Other herbs used</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Wild Carrot Seed - Daucus carota, used as
        a preventative. Dosage: 1 teaspoon a day chewed and washed down
        with fluid. Believed to work as an implantation preventor by
        making the uterine lining unsuitable. See appendix B. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: So far appears to be
        low toxicity, long term effects unknown. Identification must be
        absolute as many wild members of this family look similar and
        can be fatal. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Trillium root - Trillium spp. Dosage:
        tincture 30 drops 3-4 times a day. Tea 3 teaspoons per cup, 1
        quart per day. Trillium root is used by midwives to facilitate
        softening of the cervix and is often used as a labor adjunct in
        the case of rigid os or as a preparatory agent before trying to
        induce labor with stronger herbs. It occasionally will start
        labor on it's own. As an abortive there is not a lot of current
        use info on effectiveness and side effects. Trillium root should
        only be harvested from garden grown plants as it is rare in the
        wild due to habitat destruction by logging and urban growth. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Parsley - Petroselinum spp. Used as a
        fresh plant vaginal insert for 24 hours. Personally I have heard
        of no cases of even bringing on a delayed period with this
        method. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toxicity: low. </p>
      <p>Misc. Herbs listed as abortives: Agave, Osha, Mistletoe, Rue,
        Peyote, Sweet flag, Papaya seed, Feverfew, Motherwort, Wood
        Sorrel, Damiana. </p>
      <p>The above is by no means an exhaustive list, many mild
        emmenagogues are listed as abortives in literature both
        scientific and folkloric: Marjoram, Oregano, Beet, Celery,
        Papaya fruit, Peppermint, Valerian, etc. While they may help
        facilitate onset of a slow period, such as the type where
        there's cramping and pelvic heaviness but bleeding has not yet
        commenced, it's doubtful they would act as abortives. </p>
      <p>Dosages mentioned above may be on the conservative side in many
        cases. However, since the serious side effects show up at higher
        doses it's best to be cautious. I've seen better results with
        tea than with tincture and with mixing 2 -3 herbs together in a
        blend. Herbal abortives effects may be enhanced by a day of
        fasting, working with ritual, and massage of the uterine
        acupressure points along the ankles several times a day for at
        least ten minutes at a time. Again the success rate is very low
        for actual pregnancies. </p>
      <p>Ideally if a woman wished to use herbal abortives I would
        recommend finding a clinic that does early pregnancy testing of
        the type that can detect pregnancy within a few days of
        conception, preferably one that can see women on a walk in basis
        so you don't have to wait for an appointment. Then if you are
        not pregnant you can use a mild emmenagogue such as marjoram,
        without stressing your body. Since early testing is not 100%
        accurate and if you are fairly sure you are pregnant, you may
        wish to use one of the less toxic abortives such as Vitamin C.
        Since most of the abortives are so hard on the body they should
        only be used in cases of confirmed pregnancy. Why put your liver
        thru more stress than it already gets in today's world? </p>
      <p><b>Appendix A ---&nbsp; Survey on herbal birth control and
          abortives</b> </p>
      <p><b>Colette Gardiner</b> </p>
      <p>Of the 10 women in the study: </p>
      <p>None had used herbs preventatively as contraception <br>
        6 had previously been pregnant <br>
        8 could tell very accurately when they ovulated <br>
        8 of the women had used herbal abortives <br>
        1 women had delayed ovulation time with herbs use <br>
        1 women was a practitioner who counseled about herbal abortives
        <br>
        6 of the women had side effects </p>
      <p>6 of the 8 women who used herbal abortives brought on a delayed
        period with herbs. Only one of these women had a confirmed
        pregnancy, but all the women felt they were pregnant. Two of
        these women were a few weeks late. A few of these women had
        unsuccessful herbal abortive attempts at other times. </p>
      <p>Time Frame Abortives Used: <br>
        Brought on period with herbs at: <br>
        Three weeks overdue - 1 women <br>
        Two weeks overdue - 1 women <br>
        When period was due - 4 women </p>
      <p>Many of the women reported friends who used herbal abortives
        successfully, but I did not use those accounts in my survey. In
        general the second hand reports were very similar to the survey
        results. </p>
      <p>A practitioner reported that several women in her area were
        drinking sassafras tea as a contraceptive. She didn't give
        details on safety or effectiveness. </p>
      <p>One women reported that either Vitamin A or Goldenseal seemed
        to delay ovulation. I've heard no other instances of this. </p>
      <p>My next project is to do a larger survey on herbal abortives
        with women who have had a positive early pregnancy test. For

      <p><b>Appendix B ---&nbsp; Wild Carrot Seed as an Herbal
          Contraceptive</b> </p>
      <p>Survey conducted by Robin Bennett ---&nbsp; In Robin's info she
        stresses that it was a small study, and that she did not use
        scientific, double blind methods etc. </p>
      <p>In her survey there were three dosage regimes <br>
        1) Every day <br>
        2) Daily for 7 -8 days surrounding ovulation <br>
        3) For 7 days following intercourse </p>
      <p>The dosage for all women was one teaspoon daily chewed and
        washed down with fluids. Half of the women in the study used it
        as their only form of birth control. The study lasted for one
        year. Out of the ten women in the study: one became pregnant and
        had a clinical abortion. She became pregnant when she used the
        seeds for only three days around ovulation instead of the
        recommended 7-8. She had a clinical abortion. Two other women
        suspected they were pregnant and used herbal emmenagogues to
        bring on their period. One of these women was using the seeds
        daily. The other women was using them for 7-8 days surrounding
        ovulation. One of the women discontinued seed use in order to
        become pregnant and did. There were some mild side effects such
        as gas and slightly earlier periods. Some women felt that
        anything less than the full dose actually enhanced fertility.
        None of the women reported any symptoms of uterine irritation
        and subsequent exams showed no signs of it. In her handout Robin
        mentions some lab studies using WCS as an implantation preventor
        in mice, but did not give details. </p>

      <p>Somebody wrote: </p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; A friend of mine does not use birth control. Is there
        an natural form for the abortion process? </p>
      <p>Somebody else tried to be helpful: </p>
      <p>&gt; Here is a formula that is intended to induce a
        miscarriage: <br>
        &gt; 20 drops blue cohosh <br>
        &gt; 20 drops black cohosh <br>
        &gt; 20 drops pennyroyal <br>
        &gt; Measure the tinctures into a cup of warm water ... <br>
        And finally some Common Sense; Jonathan Treasure replied to
        above: </p>
      <p>It is debatable whether using herbal medicine to cause uterine
        rejection of a conceptus is any more "natural" then an a
        D&amp;C. Herbs can be potent and potentially dangerous - just
        because they grew out of the ground doesn't confer the status
        "natural" on anything they may be used for especially when the
        only alternative is orthodox procedural medicine. However the
        answer is YES, herbal abortion is possible, in certain
        circumstances. </p>
      <p>It would however be quite insane to take a recommendation from
        an internet list and simply believe that is the end of it....we
        are not talking about a common cold here. The reply giving
        cohosh/pennyroyal recipes was just plain daft - how late is she,
        how old is she, what is her general health, nutritional status,
        psychological state, emotional strength, domestic situation,
        support network etc etc etc etc etc. All these questions come
        before some generic formula can be given. Then the formula given
        was not related to strength of tincture, dried or fresh plant
        used, etc. The dose pattern given was potentially excessive. It
        might harm or her or it may not work at all. Would you then
        write to this list again? Grow up! I would urge your friend to
        consult someone who is experienced in the herbal management of
        ob/gyn if there is a real need (e.g. legality/finance) to go
        this route. </p>

      <p>Q:&nbsp; I've heard that herbs can be used for contraception.
        Is this a good idea? </p>
      <p>ADRIANE FUGH-BERMAN, M.D., REPLIES: I wouldn't recommend it.
        Modern contraceptives are more effective and have been
        extensively tested for safety. By the way, the birth control
        pill was derived from an herb. Its progestin comes from a
        chemical isolated from the inedible Mexican wild yam (Dioscorea
        villosa). However, this plant is used traditionally for stomach
        problems, not contraception. </p>
      <p>Some people have used herbs to prevent conception, like the
        seeds of Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota). But there's no
        clinical evidence of their efficacy and I wouldn't recommend
        taking your chances. </p>
      <p>Several so-called contraceptive herbs are actually
        abortifacients and can be dangerous. These potentially deadly
        herbs work by poisoning the woman, who, being larger than the
        fetus, may survive the toxicity while the fetus does not. A
        recent review published in the Journal of Toxicology and
        Clinical Toxicology reported 57 cases of poisonings, including
        two deaths, due to plants used to attempt abortion between 1990
        and 1997. </p>

      <p>An indigenous contraceptive herbal formulation consisting of a
        mixture of Lepidagathis longifolia, Palaquium sp and
        Phyllagathis rotundifolia is being used by the Temuan Aborigins
        of Malaysia. Although the previous studies demonstrated that
        this contraceptive herbal formulation causes anovulatory estrous
        cycle, altered circulating hormone levels and fetal resorption
        in rats, but the effects of this formulation on the gonadotrphs
        of the pituitary gland are yet to be evaluated. The present
        study was designed to observe the morphometric changes of the
        gonadotrophs and the plasma concentrations of follicle
        stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone. Thirty five
        Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were randomly divided into 5
        groups. Experimental animals were given a combined herbal
        extract or individual herbal extract at a dose of 540 mg/kg/day
        subcutaneously for 7 days. Immunostained gonadotrophs were
        studied by using image analyzer. FSH and LH serum concentrations
        were determined using RIA. The FSH and LH concentrations were
        low in animals that received combined herbal extract
        (p&lt;0.01). FSH concentration was noted to be significantly low
        in animals that received P. rotundifolia (p&lt;0.05). The mean
        cell area and cell density of gonadotrophs of animals that
        received combined herbal extract were significantly low compared
        to control group (p&lt;0.05). It was concluded that the herbal
        extracts do suppress the production of gonaotrophins along with
        the demonstrable suppresive effect on the FSH cells. </p>

      <p>Herbal contraceptives date back to the Greek Empire (at least
        3,000 years) or ancient times. Certain herbs proven by
        scientific research: Affective anti-fertility method. When
        taking an herb for contraceptive purpose, beware each herb taken
        differently, some are taken daily, and when needed during
        fertile time preventing pregnancy. Many women choose herbal
        contraceptive method for various reasons: Cheaper than modern
        contraceptive methods, alternatively fewer difficulties or no
        complications compared to modern contraceptives, and seeking a
        different contraceptive method. However, taking herbal
        contraceptives may risk exposure to health concerns, not always
        100% effective, and should not be taken with prescribed
        medication or having an existing health problem. Taking herbal
        contraceptives long term may or may not cause a health concerns.
        Some herbalists don't recommend herb for contraception, because
        potential unreliability. 1 </p>
      <p>During the Roman Empire, a coin depicted a picture of the
        contraceptive herb asafoetida (Devil's dung, stinking gum,
        asant, food of the gods, hing and giant fennel 3) named by the
        Romans silphium. Greeks named the herb Silphion. 4 This perineal
        plant native to Iran. The asafoetida produces a pungent
        sulfurous odor. The plant made into a spice as a digestive aid,
        condiment and pickles. Reported in human tests asafoetida used
        as a contraceptive and substance that induces abortion. 3 Roman
        physician Soranus, antiquity's foremost gynecologist wrote,
        regarding silphium, women drink the juice from the plant with
        water once a month, he said: "It not only prevents conception
        but also destroys anything existing". 4 </p>
      <p>Queen Annes Lace (wild carrot) a biennial plant, in the second
        year, stems are erect and branched; both stems and leaves are
        covered with short coarse hairs, and reach height two to four
        feet. The plant strives growing in direct sunlight and well
        drained neutral to alkaline soil. Originally the plant was
        brought to the United States from Europe. It grows abundantly in
        western part of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington. Wild
        carrot attracts sheep as a source of food. During late 1980s
        scientists discovered Queen Annes Lace in mice, blocked the
        production of progesterone and inhibited fetal and ovarian
        growth .6 (In Chinese laboratory tests confirmed Queen Annes
        Lace seeds inhibited progesterone, required to fertilize an egg
        5) According to a study ..." in which twelve women from New York
        City used 1 teaspoon of QAL (Queen Annes Lace) seeds chewed well
        for 12 months for contraceptive purposes.": According to a
        women's menstrual cycle, wild carrots ingested induce
        contraception. The dosage increased to work more effectively for
        women above average height and weight. Wild carrot known side
        affect: Occasional - slight constipation for a few women. Queen
        Anne's Lace may not be recommended for women who have kidney or
        gallstones and herb should not be taken along with prescribed
        blood pressure and estrogen medication. 5 </p>
      <p>In the United States, black cohosh herb grows in shady
        woodlands of southeast, northern Oregon, Washington, and Ontario
        (Canada). The plant measures one to three feet long with white
        blossoms (June and July). The stout and root used for medicinal
        purposes. 7 Native Americans used black cohosh to treat sore
        throats and kidney problems. Also, the herb treats hot flashes
        and other menopausal symptoms 9 "Black cohosh has been used as
        an abortifacient". 8 Also, the herb combined with Pennyroyal
        (herb) intensifies the abortifacient process. 2 In the United
        States, black cohosh sold as a dietary supplement but not
        regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The herb can
        cause stomach pain and headache. Also, herb rarely causes liver
        damage. Breast cancer patients should avoid taking black cohosh,
        unknown side effects. 9 </p>
      <p>Chinese Yam (Mexican yam or Dioscorea villosa 16) perennial
        vine: Native to China, and native herb plant (wild yam) grown in
        the United States. The herb roots and rootstock (rhizomes)
        provide herbal remedies, including treating menstrual
        irregularity, flashes and other symptoms of menopause (No
        available scientific evidence support these claims). Cream
        makers of the byproduct wild yam claim their product helps women
        lose weight, increase energy (stamina) and enhance sex drive.
        According to Chinese Yam herb users, claim to stimulate
        appetite, remedy for chronic diarrhea, asthma, fatigue and treat
        frequent urination, diabetes and emotional stress. 10 Reported
        in a magazine, midwife (Willa Shaffer) in Utah claimed wild yam
        effectively stopped getting pregnant during a year usage of the
        herb. She wrote a book: Wild Yam: Birth Control Without Fear
        (Woodland Health) (Paperback). However, no scientific
        documentation has proven her claim. 11 Large doses of wild yam
        may cause: Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Rarely the herb causes
        these allergic reactions: Rashes, asthma, and other symptoms.
        Cream makers of Chinese yam, known to add progesterone, may
        cause adverse health concerns, including headache, breast
        tenderness, constipation, upset stomach, tiredness, and
        irritability. 10 </p>
      <p>In India, Neem Oil (extracted from Azadiracta Indica Juss tree
        16) popular birth control choice for men and women. Besides the
        bark and roots of the tree offer many medicinal properties.
        Women use neem oil in vaginal creams and suppositories (Also
        available single injection of neem oil, producing up to 12
        months block fertility. No apparent change in menstrual cycle or
        ovarian function.), and men ingest Neem leaf tablets for one
        month, effective antifertility. However, herb doe not effect
        sperm production or sex drive. Also, potency of the herb causes
        infertility, reversible after discontinuation. According to
        studies, vaginal cream killed sperms in the vagina within thirty
        seconds, and effective for up to five hours. Also, effectively
        prevents vaginal and sexually transmitted diseases.12 In India
        the Hyderabad - based National Research Development Corporation
        (NRDC), developed two types of Neem oil vaginal
        contraceptives.16 According to a research study conducted in
        India, twenty Indian married army men, took the oral dose of
        Neem oil, prevented pregnancy in each of their wives. ("The
        effect took 6 weeks to become 100% effective"). After
        discontinuing taking the capsules, within six weeks, reversed
        the effects of the herb contraceptive. 13 Neem oil vaginal cream
        not available in the United States. The Food and Drug
        Administration has not processed the contraceptive cream for
        safety and efficacy. 14 Also, Neem oil ingredient processed in
        India, formulate to make cosmetics (body hygiene creams, hand
        creams, soap, and hair products) and when diluted (water) used
        as a bio -- pesticide. 15 </p>
      <p>Smartweed (Polygonum hydropiper) an herb plant produces flowers
        from July to September. It grows in light, medium and heavy
        soils containing neutral and basic alkaline soils. Also, herb
        requires wet soil and can grow in water. Smartweeds known by
        many herbalists to treat bleeding, skin problems, diarrhea, and
        other ailments. According to Chinese tests, a survey of 250
        potential antifertility drugs, Smartwood ranked twentieth. 17
        Susan Weed writes in her published book: 'The Child Bearing
        Year' (paperback) -- how Smartweed terminates pregnancies or
        prevents fertilization during intercourse. Also, women ingesting
        the formulated prepared Smartweed leaves known to induce a
        missed period. 11 </p>
      <p>Pregnant women should be cautious taking or ingesting an herb
        supplement unaware of the potential side effects may interfere
        with a pregnancy. According to John M. Riddle (Written book:
        Contraception and Abortion in the West - paperback) told a true
        story regarding his wife's miscarriage. Later, the couple
        learned the mint flavored herb pennyroyal (plant) they added to
        their tea, drank nearly every day, unknown to them is an
        abortifacient. 18 </p>
