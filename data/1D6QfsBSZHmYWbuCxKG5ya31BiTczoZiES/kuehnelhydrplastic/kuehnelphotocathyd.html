developing way of using waste plastic to create car fuel</big><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">How unwanted plastic could help keep
us motoring in the future</span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Swansea University</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
</div>
<br>
Discarded plastic could be used to fuel cars in the future thanks to a
ground-breaking process developed by scientists from Swansea
University. They have been able to transform unwanted plastic into
hydrogen which in turn could be used to run cars.<br>
<br>
Dr Moritz Kuehnel, of the University's chemistry department, told the
BBC how light-absorbing material are added to the plastic, before it is
placed in an alkaline solution and then exposed to sunlight, which
creates hydrogen.<br>
<br>
He said this process could be cheaper than recycling because any kind
of plastic can be used and it does not need to be cleaned first.<br>
<br>
"There's a lot of plastic used every year - billions of tonnes - and
only a fraction of it is being recycled. We are trying to find a use
for what is not being recycled," he said.<br>
<br>
Most plastic bottles are made from PET [polyethylene terephthalate]
which can be recycled but often end up being burned or thrown into
landfill.<br>
<br>
Dr Kuehnel said: "But even if you do recycle it, it needs to be very
pure - so only PET, nothing else mixed in with it... and it has to be
clean, no grease, no oil.<br>
<br>
"Potentially you need to wash it which is very expensive, and even if
you do all of that, the plastic you get isn't always as nice as virgin
material."<br>
<br>
He added: "The beauty of this process is that it's not very picky. It
can degrade all sorts of waste.<br>
<br>
"Even if there is food or a bit of grease from a margarine tub, it
doesn't stop the reaction, it makes it better.<br>
<br>
"The process produces hydrogen gas. You can see bubbles coming off the
surface. You can use it, for example, to fuel a hydrogen car."<br>
<br>
However, he warned that rolling out the project on an industrial level
may still be years away.<br>
<br>
Dr Kuehnel added that the work, funded by the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council and an Austrian petrochemical company, had
also shown how the remains of the plastic could be recycled to make new
plastic.<br>
<br>
Just one part of PET is used to produce the hydrogen and carbon dioxide
- the other part stays intact and remains in the solution.<br>
<br>
He said: "We get the hydrogen fuel and we get a chemical we can use to
make new plastic.<br>
<br>
"We don't make a full new plastic, we use just half of the material to
make new plastic and the rest can be recycled - a clean, clear water
bottle out of plastic." <br>

Abstract</span><br>
Solar-driven reforming of plastics offers a simple and low-energy means
to turn waste into H2. Here, we report the efficient photoreforming of
three commonly produced polymers &#8211; polylactic acid, polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane &#8211; using inexpensive CdS/CdOx
quantum dots in alkaline aqueous solution. This process operates under
ambient temperature and pressure, generates pure H2 and converts the
waste polymer into organic products such as formate, acetate and
pyruvate. We further validate the real-world applicability of the
system by converting a PET water bottle into H2. This is the first
demonstration of visible light-driven, noble metal-free photoreforming
of plastic.<br>

The present invention provides a method of producing hydrogen, the
method comprising the step of exposing a photocatalyst to visible
and/or ultraviolet light in the presence of an organic substrate,
wherein the photocatalyst has a semiconductor core having an oxide-
and/or hydroxide-functionalised surface, thereby to generate hydrogen
from the organic substrate, and the hydrogen is optionally collected.
The photocatalyst semiconductor core may be CdS having oxide- and/or
hydroxide-functionality at its surface (CdS|CdOx). The organic
substrate typically contains a component having a molecular weight of
50 or more, such as 500 or more.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Field of the Invention</span><br>
<br>
The present invention provides a photocatalyst and the use of the
photocatalyst in photocatalytic methods for degrading an organic
substrate, such as biomass or an organic polymer. Also provided is the
use of the photocatalyst in photocatalytic methods for generating
hydrogen.<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br>
<br>
As of 2016 the global consumption of fossil-derived oil has reached 1
,100 barrels (10&lt;5&gt;litres) per second and continues to climb
annually. Low-cost fuel cannot be produced at this rate indefinitely,
and securing and combusting crude oil is causing irreversible
environmental damage.<br>
<br>
Investigations into sustainable alternatives have consequently
identified H2as a promising energy carrier, which can be used directly
in an emission-free fuel cell, or as a hydrogenating agent in the
synthesis of renewable liquid fuel. To date however, isH a2lmost
exclusively attained through reforming/gasification of fossil-derived
coal, gas or oil. It is also possible to produce H2by electrolysis.
However, such methods are not regarded as renewable where the
electrical power is ultimately sourced from coal, gas or oil. Biomass
conversion is one of the most affordable routes to generate sustainable
H2, but this process requires the demanding chemical transformation of
lignocellulose. Lignocellulose is the main constituent of biomass and
can be cultivated worldwide, even on unfertilised, marginal land.
Lignocellulose conversion to H2has predominantly been realised through
gasification, which uses high temperatures (&gt; 750&deg;C) to
decompose its organic structure and release H2, alongside other gases,
such as CO, CO2 and CH4.<br>
<br>
In the interest of increasing the selectivity and efficiency of this
conversion, it is possible to replace the thermal input with sunlight.
Solar light offers an essentially inexhaustible source of globally
available energy and therefore the photoreforming of biomass-derived
compounds is a fast growing field of research. A particular attraction
of photoreforming is the ability to perform the reforming reaction at
ambient temperature. Photoreforming requires a photocatalyst able to
oxidise lignocellulose and use the resultant electrons to undertake the
two-electron reduction of aqueous protons to H2. Lignocellulose adopts
the role of a hole scavenger, replacing the expensive sacrificial
electron donors commonly used when studying photocatalytic proton
reduction. Thus far, this field has focused on H2evolution from
substrates that could be derived from lignocellulose, such as methanol,
glycerol or glucose, however lignocellulose refining is expensive and
inefficient, usually requiring acid hydrolysis, enzymatic hydrolysis or
pyrolysis to produce more manageable substrates. These processes are
followed by hydrogenation or fermentation depending on the desired
product. Viable H2 production systems must therefore reform
lignocellulose directly to compete with thermochemical processes. This
is a considerable challenge at ambient temperatures, as the structure
of lignocellulose has evolved to prevent its consumption by microbial
and animal life. Lignocellulose is mainly comprised of cellulose (&gt;
40% in wood stems), a crystalline polysaccharide of anhydroglucose
monomers.<br>
<br>
Cellulose is surrounded by branched polysaccharides, called
hemicelluloses (20-40%), which are heteropolymers of pentose and hexose
sugars. The two cellulosic polymers are further encased in the
cross-linked phenolic polymer, lignin (&lt; 35%), and the combined
structures form microfibrils that are resistant to chemical
transformation. Examples of the direct photoreformation of
lignocellulose or even purified cellulose to H2are consequently rare
and until now have exclusively required a UV-light absorbing T1O2
architecture loaded with expensive, non-scalable noble-metal catalysts,
such as Pt and RUO2. Li et al. report the direct catalytic conversion
of raw woody biomass into two groups of chemicals over a carbon
supported Ni-W2C catalyst (see Energy Environ. Sci. 2012, 5, 6383). The
carbohydrate fraction in the woody biomass, principally cellulose and
hemicellulose, was converted to ethylene glycol and other diols with a
total yield of up to 75.6% (based on the amount of cellulose and
hemicellulose), while the lignin component was converted selectively
into monophenols with a yield of 46.5% (based on lignin).<br>
<br>
Matson et al. describe the quantitative catalytic conversion of wood
and cellulosic solids to liquid and gaseous products (J. Am. Chem. Soc.
2011 , 133, 14090). A single stage reactor is used, operating at
300-320&deg;C and 160-220 bar. Little or no char is formed during this
process. The reaction medium is supercritical methanol (sc-MeOH) and
the catalyst, a copper-doped porous metal oxide, is composed of
earth-abundant materials. The major liquid product is a mixture of
C2-C6 aliphatic alcohols and methylated derivatives of these alcohols,
and these products are, in principle, suitable for applications as
liquid fuels.<br>
<br>
Photocatalysts have also been used to treat refined (or processed)
biomass substrates. These methods are not necessarily desirable, as the
biomass must be pre-treated to provide the refined material. However,
these methods may be suitable under some circumstances, for example
where the pre-treatment (refining) process is not costly or time
consuming.<br>
<br>
Xia et al. describe the direct hydrodeoxygenation of raw woody biomass
into liquid alkanes with mass yields up to 28.1 wt % using a
multifunctional Pt/NbOP04catalyst in cyclohexane (see Nat. Commun.
2016, 7, 11 162). The reactions were conducted at 190&deg;C and 5 MPa
H2for 20 h and a total mass yield of liquid alkanes of greater than 20
wt % was achieved for all woods, among which birch wood gave the
highest mass yield of 28.1 wt %. This method requires, however,
hydrogen to be consumed in the degradation reaction.<br>
<br>
Zhang et al. describe the photocatalytic conversion of cellulose to
sugars and carbon dioxide with simultaneous production of hydrogen
under UV or solar light irradiation (see Chem. Commun. 2016, 52, 1673).
Here, degradation of the cellulose was achieved with immobilisation of
the cellulose onto a platinised T1O2 photocatalyst (P25, BET surface
area B50 m&lt;2&gt;g-&lt;1&gt;, particle size B20-30 nm, loading of 0.5
wt % platinum for H2 production).<br>
<br>
Kawai et al. (Nature) have reported the reaction of aqueous mixtures of
carbohydrates, including cellulose, in the presence of a RuO2/TiO2/Pt
photocatalyst powder with irradiation from a 500 W Xe lamp (Nature
1980, 286, 474). The evolution of hydrogen was observed.<br>
<br>
Kawai et al. (Chemistry Lett.) have also described photocatalytic
production of hydrogen from water and synthetic and natural organic
molecules (Chemistry Lett. 1981 , 10, 81). The authors use a platinized
T1O2 photocatalyst to photoreform PVC, gelatine and turf, amongst
others, under incident light generated from a Xe lamp.<br>
<br>
Speltini et al. have described the evolution of hydrogen during the
degradation of cellulose in an aqueous suspension together with Pt/TiO2
under irradiation at 366 nm (UV-A) or under natural light (Photochem.
Photobiol. Sci. 2014, 13, 1410). The present inventors have identified
an alternative class of photocatalysts having use in methods of
degrading biomass, and also more generally in methods of degrading
organic substrates.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The present inventors have identified a particular class of catalysts
that have useful reduction and oxidation properties when exposed to
visible light, such as sunlight, or simulated visible light. These
photocatalysts may be reliably used in photocatalytic methods for
degrading organic substrates, such as biomass, and photocatalytic
methods for producing hydrogen. The catalyst is therefore a
photocatalyst. The photocatalyst of the invention is typically a
particle, and the photocatalyst has a surface that is oxygen
functionalised (which may be referred to as passivated), such as
hydroxide- or oxide-functionalised. Exemplified in the present case is
an oxygenated CdS photocatalyst (which may be referred to as CdS|CdOx).
A photocatalyst may be obtained or is obtainable by treatment of a
semiconductor with aqueous base, for example.<br>
<br>
The photocatalysts of the invention have excellent catalytic activity
in methods for degrading biomass, such as those biomasses having a high
cellulose content, and this degradation may be accomplished at ambient
temperatures and pressures using natural light or simulated natural
light. Thus, the photocatalyst may be used to degrade tree material,
such as branches, as well as processed biomass products such as paper
and cardboard, which may be obtained as waste materials.
Advantageously, the photocatalyst is also capable of catalysing the
degradation of lignin, which is also a component of many biomasses.
Further, the photocatalyst may also be used to degrade semi-refined
biomass, for example the photocatalyst may be used to degrade cellulose
extracted from a biomass. Here, degradation may refer to oxidative
degradation or depolymerisation degradation.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention may be used in a photocatalytic
method for the generation of hydrogen, for example from biomass. Thus,
the photocatalyst is therefore capable of producing a useful fuel from
abundant raw and waste biomasses. The methods of the invention may also
allow hydrogen to be produced that is substantially free of carbon
dioxide. The photocatalyst of the invention is active under incident
visible light, and may be used for sustained periods, for example for
more than two days, without appreciable loss in activity. The
photocatalyst may also be regenerated with ease, for example by simple
changes to the pH of a catalyst mixture. The rate of substrate
degradation, such as biomass degradation, is remarkably high, and the
hydrogen evolution that is observed is comparable to that observed for
catalysts using purified monosaccharides. However, the photocatalyst of
the invention has a significant advantage in that no substrate
processing is required in order to obtain the hydrogen product.<br>
<br>
A photocatalyst may be used to generate hydrogen without photocorrosion
and without the need to use noble metal co-catalysts.<br>
<br>
In a general aspect there is provided a photocatalyst and the use of
the photocatalyst to degrade organic materials and/or to generate
hydrogen. The photocatalyst has a semiconductor core with a hydroxide-
and/or oxide-functionalised surface, which may be referred to as an
oxygenated surface. Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention
there is provided a method for degrading an organic substrate, the
method comprising the step of exposing a photocatalyst of the invention
to visible and/or ultraviolet light in the presence of the organic
substrate. The degradation of the organic substrate may produce
hydrogen, and the hydrogen is optionally collected.<br>
<br>
In a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method for
producing hydrogen, the method comprising the step of exposing a
photocatalyst of the invention to visible and/or ultraviolet light in
the presence of the organic substrate. The method may also comprise the
step of collecting the hydrogen. Carbon dioxide or an organic compound,
such as a carboxylic acid, is optionally produced in this method.<br>
<br>
In the methods of the invention, the photocatalyst and the organic
substrate may be provided as an aqueous mixture, and typically a basic
aqueous mixture. The aqueous mixture may have a pH of at least pH 10,
such as at least pH 11 , such as at least pH 12. Where carbon dioxide
is produced, it may be provided as carbonate in the aqueous mixture.
Any hydrogen that evolves in the methods of the invention is therefore
substantially free of carbon dioxide. The organic substrate may be or
comprise a hydroxyl-functionalised compound, such as a
hydroxyl-functionalised compound having a molecular weight of 50 or
more, such as 500 or more. The organic substrate may be or comprise a
polyol.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be or comprise an oligosaccharide or a
polysaccharide, such as cellulose, and preferably the organic substrate
may be or comprise a polysaccharide.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be a biomass, such as wood, paper, cardboard
or grass. The organic substrate may contain cellulose and lignin.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be selected from the group consisting of
general waste, plastics, packing materials, waste food, aliphatic
polyols, algae, sugars, starches, biomass, sewage and/or domestic waste.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be mechanically processed, such as chopped
(including chipped), prior to use in the methods of the invention.
However, in the preferred method of the invention no mechanical
processing is required, and the organic substrate may be used directly.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be pre-treated, for example with an aqueous
base, to at least partially degrade the organic substrate and/or to
improve the aqueous solubility of the organic substrate. Such a
pre-treatment is associated with an increased hydrogen evolution rate
in the subsequent photocatalytic reaction. Additionally or
alternatively, the organic substrate may be an organic polymer, such as
a polymer having hydroxyl, ester, amide, ether, carbonate, and/or
urethane functionality, either in the backbone chain or a side chain.
The organic polymer may be selected from polyester, substituted
polyethylene, polyether, polycarbonate, and polyurethane.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be a polymer selected from the group
consisting of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(lactic acid)
(PLA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).
Additionally or alternatively, the organic substrate may be selected
from the group consisting of polyurethane (PUR), a polypeptide and a
polysaccharide. Optionally the polymer may be further selected from low
density polyethylene (LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), poly(methyl
methacrylate), polystyrene (PS) and polycarbonate. Here, the polymers
may require pre-treatment, such as with aqueous base, prior to the
photocatalytic reaction.<br>
<br>
The organic polymer may have a molecular weight of 500 or more, such as
1 ,000 or more, such as 5,000 or more.<br>
<br>
The incident light may be ultraviolet light, such as light having a
wavelength in the range from 100 to less than 400 nm, and it may be
visible light, such as natural light (such as sunlight), such as light
having a wavelength in the range from 400 to 700 nm, or a combination
of visible and ultraviolet light, such as natural light (such as
sunlight, which has visible and UV components). The incident light may
be a combination of natural and non-natural light.<br>
<br>
The intensity of the light may be in the range 1 to 150 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;,
such as 10 to 150 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 50 to 150 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;,
such as 90 to 150 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 130 to 145 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;.
The light intensity may be around 100 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a
photocatalyst, which may be used in the methods of the invention. The

an anaerobic atmosphere. The mixtures were filtered before the
measurement to remove CdS|CdOx; (b) the change in absorbance at 300 nm
over time (days) for the mixtures in (a) with and without CdS|CdOx; and
(c) the change in absorbance at 350 nm over time (days) for the
mixtures in (a) with and without CdS|CdOx. The absorbances in (b) and

<br>
Figure 17 shows (a) the photoluminescence emission spectra (bandwidth 2
nm) at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) for 10 mM
terephthalic acid solution (2 mL) with CdS (0.5 &#956;&#924;) at various pH
(adjusted by adding 0 to 5 M KOH) after 18 hours of irradiation (AM
1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;, &#955; &gt; 420 nm). The background spectrum of
10 mM terephthalic acid was taken at pH 5.2 after 18 hours of
irradiation without CdS. The emission at 420-430 nm arises from
2-hydroxyterephthalic acid; and (b) selected spectra from (a) relative
to 1 mM 2-hydroxyterephthalic (2 &#956;&#951;&#953;&#959;&#921;) at various pH values (pH 5.2,
12.9 and 13.9). Figure 18 is a series of photoluminescence emission
spectra (bandwidth 2 nm) at an excitation wavelength of 315 nm
(bandwidth 2 nm) of a 10 mM terephthalic acid solution (2 mL) before
and after exposure to OH through the photolysis of 0.5 mM H2O2 where
the spectra show the recorded intensity for reactions conducted in (a)
1 mM KOH (pH 5.2); (b) 0.1 M KOH (pH 12.9); and (c) 5 M KOH (pH 14.7).
Photolysis was induced during each measurement by the excitation beam.
A 100% photolysis yield would generate a maximum of 2 &#956;&#951;&#953;&#959;&#921; of &#908;&#919;, but
the actual yield will be much lower than this value. A peak from
2-hydroxyterephthalic at 430 nm arises after addition of H2O2 in all
cases. This does not differ significantly from the background of
terephthalic acid (410 nm) as only minimal amounts of the
2-hydroxyterephthalic are present, but the peak is clearly
distinguishable. These controls confirm that even minimal &#908;&#919; formation
is detectable by the probe. Figure 19 is (a) a TEM image of an
a-cellulose film obtained from a mixture of a-cellulose (50 mg/mL) with
CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;) in 10 M KOH (2 ml_) after 18 hours of photocatalysis
(AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;) under an anaerobic atmosphere; and (b) a

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description of the Invention </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The present inventors have found that a particular class of
photocatalysts may be used to degrade organic substrates under visible
light, such as to provide hydrogen and optionally other products,
including carbon dioxide, such as in the form of a carbonate.<br>
<br>
Generally, a photocatalyst of the invention comprises a semiconductor
core, such as a metal- or metal-containing core, which may be a mixed
metal-containing core, the outer surface of which is oxygenated
(passivated), and more specifically may have metal hydroxide and/or
metal oxide functionality. The photocatalyst may be prepared from a
metal-containing substrate by oxygenation (passivation) of the metal
surface. The photocatalyst may be regarded as having an at least
partial oxide and/or hydroxide coating. Typically the core consists
essentially of a metal sulfide or a metal selenide.<br>
<br>
The oxygenation of the surface alters the catalytic activity of the
material, such as to provide or improve the photocatalytic activity.
The worked examples in the present case show that incorporating oxide-
and hydroxide-functionality into CdS surfaces provides an oxygenated
material, referred to herein as CdS|CdOx, having excellent
photocatalytic activity against a broad range of organic substrates,
including unreformed biomass.<br>
<br>
The passivation of metal sulfides has previously been described, though
these materials are not shown to be useful for the treatment of biomass.<br>
<br>
For example, Kalisman et al. (Nano Lett. 2016, 16, 1776) have described
the preparation of nanoparticle photocatalysts having CdSe embedded
within CdS, with a Pt-reduction catalyst located on a tip of the
material. The photocatalyst is used at high pH, and this is observed to
shift the valance band of the CdS material. The use of the
photocatalyst at high pH exponentially increases the catalytic
activity. The photocatalyst is used to generate hydrogen, with
isopropyl alcohol provided as an electron donor in the reaction
mixture. Simon et al. (Nat. Mater. 2014, 13, 1013) described the use of
cadmium sulfide nanorods that are decorated with Ni nanoparticles. The
nanorods were dispersed into basic hydroxide solutions of varying pH
together with ethanol. The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen from
the resulting mixture was seen to increase significantly with increases
in pH.<br>
<br>
Petrov et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B 2002, 106, 5325) describe the
preparation of CdS nanocrystals which optionally contain Zn. The CdS
surfaces of the nanocrystals were passivated by treatment with aqueous
base. The use of the nanocrystals as a photocatalyst is not described.<br>
<br>
CN 102181283 describes the preparation of nanowires from CdS/CdO
nanocrystals, which is treated in order to generate hydroxyl
functionality. This document does not apparently describe the use of
the photocatalyst for degrading organic substrates or for generating
hydrogen.<br>
<br>
Anku et al. describe the use of a ZnS/ZnO composite as a photocatalyst.
However,<br>
<br>
Anku et al. use such materials doped with Ni. The photocatalyst of the
present invention typically does not include materials that are doped
with metals such as Ni. Anku et al. do describe the use of the ZnS/ZnO
composite to catalyse the degradation of an organic dye under visible
light. There is no mention by Anku et al. that the photocatalyst could
be used to degrade biomass, or that they could be used specifically to
generate hydrogen.<br>
<br>
Emin et al. describe the preparation of ZnS microspheres that are
subsequently heat treated to give ZnO microspheres. Intermediate mixed
products, of the type ZnS/ZnO, were also formed and studied. These
materials are shown to have use as photocatalysts for the degradation
of an organic dye under incident UV light. Emin et al. do not suggest
that the catalysts could or would be useful for generating hydrogen,
nor for degrading biomass.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photocatalyst</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention is a material, which may be in the
form of a particle, having an oxygenated surface. Typically the
material is a semiconductor material, and the properties of the
semiconductor are modified by the oxygenation of that surface, which
introduces oxide and/or hydroxide functionality to the surface. The
treatment of the semiconductor material (or precursor material) may
have the effect of altering the surface charge of the material, such as
to increase the negative surface charge.<br>
<br>
The oxygenation of the surface may result in other changes. For
example, the electron binding energy of the precursor material at the
surface of the material (for example, as measured by XPS) may change.
Here, the electron binding energy may refer to that of a metal, such as
Cd, that is present within the material, and is present within the
surface layer, for example present within 10 nm of the surface.
Typically, the oxygenation of the surface may be associated with a
reduction in the binding energy for the metal. This is observed in the
present case where the electron binding energies for Cd decrease with
oxygenation. Spectral characterisation of the material may show
evidence for oxygenated metal on the surface, for example through its
identification using Raman spectroscopy. In the worked examples of the
present case the oxygenation of CdS is seen to result in a product
having CdO bonds. Also observed on oxygenation of the surface is an
alteration in the photoluminescent properties of the semiconductor,
particularly within the visible range, with the development of
emissions within this range.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention is typically a particle, such as a
nanoparticle. Thus, the average largest dimension, such as the
diameter, of the photocatalyst may be at most 7, at most 10, at most
25, at most 50, at most 100, or at most 250 nm.<br>
<br>
The average largest dimension, such as the diameter, of the
photocatalyst may be at least 0.1 , at least 0.5, at least 1 , or at
least 5 nm.<br>
<br>
The average largest dimension, such as the diameter, of the
photocatalyst may be within a range with the upper and lower limits
selected from the values given above. For example, the average largest
dimension, such as the diameter, of the photocatalyst may be in the
range 1 to 100 nm.<br>
<br>
The particle size may be about 4 nm or about 5 nm. The size of a
particle may be determined by, for example, measurements taken from the
transmission electron microscopy imagery of the particle or
measurements based on the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the
particle. Such measurements are described in the worked examples.
Particle size may also be determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS).
The photocatalyst particle may have a low size distribution. For
example, the standard deviation may be at most 0.5%, at most 1 %, at
most 2%, at most 3%, at most 4%, at most 5%, at most 10%, at most 15%,
at most 20%, or at most 25%.<br>
<br>
The worked examples in the present case show that a photocatalyst of
the invention may be prepared from a precursor material, such as CdS,
having a low size distribution (such as a distribution with the limits
set out above), resulting in a photocatalyst product having a
substantially unaltered size distribution. Thus, the methods of
preparation are not associated with a significant loss of homogeneity
in the material. The inventors have found that the size of the
particles may be altered very slightly by the passivation treatments
described herein. However, the change in size, which is typically a
reduction in size, is very small and is uniform cross the population.
Consequently the homogeneity in the sample is retained.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst has a negatively charged surface, which is formed by
the oxygenation, of the surface of the precursor material.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst has an oxygenated surface that may be generated under
basic conditions. The surface may contain metal hydroxide and/or metal
oxide functionality, and the recorded zeta potential is negative. The
inventors have found that the zeta potential of the photocatalyst of
the invention is relatively large (that is, large and negative).
Increasing the surface metal hydroxide and/or metal oxide content
increases the magnitude of the zeta potential.<br>
<br>
In the worked examples of the present case a significant increase in
the zeta potential is observed during the treatment of CdS particles
with strong aqueous base. Where the basic aqueous mixture has a pH of
11 or more, there is a significant alteration in the zeta potential,
which becomes considerably more negative at higher pH values.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be regarded as having a surface that is
oxygenated (passivated). As noted above, the surface may contain
hydroxide and/or oxide groups, such as metal hydroxide and/or metal
oxide groups. The hydroxide and/or oxide functionality may be present
across at least part of the available surface area, and it may be
present across the entire surface. The oxygenated surface need not, and
typically does not, extend far into the bulk of the metal substrate.
The oxide and/or hydroxide functionality may be a thin layer, perhaps a
few atoms only, that is provided at the surface of the photocatalyst.
In one embodiment, the oxygenated surface is not more than 10 nm deep,
and may be no more than 5 nm deep, such as no more than 1 nm deep.<br>
<br>
The extent of the oxygenated surface may be determined in part from XPS
analysis of the photocatalyst. Here, the presence of the oxygenated
surface may be seen from the change in the electron binding energies
observable in the XPS spectrum. The presence of a relatively thin
oxygenated surface layer may be inferred from the presence of binding
energy peaks associated with the core, bulk material, such as the
metal. Such signals are observable only when the oxygenated surface
layer is thin, as XPS experiments can generally only provide
information regarding the uppermost (such as within 1 to 10 nm) surface
of the tested material. Direct study of the oxygen environment by XPS
(for example 0 1s) may be difficult: the inventors have found that the
use of hydroxide base as the oxide source generates residual hydroxide
at the sample surface, and this residual hydroxide dominates the
signal. Whilst the XPS analysis may focus on the metal environment of
the photocatalyst, other environments may be analysed, where such are
present. For example, many photocatalysts of the invention have a core
that contains both metal and sulfur as a metal sulfide, and the sulfur
environment at the surface may be considered.<br>
<br>
Raman spectroscopy may also be used to analyse the surface of a
photocatalyst.<br>
<br>
Vibrational bands that are associated with oxide- and/or
hydroxide-functionality, such as metal oxide and/or metal hydroxide, at
the surface of the photocatalyst may be visible in the Raman spectrum.<br>
<br>
In the worked examples of the present case, a photocatalyst having a
CdS core and an oxygenated surface is prepared and used to degrade
cellulose and cellulose-containing biomass. Here, the oxygenated
surface comprises Cd-OH and/or Cd-0 (which may be Cd-0-) functionality
(metal hydroxide and metal oxide functionality respectively). Raman
measurements of the photocatalyst give rise to vibrational bands
associated with Cd-0 (for example in comparison to a reference spectrum
of CdO (bulk)).<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may comprise a material that is selected from the
group consisting of CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, ZnSe, ZnTe, PbS, PbSe, PbTe,
CulGaS, Cd(i-x)Zn(x)S(i-y)Se(y),<br>
<br>
CuGa3S5, ZnO(i-x)S(X), FeS2, SiC, CuO, SnS2, SnSe and carbon
nanoparticles. The surface of these materials is oxygenated. Here, the
material may be regarded as core material, with a coating that is the
oxygenated surface. The oxygenated surface may comprise hydroxide and
oxide functionality bonded with the metal or other atoms at the
surface. Thus, the surface may have metal hydroxide and/or metal oxide
groups. Where S and Se is present within the material, these may be
displaced by O at the surface.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may have an oxygenated surface containing a material
that is selected from the group consisting of ZnO, T1O2, AI2O3, and
SnC&gt;2, and combinations thereof. These materials may be provided
onto a core material, such as a semiconductor, in the form of a
precursor material that is subsequently oxygenated to give the ZnO,
T1O2, AI2O3, and Sn02 forms, for example. For example, ZnO may be
obtained from ZnS and T1O2 may be obtained from TiCI4. The
photocatalyst of the invention may be substantially free of additional
metals, such as Pt, Zn and Ni. The beneficial photocatalytic effects
may be achieved without the need for the addition of such metals.
However, additional metals, such as Pt, Zn, Co and Ni, may be present
to enhance the photocatalytic effect. Thus, in one embodiment, the
photocatalyst of the invention, such as a CdS-based photocatalyst, is
doped with such metals.<br>
<br>
Other metals may be use in place of Cd, in alternative sulfur-based
systems. For example, the photocatalyst may be based on CdS, ZnS, PbS,
or FeS2. Mixed-metal sulfur-based systems may also be used, for example
the photocatalyst may be based on CulnGaS, CuGasSs or ZnO(i-X)S(X),
where x is typically in the range 0 to 1.<br>
<br>
Sulfur may be replaced with selenium in the photocatalyst, or the
photocatalyst may contain a mixture of both sulfur and selenium. For
example the photocatalyst may be based on CdSe, ZnSe, or PbSe, or
combinations thereof.<br>
<br>
Mixed metal sulfides and selenides may be used. For example,
Cd(i-X)Zn(x)S(i-y)Se(y) may be used, where x is typically in the range
0 to 1 and y is in the range 0 to 1 , such as where x is 0.5, and such
where y is 0.5.<br>
<br>
As an alternative to the systems described above, which are based on
metal sulfides and/or metal selenides, a mixed metal material may be
used as the photocatalyst core. For example, the photocatalyst may be
based on CdTe, ZnTe, or PbTe, or combinations thereof.<br>
<br>
As a further alternative, non-metal-based materials may also be used,
including in particular SiC and carbon nanoparticles (also known as
carbon quantum dots). Additionally or alternatively, the
non-metal-based material may be selected from carbon nitride and
silicon nanoparticles.<br>
<br>
In each case, the photocatalyst has a core of one or more of the
materials described above, the surface of which is passivated, or
oxygenated. In a preferred embodiment, the core of the material
consists essentially of a material as described above. Thus, additional
components, such as additional metals, are preferably not present.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention may be prepared directly from the
base material by treating the surface of that material, such as
oxygenating the surface thereby to provide the oxygen functionality.
The surface is typically hydroxide- and/or oxide-functionalised. In one
embodiment the photocatalyst has a band gap of 3.0 eV or less, such as
2.7 eV or less, such as 2.5 eV or less. The band gap of the
photocatalyst may be determined by standard methods.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention has catalytic activity when exposed
to visible light. The photocatalyst is capable of catalysing the
degradation of cellulose under aqueous conditions under incident
visible light, for example to generate hydrogen, such as to generate
hydrogen at a rate of at least 0.1 , at least 0.5, at least 1.0, at
least 2.0 or at least 5 mmol gcar&lt;1&gt;h&lt;-1&gt;.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may not have a ligand bound to its surface. Ligands
may be present on the semiconductor material from which the
photocatalyst is prepared, but these are displaced in the oxygenation
of the material. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought
that the photocatalyst coating - the oxidation layer at the surface of
the semiconductor material - reduces photocorrosion and extends the
lifetime of the photocatalyst. The photocatalyst coating is preferably
equal to or less than 1 nm in thickness.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Basic Aqueous Mixture</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The photocatalyst is typically provided and used in a basic aqueous
mixture. The photocatalyst is suspended in the mixture.<br>
<br>
A basic aqueous reaction mixture may be used to form the oxygenated
surface on the photocatalyst, and retaining the product photocatalyst
in that basic aqueous mixture can maintain that oxygenated surface, for
example during the use of the photocatalyst in the methods of the
invention.<br>
<br>
The aqueous mixture is basic and the aqueous mixture may have a pH of
10 or more, such as 1 1 or more, such as 12 or more, such as 13 or
more, such as 14 or more.<br>
<br>
A high basicity (high pH) is associated with extensive oxide/hydroxide
formation, and a higher degradation rate in the degradation reaction
described herein, and a higher hydrogen evolution rate. The inventors
have found that the highest rates of degradation are generally achieved
when the pH of the aqueous mixture is pH 11 or more, and most
preferably pH 12 or more, such as pH 14 or more. The degradation and
evolution reactions may occur when the aqueous mixture is less basic
(lower pH), however the rate is significantly lower than the rates
achieved at higher pH values.<br>
<br>
The increase in pH is associated with an increase in the surface
passivation of the photocatalyst. The inventors have also found that
the increase in pH is associated with an increase (larger negative
value) in the Zeta potential of the photocatalyst. Unexpectedly, there
is a large increase (toward more negative values) in the Zeta potential
at around pH 11 , such as for a photocatalyst based on CdS. The changes
in Zeta potential here show a substantial increase in the negative
surface charge of the photocatalyst, and this is associated with a
substantial increase in the photocatalytic activity of the material.<br>
<br>
A reduction in the basicity of the aqueous mixture may be associated
with a reduction or loss of the oxygenated surface, therefore the pH of
the aqueous basic mixture may be maintained at a level sufficiently
high to maintain the oxygenated surface and therefore to maintain the
beneficial photocatalytic activity. The pH of the aqueous mixture may
be adjusted as required, such as the pH increased, for example by the
addition of further base to the aqueous mixture.<br>
<br>
In the methods of the invention, an organic substrate may be degraded
with the resulting production of a carbon dioxide product and/or an
organic product, such as a low molecular weight organic compound. Here,
where carbon dioxide is generated, the carbon dioxide product may be
dissolved into the aqueous mixture as carbonate. As such, the carbon
dioxide may be regarded as sequestered in the aqueous mixture. This may
result in a change in the pH of the aqueous mixture. Suitable
adjustment of the pH level may be required.<br>
<br>
In the worked examples of the present case the amount of carbon dioxide
generated in the degradation reaction (as carbonate) was not of a level
sufficient to significantly alter the pH of the basic aqueous mixture,
therefore it was not necessary to make any adjustments to the pH of the
basic aqueous mixture during the course of the degradation reaction.<br>
<br>
The use of high pH may also promote the dissolution of the organic
substrate, thereby promoting the interaction between the photocatalyst
and the substrate. This is shown in the worked examples, where high pH
solutions promote the dissolution of lignocellulose. As described
herein, a pre-treatment of the organic substrate with, for example,
aqueous base, may improve the dissolution of the organic substrate.<br>
<br>
A reduction in basicity may be used to deliberately remove the
oxygenated surface in a regeneration method. After removal of the
oxygenated surface, the photocatalyst may be regenerated by an increase
in basicity, which provides a new oxygenated surface. The
photocatalytic activity may be restored in this way.<br>
<br>
The basic solution contains the photocatalyst, which may be present at
a concentration selected for an appropriate rate of reaction for the
degradation reaction. The inventors have found that the photocatalyst
of the invention may be used at relatively low concentrations with a
sufficiently high rate of substrate degradation and a sufficiently high
rate of hydrogen evolution and/or carbon dioxide (which may be
carbonate generation) or organic product generation. The photocatalyst
may be used at relatively low concentrations and at relatively low
levels with respect to the organic substrate. At these concentrations
and levels the rate of organic substrate degradation and the rate of
hydrogen evolution and/or product generation, such as carbon dioxide
generation (for example as carbonate), is relatively high. Minimising
the amount of photocatalyst required in the methods of the invention
will clearly minimise the processing cost. The photocatalyst may be
present in the basic aqueous mixture at a concentration of at least
1.0, at least 5.0, at least 10, at least 50 or at least 100 nM. The
photocatalyst may be present in the basic aqueous mixture at a
concentration of at most 0.5, at most 1.0, at most 5.0, at most 10, at
most 50, at most 100, at most 500 at most 1 ,000 or at most 5,000 &#956;&#924;.
The photocatalyst may be present in the mixture at a concentration
within a range where the lower and upper limits are selected from the
values given above. For example, the photocatalyst may be present at a
concentration in the range 50 nM to 1.0 &#956;&#924;.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be present in the mixture at a concentration of
around 0.5 &#956;&#924;.<br>
<br>
For the values given above, concentration refers to nanomoles of
photocatalyst particles per litre.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be present in the basic aqueous mixture at a
concentration of at least 0.01 wt %, at least 0.05 wt %, or at least
0.1 wt % with respect to the total amount of organic substrate in the
basic aqueous mixture.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be present in the basic aqueous mixture at a
concentration of at most 0.5 wt %, at most 1.0 wt %, at most 5.0 wt %,
at most 10 wt %, or at most 20 wt % with respect to the total amount of
organic substrate in the basic aqueous mixture.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be present in the mixture at a concentration
within a range where the lower and upper limits are selected from the
values given above. For example, the photocatalyst may be present at a
concentration in the range 0.1 to 10 wt %, such as 0.1 to 1.0 wt %.<br>
<br>
The amount of photocatalyst present in the basic aqueous mixture may be
based on the amount of precursor material that is added to the basic
aqueous mixture during the method of preparation.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be used with organic substrates across a wide
concentration range. The organic substrate may be provided in the basic
aqueous mixture, together with the photocatalyst, at a concentration of
at most 50, 75, 100, 150, 200 or 500 mg/mL.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be provided in the basic aqueous mixture,
together with the photocatalyst, at a concentration of at least 1 , 5,
10, 15, 20 or 25 mg/mL.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be provided in the basic aqueous mixture at a
concentration in a range with upper and lower limits selected from the
values given above. For example, the organic substrate may be present
at a concentration in the range 15 to 100 mg/mL.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be provided in the basic aqueous mixture at a
concentration of around 50 mg/mL. The inventors have found that the use
of an organic substrate, such as cellulose, at this concentration
provides the highest catalytic activity, for example where a
CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst is used. When the photocatalyst and the organic
substrate are present together in the amounts given above, it is
possible to degrade the organic substrate under incident visible light,
and the degradation rate is sufficiently high as to allow for an
efficient degradation of the substrate. The degradation rate of the
organic substrate may be determined from the amount of hydrogen evolved
and/or carbon dioxide generated (for example as carbonate) from the
reaction mixture during the time course of the degradation reaction. In
the worked examples of the present case hydrogen evolution rates
determined from the degradation of biomass, such as wood, and
a-cellulose and hemicellulose is high. For example, the amount of
hydrogen evolved over time with respect to the amount of photocatalyst
may be 1 or more, 2 or more, or 5 or more mmol
gcat&lt;-1&gt;h&lt;-1&gt;, such as measured over a 24 h photocatalytic
reaction period, where the photocatalyst is used at 0.5 &#956;&#924;, and the
organic substrate is present at 50 mg/mL.<br>
<br>
The inventors have found that the quantum yield for the photocatalysts
of the invention is relatively high, at around 1.2 %, at 430 nm, which
is comparable to the reported efficiencies for the Pt/TiC&gt;2
photocatalyst. It is noted that higher quantum yields are known, but
these yields are reported for incident light having a wavelength less
than 400 nm, and therefore within the UV-range, and not the visible
range.<br>
<br>
The present photocatalysts achieve these efficiencies when used to
degrade a complex organic substrate, such as cellulose, under visible
light, whereas the Pt/TiC&gt;2 photocatalyst achieves the reported
efficiencies only when used under UV light.<br>
<br>
The pH of the basic aqueous mixture may be determined by standard
analytical techniques. Alternatively, the pH of the basic aqueous
mixture may be estimated from the amount of base present in (or added
to) the aqueous mixture.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use of the Photocatalyst</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The present invention provides for the use of the photocatalyst as
such, for example in the degradation of an organic substrate. The
degradation may also be referred to as reformation or reforming, and
more specifically as photoreformation or photoreforming.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for degrading an organic
substrate, the method comprising the step of exposing a photocatalyst
of the invention to visible and/or ultraviolet light in the presence of
the organic substrate. The photocatalyst and the organic substrate may
be provided in an aqueous mixture, and preferably a basic aqueous
mixture.<br>
<br>
Degradation may refer to a reduction in the molecular weight of the
organic substrate due, for example, to the oxidative cleavage of bonds
within the organic substrate. The degradation may be accompanied by the
formal loss of hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide from the organic
substrate. The methods of the invention also provide for the generation
of hydrogen and/or a product such as carbon dioxide (for example as
carbonate) or an organic product such as formic acid, the method
comprising the step of exposing a photocatalyst of the invention to
visible and/or ultraviolet light in the presence of the organic
substrate.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst and the organic substrate may both be provided in an
aqueous mixture. The aqueous mixture may be a basic aqueous mixture,
such as a mixture having a pH of 10 or more, such as 1 1 or more, such
as 12 or more, such as 13 or more, such as 14 or more. In the methods
for generating hydrogen, the source of hydrogen may be the organic
substrate, the basic aqueous mixture or both. The present inventors
have found from deuterium experiments that the predominant source of
hydrogen is water.<br>
<br>
In the methods for generating carbon dioxide (or carbonate) the source
of carbon is the organic substrate. Similarly, in the methods for
generating an organic product, the source of carbon is the organic
substrate.<br>
<br>
Carbon dioxide may be retained in the reaction mixture, such as the
aqueous reaction mixture, for example as the carbonate form. Where
carbon dioxide is produced together with hydrogen this ensures that the
hydrogen evolved from the mixture is substantially free of carbon
dioxide. The methods of the invention therefore provide the possibility
of preparing clean hydrogen.<br>
<br>
The organic product may be retained in the reaction mixture, such as
the aqueous reaction mixture, and the organic product may be in ionic
form. Example organic products produced in the methods of the invention
include formic acid, acetic acid, pyruvic acid, and terephthalic acid,
and the ionic, such as anionic, forms thereof.<br>
<br>
The method may include the subsequent step of collecting the hydrogen
and/or a product, such as carbon dioxide or the organic product.
Hydrogen may be removed from the headspace over the reaction mixture as
it is evolved. Carbon dioxide may be recovered from the basic aqueous
mixture, as its carbonate form or as gaseous form, after appropriate
processing of the basic aqueous mixture. The organic products may be
recovered by standard work-up and purification techniques. This may
include recovery of an aqueous solution of the organic product after
filtration to remove insoluble components of the reaction mixture.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst is active ("excited") under incident light in the
visible or ultraviolet range, and preferably the photocatalyst is used
under incident visible light. Here, visible light refers to light
having a wavelength in the range 400 to 700 nm, and ultraviolet light
refers to light having a wavelength in the range 100 to 400 nm, such as
315 to 400 nm. The incident light may be natural light, such as
sunlight. Natural light may include light in both the visible and
ultraviolet ranges.<br>
<br>
The incident light may be artificial light, such as provided by a solar
simulator, or light from a xenon or mercury lamp, or an LED. Examples
of simulated solar light include AM1.5D, AM1.5G and AMO.<br>
<br>
The incident light may be monochromatic.<br>
<br>
The incident light may be a combination of natural and artificial light.<br>
<br>
The methods of the present invention may be performed under light
having an intensity that is similar to that of natural light. Thus, in
the methods of the invention it is not necessary to expose the
photocatalyst to intense light.<br>
<br>
The intensity of the incident light may be at most 140, at most 150, at
most 160 or at most 200 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
The intensity of the incident light may be at least 1 , at least 10, at
least 20, at least 50, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, or at
least 100 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
The incident light maybe of an intensity within a range where the upper
and lower limits are selected from the values given above. For example,
the intensity of the incident light may be in the range 1 to 150
mW/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 10 to 150 mVV/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 50 to 150
mVV/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 90 to 150 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;, such as 130 to 145
mW/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
The light intensity may be around 100 mVV/cm&lt;2&gt;. In the worked
examples of the present case, artificial light of 100 mW/cm&lt;2&gt;is
used (AM 1.5G).<br>
<br>
The methods of the invention may be conducted at ambient temperatures,
for example at a temperature in the range 5 to 30&deg;C. Accordingly,
it is not necessary to apply heat to the reaction mixture in order to
promote the reaction. Photocatalytic reactions previously reported in
the art described heating the reaction mixture, and such is not
required in the methods of the present invention.<br>
<br>
However, if needed, the methods of the invention may be performed at an
elevated temperature, such as a temperature greater than 30&deg;C, and
for example at a temperature no more than 60&deg;C, such as no more
than 50&deg;C, such as no more than 40&deg;C.<br>
<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the organic substrate may be pre-heated
prior to its contact with the photocatalyst or prior to irradiation,
and preferably prior to its contact with the photocatalyst. Typically,
the organic substrate is provided in the basic aqueous mixture, for
example at a pH of at least 10, such as at least pH 1 1 , and the
mixture is heated to a temperature above room temperature, for example
a temperature greater than 30&deg;C. The mixture may be a heated to a
temperature that is no more than 100&deg;C, such as no more than
80&deg;C, such as no more than 60&deg;C, such as no more than 50&deg;C,
such as no more than 40&deg;C<br>
<br>
The heating of the mixture may be maintained during and after the
addition of the photocatalyst, and throughout the catalytic reaction.
Alternatively, the heating of the mixture may be discontinued during or
after the addition of the photocatalyst. Indeed, the mixture may be
allowed to cool, for example to a temperature in the range 5 to
30&deg;C, prior to the addition of the photocatalyst. The present
invention also provides the use of the photocatalyst in a method of
synthesising a carboxylic acid, the method comprising the step of
exposing a photocatalyst of the invention to visible and/or ultraviolet
light in the presence of an alcohol, thereby to generate a carboxylic
acid. The inventors have found that the photocatalyst may be used more
generally to generate organic products, such as carboxylic acids, from
organic substrates. The present invention therefore also provides the
use of the photocatalyst in a method of synthesising an organic
product, the method comprising the step of exposing a photocatalyst of
the invention to visible and/or ultraviolet light in the presence of an
organic substrate, thereby to generate an organic product, such as a
carboxylic acid. For example, the organic product may be selected from
the group consisting of formic acid, acetic acid, pyruvic acid,
terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol, glycolic acid, ethanol,
diaminotoluene, lactic acid. The method may also yield a combination of
organic products, including those listed. For example, the
photodegradation of polylactic acid is associated with the production
of lactic acid and pyruvic acid. The photodegradation of polyethylene
terephthalate terephthalic acid is associated with the production of
terephthalic acid (and its salts), ethylene glycol, glycolic acid,
acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol. The photodegradation of
polyurethane is associated with the production of diaminotoluene,
formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid and pyruvic acid.<br>
<br>
The methods of the invention may be performed as a batch process, or as
a flow process where the organic substrate is permitted to flow across
the photocatalyst, which may be immobilised to a support.<br>
<br>
After a degradation reaction is deemed complete the photocatalyst may
be recovered for future further use. Here, the photocatalyst may be
separated from remaining unreacted organic substrate and any reaction
intermediates, such as partially degraded organic substrate. If
appropriate, the recovered photocatalyst may be rejuvenated prior to
reuse, such as described in further detail below.<br>
<br>
The method of the invention may additionally comprise the step of
pre-treating the organic substrate prior to its use in a photocatalysed
hydrogen production method or degradation reaction. Such a treatment
may at least partially degrade the organic substrate as a preliminary
step. Additionally or alternatively, such a treatment may increase the
aqueous dissolution of the organic substrate prior to photocatalytic
degradation. The pre-treatment step may subsequently include the step
of separating insoluble materials from the pre-treatment mixture, such
as by filtration or centrifugation. The solubilised components may then
be used in the photocatalysed hydrogen production method or degradation
reaction.<br>
<br>
The pre-treatment step is a treatment to reduce the molecular weight,
such as weight or number average molecular weight, of the organic
substrate. The pre-treatment step may be the treatment of the organic
substrate with base, such as inorganic base. The base may be an aqueous
base.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the base used in the pre-treatment step is the same base
for use in the subsequent photocatalytic reaction, which base is used
to provide the photocatalyst and the organic substrate in an aqueous
mixture having a pH of 10 or more. Thus, the pre-treatment reaction
mixture may be used directly in the photocatalytic reaction after the
pre-treatment is deemed complete. Here, the pre-treatment reaction
mixture may be optionally separated to remove solids, and it may then
be mixed with the photocatalyst components. The base may be used in the
pre-treatment step at a concentration that is suitable for the later<br>
<br>
photocatalytic reaction. Preferably, the organic substrate is treated
with a basic aqueous mixture having a pH of 10 or more, such as a pH of
11 or more, such as a pH of 12 or more.<br>
<br>
Thus, most preferably the organic substrate is pre-treated with aqueous
NaOH or aqueous KOH, such as aqueous NaOH. The pre-treatment step may
include heating the organic substrate in the presence of the base. The
organic substrate may be heated to a temperature of at least 30&deg;C,
at least 40&deg;C or at least 50&deg;C. The organic substrate may be
heated to a temperature of at most 60&deg;C, at most 70&deg;C, at most
80&deg;C, or at most 90&deg;C.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be heated to a temperature of around 40&deg;C.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be treated with base for at least 1 hour, at
least 2 hours, at least 12 hours, or at least 24 hours. The organic
substrate may be treated with base for at most 26 hours, at most 48
hours, or at most 96 hours.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be treated with base for around 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Preferably, the mixture of the organic substrate with the base is
agitated, such as stirred, to promote any degradation of the organic
substrate.<br>
<br>
The at least partial degradation of the organic substrate, and the
treatment of the organic substrate with base, may result in a product
mixture having insoluble materials, and these materials may be
separated from solubilised components, for example by filtration or
centrifugation. The solubilised components may then be used in the
photocatalytic reaction. The inventors have found that pre-treatment of
the organic substrate may cause degradation of the polymer substrate,
and this degradation is associated with an increase in the amount of
material that is solubilised in the reaction mixture, which is
typically an aqueous basic mixture. This at least partial degradation
of the polymer is associated with an increase photoreforming rate, as
is seen from the collection of hydrogen over a set time period.<br>
<br>
Associated with an improvement in substrate solubility is an increase
in the reaction mixture transparency. An increased transparency allows
for great light penetration into the mixture, and thereby greater
exposure of the photocatalyst to the incident light. An increase in the
photoreforming rate is thereby provided.<br>
<br>
The pre-treatment step often produces insoluble material, and such may
be beneficially removed from dissolved organic substrate. Solid
materials are thereby prevented from contacting the photocatalyst, and
this means there is no contamination of unreacted material.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Organic Substrate</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The photocatalyst of the invention may be used to degrade, or reform,
an organic substrate, and preferably the degradation reaction yields
hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide. The methods of the invention may be
used to degrade waste material as part of the disposal process of that
material. Alternatively, the methods of the invention may be intended
for the generation of a fuel material, such as hydrogen, for downstream
use. Advantageously the methods of the invention may be used to dispose
of unwanted biomass and also to generate commercially relevant fuels or
commercially useful organic products, such as formic acid, acetic acid,
pyruvic acid, and terephthalic acid. The organic substrate typically
contains both hydrogen and carbon atoms, and most typically contains
multiple carbon-carbon and multiple carbon-hydrogen bonds. The
photocatalyst is most useful in the degradation of higher molecular
weight organic substrates, and is also most useful in the degradation
of hydroxyl functionalised organic substrates. The photocatalyst may
also be used to directly degrade biomass without any prior refining of
the biomass. Thus, the photocatalyst is suitable for use with
relatively simple organic materials as well as complex biomass
mixtures, which contain a wide variety of different chemical
structures, often with a wider distribution of molecular weights.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst has tolerance to a range of substrates, and such
tolerance has not previously been reported in the art. The ability to
use the photocatalyst with unrefined substrates therefore provides
flexibility for the process, which may be used anywhere where there is
a source of biomass materials, such as wood and grass. In contrast,
many of the degradation and hydrogen evolution reactions reported to
date rely on the use of refined substrates for use in the
photocatalytic reaction, and therefore the methods can only be
performed where there it the ability to refine biomass materials, or
where there is a ready commercial source of the refined material.<br>
<br>
The degradation of the organic substrate may yield hydrogen, which has
use as a commercial fuel and a chemical feedstock. Accordingly, the
degradation reaction allows for the valorisation of the organic
substrate. The ability to generate hydrogen from any organic substrate,
including wood and cardboard as well as refined cellulose and lignin,
is highly advantageous, as the methods of the invention are not limited
to locals where refined materials are available, which is a clear
limitation of the prior art methods. It is possible that other
degradation products are also produced, such as carbon dioxide. The
inventors have also found that the degradation of an organic substrate
may yield formic acid (or formate) as a product, which product also has
commercial value. The production of formic acid therefore provides an
additional or alternative pathway for creating value from the organic
substrate.<br>
<br>
The production of ethanol from cellulose has been described previously
as a route to preparing a fuel stock. However, in many cases
cellulose-derived ethanol requires purification of glucose from
lignocellulose, followed by the subsequent fermentation of that glucose
to yield ethanol. As noted above, the present invention allows for the
production of hydrogen or formic acid directly from any source of
unprocessed lignocellulose.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate typically has hydroxyl functionality. Without
wishing to be bound by theory, the present inventors believe that the
hydroxyl functionality of an organic substrate strongly interacts with
the surface of the photocatalyst, and more particularly the oxygenated
portions of the photocatalyst. This is seen from TEM images of a
photocatalyst with an organic substrate after a degradation reaction:
the photocatalyst is clearly closely associated with organic substrate.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may contain one or more, such as two or more,
hydroxymethyl groups (-CH2OH). For example, cellulose, hemi-cellulose
and lignin contain a plurality of hydroxymethyl groups within their
core structures (see, for example, Figure 1 (a)).<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be a polyol, for example a polyol having two
or more, such as five or more, such as ten or more hydroxyl groups. The
photocatalyst of the invention may be used to degrade a high molecular
weight component within the organic substrate. In the worked examples
of the present case, the photocatalyst is shown to be useful in
degrading cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin. Indeed, the
photocatalyst may be used to degrade biomass directly, and without any
refining.<br>
<br>
Thus, the photocatalyst may be used to degrade an organic substrate
that is or contains a component having a molecular weight of 70 or
more, such as 100 or more, such as 200 or more, such as 500 or more,
such as 1 ,000 or more. Here, the organic substrate may have a
molecular weight of at most 1 ,500.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be used to degrade an organic substrate that is
or contains a component having a molecular weight of 2 kDa or more, 5
kDa or more, 10 kDa or more, 20 kDa or more, 25 kDa or more, 30 kDa or
more, or 50 kDa or more.<br>
<br>
In the worked examples of the present case, the molecular weight of the
cellulose used (see also Figure 4(a)) is believed to be around 30 kDa.<br>
<br>
It is noted that Kalisman et al. only describe the reaction of the
small molecular weight substrate isopropyl alcohol in the presence of a
passivated photocatalyst. Similarly, Simon et al. describe the reaction
of ethanol in the presence of a passivated CdS material. Zhensheng also
describes the use of CdS materials to photocatalytically dehydrogenate
alcohols. There is no suggestion that the photocatalysts could or would
be useful in the treatment of larger molecular weight substrates or
biomass. The organic substrate may be a biomass or a refined biomass.
In the preferred<br>
<br>
embodiments of the invention, refining of the biomass is not required,
and a biomass may be used directly (or after mechanical processing).
Here, refining refers to a process where components of the biomass,
such as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose are separated from each
other, of from other components of the biomass. Refining may refer to a
thermal, chemical or biochemical processes for achieving this
separation.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be or comprise a polysaccharide.<br>
<br>
In the preferred methods of the invention, the organic substrate is a
cellulose, such as a-cellulose.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be or comprise a polypeptide.<br>
<br>
A mixture of different organic substrates, such as those described
above, may be present. In the worked examples of the present case, the
organic substrate is a complex biomass material, such as paper or wood.
The organic substrate may contain many different types of biomass in a
mixture.<br>
<br>
In one embodiment, a mixture of lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose may
be present as organic substrates. Such materials typically feature
within biomasses such as paper and wood or a biomass that is plant
matter.<br>
<br>
The organic substrate may be wood, paper, cardboard, bagasse, grass
and/or sawdust. The organic substrate can be general waste, plastics,
packing materials, waste food, aliphatic polyols, algae, sugars,
starches, biomass, sewage and/or domestic waste. The organic substrate
preferably comprises lignocellulose or one or more of its constituent
components.<br>
<br>
A biomass for use in a method of the invention may be mechanically
treated prior to used, for example to reduce the size of the biomass
and optionally to provide the biomass in a uniform size distribution.
Such mechanical treatments are for optimal processing of the biomass in
the methods of the invention, for example to increase the available
surface area of the substrate or simply to ensure that the organic
substrate can be handled and distributed within a processing facility.<br>
<br>
The inventors have found that the photocatalyst of the invention can be
used directly to catalyse the reaction of biomass, and each of the
major components of lignocellulose is reactive in the presence of the
photocatalyst when it is exposed to light. Accordingly, the methods of
the invention do not require the biomass to be chemically treated prior
to use. Many methods contained in the prior art have described the
preparation of monosaccharides from cellulose components as a
preliminary step, prior to the use of the photocatalyst. Additional
Organic Substrates<br>
<br>
In addition to, or as an alternative to, the organic substrates
described above, the present inventors have found that the
photocatalyst of the invention has broad application in degrading, or
reforming, organic substrates that are organic polymers, and preferably
the degradation reaction yields hydrogen and/or carbon dioxide (for
example as carbonate).<br>
<br>
In their initial work, the inventors found that the photocatalyst could
be used to degrade organic polymers such as polysaccharides, including
cellulose and hemicellulose, and lignin. The photocatalyst is now found
to have use in the degradation of other organic polymers, and may be
used to generate hydrogen from those organic polymers.<br>
<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the
organic polymers are at least partially hydrolysed or solubilised under
the reactions conditions. The hydrolysis of the polymer may result in
the formation of dissolved hydrolysis products having hydroxyl
functionality. From their earlier work, the inventors have established
that hydroxyl-containing materials, such as hydroxyl-containing organic
polymers, are substrates for the photocatalyst.<br>
<br>
The standard reaction conditions for the use of the photocatalyst are
aqueous basic conditions, and such are sufficient for the at least
partial hydrolysis or at least partial dissolution of many organic
polymers. For example, substituted polyesters, polyethers,
polycarbonates, and polyurethanes are all degradable under aqueous
basic conditions, and are therefore shown or expected to be suitable
substrates for the generation of hydrogen using the photocatalyst of
the invention.<br>
<br>
The organic polymers described here may be used in the same way as the
organic substrates described in the section above. Thus, the organic
polymers may be provided together with the photocatalyst in an aqueous
mixture having a pH of 10 or more, such as pH 11 or more, such as pH 12
or more, optionally together with a co-catalyst.<br>
<br>
An organic polymer may refer to a polymer that contains multiple
monomer units, and typically each monomer unit contains at least one
carbon-carbon bond in the backbone chain of the polymer. Where a
monomer does not contain a carbon-carbon bond in the backbone chain of
the polymer, it may contain a carbon-oxygen in the backbone, for
example as seen with paraformaldehyde polymers. The monomer units may
be covalently linked by carbon-carbon bonds, such as in a substituted
polyethylene, but this is not necessary, and monomers may be linked by
carbon- oxygen or carbon-nitrogen bonds. For example, carbon-oxygen
bonds are present in polyethers. The organic polymer may be a
homopolymer or a copolymer.<br>
<br>
Typically each monomer (repeat) unit within the organic polymer
contains one or more heteroatoms, such as one or more heteroatoms
selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. A heteroatom may be present
within the covalent bond connecting monomers, and/or a heteroatom may
be present within a side chain of the monomer.<br>
<br>
The organic polymer may be a polymer that is hydrolysable or at least
partially soluble under basic conditions, such as the aqueous basic
conditions mentioned above, for example at aqueous pH 10 or more, such
as aqueous pH 1 1 or more. Organic polymers that are not hydrolysable
or partially soluble under basic aqueous conditions, such as
polyethylene, polypropylene or polystyrene, are not seen to evolve
hydrogen under the reactions conditions described herein.<br>
<br>
In certain methods of the invention, an organic substrate such as an
organic polymer may be at least partially degraded or solubilised prior
to its treatment with the photocatalyst. This pre-treatment of the
organic substrate may be undertaken to improve the solubility of the
substrate in the aqueous basic mixture.<br>
<br>
The organic polymer may therefore comprise functionality, either in the
backbone chain or the side chain, which is hydrolysable under basic
conditions. For example, the organic polymer may contain ester, amide,
ether, carbonate, and/or urethane (carbamate) functionality. The
organic polymer may additionally or alternatively contain hydroxyl
functionality, and such polymers are believed to be substrates for the
photocatalyst. As previously noted in the section above, the organic
substrate may be a polyol, such as a polysaccharide, including
cellulose, or lignin.<br>
<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the organic polymer may be a polyester,
such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polylactic acid (PI_A), a
substituted polyethylene, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and
optionally also polyethylene, a polyether, such as polyethylene glycol
(PEG), a polycarbonate (PC) or a polyurethane (PUR).<br>
<br>
Additionally or alternatively, the organic polymer may be a polyamide,
such as a protein.<br>
<br>
For example, the organic polymer may be a polyester, a substituted
polyethylene, or a polyether.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be used together with an organic polymer that is
a polyester. The polyester may be an aryl-containing polyester
(aromatic polyester) or an alkyl-containing polyester (aliphatic
polyester). The polyester may contain both aryl and alkyl functionality.<br>
<br>
Examples of aryl-containing polyesters include polyethylene
terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and
polytrimethylene terephthalate.<br>
<br>
Examples of alkyl-containing polyesters include the homopolymers
polylactic acid, polycaprolactone (PCL), polyglycolic acid,
poly-3-hydroxyvalerate, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate.
Examples of alkyl-containing polyesters include the copolymer
polybutylene succinate and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate).<br>
<br>
The worked examples in the present case show that the photocatalyst can
catalyse the oxidation of the polyesters PET and PLA.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst may be used together with an organic polymer that is
a substituted polyethylene. Thus, the polyethylene has a side chain.
Typically, the substituted<br>
<br>
polyethylene is a polymer having one or more heteroatoms, such as
selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, within the side chain. The
heteroatom functionally may be a component of a functional group that
is hydrolysable under the reaction conditions, or it may assist in the
dissolution of the polymer in the reaction mixture.<br>
<br>
The polyethylene may be substituted with, for example, a heterocycle,
such as a C4-7 heterocycle having one ring heteroatom. The heterocycle
may be pyrrolidone.<br>
<br>
The polyethylene may be substituted with, for example, a cyano group.
Thus, the polymer may be a polyacrylonitrile (PAN).<br>
<br>
The polyethylene is typically not an acrylate polymer, for example the
polyethylene is not a poly(methyl methacrylate). The photocatalyst may
be used together with an organic polymer that is a polyether, including
for example polyethylene glycol.<br>
<br>
A polyether may be an alkyl-containing polyether (aliphatic polyether)
or an aryl-containing polyether (aromatic polyether). The polyether may
contain both aryl and alkyl functionality.<br>
<br>
Examples of alkyl-containing polyethers include polyethylene glycol,
polypropylene glycol, paraformaldehyde (PFA) and poly(tetramethylene
ether) glycol (also known as polytetrahydrofuran).<br>
<br>
Examples of aryl-containing polyethers include polyphenyl ether and
poly(p-phenylene ether) (PPE).<br>
<br>
An example of a complex polyether containing both alkyl and aryl
functionality, together with further substituent groups, is lignin.
Here, lignin is a polymer of linked and crosslinked phenolic monomers.
In one embodiment, a polyether is not lignin.<br>
<br>
The organic polymer may be a component of a consumer product. For
example, polyethylene terephthalate is found in fibres for clothing and
containers for foods and liquids.<br>
<br>
For the purposes of the present case, a polysaccharide may not be
considered a polyether.<br>
<br>
An example of a polyamide is a polypeptide. Example polypeptides
include bovine serum albumin and casein.<br>
<br>
As with the organic substrates previously described, the organic
polymer may have a molecular weight that 500 or more, such as 1 ,000 or
more. The photocatalyst may be used to degrade an organic substrate
that is or contains a component having a molecular weight of 2 kDa or
more, 5 kDa or more, 10 kDa or more, 20 kDa or more, 25 kDa or more, 30
kDa or more, or 50 kDa or more.<br>
<br>
As previously noted, the organic substrate, such as the organic
polymer, may be pre-treated prior to its mixing with the photocatalyst.
For example, the organic substrate may be pre-heated to assist the
hydrolysis or dissolution of the organic polymer. In a further example,
the organic polymer may be pre-treated with base to assist the
hydrolysis or dissolution of the organic polymer.<br>
<br>
The organic polymer may also be mechanically treated, for example by
cutting, grinding and milling and other such techniques. The mechanical
treatment may be particularly advantageous where the organic polymer is
a component of a consumer product, and a size reduction in the product
will assist in the rate of degrading the product and its organic
polymer component. The organic substrate, such as an organic polymer,
may be used to generate hydrogen, optionally together with carbon
dioxide and/or an organic product, such as formic acid, acetic acid,
pyruvic acid, and terephthalic acid. The pre-treatment steps, which may
include mechanical or chemically pre-treatment, may provide an
increased production rate for these products.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Methods of Preparation</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The present case provides methods for preparing a photocatalyst.
Generally the methods include the step of modifying the surface of a
base material, which is a semiconductor, such as a metal-containing
semiconductor, to provide an oxygenated surface, which is typically a
metal hydroxide or metal oxide surface.<br>
<br>
The semiconductor may be a metal chalcogenide, such as a metal sulfide,
metal selenide or a metal telluride, for example. Example materials for
use as the core materials are described above in relation to the
structure of the photocatalyst. In one embodiment, the method for
preparing a photocatalyst comprises the step of treating a
semiconducting material, such as a particle of a semiconducting
material, with aqueous base, where the pH of the aqueous base is 10 or
more, such as pH 1 1 or more. The method may be performed in the
substantial absence of ligands. In the worked examples of the present
case CdS|CdOxis prepared from ligand-free CdS quantum dots.<br>
<br>
Annealing methods performed in air may also be used to generate an
oxygenated surface, for example a CdO layer in a photocatalyst (see
Zhensheng et al. J. Mol. Catal. 1989, 50, 315). The present case also
provides a method for rejuvenating a photocatalyst, where the
photocatalyst is provided in an aqueous mixture, such as a basic
aqueous mixture, the method comprising the step of increasing the
acidity of the mixture (lowering the pH), and then subsequently
increasing the basicity of the mixture (increasing the pH), thereby to
provide the photocatalyst.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst for rejuvenation is a photocatalyst that has
previously been used in a photocatalytic reaction, such as the
degradation, hydrogen generation and carbon dioxide generation methods
described herein. The photocatalyst may have reduced activity, for
example due to poisoning of the catalyst, including the loss of
functionality, or some other change resulting in a loss of activity.
Here reduced activity refers to a reduction in catalytic activity
compared with the photocatalyst activity as first used, for example
within the first hour of use. The steps of decreasing then increasing
the pH of the aqueous mixture has the effect of "stripping" the surface
of the photocatalyst, then regenerating the active surface, thereby
substantially restoring catalytic activity.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Experimental and Results</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Described below is a photocatalytic system based on semiconducting CdS
quantum dots (QDs) that is capable of degrading cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin into H2at room temperature. CdS is an
inexpensive, visible-light absorbing photocatalyst with a bulk
electronic band gap of around 2.4 eV that can be increased through
quantum confinement effects. The CdS conduction band has a potential of
-0.5 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE, pH 0), providing
sufficient driving force for proton reduction and is responsible for
several of the highest reported rates of photocatalytic evH2olution.<br>
<br>
The CdS valence band is located at roughly +1.9 V vs. NHE, which is
adequate for saccharide oxidation, however it is also sufficient for
the photooxidation of its constituent sulfide. This photocorrosion has
brought the viability of CdS as a sustainable photocatalyst into
question, as H2evolution has depended on the use of easily-oxidised
sacrificial reagents to outcompete sulfide oxidation. To circumvent
these issues CdS is treated under highly alkaline conditions, and
typically under ligand free conditions, that promote Cd(OH)2/CdO
(henceforth CdOx) formation on the CdS surface (Fig. 1 b). The
resultant CdS|CdOxmaterial is able to undertake demanding
photocatalytic reactions without photocorrosion, such that light-driven
evHo2lution is achievable through the oxidation of completely
unprocessed lignocellulosic substrates. Beneficially, the use of highly
alkaline conditions may also solubilise the organic substrate, such as
lignocellulose, thereby providing highly accessible substrate for the
photocatalyst. The synergistic interplay between the active
photocatalyst formation and the increase in dissolved lignocellulosic
substrate produces a system with previously unmatched rates of H2
evolution.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reagents</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Ligand-free CdS quantum dots were synthesised as reported previously
(see J. Mater. Chem. A 2016, 4, 2856). a-Cellulose, hemicellulose
(xylan from beechwood), CdO and CdS04and lignin (alkali) were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich and used without further processing.<br>
<br>
Semiconductor-grade KOH (99.99%) was used to ensure impurities were not
present during photocatalysis. Cobalt(ll) tetrafluoroborate hydrate,
96% (assumed to be Co(BF4)2-6H20) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. NaOD
(40 wt % in D20, 99% atom% D) and D2(99.8% atom D) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich.<br>
<br>
&lt;13&gt;C cellulose was purchased from IsoLife. Wood from the branch
of a London plane tree was obtained from a tree on Lensfield Road,
Cambridge, UK. Sawdust was obtained from a local sawmill (B&amp;Q,
Cambridge, UK) and grass was attained from a garden in north<br>
<br>
Cambridge, UK. Cardboard was obtained from a Sigma Aldrich box,
newspaper from an issue of the Cambridge News, bagasse from a Duni
bagasse plate and paper from Office Depot. Waste cellulose and biomass
sources were cut roughly into pieces &lt; 0.25 cm long before use. All
other reagents were obtained from commercial sources at the highest
available purity.<br>
<br>
Equipment UV-Visible spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 UV-Vis
spectrophotometer.&lt;1&gt;H and&lt;13&gt;C NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker 400 MHz Avance spectrometer at room temperature.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using a
FEI Philips Tecnai 20 microscope, with 200 kV accelerating voltage. XPS
analysis was carried out at the Cambridge Microelectronics centre on a
Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi&lt;+&gt;XPS Microprobe in an ultrahigh
vacuum chamber. Freeze drying was carried out in a VirTis SP Scientific
freeze dryer. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on
an X'Pert PRO by PANalytical BV instrument. Photoluminescence
measurements were carried out on an Edinburgh Instruments FS5
spectrofluorometer. pH was measured on a Mettler Toledo pH meter and
probe, with the exception of the pH of solutions containing [KOH] &gt;
1 M, which was estimated based on the assumption [OH-] ~ [KOH].
Characterisation of CdS\ CdOx<br>
<br>
CdS|CdOxwas synthesised from ligand-free CdS quantum dots with a
diameter of 5 nm, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, Fig. 2a, b). The ligand-free CdS is passivated by weakly-bound
tetrafluoroborate anions and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), presenting an
accessible surface that can be modified for improved catalytic activity.<br>
<br>
Addition of the quantum dots to basic solution caused CdOxto
instantaneously form on the particle surface through OH- binding to Cd
surface sites.<br>
<br>
This was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of CdS
QDs after suspension in various concentrations of KOH. The expected Cd
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 binding energies for emissions in CdS are 405 and 412
eV, respectively, which was observed in the photoemission spectrum of
QDs isolated from a pH neutral solution (Fig. 2c, see Fig. 6 for S and
O spectra). After isolation from 0.1 M KOH the Cd emissions tail
towards lower binding energies and after isolation from 10 M KOH the
peaks shift 1 eV lower to 404 and 41 1 eV. The lowered binding energy
is consistent with CdO/Cd(OH)2 environments on the CdS at high pH.<br>
<br>
Raman measurements provided in situ evidence for the formation of
surface-bound CdOx. Under 514 nm laser excitation, highly resolved
off-resonant Raman spectra of ligand-free CdS QDs in 0, 0.1 and 10 M
KOH aqueous solutions were obtained (Fig. 2d). In agreement with
literature, vibrational bands at 305 cm&lt;-1&gt;and 605
cm&lt;-1&gt;were observed that can be assigned to scattering and
double-scattering on the longitudinal optical phonon of CdS (LO and
2LO), respectively. As the KOH concentration is increased, a broadening
of the LO peak on the low frequency side is observed that cannot be
accounted for by the KOH (Figs. 2e and 7). Spectral deconvolution by
band-fitting analysis revealed contributions from two bands located at
260cm&lt;- 1&gt;and 292cm&lt;- 1&gt;. These bands can be attributed to
CdO by comparison to a reference spectrum of CdO (bulk) and literature
values. The positions of these bands are slightly lower than those
reported for bulk CdO (265-268cm&lt;- 1&gt;and<br>
<br>
298-305 cm&lt;-1&gt;). Although the formation of Cd(OH)2 was not
visible in the Raman spectra (see Fig. 7 for reference spectrum), this
does not confirm that the surface consists solely of CdO, as the
dynamic nature of the QD modification would introduce numerous Cd-0
functionalities.<br>
<br>
TEM images of CdS|CdOxafter isolation from 10 M KOH show that the
surface change occurs with a concomitant decrease in average particle
size by 0.6 nm (Fig. 2f,g). Formation of CdOxin highly basic solution
was corroborated by zeta potential analysis of the QDs (Fig. 2h), which
shows a rapid increase in negative surface charge above pH 12. This
shift is similar to that observed on ZnS/Zn(OH)2 surfaces, and is
indicative of Cd-O&lt;"&gt;forming on the particle surface.<br>
<br>
The decrease in size is a result of the removal of a few layers of CdS
to generate a CdOxpassivation. This does not affect the bulk properties
of the particle as the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 8) displays only
marginal changes after dissolution in 10 M KOH. The UV-visible spectrum
after dissolution in 10 M KOH also retains the visible-light absorption
consistent with CdS QDs, although the spectrum is broadened and
slightly red- shifted relative to the spectrum in DMF (Amax= 450 nm in
DMF and 470 nm in 10 M KOH, Fig. 9). This red-shift is attributed to a
lower QD dispersibility in the aqueous solvent, which leads to a degree
of particle aggregation, as seen previously for ligand-free CdS QDs.
Considering the presented data it is proposed that CdOx exists as a
monolayer or at most as a few layers on the CdS surface at high
concentrations of KOH. This is evidenced by the spectroscopic
confirmation of CdOx (Fig. 2c,d and e), combined with the still-present
bulk properties of CdS (Figures 8 and 9) and lack of a larger, visible
CdOx shell in the TEM image (Fig. 2f).<br>
<br>
The influence of the CdOxsurface passivation on the CdS QD
photoluminescence is presented in Fig. 2i. As OH- is added a stronger
near band-gap emission is visible at 480 to 490 nm, which is most
pronounced in 10 M KOH. A comparison between the emission and
absorption spectra in 10 M KOH is presented in Fig. 9b. The increasing
intensity of the emission is attributed to the formation of CdOx, which
blocks CdS defect sites that promote radiationless charge-carrier
recombination. The near band gap energy of the emission also indicates
that CdOx may provide shallow trap-states (below 0.1 eV in depth) above
the valence band and below the conduction band that increase the
lifetime of charge separation. These effects lead to more efficient
light-harvesting capacity, and thereby photocatalytic activity, of the
QD and may also enhance particle stability through prevention of S*
radical formation that is responsible for CdS degradation.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photoreforming (Degradation) of
Cellulose</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
To test the efficacy of the CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst for lignocellulose
reforming, we initially focused on the oxidation of its major
component, cellulose. We used the most crystalline and unreactive form,
referred to as 'a-cellulose', as its conversion is most crucial if
complete lignocellulose reformation is to be achieved. Photocatalysis
was carried out with CdS QDs (1 nmol) and a-cellulose suspended in a
deaerated aqueous solution (2 ml_) kept at 25&deg;C, which was
irradiated with simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;).
The cellulose exists as a suspension due to its low solubility and
optimisation revealed that a loading of 50 mg mL&lt;- 1&gt;led to the
highest photocatalytic activity (Table 1). Large volumes of H2 could be
produced provided strongly alkaline conditions were employed (Fig. 3a)
with the activity rapidly increasing towards pH 15 (10 M KOH). This
concurs with the in situ formation of CdOx on the QD surface (Fig. 2)
and a similar pH dependence was observed when photoreforming other
substrates (Table 2), as seen in other CdS-based systems. H2 evolution
by the photocatalyst originates mostly from reduction of aqueous
protons, as photocatalysis in D2O produced D2 and HD in a 4: 1 ratio
(Fig. 10). Formation of the latter originates from H/D exchange with
cellulose OH groups. No H2evolution was observed without QDs or light
(see Table 1).<br>
<br>
In addition to promoting the formation of CdOx, the high concentration
of KOH provides the added benefit of solubilising a portion of the
suspended cellulose, as seen for NaOH-water systems. Dissolved
cellulose chains were confirmed to be the major substrate through use
of a 10 M KOH solution that had been stirred in the presence of
a-cellulose for 24 hours and subsequently centrifuged to remove the
suspended, insoluble cellulose. The supernatant was then added to a
vial containing ligand-free CdS QDs and irradiated (Fig. 11 , Table 3).
Here, photocatalytic H2 evolution (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm-2) from CdS|CdOx
QDs (0.5 &#956;&#924;) was studied under an anaerobic atmosphere at 25&deg;C with
50 mg rnL&lt;-1&gt;suspended a-cellulose in 1 ml_ aqueous 10 M KOH (top
line) and 1 ml_ of a suspension-free &#945;-cellulose solution in 10 M KOH
(bottom line). The suspension-free solution was prepared by irradiating
50 mg ml_&lt;"1&gt;&#945;-cellulose for 24 hours at 25&deg;C in anaerobic
conditions (shaded region) and subsequently centrifuging the solution
to remove the solid material.<br>
<br>
The H2 evolution rate from this solution was initially faster relative
to the rate observed when using suspended cellulose, as more dissolved
substrate was available. Without the suspended cellulose present
however, the activity dropped over time as the solubilised substrate
depleted. The photoreforming reaction therefore occurs through
continuous dissolution of the suspended cellulose by the basic solution
followed by its fast oxidation by the CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst. The
presence of the dissolved polysaccharides is confirmed in Fig. 3c
(discussed below) and was also evidenced by an increase in solution
viscosity after several days of photocatalysis.<br>
<br>
Long-term photocatalytic H2 evolution activity from cellulose is
illustrated in Fig. 3b. After 6 days there was no evidence of
photocorrosion and nearly 600 &#915;&#932;&#921;&#915;&#932;&#921;&#927;&#921;&#919;29CdS-&lt;1&gt;had been produced
in the headspace of a closed photoreactor, equating to a turnover
number of 100,000 with respect to the QD. The activity of CdS|CdOxis
over an order of magnitude higher than the aforementioned T1O2 systems,
even without the use of prohibitively expensive noble metal
co-catalysts or the need for UV light to operate. No evolution of CO
was observed during catalysis (gas chromatograph CO detection limit =
35 ppm), resulting in inhibitor-free H2 in the photoreactor headspace.
All CO2 generated was sequestered by the basic solution as
CO3&lt;2"&gt;(see Fig. 3c), removing any potential environmental impact
of the oxidation reaction. CdS|CdOxwithout cellulose present (Fig. 3b,
black line) shows 10% of the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity for
the first 24 h irradiation and then ceases (4% after 6 days), which
originates from oxidation of residual DMF from the stock solution or
sulfide displaced from the quantum dots.<br>
<br>
The narrower bandgap of CdS also allows the system to function
effectively under visible light and 50% of the catalytic activity was
maintained by CdS|CdOxwhen UV-light<br>
<br>
(&#955; &lt; 400 nm) was filtered from the solar spectrum (Table 1). The
drop in activity is due to the decrease in the number of photons
available to the CdS, demonstrating that UV-light is not needed to
facilitate the photoreforming reaction. Cellulose photoreforming may
therefore be undertaken with visible light only, an essential
development if this process is to be undertaken in realistic operating
conditions. An external quantum yield of 1.2 &plusmn; 0.4 % was
achieved when irradiating with 430 nm monochromatic light (Table 4),
which is comparable to reported efficiencies of Pt/Ti02 for the much
simpler glucose reforming reaction under UV light. The yield was
substantially higher when photoreforming MeOH (17.7 &plusmn; 1.5 %,
Table 5), indicating that the efficiency is reduced by the slow
oxidation rate of the polysaccharide chains, as well as
light-scattering by the cellulose suspension.<br>
<br>
The products of a-cellulose oxidation were identified by&lt;13&gt;C-NMR
spectroscopy using uniformly&lt;13&gt;C-labelled cellulose in 10 M NaOD
in D2O (Fig. 3c). Photocatalysis was carried out with 10 mg
of&lt;13&gt;C a-cellulose in NaOD for 3 days, after which the reaction
solution was filtered of insoluble cellulose and analysed. A control
experiment wherein&lt;13&gt;C-cellulose was irradiated without CdS|CdOx
produced signals between &#948; = 55-110 ppm (see Fig. 3c, black line, i),
corresponding to C-environments in the anhydroglucose repeating unit.
This confirms that the basic conditions are able to partially dissolve
the &#945;-cellulose, providing solvated cellulose chains as a substrate for
photocatalysis.<br>
<br>
After irradiation in the presence of CdS|CdOx the polymeric cellulose
resonances (&#948; = 55 to 1 10 ppm, i) are reduced in intensity, indicating
that the photocatalyst is able to break down the large cellulose
chains. This leads to a broad polymeric carboxylic acid resonance (&#948; =
182 ppm, ii), from oxidised polysaccharide end groups.<br>
<br>
Decomposition of the cellulose by CdS|CdOx forms smaller saccharides,
however sharp monosaccharide peaks are not present in the spectrum.
This suggests that if smaller saccharides do form they are rapidly
consumed by the photocatalyst. The fast affinity of the photocatalyst
for smaller saccharide oxidation was confirmed by photoreforming 0.1 M
glucose, which produced hh at a rate of 10.0 mmolH2
gcds&lt;-1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;(Table 2); 130% higher than with a-cellulose
(4.4 mmolH2 gcds&lt;-1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;). At an a-cellulose loading of 50
mg mL&lt;-1&gt;the potential anhydroglucose concentration (0.3 M) is
three times higher than glucose. Dehydration of monosaccharides
produces furfural species, such as 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), as
intermediates in the oxidation of cellulose by Pt/TiO2 systems. HMF
resonances are not visible in the&lt;13&gt;C spectrum after
photocatalysis, as confirmed by reference to an authentic sample (Fig.
b). This illustrates that either HMF is not formed as an intermediate
in photocatalysis or that upon its formation it is rapidly decomposed.
The latter is unlikely as photoreforming HMF by the photocatalyst
proceeded at a relatively slow rate of 4.7 mmolH2
gcds&lt;-1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;(Table 2).<br>
<br>
Instead, formate was identified as the major intermediate during
catalysis (&#948; = 171 ppm, iii), which is a common product of biomass
oxidation by thermally-driven metal oxide catalysts. The accumulation
of formate was assigned to its slow oxidation by CdS|CdOx, as its
photoreformation generated H2 at an even slower rate of 1.3 mmolH2
gcds&lt;-1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;(Table 2). A combination of decarboxylation of
carboxylic acids and formate oxidation then produces CO2, which was
solubilised as carbonate (CO3&lt;2"&gt;) at the employed pH (&#948; = 169
ppm, d) (Fig. 3c). These assignments were corroborated by reference to
authentic samples and&lt;1&gt;H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 12).<br>
<br>
&lt;13&gt;C-NMR spectroscopy was also undertaken of insoluble cellulose
that had been irradiated for 12 hours in 10 M NaOD/D20 both with and
without CdS|CdOx. The suspended cellulose was collected after
photocatalysis via centrifugation and dissolved in molten ZnCI2before
measuring a spectrum (Fig. 12e). Both spectra showed the expected
cellulose resonances, as well as numerous sp&lt;2&gt;C-environments.
When CdS|CdOxis present there are a number of extra peaks that can be
assigned to the heterogeneous oxidation of the cellulose. This
indicates that there is both homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of
the cellulose chains during photocatalysis, however due to the
mass-transport limitations of the heterogeneous reaction, oxidation of
the dissolved cellulose will provide the major contribution to the H2
evolution activity.<br>
<br>
Proton reduction occurs on CdS through Cd&deg; sites formed by electron
accumulation on the photocatalyst surface, however this leads to slow
rates of H2evolution. Transition metal co-catalysts are typically added
to semiconductor systems to accelerate the proton reduction activity,
but showed a limited effect in the present system. Addition of Ni(BF4)2
lowered the H2 generated and K2PtCI4halted activity completely over 24
h of photocatalysis (see Table 6). The addition of Co(BF4)2 increased
the H2 produced by 12%, but only after several days of photocatalysis
(Fig. 13).<br>
<br>
XPS analysis of Co(BF4)2 in 10 M KOH showed emissions consistent with
Co(OH)2/CoOOH (Fig. 14), which is believed to be the co-catalyst in
this case. When replacing cellulose with more easily oxidised glucose
the addition of Co ions had a larger influence on the photoactivity,
increasing the H2 generated by over 100% (see Table 2). This indicates
that the cellulose oxidation reaction limits the rate of photocatalytic
H2 generation on CdS|CdOx. This was further confirmed through studies
of the kinetic isotope effect in a solution of FbO/NaOH vs. D20/NaOD.
When the rate of reaction is dictated by breaking/making a H-containing
bond the activity drops substantially upon changing to deuterated
substrates, due to the lower vibrational frequency of the D-containing
bond. In the deuterated solvent, the rate of photocatalysis was lowered
by only 25% (kH/kDof 1.35 &plusmn; 0.16) (Table 7), indicating that the
formation/cleavage of an O-H bond is not rate-limiting. The limiting
oxidation rate is reflected in the conversion yield of cellulose to H2,
which reached a maximum of 9.7% after 6 days (Table 8, this data was
corrected by background activity and assumes a theoretical maximum of
12 equivalents of fHo2rmed per anhydroglucose monomer).<br>
<br>
The yield is not yet comparable with the conversion attained by
thermochemical reforming processes, due to the inaccessibility of the
undissolved cellulose, however this disadvantage is offset by the high
purity of the H p2roduced and significantly reduced energy input of the
presented system. It is likely that much higher conversions will be
realised as study of the system matures.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Photoreforming of Lignocellulose</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Study into the reformation of the other lignocellulose components,
lignin and hemicellulose, is presented in Fig. 4a (Table 9).
Hemicellulose, in this case xylan from beech wood, could be reformed at
similar rates to a-cellulose, as expected from its similar chemical
composition. A lowered loading of hemicellulose at 25 mg ml_&lt;-
1&gt;was used to reflect the levels of hemicellulose present in
lignocellulose. The heightened specific evH2olution performance is due
to the higher solubility of hemicellulose, which presents more
accessible oxidation sites for the particulate CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst.<br>
<br>
Lignin is strongly light-absorbing and consequently its light-driven
oxidation to form haHs2rarely been reported. UV visible spectroscopy of
lignin shows a broad absorption peaking at 300 nm with a shoulder at
350 nm that tails into visible wavelengths of light; the region over
which wide-band gap semiconductors absorb most strongly. The smaller
band gap of CdS|CdOxabsorbs wavelengths above 420 nm, where there is
little competition for light between the photocatalyst and substrate
(Fig. 15), allowing photocatalysis to occur effectively.<br>
<br>
At lignin loadings of 0.25 mg rnL&lt;-1&gt;, CdS|CdOxwas able to evolve
at aHn2unprecedented rate of 0.44 mmolH2 gcar&lt;1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;(Fig.
4a). The decomposition of lignin during photocatalysis was followed by
UV-visible spectroscopy over 5 days of irradiation, which showed a
decrease in the peak at 300 nm and growth of the shoulder at 350 nm
(Fig. 16a). This change is a result of oxidation of phenols within
lignin to quinone functionality. This also occurred without CdS|CdOx
present, due to UV-light absorption and self-oxidation by lignin, but
3.7 times slower with no evolved H2(Fig. 16b/c).<br>
<br>
Solar-driven H2evolution from unprocessed lignocellulose stands as a
long-sought objective for progress in the field of biomass conversion.
Fig. 4b (Table 10) summarises the rate of H2evolution from suspensions
of raw biomass available in areas local to Cambridge, UK and
lignocellulosic waste. Each source was added to the reaction mixture
after a rough cutting procedure to attain pieces &lt; 0.25 cm long, and
theH2produced by CdS|CdOxwas measured after 24 hours of solar
irradiation. Rates of up to 9 mmol gcds&lt;-1&gt;h&lt;-1&gt;were
observed using wood from a tree branch, whereas the other natural
lignocellulose sources (bagasse, sawdust and grass) exhibited lower
activity.<br>
<br>
Waste paper, cardboard and newspaper were also reformed to H2, despite
the highly crystalline cellulose present in their structure. The rate
at whichH2is evolved from each substrate is remarkably high, competing
with the activity of purified monosaccharide reforming systems
(typically 1 to 9 mmolH2gcds&lt;-1&gt;IT&lt;1&gt;) and reaches values
two orders of magnitude higher than previous reports of photocatalytic
lignocellulose reforming. The high activity is assigned to the employed
conditions that benefit both the photocatalyst and the substrate; the
alkaline conditions provides an in situ pre-treatment of the
lignocellulose, dissolving hemicellulose, lignin, cellulose and other
saccharides into the solution, which are then accessible for oxidation
by CdS|CdOx. This provides a one-pot system that is responsive to
highly unprocessed substrates, thereby allowing facileH2generation from
the most ubiquitous lignocellulose in a given area. Mechanism of
Lignocellulose Reforming on CdS\CdOx<br>
<br>
Photocatalytic lignocellulose oxidation is often believed to occur
through the formation of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which subsequently
oxidise the substrate. This possibility was explored using the
OH-scavenger benzene-1 ,4-dicarboxylic acid (terephthalic acid, TPA).
TPA reacts with &#908;&#919; to form 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (TPA-OH), which
can be characterised by its fluorescence at 430 nm when excited with
315 nm light. CdS QDs irradiated for 18 hours in the presence of TPA
showed low levels of TPA-OH formation below pH 14 (Fig. 17a), typically
amounting to &lt; 2 &#956;&#951;&#953;&#959;&#921; &#908;&#919; when compared to a TPA-OH reference
(assuming the reaction yield of &#908;&#919; and TPA to be 35%, Fig. 17b). Above
pH 14, when CdS|CdOxis formed, no TPA-OH was detected and therefore it
is unlikely that &#908;&#919; plays a role in the presented system.<br>
<br>
The function of the probe above and below pH 14 was confirmed through
controlled generation of &#908;&#919; by H2O2 photolysis (see Fig. 18). Here,
photoluminescence emission spectra (bandwidth 2 nm) were recorded at an
excitation wavelength of 315 nm (bandwidth 2 nm) for a 10 mM
terephthalic acid solution (2 ml_) before and after exposure to &#908;&#919;
through the photolysis of 0.5 mM H202 with 1 mM KOH (pH 5.2), 0.1 M KOH
(pH 12.9) and 5 M KOH (pH 14.7). Photolysis was induced during each
measurement by the excitation beam. A 100% photolysis yield would
generate a maximum of 2 &#956;&#951;&#953;&#959;&#921; of OH, but the actual yield will be much
lower than this value. A peak from 2-hydroxyterephthalic at 430 nm
arises after addition of H2O2 in all cases. This does not differ
significantly from the background of terephthalic acid (410 nm) as only
minimal amounts of the 2-hydroxyterephthalic is present, but the peak
is clearly distinguishable. These controls confirm that even minimal &#908;&#919;
formation is detectable by the probe<br>
<br>
Instead it is proposed that the CdOxcoverage promotes effective binding
between the photocatalyst and the substrate, which would contain
numerous alkoxide groups at the employed pH. This interaction may be
similar to T1O2, which forms Ti-O-R bonds during photocatalysis,
facilitating effective hole transfer and a weakening of the C-C bonds
in the bound substrate, leading to efficient oxidation to CO2.
Lignocellulosic substrates may bind to the CdS|CdOxsurface through
analogous Cd-O-R bonds, as evidenced by the formation of the
decarboxylation product, CO3&lt;2-&gt;. Such binding is not normally
possible on CdS QDs as available Cd-binding sites are passivated by
surface ligands or sulfide. It is speculated that dissolved
lignocellulose chains bind to the CdS|CdOxsurface, possibly through
multiple alkoxide groups, allowing the photocatalyst to undertake fast
oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes. At this point, C-C bond cleavage
can generate formate, or the aldehyde can be further oxidised to a
carboxylic acid, which is decarboxylated to CO3&lt;2-&gt;. The fast
realisation of these reactions is further assisted by the efficient
charge separation in the photocatalyst, as a result of the CdOxsurface
modification, and the basic pH, which rapidly facilitates deprotonation
steps necessary during oxidation.<br>
<br>
This reaction almost completely occurs in the homogeneous phase using
solubilised lignocellulosic biomass, although a small amount of
photoreforming on the surface of insoluble substrates may occur based
on&lt;13&gt;C-NMR evidence (Fig. 12e). A strong interaction between the
CdOxsurface and insoluble cellulose is also apparent in TEM images
after reforming, which show the particles embedded in a cellulose
matrix (Fig. 19).<br>

Photocatalysis was carried out in a Pyrex glass photoreactor
thermostated at 25&deg;C. Solar irradiation was emulated by a solar
light simulator (Newport Oriel, 100 mW&lt;2&gt;)c emq-uipped with an
air mass 1.5 global filter (AM 1.5G) and a water filter (10 cm path
length) to remove IR radiation. In a typical experiment, ligand-free
CdS QDs in DMF (1 nmol) were transferred to a photoreactor and the DMF
was removed in vacuo while stirring. Upon removal of the solvent, the
substrate and 2 mL of 10 M KOH were added. Co-catalyst solutions were
made through dissolution of the metal salt in 10 M KOH and were added
to the reaction solution when required. The photoreactor was sealed
with a rubber septum and purged with N2 (containing 2% CH4for gas
chromatographic analysis) for 10 min, after which the vial was
irradiated whilst stirring at 600 rpm. The accumulation of wH2as
quantified through periodic headspace gas analysis (50 &#956;&#921;_) by gas
chromatography.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Synthesis of Oleic Acid Capped CdS
Quantum Dots (CdS-OA)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
CdS-OA were synthesised following a modified literature procedure. A
mixture of CdO (0.64 g) and oleic acid (OA, 29 mL) in octadecene (89
mL) were heated under an Ar atmosphere to 280&deg;C. Separately, a
solution of sulfur (0.08 g) in octadecene (20 mL) was prepared. Half of
the sulfur solution was then added rapidly to the Cd-containing
solution and the other half was added continuously over the course of 2
minutes. The vessel was then immediately cooled to 220&deg;C with N2
gas and rapidly cooled in a water bath. The solution was diluted with 1
: 1 hexane:methanol (100 mL) and the particles were precipitated using
excess acetone (c.a. 300 mL). Isolation of the particles was achieved
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 3 min, after which they were
re-dispersed in hexane. Two further washing steps were carried out by
dispersion in hexane and precipitation with acetone, before finally
dispersing in hexane.<br>

Ligand-free CdS Quantum Dots (CdS-BF4) A solution of CdS-OA in hexane
(3 mL) was reduced to dryness and re-dispersed in a mixture of
anhydrous CHCI3(15 mL) and anhydrous /V,/V-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1.9
mL) under a N2 atmosphere. Et30BF4(1.0 M in dichloromethane, 9 mL) was
added and the reaction solution was stirred for 1 hour. Me3OBF4(1.0 M
in acetonitrile) was added slowly until the particles precipitated
(around 3 mL). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (6,000
rpm, 3 min), and re-dispersed in a minimum of DMF. The quantum dot
concentration and particle size was determined by UV-visible
spectroscopy based on the position and size of the absorption maximum
around 440-450 nm in DMF.<br>

measured using a power meter (ILT 1400,<br>

Raman Analysis Raman spectra were recorded using a confocal Raman
spectrometer LabRam (Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with a liquid nitrogen
cooled Symphony CCD detector (Horiba Jobin Yvon). A 514.73 nm line of
an Ar ion laser (Coherent Innova 300c) was used as excitation
wavelength. CdS-BF4QDs in water (10 &#956;&#924;), KOH (100 mM) and KOH (10 M)
were measured in a rotating quartz cuvette. The accumulation time of
the Raman spectra was 60 seconds. The laser power was set to 2.5 mW.
The laser light was focused into the solution using a
20&lt;&#967;&gt;objective (Nikon, 20&lt;&#967;&gt;NA 0.5). Cd(OH)2 was obtained
by slowly adding 1.5 mL 1 M NaOH into 10 mL of a 0.1 M CdS04solution.
The white precipitate was centrifuged and washed with Millipore water
(p &gt; 18.2 &#924;&#937; cm) three times. Band fitting of the Raman spectra was
employed to evaluate the band structures with low intensities arising
at high KOH concentrations around the LO band at 305 cm&lt;-1&gt;. For
this, the spectra were first cut in the region from 225 cm&lt;-1&gt;to
475 cm&lt;-1&gt;. Then, the spectra of ligand- free CdS in water were
fitted. As the LO band dominates the spectra, this band was fitted
first using a Lorentzian band profile. The frequency is directly
derived from the local maximum in the measured spectrum (i.e. 305
cm&lt;-1&gt;). The band width was adjusted until the experimental band
is properly accounted affording a width of 13 cm&lt;-1&gt;, which is
comparable to values reported in the literature. Small bands with
frequencies around the LO frequency had to be included to enhance the
match of generated and experimental spectrum (see Figure 7b, green
dashed lines). These bands do not necessary reflect real bands but may
be a result of artefacts due to difficulties in baseline subtraction.
The baseline at lower frequencies was dominated by a very strong
polynomic increase of intensity towards the Rayleigh line, which made
it difficult to properly estimate the baseline. As a result, the band
width can be slightly inhomogeneous, which then requires inclusion of
smaller bands around the middle frequency to achieve a match with
convergence criteria of the fit. Importantly, the intensities of these
bands are typically very low compared to the actual band. In this case,
the integral intensities are smaller than 5 % and can therefore be
neglected. The spectra of ligand-free CdS in 10 M KOH were evaluated
next using the bands already derived from the water spectra. To
reconstruct the spectra properly, more bands needed to be included,
particularly on the low frequency side of the LO band. To account for
the additional spectral contribution, the local intensity maxima were
searched for and, at each frequency maxima, an additional Lorentz band
was included with a pre-defined width of 20 cm&lt;-1&gt;. Subsequently,
the widths of these bands and their intensities were iteratively
altered until the best convergence between overall fit and experimental
spectrum was achieved (see Figure 7c). This set of bands was then used
to fit the 0.1 M KOH spectra by allowing only the relative intensities
of the bands to change. The fit allowed a very good reconstruction of
the spectra (see Figure 7d).<br>

solution was purged with N2 and irradiated, as described above, for 12
hours.<br>
<br>
The reaction mixture was centrifuged (15 min, 12,000 rpm) and the solid
residue was washed with water and freeze-dried to give a pale yellow
powder. The yellow powder was added to an NMR tube containing ZnC12
(1.00 g), LiCI (200 mg) and D2O (360 &#956;&#921;_). The mixture was degassed by
three freeze-pump-thaw cycles, sealed and heated to 100&deg;C
overnight. The resulting brown melt was cooled to room temperature
before a&lt;13&gt;C NMR spectrum was taken.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Experimental and Results</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
In addition to the oxidation of organic substrates such as biomass, the
photocatalyst of the invention is capable of degrading and/or
generating hydrogen from common organic polymers, including those used
as commercial plastics in consumer products. The photocatalyst of the
invention was used together with the following organic substrates:
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyvinyl
pyrrolidone) (PVP), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). In a typical
experiment, CdS-BF4(1 nmol) was added to a pyrex photoreactor and
dried. The desired polymer (from 20-200 mg) was weighed into the
photoreactor and aqueous KOH (2 ml_, 10 M) was added. Optionally,
Co(BF4)2-6H20 (0.25 mM) was added to the solution as a co-catalyst. The
mixture was purged with N2 (containing 2% CH4) for 10 minutes prior to
photocatalysis, and the solution was irradiated as described
previously. Thus, a sample mixture was irradiated with simulated solar
light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;) at 25&deg;C under an anaerobic
atmosphere for 24 hours.<br>
<br>
PVP was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, having a Mw of 55,000. PEG was
purchased from Sigma- Aldrich, having a Mw of 1 ,500. PET and PLA were
purchased from Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd.<br>
<br>
The photocatalyst works adequately without the need for a co-catalyst
(see Figure 20), however activity can be enhanced upon addition of
Co(BF4)2 catalyst (Figure 21).<br>
<br>
An increase in photocatalyst activity should also be achievable with
other transition metal co-catalysts, such as Ni and Pt.<br>
<br>
An increase in photocatalyst activity was seen when an organic polymer
or an organic biomass was pre-heated in aqueous base prior to
irradiation (Figure 22). In this experiment, the PVP or a-cellulose
substrate (100 mg of each, a-cellulose as used in the experiments
described above) was suspended in aqueous KOH (1 mL, 10 M) and heated
to 100&deg;C for 1 h whilst stirring. After cooling to room
temperature, the resultant suspension was transferred to a pyrex
photoreactor, containing dried CdS-BF4(1 nmol) and KOH (1 mL, 10 M).
Optionally, Co(BF4)2-6H20 (0.25 mM) may be added to the solution as a
co-catalyst. Each mixture was purged with N2 (containing 2% CH4) for 10
minutes prior to photocatalysis, and the solution was irradiated as
described previously. Thus, a sample mixture was irradiated with
simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;) at 25&deg;C under
an anaerobic atmosphere for 24 hours. The amount of hydrogen evolved is
shown in Figure 22.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Further Experimental and Results</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
As noted in the experimental section above, the photocatalyst of the
invention may be used to degrade and generate hydrogen from common
organic polymers. For example, the inventors have shown that
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyvinyl
pyrrolidone) (PVP), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) are suitable
substrates for the photocatalyst. In further work, the photocatalyst of
the invention is shown to be capable of degrading and/or generating
hydrogen from other polymer types, including polyurethane (PUR),
polyethylene glycol (PEG) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The
photocatalyst may also be used to generate hydrogen from a polymer
substrate pre-treated with base prior to the photocatalytic reaction.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Substrates for Use</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
It is now established that the photocatalysts of the invention may be
used for photocatalytic reforming of a broad range of natural and
synthetic organic polymers. It has been found that some organic
polymers are poor substrates for the photocatalyst, but the hydrogen
production rate may be enhanced or initiated after pre-treatment of the
polymer with base, such as NaOH, prior to the photocatalytic reaction.
The pre-treatment of a polymer is described in further detail in the
section below.<br>
<br>
In a series of reactions, different organic polymers were treated with
a photocatalyst, and the hydrogen evolution over time was monitored. In
a typical experiment a polymer substrate (100 mg) was treated with
CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;) in 10 M NaOH. The mixture was irradiated with
simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 rnW cm&lt;-2&gt;) at 25&deg;C for 4
h under an anaerobic atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Photoreforming of each of the polymers was also studied after
pre-treatment of the polymer with base. Here, each polymer (100 mg) was
mixed with 10 M NaOH (2 ml_), and stirred for 24 h. at 40&deg;C. The
mixture was centrifuged, and the precipitate removed. The supernatant
was then added to CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;), and the mixture was irradiated as
before (thus, simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;at
25&deg;C for 4 h, under an anaerobic atmosphere).<br>
<br>
The polymers tested included a-cellulose, PLA (polylactic acid), PET
(polyethylene terephthalate), PUR (polyurethane), PVP
(polyvinylpyrrolidine), PEG (polyethylene glycol), LDPE (low-density
polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), PMMA (poly(methyl
methacrylate)), PS (polystyrene), PC (polycarbonate), chitin, chitosan,
casein and BSA (bovine serum albumin). Polycarbonate (pellets,
Mw45,000), polyethylene glycol (Mw1 ,500), polymethyl methacrylate (Mw
350,000), polypropylene (amorphous), polystyrene (pellets, Mw 35,000),
and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (powder, Mw55,000) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.<br>
<br>
Low density polyethylene (powder, 300 &#956;&#951;&#953;), polyethylene terephthalate
(powder, 300 &#956;&#951;&#953;), polylactic acid (pellets, 3 mm), polyurethane (foam,
10&lt;&#967;&gt;100&lt;&#967;&gt;100 mm&lt;3&gt;, density 0.08 g cm&lt;-3&gt;),
and unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (powder, 250 &#956;&#951;&#953;) were obtained
from Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd. Polylactic acid and polyurethane were
ground in a coffee grinder to provide powders with particles having
diameters of approximately 900 and 1 ,400 &#956;&#951;&#953;, respectively.<br>
<br>
NaOD (40 wt% in D20), and NaOH were purchased from Fischer Scientific.
D20 (99.96 atom% D) was obtained from Euriso-Top. The plastic water
bottle was purchased from M&amp;S Cambridge Rail Simply Food, Station
Rd, Cambridge CB1 2JW, drained of water, dried and then ground using a
coffee grinder into pieces&#8804; 1 cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
<br>
Figures 23 and 24 show the amount of hydrogen evolved from a range of
polymers with and without pre-treatment of that polymer with base. The
amount of hydrogen collected is the amount collected after 4 hours of
irradiation.<br>
<br>
The results show that many polymers may be degraded under the
photocatalytic reaction conditions, and frequently the pre-treatment of
the polymer substrate with base enhances hydrogen evolution. In some
cases, hydrogen evolution is not observed when a polymer substrate is
irradiated in the presence of the photocatalyst (for example, for the
polymers PVC, PS and PC). However, hydrogen evolution is seen when
these polymer substrates are pre-treated with base. A summary of the
results is set out below for each polymer tested.<br>
<br>
Polylactic acid (PLA). Very high hydrogen production was observed, and
the hydrogen evolution was not greatly affected by a pre-treatment. The
polymer is believed to degrade to lactic acid when it is added to the
basic photocatalyst-containing mixture. It is also believed that
pyruvic acid is formed during photoreforming.<br>
<br>
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Moderate hydrogen production was
observed, and the hydrogen production rate was increased greatly (by
around five times) when the substrate was pre-treated with base. The
inventors were also able to repeat the work using a PET sample taken
from a consumer product water bottle.<br>
<br>
During the reaction it was observed that terephthalic acid was
produced, and this precipitated from the reaction mixture as its
disodium salt (disodium terephthalate) and could be recovered. Other
products of the reaction were likely to include ethylene glycol,
glycolic acid, acetic acid, formic acid and ethanol.<br>
<br>
Polyurethane (PUR). Low hydrogen production was observed, and the
production rate was increased greatly (by around six times) when the
substrate was pre-treated with base. The products of the
photoreformation reaction likely included diaminotoluene, formic acid,
acetic acid, lactic acid and pyruvic acid. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).
Low hydrogen production was observed, and the production was increased
greatly (by greater than ten times) when the substrate was pre-treated
with base. Polyethylene glycol (PEG). Low hydrogen production was
observed, and the production was increased greatly (by around three
times) when the substrate was pre-treated with base.<br>
<br>
Low density polyethylene (LDPE). A very low hydrogen production was
observed, both with and without pre-treatment of the polymer substrate.<br>
<br>
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), Polystyrene (PS) and Polycarbonate
(PC). No hydrogen production was observed without pre-treatment of the
polymer substrate. With pre-treatment a very low hydrogen production
was observed. The results for the polymers described above are shown in
Figure 23, and are set out in Table 11 below.<br>
<br>
Table 11<br>
Chitin, chitosan, casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA). Low hydrogen
production was observed. The casein and BSA polymers were not
pre-treated. The results are shown in Figure 24, and are set out in
Table 12 below. In further experiments, chitin and chitosan were
pre-treated, and the results are shown in Figure 25.<br>
<br>
Table 12Analysis of Substrate and Substrate Degradation Products<br>
<br>
The reaction of the polymer substrates under the photodegradation
methods of the present invention was studied by&lt;1&gt;H NMR
spectroscopy. In a series of experiments the degradation of PL-A, PET
and PU was investigated.<br>
<br>
Similar to the photoreforming experiments describe above, a polymer
substrate (50 mg) was treated with CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;) in 10 M NaOD in D20
(2 ml_). The mixture was irradiated with simulated solar light (AM
1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;) at 25&deg;C for 24 h under an anaerobic
atmosphere.<br>
<br>
Samples of each polymer were taken before and after photoreforming,
filtered and analysed by&lt;1&gt;H NMR spectroscopy using a Bruker 400
MHz Avance spectrometer at room temperature. The spectra are shown in
Figure 26.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pre-Treatment of Organic Substrate</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
The inventors have found that hydrogen production, such as the hydrogen
production rate, in the photocatalytic treatment of an organic
substrate may be enhanced when that organic substrate is pre-treated
with base. It has also been found that this pre-treatment prevents
contamination of the solid photoreforming leftovers with Cd.<br>
<br>
The improvement in hydrogen production rate is shown in Figures 23 and
25 and Table 11 for a range of organic substrates. The conditions for
the pre-treatment were studied in order to identify an optimal set of
conditions. In each pre-treatment a PET substrate (at 25 mg/mL) was
treated with 10 M NaOH for a set time. After this time undissolved
substrate was optionally removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant
was used in a photoreforming reaction.<br>
<br>
The supernatant (2 mL) was added to CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;), and the mixture
was irradiated with simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW
cm&lt;-2&gt;at 25&deg;C for 4 h) in a sealed photoreactor under an
anaerobic atmosphere with an internal volume of 7.91 mL. The conditions
investigated for the pre-treatment are set out below:<br>
<br>
A: 24 h stir at 40&deg;C, centrifuge<br>
B: 24 h rest at room temperature, centrifuge<br>
C: 24 h stir at 80&deg;C, centrifuge<br>
D: 24 h stir at 40&deg;C, no centrifuge<br>
E: 48 h stir at 40&deg;C, centrifuge<br>
F: 24 h stir at room temperature, centrifuge<br>
<br>
None: no pre-treatment The amount of hydrogen evolved after 4 hours in
the subsequent photoreforming reaction was recorded. The results are
shown in Figure 27. The results show that condition A provided the
highest rate of hydrogen evolution, and these conditions were used in
the experiments described above for the range of organic substrates.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Base for Use</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
In the experimental preparation of the photocatalyst described
previously, CdS|CdOxwas formed in a highly basic aqueous solution of
KOH. It has now been shown that aqueous NaOH can be used in place of
aqueous KOH to lower the cost of photoreforming without affecting the
performance of the CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst.<br>
<br>
Thus, the CdS|CdOxphotocatalyst was prepared as described previously
except that 10 M KOH was replaced with 10 M NaOH. The resulting
photocatalyst was used to treat a-cellulose and PET. Thus, a-cellulose
(100 mg) and PET (100 mg) were exposed to<br>
<br>
CdS|CdOx(0.5 &#956;&#924;) in the presence of 10 M NaOH or KOH (10 mL) under
simulated solar light (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm&lt;-2&gt;) at 25&deg;C under
an anaerobic atmosphere. The evolution of hydrogen from the
photoreforming reaction was monitored, and the amount of hydrogen
collected after 4 hours of irradiation was measured. The results are
shown in Figure 28. References<br>
