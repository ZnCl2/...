        </big><br>
        <b>by Walter Rawls</b><br>
      </div>
      Â©2003 Biomagnetics International, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      It has been said that magnetism is not energy and does not flow.
      The following is submitted:<br>
      <br>
      Energy is a concept so basic that no terms more fundamental can
      describe it.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, especially in science, it has been qualified in more
      basic units by relating it to mass, velocity, temperature, and so
      on.<br>
      <br>
      When Newton formulated his laws of motion, he did not mention
      energy. Thomas Young (1773-1829), about eighty years after Newton,
      took the term from a Greek word meaning "work" and applied it to
      what we now call the kinetic energy of a body.<br>
      <br>
      Half a century later, Rankin coined the term 'potential energy'.
      Both of these terms concern mechanical physics and their relation
      to thermal energy (HEAT), but it was not realized until Joule
      (1818-1889) demonstrated that heat produced by the passage of an
      electric current through a wire was related to the square of the
      current and that heat was produced by mechanical work.<br>
      <br>
      Lord Kelvin (1824-1907) and Carnot (1796-1832) never accepted that
      heat was anything other than a fluid, called calorie, possessed by
      hot bodies.<br>
      <br>
      It was Einstein (1879-1955) who showed that every physical
      occurrence of whatever kind can be specified completely only if it
      is known when, as well as where, it occurred.<br>
      <br>
      From Einstein's relativity of energy and mass also grew the idea
      (with "flow" overwhelmingly accepted at that time), that matter
      can be rearranged, but not destroyed. Mass at rest is equivalent
      to an amount of energy; but in motion, the effective mass (and
      therefore the effective energy) increases according to the
      velocity of the body in relation to the velocity of light.<br>
      <br>
      For energy to do work and to be useable it must be able to flow to
      be transferred from one place to another. For example, a heat
      engine will only function with a useable temperature difference
      because only then can heat energy flow.<br>
      <br>
      It has followed that units of energy have been thus specified,
      such as:<br>
      <br>
      Calories, therms, and British Thermal Units (for heat),<br>
      Watt-hours (for electrical energy),<br>
      Foot-pounds and kilogram-metres for (mechanical energy), and<br>
      Gauss-oersteds (for the permanent magnet industry).<br>
      <br>
      Energy is stored in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet
      because it will move a piece of iron in the vicinity, thus doing
      work on the iron. We pause here to remind the reader that the
      foregoing is accepted science. It is not unusual for a part (or
      parts) of accepted scientific knowledge to be misapplied or not
      disseminated thoroughly throughout the scientific community.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of editorials and scientific magazines, as well
      as comments by noteworthy publicly employed and private
      scientists, addressed to this difficulty. For example, the eminent
      scientist and mathematician, Gilbert, in the time of Elizabeth the
      First of Great Britain, proclaimed that the Earth was like a giant
      magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Since Gilbert, this has been accepted science (although perhaps
      not emphasized or used properly for clarifications of energy and
      flow).<br>
      <br>
      Since the industrial revolution...really since Benjamin Franklin,
      through Edison, Tesla, and even until the mid-1900's, the thrust
      has been on electrical energy in private and public use. That was
      until the advent of atomic energy. If a machine works...if a bomb
      can explode, then it is accepted. And even now, the scientific
      community divides between relativity and quantum mechanics in a
      broader sense of disciplines.<br>
      <br>
      Question!<br>
      <br>
      For energy to do work it must flow, so how can magnetism not flow
      as science accepts that it does work, and is energy? Still, we
      find prestigious scientific references that will say magnetism is
      energy and does not flow. This is a paradox of words (which are
      actually symbols) and not unusual as we rush ahead rapidly to
      improve upon and build greater devices. All the while, however, it
      is all too often done at the very expense of gaining more
      comprehension of the basics we have accepted on the path to
      achieving that very growth.<br>
      <br>
      Here is another example of a science principle overlooked in
      relation to the importance of magnetism versus electricity (our
      two basic disciplines of useable energy in societies). In the
      discovery by Faraday in 1851, he realized that it is not just the
      actual motion of flow of the electrons that are at the center of
      electricity. Rather, it is the electric and magnetic (force)
      fields they set up as they move along.<br>
      <br>
      It is well to note that in 1865, when Maxwell published his
      theories of electromagnetism, both electricity and magnetism were
      related in an exact mathematical fashion, one equal to the other
      and interrelated.<br>
      <br>
      The rapid development of the atomic theory, with its discovery
      that all matter is ultimately composed of (among other particles)
      electrons, meant that electricity gained the more central
      prominence in physics. This added to the earlier important
      discoveries of Hertz (a light wave is merely a traveling
      electromagnetic wave).<br>
      <br>
      Electrons exist in the atom orbiting around the nucleus. They are
      held there by the electromagnetic attraction existing between the
      negative charge carried by the electron and the positive charge of
      the nucleus. It is the same as the way in which the moon is held
      in orbit by the gravitational attraction between it and the Earth.
      The heavier atoms can have as many as ninety electrons swirling
      around the nucleus moving from one orbit to another giving us a
      source of energy for light, x-rays, etc.<br>
      <br>
      It is the behavior of the electron clouds of the different atoms
      and the way the clouds link together that gives us the chemical
      properties of all matter.<br>
      <br>
      The electron can behave like a particle or a wave (cables of
      spinning circular energy in frequency waves and particles, i.e.
      Davis and Rawls). The most important charged particle, the
      electron, carries a negative charge. Davis and Rawls, when pressed
      to state a preference between the negative and positive separate
      and distinct magnetic energies, will say the negative magnetic
      energy is more desirable for applications and effects, although a
      balance between the two energies is essential.<br>
      <br>
      One of the themes of Davis and Rawls' book, The Magnetic Blueprint
      of Life, stresses the importance of negative energy in a number of
      scientific areas characterized in line with accepted physics, in
      the form of spin in the Nature of this energy. It is interesting
      to note here that the word "electron" also comes from the Greek
      word, and was first applied to magnetism, not electricity. It is,
      of course, still applied to magnetism, and becomes more important
      with the applications and effects seen by Davis and Rawls.<br>
      <br>
      Davis and Rawls' discoveries have their roots in accepted science.
      To understand the basics as presented, it is neccessary to
      understand that by the scientific principle of application and
      effect, magnetism is as important (if not more so) as electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Considering electromagnetic dictums, this is the principle. But
      the application and effect of magnetism has not been, in practice,
      equal to the use of electricity. It is believed that clarification
      of magnetism, at least in the discovery of the two separate and
      distinct energies fitting into definite scientific principles of
      cause and effect, will change this appreciation of magnetism's
      importance one day.<br>
      <br>
      What does the scientific community say about magnetic flux in
      regard to flow? There are two general camps of belief:<br>
      <br>
      1. That it flows, and<br>
      <br>
      2. That it does not flow.<br>
      <br>
      The only right or wrong belief about its flow is to be judged on
      whether the concept is useful to a particular individual. For
      example, it is more profitable to think of flux as merely being
      set up because it represents stored energy. In this case, it
      thusly does not flow and does not have a continuous loss of power
      as in the case when electric current flows in a wire.<br>
      <br>
      For others, the analogue is more profitable if flux is considered
      to be a more precise analogue of electric current, so that a
      magnetic circuit can be given the properties appropriate to
      inductance and capacitance in an electric current.<br>
      <br>
      Electricity flowing is an analogue as is magnetism flowing,
      depending on the use, application and effect. Prestigious
      scientific references are in conflict as Van Nostrand's will say
      no flow and the International Edition of the Science and Invention
      Encyclopedia will say otherwise. The analogue explanation seems
      more plausible for the scientific community's present position.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we note the accepted practice of using a "keeper" for a
      magnet. Flow is considered magnetic flux from one pole to another.
      Each part of a magnet is a domain, a self-contained energy source,
      except for the Bloch wall (the center dividing portion), which
      cannot be measured with available instrumentation.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetism will flow from pole to pole and over a period of time
      there is a loss of magnetism from the pole ends into infinity.
      Eventually, you would have a dead magnet (which could be
      recharged). A "keeper" is used to slow down and prevent this loss
      of energy flowing into infinity.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic domains are negative and positive, not just as symbols
      for identification, but in accordance with physics and natural
      laws of energy spin in relation to the distance of a magnet's
      poles to its center. The flow of energy is in cables of spinning
      circular energy, initially, from south to north. However, the
      constant flow is in both directions.<br>
      <br>
      This is a synopsis, not a detailed explanation needing many pages,
      experiments, etc. Also, we are not going into radiation and wave
      frequency herein. However, we will say that the only thing that
      distinguishes one kind of radiation from another is its wavelength
      (or frequency) and that the study of electromagnetism is basic to
      the whole of science. After all, the Earth receives most of its
      energy from the sun by electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, we say that the already accepted basics of science
      - before Davis and Rawls - did accept magnetism as energy that
      flows, although not in unanimity among the scientific community.
      Davis and Rawls' applications and effects give more importance to
      these basics.<br>
      <br>
      Davis and Rawls consider themselves their own worst critics, but
      nonetheless have to ask: If our diagnostic system, patented on the
      separate energies, works 100% of the time on the animal and human
      body - and the explanation of this working is not correct - then
      can someone come forth with a scientific explanation of why it
      works other than the way Davis and Rawls explain?<br>
      <br>
      So far no one has. And we do not believe they can.<br>

      The following is a very basic introduction to the incredible&nbsp;
      researches of Albert Roy Davis and Walter Rawls.&nbsp; Davis is no
      longer living, but Rawls currently lives in Florida around
      Jacksonville.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;We highly recommend the purchase&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      following books detailing the researches of these two brilliant
      investigators.<br>
      <br>
      "Magnetism and its Effects on the Living System" -- Explains for
      the first time how magnetism affects your life and the life of all
      living systems around you. The result of years of investigation
      into the laws&nbsp; of&nbsp; magnetism,&nbsp; it&nbsp; explains
      the discovery that a magnet has not one effect on the&nbsp; living
      syste but TWO&nbsp; EFFECTS,&nbsp; each&nbsp; supplied&nbsp;
      by&nbsp; the&nbsp; two&nbsp; forms of energy transmitted from each
      pole.&nbsp; You&nbsp; or&nbsp; any other qualified person can
      reproduce the projects in this book.&nbsp; (Illustrated)<br>
      <br>
      "The Magnetic Effect" -- In this&nbsp; book,&nbsp; Davis and Rawls
      present and discuss&nbsp; biomagnetic experiments and&nbsp;
      research that have been successfully duplicated by members of the
      orthodox scientific&nbsp; community.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; author
      reveal the&nbsp;&nbsp; factual,&nbsp; natural&nbsp; basis&nbsp;
      of&nbsp; applied&nbsp;&nbsp; biomagnetic energies and&nbsp;
      add&nbsp; greatly&nbsp; to the understanding of this new and
      exciting field.&nbsp; The computer-exact and reproducible findings
      in this work&nbsp; apply&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      treatment&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp; such&nbsp; conditions&nbsp;
      as arthritis, cancer, glaucoma, sexual problems, and aging.<br>
      <br>
      "The Magnetic Blueprint of Life" -- Written with forcefulness and
      precision, this is a comprehensive guide to the effect of
      magnetism upon the air&nbsp; we&nbsp; breathe, the food we&nbsp;
      eat,&nbsp; the&nbsp; exercise we take.&nbsp; It is an eloquent
      plea to the scientific community to reconsider the significance of
      basic magnetism...."the most important energy in Nature."<br>
      <br>
      BioMagnetics ( Part 1 )<br>
      by Jerry W. Decker<br>
      with information from "The Magnetic Effect" by Albert Roy Davis
      and Walter C. Rawls<br>
      <br>
      One of the most important series&nbsp; of&nbsp; experiments&nbsp;
      ever done and yet still not widely known, were those carried out
      by Albert&nbsp; Roy&nbsp; Davis in conjunction with Walter
      Rawls.&nbsp; These experiments are FUNDAMENTAL to an understanding
      of magnetic forces and are to this day not being used widely
      because many have never heard of them.<br>
      <br>
      They found that&nbsp; each pole of a magnet has SPECIFIC effects
      that are quite different from those of a full&nbsp; magnet&nbsp;
      where&nbsp; both&nbsp; poles are applied simultaneously.&nbsp;
      These polar effects are deemed "mono-polar" for one
      pole.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; poles&nbsp; spin&nbsp; in&nbsp;
      opposite directions&nbsp; and&nbsp; have opposite properties.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, North Pole&nbsp;&nbsp; energies&nbsp;&nbsp;
      cause&nbsp; mass&nbsp; to&nbsp; contract&nbsp; and condense,
      rotating in a CCW direction,&nbsp; while&nbsp; South&nbsp;
      Pole&nbsp; energies cause mass to&nbsp; expand&nbsp; and
      dissipate, rotating in&nbsp; a&nbsp; CW&nbsp; direction. Also,
      North Pole&nbsp; energies have alkaline properties while South
      Pole energy is acid.&nbsp; North pole energies&nbsp; tend&nbsp;
      to&nbsp; collect fluids while South Pole energies dissipate
      fluids.&nbsp; North pole energy is referred to as negative&nbsp;
      because&nbsp; it&nbsp; reduces or attracts, while&nbsp;
      South&nbsp; pole energy is referred to as positive because it
      expands and dissipates.<br>
      <br>
      Since magnetic monopole&nbsp; magnets&nbsp; are not available at
      just any Wal-Mart store, they chose to use the&nbsp; longest&nbsp;
      possible bar or cylinder magnets they could&nbsp; acquire&nbsp;
      which&nbsp; would&nbsp; allow&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; greatest
      separation of the two opposite energies.<br>
      <br>
      It was found&nbsp; that&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; a North Pole
      would provide an energetic environment which would cause cancer
      cells to contract and die out. This energetic environment also has
      other healthy applications as detailed in their many books.<br>
      <br>
      I had the&nbsp; pleasure of visiting with Walter Rawls one
      afternoon at his office in Jacksonville, Florida several years
      back. We discussed many things including Keely, of which he&nbsp;
      had never heard. Mr. Rawls mailing address is<br>

      Should you wish&nbsp; to&nbsp; carry&nbsp; out your own
      experiments with magnets as blazed by these pioneers, here are
      some helpful tips.<br>
      <br>
      CORRECT POLE IDENTIFICATION<br>
      <br>
      First, you need to understand how to correctly identify the
      polarity of any magnet.&nbsp; In Davis/Rawls own words:<br>
      <br>
      "The North pole of a magnet seeks&nbsp; a South pole; likewise, a
      South&nbsp; pole seeks a North pole.&nbsp; The North pole of a
      magnet&nbsp; is&nbsp; NOT the North-SEEKING pole, nor is the South
      pole the South-SEEKING pole.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the North-SEEKING pole of a magnet is ACTUALLY the South
      pole! The South-SEEKING pole of a magnet is the North pole. The
      rule to remember is OPPOSITES ATTRACT and SIMILARS REPEL.<br>
      <br>
      Test a magnet for correct usage by identifying the separate poles
      correctly.&nbsp; Using&nbsp; a&nbsp; bar or cylinder magnet, tie a
      thread around the exact center of the magnet,&nbsp; with&nbsp;
      the&nbsp; thread having a loose end.<br>
      <br>
      Tie the&nbsp; loose&nbsp; end of the thread to any stationary
      overhang that allows the magnet to turn without&nbsp;
      hindrance&nbsp; in space.&nbsp; When the magnet stops&nbsp;
      turning,&nbsp; the&nbsp; end&nbsp; of the magnet pointing&nbsp;
      in&nbsp; the direction of&nbsp; the&nbsp; earth's&nbsp;
      North&nbsp; pole&nbsp; is the South pole of the magnet.&nbsp; You
      may need a simple&nbsp; compass&nbsp; to determine the earth's
      North pole direction.<br>
      <br>
      After you have determined the South pole of the magnet, mark that
      pole end with red fingernail polish or paint.&nbsp; Once&nbsp; you
      have one magnet properly&nbsp; identified for North and South
      poles this magnet can be&nbsp; used to IDENTIFY the&nbsp;
      North&nbsp; and&nbsp; South&nbsp; poles&nbsp; of&nbsp; OTHER
      magnets.&nbsp; (They&nbsp; use the color RED to indicate&nbsp;
      danger&nbsp; and&nbsp; thus avoid it for biological
      experiments.&nbsp; The reason being that since it causes&nbsp;
      a&nbsp; swelling of tissue, the fluids flow more freely, it
      accelerates life and growth.&nbsp; If&nbsp; you have a bacteria or
      disease, it will&nbsp; also&nbsp; ACCELERATE&nbsp; its&nbsp;
      growth&nbsp; and&nbsp; so&nbsp;&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; be&nbsp;
      quite dangerous.)<br>
      <br>
      For example,&nbsp; if&nbsp; we&nbsp; bring&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      South&nbsp; pole of any magnet up to another magnet's pole, a
      REPELLING&nbsp; force&nbsp; shows that the pole of the unknown
      magnet is the South pole.&nbsp; An ATTRACTING&nbsp; force shows
      that the unknown pole is the North pole.<br>
      <br>
      You may&nbsp; wish&nbsp; to purchase a small inexpensive
      magnetometer.&nbsp; The sensitive needle of this instrument moves
      in one direction or the other depending on the separate&nbsp;
      magnetic pole in close vicinity. The law of magnetism is a PRIMARY
      law of nature: Like forces REPEL - unlike forces ATTRACT.<br>
      <br>
      ESTIMATING FIELD STRENGTH<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic field strength&nbsp; is measured in units called&nbsp;
      gauss.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since magnets are not sold with this value
      printed on them and gaussmeters are expensive, you&nbsp;
      need&nbsp; a&nbsp; way&nbsp; to determine the approximate field
      strength.<br>
      <br>
      Magnets are generally&nbsp; sold by their&nbsp; LIFTING&nbsp;
      power.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&nbsp; is,&nbsp; a horseshoe magnet is
      offered as having a lifting power,&nbsp; when&nbsp; placed against
      a piece&nbsp; of&nbsp; heavy&nbsp; metal,&nbsp; of&nbsp; 2&nbsp;
      pounds to 25 pounds to 50 pounds, depending on the size, type, or
      kind of magnet.<br>
      <br>
      As a guide to the approximate gauss&nbsp; of commercial magnets,
      consider the following:<br>
      <br>
      A magnet having a lifting power of 2 pounds may&nbsp; vary from
      500 to 600 gauss units; a lifting power of 5 pounds may vary from
      900 to 1200 gauss; a lifting power of 25 pounds is usually around
      2000 gauss; with 50 pounds lifting power, 3500 to 4500 gauss.<br>
      <br>
      For more precise&nbsp;&nbsp; measurement,&nbsp;&nbsp;
      an&nbsp;&nbsp; equipment&nbsp;&nbsp; aid,&nbsp; such&nbsp;
      as&nbsp; a magnetometer, should be employed.<br>
      <br>
      Care must be taken to properly determine&nbsp; which&nbsp;
      pole&nbsp; is&nbsp; North and which is South, based on the above
      criteria.<br>
      <br>
      When I was visiting with Walter in Florida, he very&nbsp;
      kindly&nbsp; gave me an assortment of&nbsp; magnets&nbsp; and
      books as well as an interesting meter that is used to measure the
      field strength AND POLARITY of a magnet.<br>
      <br>
      This meter allows&nbsp; you to quickly and accurately determine
      what pole is North or&nbsp; South.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; also&nbsp;
      has&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions&nbsp; for&nbsp; helping&nbsp; to
      determine the field&nbsp; strength.&nbsp; The meter sells
      for&nbsp; $50&nbsp; and&nbsp; is&nbsp; a quick way to VISUALLY
      determine the polarity of any magnet.<br>
      <br>
      CARE AND HANDLING OF MAGNETS<br>
      <br>
      To prevent breakage&nbsp; and&nbsp; loss&nbsp; of&nbsp; magnetic
      power, you should never drop or strike the magnet with a
      sharp&nbsp; blow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only can it chip but it can also
      lose magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Magnets should never be stored in a hot location.&nbsp; Most
      magnets lose ALL their power at temperatures from 400 to 500
      degrees&nbsp; Fahrenheit. The loss occurs&nbsp; at&nbsp; the CURIE
      point, where the magnetic domains are no longer aligned and become
      chaotic.<br>
      <br>
      After using a magnet, you should&nbsp; place&nbsp; both&nbsp;
      ends&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; magnet against a structure of flat
      metal.&nbsp; This will allow&nbsp; the&nbsp; magnet&nbsp; to
      maintain its original&nbsp; strength.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such&nbsp;
      a&nbsp; structure&nbsp; is&nbsp; called&nbsp; a "keeper."&nbsp;
      Magnets should be kept&nbsp; away&nbsp; from each other.&nbsp; If
      placed where the poles&nbsp; of&nbsp; separate&nbsp; magnets&nbsp;
      repel,&nbsp; there&nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp; be&nbsp; a
      "bleeding-off" of the energy.&nbsp; A loss of energy in this
      manner would be rapid.<br>
      <br>
      WHY YOU SHOULD NOT USE ELECTROMAGNETS<br>
      <br>
      Very effective and&nbsp; powerful&nbsp; magnets are made by
      passing electrical energy through a coil of wire having&nbsp;
      a&nbsp; metal, iron, or steel core. However, there is&nbsp;
      a&nbsp; difference between the magnetism&nbsp; produced&nbsp; in
      this manner and&nbsp; the&nbsp; magnetism&nbsp; from&nbsp; a&nbsp;
      solid&nbsp; state&nbsp; bar or metal composition magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetism HAS A&nbsp; FREQUENCY.&nbsp;&nbsp; It&nbsp; also&nbsp;
      has&nbsp; motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; rate&nbsp; of vibration
      depends on&nbsp; the&nbsp; size,&nbsp; length, width, and&nbsp;
      power&nbsp; of&nbsp; the magnet.&nbsp; Solid state&nbsp;
      composition&nbsp; magnets,&nbsp; such as metal, iron and steel,
      are CONSTANT in their rate&nbsp; of&nbsp; vibration&nbsp;
      DEPENDING on their structure.&nbsp; An electromagnet,&nbsp;
      however,&nbsp; may&nbsp; present&nbsp; a&nbsp; number&nbsp; of
      different types of vibrations.<br>
      <br>
      Any kind of&nbsp; electromagnet&nbsp; has&nbsp; many turns of
      insulated wire.&nbsp; Each turn of this wire presents so many
      lines of magnetism.&nbsp; Actually, we have discovered that these
      lines&nbsp; of&nbsp; force&nbsp; are&nbsp; really&nbsp;
      CABLES&nbsp; of force, as explained&nbsp; in our earlier
      publications.&nbsp;&nbsp; (See&nbsp; RAWLS1.ASC and RAWLS1.GIF on
      KeelyNet)<br>
      <br>
      However, a coil&nbsp; wound&nbsp; a&nbsp; certain&nbsp;
      number&nbsp; of turns has a different frequency from a fixed metal
      or composition&nbsp; magnet.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; the&nbsp; coil
      heats, the resistance&nbsp; to&nbsp; the flow of current
      INCREASES.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&nbsp; we have a SLOW DROP in magnetic
      lines, or cables, of force to a RISE IN FORCE, depending
      upon&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; wire&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;
      core&nbsp; materials&nbsp; used&nbsp; for construction.&nbsp;
      Therefore, the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vibrations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      supplied&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the electromagnet
      are NOT&nbsp; AS&nbsp; CONSTANT&nbsp; as&nbsp; those&nbsp;
      from&nbsp; the&nbsp; metal&nbsp; or composition magnet.<br>
      <br>
      Our research has&nbsp; revealed that size, width, and overall
      length of a magnet GOVERNS FREQUENCY in electrical electron
      vibrations.&nbsp; This is a discovery not known by the
      general&nbsp; scientific&nbsp; community, because we have
      not&nbsp; published&nbsp; our scientific materials on&nbsp;
      this&nbsp; research finding.&nbsp; We are&nbsp; working&nbsp; on
      this discovery in the establishment of provable laws that&nbsp;
      we&nbsp; will&nbsp; disclose&nbsp;&nbsp; when&nbsp;
      completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; feel confident this future
      disclosure will open new avenues&nbsp; that neither we nor the
      general scientific community could properly comprehend at this
      time.&nbsp;&nbsp; (printed in The Magnetic Effect in 1975)<br>
      <br>
      I asked Walter&nbsp; about&nbsp; this&nbsp; frequency&nbsp;
      business with magnets and at that time, he would not disclose
      how&nbsp; the&nbsp; measurements were made as it was
      proprietary&nbsp; to&nbsp; their&nbsp; company, BioMagnetics&nbsp;
      International. There are over&nbsp; 36&nbsp; international&nbsp;
      patents&nbsp; based on the Davis/Rawls discoveries.<br>
      <br>
      Also at the time I spoke with Walter,&nbsp; he&nbsp; said they had
      developed a couch that could DIAGNOSE problem areas in the body
      with an accuracy of 99%.&nbsp; It&nbsp; uses&nbsp; magnets&nbsp;
      to&nbsp; create a response&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; body&nbsp; to
      indicate an infected&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; diseased&nbsp;
      location.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; response&nbsp; is described in
      the books listed above and has to do with a contraction of tissue
      when in the presence of a North pole energy.<br>
      <br>
      It is interesting that the Floyd (Sparky)&nbsp; Sweet&nbsp; Vacuum
      Triode uses magnets that are "tuned" to the 60 cps
      frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp; allows the device to pull&nbsp;
      in&nbsp; space&nbsp; energy&nbsp; at&nbsp; a&nbsp; frequency that
      requires no alteration to run off the shelf devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      We also understand he has "pulled" as much&nbsp; as&nbsp; 3000
      watts of free energy directly&nbsp; from&nbsp; this space energy
      source,&nbsp; also&nbsp; called&nbsp; the ZPE or hyperspace or
      virtual<br>
      flux.&nbsp; The magnets are put under a tremendous stress by
      placing like poles against one&nbsp; another,&nbsp;
      then&nbsp;&nbsp; binding&nbsp;&nbsp; them&nbsp;&nbsp;
      together,&nbsp; this effectively creates a giant magnet with
      spatial stress&nbsp; bubble.&nbsp; All that is listed on KeelyNet
      as SWEET1 through SWEET4 and the diagrams are listed as
      VTAPAK.ZIP.<br>
      <br>
      The device also&nbsp; appears&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; LOCALE&nbsp;
      DEPENDENT, meaning that it works better in some areas than
      others.&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp; our&nbsp; knowledge, no one has yet
      publicly&nbsp; admitted&nbsp; to&nbsp; successfully
      duplicating&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sweet device.<br>
      <br>
      We are told&nbsp; Sweet&nbsp; is&nbsp; under&nbsp; a&nbsp; Secrecy
      Order by the United States government that forbids his
      discussing&nbsp; or&nbsp; working further with his own
      discovery.&nbsp; If he'd only "slip" a copy of the plans out, we'd
      be very happy to distribute them across the computer&nbsp;
      networks&nbsp; and&nbsp; to many other researchers who would make
      it a reality for all.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>The Revolutionary Discoveries of Davis
            and Rawls</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Albert Roy Davis was the first scientist in the world to discover,
      in 1936, that magnetism consists of two separate and distinct
      energies, each having opposite effects on matter.<br>
      <br>
      This revolutionary discovery forever changed the field of
      magnetic/electromagnetic research. Albert Roy Davis is the founder
      of the Science of&nbsp; Biomagnetics (or Biomagnetism) in the
      United States, a term which means the study of the effects of a
      magnet's energies on the biological system. Magnetic therapy, as
      it is commonly referred to today, is one branch of the science
      called biomagnetism. Never before in recorded history could
      experiments be reproduced, time and time again, with precise and
      predictable results. If you are considering magnetic therapy, you
      must, for your own well-being, have an adequate understanding of
      the effects of the North and South pole energies. Incorrect use of
      a biomagnet (magnet specifically designed for magnetic therapy)
      can have serious undesirable consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the twentieth century and up to the present, a great
      deal of research has been done to determine the effects of
      magnetic fields on living organisms. Researchers had not been able
      to obtain predictable results. All of the researchers throughout
      the world, whether the results showed magnetic energies to have an
      effect or not, were unaware of the fact that the polarity of the
      magnetic field used in their experiments would have a profound
      effect on the outcome. They believed, as scientists have for
      thousands of years, that the North and South poles of magnetism
      were homogeneous (the same) in their effects. You may know someone
      who has tried magnetic therapy and said it seemed to be helpful
      sometimes, but not at other times, or worse yet they may have had
      no improvement at all. Have you wondered why this has been the
      experience of many people who have used biomagnets, and as a
      result no longer do? There are several reasons.<br>
      <br>
      In 1936, Albert Roy Davis discovered that magnetism consists of
      two separate and distinct energies. The North pole has the
      opposite effects of the South pole. To this day, most researchers
      still do not understand this, nor do many companies that sell
      magnetic therapy products. A biomagnet must be constructed in a
      way that separates the two poles of the magnet so that the North
      pole energy is on one side and
      the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South pole
      energy is on the opposite side of the magnet. They are often
      called unipolar magnets, as opposed to bipolar magnets, which have
      the North and South poles on the same side. Other companies that
      do sell unipolar biomagnets take some of the original work done by
      Davis and Rawls, which has been scientifically verified, and then
      wrongfully alter it. It is not uncommon for some doctors,
      scientists, and others to take credit for one or more of their
      discoveries. Using the North pole energy alone is not enough . The
      material the magnet is constructed of, the size,&nbsp; and length
      of time it is used are all important considerations. If biomagnets
      are not used properly they will not only fail to give you the
      results you desire, they can be harmful.<br>
      <br>
      We at Biomagnetics USA have been guided by the greatest scientists
      in magnetic/electromagnetic research in the world, the Albert Roy
      Davis Research Laboratory. When biomagnets are used correctly, as
      determined through decades of research by Davis and Rawls, they
      can offer you benefits that are nothing short of amazing!<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"> <big><b>The Figure Eight</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      No other scientists in history have made more fundamental
      discoveries about magnetism than Albert Roy Davis and Walter C.
      Rawls, Jr. Many years ago Davis discovered that magnetic energies
      spin, North pole in a counterclockwise rotation, and the South
      pole in a clockwise rotation. It is now common to read about the
      spin or vortex of magnetic energies in scientific literature, but
      what is never mentioned in these publications is the fact that
      this was first discovered by Davis. Even scientists and
      researchers of unorthodox science often fail to give credit to
      Davis and Rawls for their discoveries, yet many of them are well
      aware of their work. <br>
      <br>
      Davis also discovered that magnetism flows in and around a magnet
      in the form of a figure "8". The method developed by Michael
      Faraday in 1852 to show the "lines of force" (Davis discovered
      that they are actually cables of force) around a magnet is
      incorrect. Faraday used a flat piece of paper, placed iron filings
      on it, and brought a magnet up under the paper to show the lines
      of force. The truth is that when each particle of steel or iron
      filing is placed in the field of the magnet, it becomes
      temporarily magnetized, in effect, becoming a magnet itself. As
      each particle then attracts and repels, the demonstration presents
      a mistaken concept.<br>
      <br>
      Albert Roy Davis discovered the figure "8" after developing a
      special type of electron photography to photograph the magnetic
      field of a magnet, the same method that was used to take the photo
      on the right. If you examine this photo you can clearly see the
      spin of the cables of force. Davis and Rawls also devised a more
      simplified demonstration to show the lines of force (i.e. cables
      of force), an experiment that can be performed in any classroom
      (see photos below). The method requires a large, clear glass
      container filled with water, some barium ferrite, and a long
      cylinder or bar magnet attached to a non-magnetic handle. The
      barium ferrite is put into the water, and the magnet with the
      handle is used to briskly stir the water to suspend the particles.
      Next, the stirring ceases and the magnet is held vertically in the
      center of the container. The particles will then form and
      reveal&nbsp; the figure eight of magnetic energies. This
      demonstration should be in all of the science textbooks that are
      used to educate students about magnetism... but it is not.<br>
      <br>
      1. Place magnet in container<br>
      2. Stir the water so the barium ferrite is suspended<br>
      3. Observe the figure eight of magnetic energies<br>

      A method is provided for focusing magnetic fields, reducing
      magnetic fields and shielding animate or inanimate subjects from
      magnetic fields. Further a media which has been subjected to a
      shielded or focused magnetic field is applied to a subject, as for
      example, topically. The method, in part, interposes between the
      subjects and the source of a magnetic field, at least one second
      magnetic field disposed in such a manner that the polarity of the
      second magnetic field cancels or at least partially neutralizes
      the magnetic strength of the first magnetic field. The second
      magnetic field can also be disposed so as to permit only a portion
      of the first magnetic field to escape shielding and thereby
      focused in a predetermined direction. Devices which normally emit
      magnetic energy and containing the shielding of the present
      invention are also provided.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>(1) Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates generally to magnetic energies derived from
      a specific magnetic field. In one aspect, this invention is
      directed to shielding of human and inanimate subjects from
      magnetic fields and a method for shielding humans from
      electromagnetic fields such as those generated by transmission
      lines, magnetic resonance imaging devices and the like. The
      invention also is directed to the utilization of such shielding to
      focus electromagnetic energy and to provide devices equipped with
      such shielding. Another aspect of the invention is the use of the
      focused magnetic energies of a particular unidirectional magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(2) Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recently there has been a rising concern by scientists and an
      increasing awareness on the part of the public in general, of the
      potential health hazards of electromagnetic fields. The scientific
      evidence is increasing daily which indicates that exposure to
      magnetic fields might conceivable cause adverse health effects in
      the cells of the human body. A comprehensive background paper was
      recently issued by the Congressional Office of Technology
      Assessment which was prepared by a team at Carnegie Mellon
      University and which indicated that the emerging evidence no
      longer allows one to categorically assert that there are no risks
      associated with electromagnetic fields radiated by cables, wires,
      fixtures and appliances in general.<br>
      <br>
      Although scientists have generally assured the public that there
      was no danger to health, the uncertainty engendered by often
      contradictory data causes some degree of concern.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, while the electromagnetic fields radiated by fixtures
      and appliances found in the home or workplace may be of a
      relatively low level, more sophisticated equipment such as
      transmission lines, large electrical transformers, as well as the
      more recent magnetic resonance imaging devices, which radiate
      greater magnetic field strengths, are undoubtedly of greater
      concern. Magnetism and its effects have been widely discussed in
      the past and it is evident that magnetic energy does indeed effect
      the living organism such as humans and agricultural products.<br>
      <br>
      A wide variety of methods have been reported in the literature
      which are directed to the use of magnetic energy as a diagnostic
      technique and also for the treatment of diseases in warm blooded
      animals including humans. For example, magnetic energy has been
      utilized quite successfully over the past several years to promote
      the formation of osteoblasts in conjunction with the healing of
      bone fractures. In many instances markedly improved results in
      healing times have been achieved by the application of magnetic
      energy to the site of bone fractures and other injuries.<br>
      <br>
      The search for a biological effect due to magnetic fields has a
      long history dating back a hundred years. The literature on
      biomagnetic effects on the growth and development of various
      organisms has been quite extensive showing both positive and
      negative findings. Among the positive findings attributed to
      strong magnetic fields are: altered growth rate, enzyme
      activities, cellular metabolism, DNA synthesis and animal
      orientation. While the mutagenic abilities of strong magnetic
      fields have been controversial, a direct cytotoxic effect on
      mammalian cells has not been reported. As long ago as 1963,
      experiments were performed with a 56 kilogauss static field
      generated in an electromagnet at the Clarendon Laboratory at
      Oxford: at the time the strongest magnetic field available in the
      world, which showed no cytotoxicity with mammalian cells cultured
      in vitro for exposures up to several hours. The recent
      availability of powerful permanent ceramic magnets prompted the
      present studies which showed that to produce cytotoxicity the
      magnetic field needed to be varied.<br>
      <br>
      Previous development of directional magnetic fields began in 1936,
      when A. R. Davis first discovered that the north and the south
      magnetic pole fields each exhibited unique properties with respect
      to their effects on various forms of life. This discovery was slow
      to be accepted because of investigations by others who confused
      Davis' directional polarities magnetic fields with those which are
      simultaneously emitted by horse shoe type magnets and by
      AC-powered electromagnets. The common belief over the years
      relating to magnets has been that the two magnetic poles, north
      and south, are homogeneous and that they emanate the same
      potential type of energy. This belief has been found to be a
      misconception, since the two poles of a magnet are totally
      different in electric potential and effect. Correspondingly, the
      application of the respective poles to living systems has been
      found to produce quite different results. More specifically, it
      has been shown that magnetic energy has an effect on cells such as
      blood cells, nerves, bacteria, et al.<br>
      <br>
      It is also believed that magnetic energy has an effect on cells
      such as blood cells, nerve tissue cells and the like. Preliminary
      investigations regarding biological effects of exposure to
      magnetic fields have indicated a polarity dependence. Cells are
      deemed to be bioelectric in nature, function and behavior and
      studies have indicated that directional magnetic fields enhance
      biological activity. Moreover, due to the orientation of such
      cells and of the metal elements and other ions contained therein,
      the blood cells have been found to decrease certain biological
      effects when exposed to the north pole and to increase other
      biological effect when exposed to the magnetic south pole. This
      same type of reaction has been noted in connection with the other
      type cells of the body, it having been observed that, as a general
      matter, the application of north pole energies to an existing
      unhealthy or abnormal condition tends to have an arresting,
      quieting or relaxing effect, to induce an overall healing reaction
      akin to the body's own defense mechanism. On the other hand, the
      application of south pole energies tends to have a strengthening,
      activating effect, which has been found useful in treating some
      abnormal conditions, particularly those associated with a slowing
      or weakening in function. Cancer cells exposed to the north field
      show a significant decrease in the number of surviving cells after
      a period of incubation. Conversely, the same type of cells, when
      exposed to the south field, indicated an increase in the number of
      surviving cells compared to the unexposed controls. A more
      detailed description of magnetic pole energies can be found in
      Davis et al, Magnetism and its Effects On the Living System, Acres
      U.S.A., Kansas City Mo. (1974) and Davis et al, The Magnetic
      Effect, Acres U.S.A., Kansas City Mo. (1975).<br>

      Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are important modalities used to
      treat many types of human cancer. A major virtue of radiotherapy
      is that radiation beams can be aimed to encompass a target volume
      including the tumor while avoiding systemic effects. Within the
      target volume itself, radiation does not distinguish well between
      normal and malignant tissues and the small differential that does
      exist requires the exploitation of kinetic differences in a
      protracted multifraction regimen. On the other hand, some
      chemotherapy agents show a big differential in cytotoxicity
      between dividing and non-dividing cells, if not between normal and
      malignant cells per se, but the concomitant problem is systemic
      toxicity since the drug cannot be aimed. It would appear that a
      varying magnetic field may combine the best features of radio- and
      chemo- therapy; i.e. a big differential in cytotoxicity between
      dividing and plateau phase cells and the possibility of being
      aimed at a limited tumor volume,<br>

      In U.S. Pat. No. 3,337,776, which issued Aug. 22, 1967, there is
      disclosed an apparatus for generating magnetic fields which are
      indicated to be particularly useful for biomedical applications.
      Although the patentee is not specific as to individual
      applications, he does state that magnetic fields generated by the
      apparatus can decrease metabolism values and reacts on the spastic
      syndrome.<br>

      A magnetic probe is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,664,327 which issued May 23, 1972 and states that the probe can
      be employed in relatively inaccessible locations, such as in body
      cavities of animals to cause relaxation of muscle tissue.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic medical treatment device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,921,620 which states that the effects of a magnetic field upon a
      living body are due to the fact that the electrolyte within the
      living body is dissociated by polarization and induced currents
      and is effective in controlling the sympathetic nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      On May 3, 1977, U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,590 issued to A. R. Davis and
      discloses an apparatus and method for treating seeds in a unipolar
      magnetic field. It is indicated in the patent that this treatment
      enhances the germination rate of the seeds, as well as providing
      plants having greater sugar content, increased protein and other
      desirable features.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,935 which issued Jan. 16, 1979 also to A.
      R. Davis, a method is disclosed and claimed which uses magnetic
      fields for clinical examination of animals to determine damaged,
      diseased, abnormal or malfunctioning parts of the body. Changes in
      tensioning and relaxation of the body extremities are an
      indication of body abnormalities.<br>

      A method for treating cancer is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
      4,622,952 which issued Nov. 18, 1986 and which involves timing an
      electromagnetic energy to the resonant energy absorption
      frequencies of the intracellular structures of the selected cells
      and then exposing a subject to this tuned electromagnetic energy
      field. The field can also be tuned to the frequency which has been
      calculated to be closest to the resonant frequency of the cancer
      cells and furthest from the normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,953, which issued to the same patentee,
      disclosed the identical procedure for the treatment of
      atherosclerotic lesions. In this process, metabolic and activity
      varying substances such as ferric hydroxide and dextran were
      employed and by applying the proper resonant energy, the heat in
      the diseased cell is increased by an increment sufficient to kill
      the diseased cell but not sufficient to kill normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      In a patent issued to Robert T. Gordon on May 5, 1987, U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,602,359, a process is described and claimed for the
      treatment of cancer in a host organism which comprises providing
      to the host organism minute particles capable of being inductively
      heated and which are of a size which can be absorbed into cancer
      cells. Thereafter the organism is subjected to an alternating
      electromagnetic field to heat the particles at that point in
      metabolic time when the maximum difference in magnetic
      susceptibility between the cancer cells and normal cells within
      the region occurs, and then continuing the inductive heating to
      increase intracellular temperature to selectively kill the cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      The north pole, which is defined as the north seeking pole, is now
      believed to provide a negative form of energy while the south
      pole, which is defined as the south seeking pole, is believed to
      provide a positive form of energy. It has also been found upon
      examination of the electron paths associated with the fields
      surrounding the respective poles that the south pole end of a
      magnet provides a right hand spin of electrons, i.e., a clockwise
      rotation of electron movement, as contrasted with the north pole
      electron spin, which provide a left hand spin or counterclockwise
      rotation of its electron field.<br>
      <br>
      It has been further observed that the lines of magnetic energy
      leave the south pole to re-enter the magnet at the Bloch Wall
      where the 180 degree phase takes place, and leave the Bloch Wall
      at that point to go on as the north pole energy to re-enter the
      magnet at its north pole.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore evident that magnetic energies do indeed have an
      effect upon plants and living organisms, and which in some
      instances may be detrimental.<br>
      <br>
      Surveys of magnetic resonance imaging devices and other types of
      equipment capable of producing appreciable magnetic fields were
      performed in order to determine the polarity and intensity of
      magnetic fields in areas where there are potentials of both
      occupational exposure and exposure to members of the general
      public.<br>
      <br>
      Considering the potential significance of the foregoing, exposure
      to the South field from devices radiating such energy should be as
      low as is reasonably achievable.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, one or more of the following objects will be achieved
      by the practice of this invention. It is an object of this
      invention to provide a method for shielding human and inanimate
      objects from magnetic fields. Another object is to provide a
      shielding for humans from electromagnetic fields such as those
      generated by transmission lines, magnetic resonance imaging
      devices and the like. A further object of the invention is to
      provide devices equipped with appropriate shielding. These and
      other objects will readily become apparent to those skilled in the

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In its broad aspect this invention is directed to a method for
      shielding humans and inanimate subjects from magnetic fields. The
      method comprises, in part, interposing between the subjects and
      the source of a magnetic field, at least one second magnetic field
      disposed in such a manner that the polarity of the second magnetic
      field cancels or at least partially neutralizes the magnetic
      strength of the first magnetic field. The second magnetic field
      can also be disposed so as to permit only a portion of the first
      magnetic field to escape shielding and thereby focus the magnetic
      energy in a predetermined direction. Devices which normally emit
      magnetic energy and containing the shielding of the present
      invention are also provided.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As indicated above, an aspect of the present invention is directed
      to a method of shielding magnetic energy radiating or emanating
      from a magnetic source. Using the shielding in accordance with the
      procedure of this invention can greatly reduce or even eliminate
      potential danger from a magnetic field, especially energy from any
      South field.<br>
      <br>
      While it has not been established with certainty, the current
      views seem to tend towards the possibility that magnetic fields,
      especially the South magnetic field may adversely effect living
      organisms. It is with this in mind that the present invention was
      conceived in order to reduce or eliminate exposure of humans and
      inanimate objects to unnecessary magnetic energy. While many of
      the devices used in the home today emit little magnetic energy,
      there are other devices wherein exposure to their magnetic field
      may have adverse consequences.<br>
      <br>
      Since there are few, if any, materials which can not be penetrated
      by magnetic energy, it was found that the best way to reduce or
      eliminate unwanted magnetic energy was to utilize a separate an
      opposing magnetic field to counteract the energy of the first
      magnetic source. Accordingly, it was found that by using one or
      more magnets of a lesser strength, but located and oriented in a
      set fashion, the undesirable effect of the first magnetic source
      could be counteracted.<br>
      <br>
      Since the magnetic field strength weakens in proportion to the
      distance away from the magnetic source, it was found that a magnet
      of a relative low strength if properly placed could effectively
      eliminate unwanted radiation. As noted in Examples 1-5 which
      follow, a shield of a lesser strength placed at a predetermined
      distance from the magnetic source, was effective in completely
      neutralizing the magnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the second magnetic field which comprises
      the shield, can be fabricated from a wide variety of materials and
      in a wide variety of configurations. For example, ferrite
      particles or powders can be embedded in a variety of plastic or
      other materials which can then be made into a wide variety of
      shapes and sizes. When such materials are rendered magnetic, then
      can serve as excellent shields for use in the method of the
      present invention. Such materials can be obtained from the Fermag
      Company of Edison, N.J. in various strengths of their magnetic
      fields. For example, magnetic shielding can be obtained having
      magnetic field strengths of from about 1000 to about 1500 gauss
      and higher. The actual strength need will of course be determined
      by the strength of the magnetic source and the proximity of the
      shielding to the source.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated, the shielding can be fabricated in a wide variety of
      shapes and sizes as well as thicknesses. In many instances, using
      the shield in the form of sheets will be sufficient and such
      sheets can be arranged in several layers one behind the other if
      necessary. In other instances, it may be necessary to have the
      shield configured into a cylindrical, spherical or other shape in
      order to provide the optimum shielding of the first magnetic
      source. Additionally, while the shielding can be a magnetized
      material, it is also possible to have the shielding be an
      electromagnet whose power is derived form an electrical source.<br>
      <br>
      Measurement of the field strength of the first magnetic source and
      of the second magnetic source or shielding, can be done with a
      gaussmeter such as Model 5-0-5, which can be obtained from the
      Annis Company of Ind. Also, a magnetometer is available from the
      Albert Roy Davis Research Laboratory, of Green Cove Springs, Fla.
      To identify the poles using this device, the side or end of the
      magnet is brought up to the meter. If the needle moves to the
      right (+), it is the South pole energy that is being measured. If
      the needle moves to the left (-) it is the North pole of the
      magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The distance between the magnetic source and the meter varies with
      the magnetic strength. For this magnetometer, 1/2 inch is about
      150 Gauss; 1 inch, 200 Gauss; 1 and 1/2 inch 300 Gauss, 2 and 1/2
      inches 500 Gauss; 5 inches, 1800 Gauss; 9 inches, 3500 Gauss; 12
      inches 4500 Gauss; and the like. Although different gaussmeters
      will have different scales, the data obtained with one meter will
      be relative to the different field strengths for the particular
      magnets tested and the distance of the meter from the magnetic
      source.<br>
      <br>
      In general, it has been observed that the energy radiating from
      the South pole is the energy which might have adverse effects on
      humans. Thus, by utilizing a shield in accordance with the
      teachings of this invention wherein this South pole energy is
      neutralized, humans can be protected from such adverse effects.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples are illustrative of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES 1-5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to demonstrate that a source of magnetic energy can be
      adequately shielded, a magnet having a field strength of
      approximately 3500 gauss was placed in a flat surface. A magnetic
      shield in the form of a sheet was placed about six inches from the
      surface of the magnet which radiated a south (+) field. The
      magnetic shield employed was obtained from the Fermag Company of
      Edison, N.J. and was comprised of magnetic ferrite embedded in a
      pliable substrate material. The shield was in the form of a flat
      sheet of no great than 0.25 inches in thickness and had a magnetic
      strength of 1200 gauss. The shield was placed vertically so that
      its flat surface was parallel to the magnet and yet perpendicular
      to the magnetic field radiating therefrom. The shield was oriented
      so that its south (+) field faced the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The strength of the magnetic field was measured using a gaussmeter
      (Model 5-0-5, obtained from the Annis Company of Ind. and placed
      about 9.5 inches from the magnet) about 3.5 inches behind the
      shield when the shield was in place. The measurements obtained are
      set forth below in Table I.<br>
      <br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A survey was made at a large northeast research institution and
      indicated that fairly high intensities of magnetic fields could be
      detected in areas adjacent to various devices. This prompted a
      survey of an operating mobile magnetic resonance imaging unit to
      determine whether high levels of magnetic energy was being emitted
      from such unit. An examination of the console regularly occupied
      by the staff personnel in the room housing the MRI magnets, showed
      that the intensity levels were substantially higher and areas of
      both positive (South field) and negative (North field) were
      measured. This unit was a 0.3 Tesla Hybrid Resistive magnet with
      magnetic bricks. The field polarity is obviously determined by the
      configuration of the components.<br>
      <br>
      Substantial levels were measured outside of the trailer 10 housing
      the unit12 which also was posted with a sign indicating "Magnet
      Hazard". In the single drawing, there is depicted a schematic top
      view of the trailer 10, showing the approximate location of the
      magnet 12, of the MRI unit and the side 14, from which actual
      measurements of the field strengths were made. Warning sign 16,
      was on the outer trailer wall at approximately the location of the
      MRI unit inside. The scale on the side of the drawing is in inches
      measured away from the side of the trailer.<br>
      <br>
      It is evident from the data obtained that there is substantial
      magnetic radiation from the side of the MRI mobile unit and which
      is the less desirable positive type of radiation. Although there
      is no correlation yet available to connect the intensity of the
      magnetic field with any detrimental effects on humans, the mere
      fact that the mobile unit contains the "Magnet Hazard" warning
      sign on the trailer should be sufficient to encourage using an
      appropriate shielding. The particular unit for which the
      measurements were made, was located on a city street where
      pedestrians would pass through the field depicted in the drawing.<br>
      <br>
      Although the invention has been illustrated by the preceding
      examples, it is not to be construed as being limited to the
      materials employed therein, but rather, the invention is directed
      to the generic area as herein before disclosed. Various
      modifications and embodiments of the invention can be made without
      departing from the spirit or scope thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Another set of experiments were conducted wherein mammalian cells
      growing in culture were exposed to a varying magnetic field having
      a maximum intensity of 6.8 kilogauss. The cell cultures remained
      stationary, while two permanent ceramic magnets were rotated at 16
      rev/min so that each magnet passed under the cells once during
      each revolution. Exponentially growing cultures of either A549
      human lung carcinoma cells or C,H/lOT-1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts
      were exposed to the varying field. By about 3 days, cell growth
      was arrested, and the fraction of cells surviving was of the order
      of 10-'. By contrast, no measurable cell killing was observed in
      confluent cultures of C,H/IOT-I/2 cells showing contact
      inhibition. The substantial cytotoxicity shown by this varying
      magnetic field and the striking differential between the level of
      killing observed in dividing versus plateau phase cells, suggests
      that this might be useful to treat rapidly growing tumors in a
      relatively slow growing normal tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of magnetic fields on exponentially growing cells
      compared with control cultures consists of two components. First,
      the total number of cells is reduced, implying that cell growth is
      inhibited. Second, of the cells present, a proportion have lost
      their clonogenicity and this proportion increases with time of
      exposure to the field. With the field strength and period of
      oscillation used, a 72 hour exposure results in 10-fold fewer
      cells on the treated than on the control flasks, and of these only
      1/10 are clonogenic. A further increase in exposure time results
      in too few viable cells to assay.<br>
      <br>
      The key to producing a cytotoxic effect by means of a magnetic
      field appears to be a combination of a sufficiently intense
      magnetic field and a suitable variation of that field applied for
      a prolonged period. A steady or constant magnetic field of
      similar, or even higher intensity, does not produce a cytotoxic
      effect over the time periods studied.<br>
      <br>
      The effect on cytotoxicity of modifying the magnetic field
      intensity and the rate of change of magnetic field strength is
      currently under intense investigation; there are evidently several
      different parameters that can be varied and the relative
      importance of each is not yet clear.<br>
      <br>
      The instant invention involves only cells cultured in vitro,
      however, the substantial cytotoxic effect of the varying magnetic
      field and the fact that it can be manipulated to cover various
      areas and volumes, and the dramatic differential in cell killing
      between dividing and plateau phase cells suggests that this may be
      a useful anti-cancer device that merits further investigation.<br>
      <br>
      C3H IOTI/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts were used. These cells
      exhibited contact inhibition of growth and anchorage dependence
      under normal culture conditions. Cells were maintained in Eagle's
      Basal medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine
      serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, Utah) and 25 /ml gentamycin
      (U.S. Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio).<br>
      <br>
      A549 human lung carcinoma cells were maintained in Eagle's Minimun
      Essential Medium Supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 25 g/ml
      gentamycin, 1% glutamine and 0.1% sodium pyruvate (Grand Island
      Biological Supplies, Grand Island, N.Y.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>TESTING</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Exponentially growing C3H IOTI/2 and A549 cells were trypsinized
      and related at I.times.10' cells and 5.times.10" cells
      respectively per 25 cm' area tissue culture flask (Corning) in 10
      ml medium. Forty eight hours after plating, the caps of the flasks
      were closed tightly and the cultures were Fmt into a
      water-jacketed incubator fitted with a custom-built motor assembly
      for varying field magnetic treatment at 37 C. A constant 16 rpm
      gear-head motor was used and was placed inside the incubator. The
      shaft of the motor was connected to a lucite platform onto which
      two sets of ceramic monopolar magnets were positioned 12.5 cm
      apart. The maximum intensity of the magnets was 6.8 kilogauss. The
      lucite platform could be adjusted by raising or lowering the shaft
      of the motor. Culture flasks exposed to the varying fields were
      placed on an aluminum tray 2 mm above the rotating magnets. The
      position of the flasks on the holding tray were bounded by the
      circumference of the revolving magnetic bars. A maximum of 13 T25
      cm' area flasks could be treated at any one time. Control flasks
      were placed on a tray at the bottom of the incubator where the
      magnetic field as determined by a gauss meter was minimal.<br>
      <br>
      In experiments involving plateau phase cultures of C3H 10T1/2
      cells, exponentially growing cells were plated at 5.times.10@5
      cells per flask in 10 ml. tissue culture medium four days before
      initiation of treatment. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling (5.times.10@-6
      M) for one cell cycle showed the cells to be in plateau phase with
      less than 6% cycling.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the growth kinetics of cultured cells treated with
      the varying fields, duplicate flasks were removed from the
      incubator together with an equal number of control cultures. The
      sampling times chosen were 2 hrs. and 6 hrs., after the initiation
      of treatment, and at daily intervals thereafter for up to 4 to 6
      days. The cultures were trypsinized, counted and the total number
      of cells per flask determined using a Coulter electronic counter.<br>
      <br>
      To determine the surviving fractions of both exponentially and
      plateau-phase treated cultures of C3H 10%1/2 cells, the cultures
      were trypsinized, counted and replated into 100 mm diameter tissue
      culture dishes at a density such that 50-60 viable cells would
      survive and form colonies. The cultures were incubated for 10-12
      days at which time they were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with
      Giemsa and counted for colony formation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 3 the growth curves for control mouse cultures exposed to
      a varying magnetic field (maximum value 6 kilogauss) for various
      periods of time are illustrated. Shown are the total number of
      cells/dish and the total number of viable cells per dish, i.e. the
      number capable of forming colonies. Each point represents pooled
      data from 2 experiments. Bar represents .+-. I.S.D. Data for
      exponential phase cultures are depicted in the left-hand panel.
      Control cells incubated in the same incubation as the treated
      cultures had a doubling time of 18 hours and was comparable to
      published data for normal C3H IOTI/2 cells. Six hours after the
      initiation of magnetic treatment, the treated cells already
      demonstrated signs of growth inhibition. By 72 hours after
      treatment, the total number of cells per treated flask was roughly
      1/10 of that of the control. The number of clonogenically viable
      cells, based on the plating efficiencies and the surviving
      fractions also changed with the duration of treatment. By the end
      of 72 hours, the number of reproductively viable cells was only
      one-tenth of the cell population. Data for plateau phase cultures
      of C3H IOTI/2 cells are shown in the right-hand panel. Essentially
      no difference was observed in the total cell number between the
      treated vs. control cultures. Although the number of
      clonogenically viable cells also showed a modest decrease after
      treatment for 3 days the effect was less dramatic than that for
      exponentially phase cultures.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows the survival data for exponentially growing and
      plateau phase c,H/lOT-1/2 cells exposed to the varying magnetic
      field for various periods of time. For each time point examined,
      cells were removed by trypsinization from replicate flasks from
      control and treated groups, and aliquots of cells replated into
      fresh medium to assay for clonogenicity. The fraction of cells
      forming colonies from treated and control flasks gives the
      surviving fraction. Each point represents pooled data from 2-3
      experiments. Bar represents + S.E. The surviving fractions of
      either exponential or plateau phase C3H lOTI/2 cells treated with
      the varying magnetic field for various periods of time are shown.
      A three (3) day treatment resulted in a 10% survival for actively
      growing cells whereas contact inhibited cells showed only a 20%
      killing level.<br>
      <br>
      The growth inhibitory effects of a varying magnetic field on a
      human tumor cell line are shown in FIG. 5. Growth curves for
      control S549 and for parallel cultures exposed to a varying
      magnetic field (maximum value about 6.8 kilogauss for various
      periods of time are shown. The data points shown correspond to the
      total number of cells per dish. Each point represents pooled data
      from 2 experiments. Bar represents + I.S.D. The human lung
      carcinoma cells have a doubling time similar to that of C3H IOTI/2
      cells (-18 to 20 hours). There was a significant difference in
      total cell numbers between the treated and control cultures at 24
      hours after treatment. By 72 hours after treatment, the number of
      treated cells was roughly 1/IO of that for control.<br>
      <br>
      In another modification of the invention, cells are indirectly
      subjected to the influence of a particular directional, or
      unipolar magnetic field, as illustrated in FIG. 2. A media is
      placed proximate to and preferably directly on a magnet 100, such
      that is is subjected to the desired field. The magnet is
      preferably a compound magnet, such that a first portion emits a
      field A and a field B. A second magnet is positioned proximate to
      the first magnet, such that the second magnet's magnetic field B
      is directed in opposition to the first magnet's field B. In this
      manner, the fields B of the first and second magnet are
      effectively canceled, as previously described and only the A
      fields are permitted to emanate to the surrounding regions. This
      serves to protect user from the detrimental effects of field B,
      when applicable.<br>
      <br>
      The media is subjected to the desired magnetic field for a period
      sufficient to have the desired effect on the media. The media
      subjected to the magnetic field can be a cosmetic cream, lotion or
      the like. The media is then applied to the user's body for a
      period of time, such as overnight. The following morning the media
      is returned to its place proximate the magnetic field for
      reactivation. It has been found that the activation of the media
      degrades with time, thus necessitating the reactivation process.
      Because the source of the magnetic field radiates both desirable
      and undesirable magnetic fields, the shielding of the undesirable
      field can be critical to the well-being of the user. The shielding
      of the undesirable field and the focusing of the desired field are
      accomplished as heretofore described.<br>

      This invention pertains to a method of modifying the reproduction
      rate of cells by exposing the cells to north directional unipolar
      magnetic fields, thereby decreasing the reproduction rate of the
      cells. The reproduction rate of the cells can also be modified by
      exposing them to south directional unipolar magnetic fields,
      thereby increasing the reproduction rate of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates generally to methods for the modification
      of microbial metabolism using unipolar magnetic fields. In one
      aspect, this invention is directed to the modification of
      microbial metabolism, such as enhancing the microbial activity in
      the biodegradation of contaminated aqueous waste streams. In a
      further aspect, the present invention relates to methods for
      utilizing a unipolar magnetic field under controlled conditions to
      modify the metabolism of microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The search for a biological effect due to magnetic fields has a
      long history dating back a hundred years. The literature on
      biomagnetic effects on the growth and development of various
      organisms has been quite extensive showing both positive and
      negative findings. Among the positive findings attributed to
      strong magnetic fields are: altered growth rate, enzyme
      activities, cellular metabolism, DNA synthesis and animal
      orientation.<br>
      <br>
      A wide variety of methods have been reported in the literature
      which are directed to the use of magnetic energy as a diagnostic
      technique and also for the treatment of diseases in warm blooded
      animals including humans. For example, magnetic energy has been
      utilized quite successfully over the past several years to promote
      the formation of osteoblasts in conjunction with the healing of
      bone fractures. In many instances markedly improved results in
      healing times have been achieved by the application of magnetic
      energy to the site of bone fractures and other injuries.<br>
      <br>
      In <b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,337,776</b>, which issued Aug. 22, 1967,
      there is disclosed an apparatus for generating magnetic fields
      which are indicated to be particularly useful for biomedical
      applications. Although the patentee is not specific as to
      individual applications, he does state that magnetic fields
      generated by the apparatus can decrease metabolism and reacts on
      the spastic syndrome.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic probe is disclosed and claimed in<b> U.S. Pat. No.
        3,664,327</b> which issued May 23, 1972 and states that the
      probe can be employed in relatively inaccessible locations, such
      as in body cavities of animals to cause relaxation of muscle
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      A magnetic medical treatment device is disclosed in <b>U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,921,62</b>0 which states that the effects of a magnetic
      field upon a living body is dissociated by polarization and
      induced currents and is effective in controlling the sympathetic
      nervous system.<br>
      <br>
      On May 3, 1977, <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,590</b> issued to A. R.
      Davis discloses an apparatus and method for treating seeds in a
      unipolar magnetic field. It is indicated in the patent that this
      treatment enhances the germination rate of the seeds, as well as
      providing plants having greater sugar content, increased protein
      and other desirable features.<br>
      <br>
      In <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,134,935</b> which issued Jan. 16, 1979 also
      to A. R. Davis, a method is disclosed and claimed which uses
      magnetic fields for clinical examination of animals to determine
      damaged, diseased, abnormal or malfunctioning parts of the body.
      Changes in tensioning and relaxation of the body extremities are
      an indication of body abnormalities.<br>
      <br>
      A method for treating cancer is disclosed in <b>U.S. Pat. No.
        4,622,952</b> which issued Nov. 18, 1986 and which involves
      timing an electromagnetic energy to the resonant energy absorption
      frequencies of the intracellular structures of the selected cells.
      and then exposing a subject to this tuned electromagnetic energy
      field. The field can also be tuned to the frequency which has been
      calculated to be closest to the resonant frequency of the cancer
      cells and furthest from the normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. No. 4,622,953</b>, which issued to the same patentee,
      disclosed the identical procedure for the treatment of
      atherosclerotic lesions. In this process, metabolic and activity
      varying substance such as ferric hydroxide and dextran were
      employed and by applying the proper resonant energy, the heat in
      the diseased cell is increased by an increment sufficient to kill
      the diseased cell but not sufficient to kill normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      In a patent issued to Robert T. Gordon on May 5, 1987, <b>U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,602,359</b>, a process is described and claimed for
      the treatment of cancer in a host organism which comprises
      providing to the host organism minute particles capable of being
      inductively heated and which are of a size which can be absorbed
      into cancer cells. Thereafter the organism is subjected to an
      alternating electromagnetic field to heat the particles at that
      point in metabolic time when the maximum difference in magnetic
      susceptibility between the cancer cells and normal cells within
      the region occurs, and then continuing the inductive heating to
      increase intracellular temperature to selectively kill the cancer
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Previous developments of directional magnetic fields began in
      1936, when A. R. Davis first discovered that the north and the
      south magnetic pole fields each exhibited unique properties with
      respect to their effects on various forms of life. This discovery
      was slow to be accepted because of investigations by others who
      confused Davis' directional polarities magnetic fields with those
      which are simultaneously emitted by horse shoe type magnets and by
      AC-powered electromagnets. The common belief over the years
      relating to magnets has been that they emanate the same potential
      of type of energy. This belief has been found to be a
      misconception, since the two poles of a magnet are totally
      different in electric potential and effect. Correspondingly, the
      application of the respective poles to living systems has been
      found to produce quite different results. More specifically, it
      has been shown that magnetic energy has an effect on cells such as
      blood cells, nerves, bacteria, et al.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary investigations regarding biological effects of
      exposure to magnetic fields have indicated a polarity dependence.
      Cells are deemed to be bioelectric in nature, function and
      behavior and studies have indicated that directional magnetic
      fields enhance biological activity. Moreover, due to the
      orientation of such cells and of the metal elements and other ions
      contained therein, the blood cells have been found to decrease
      certain biological effects when exposed to the north pole and to
      increase other biological effects when exposed to the magnetic
      south pole. This same type of reaction has been noted in
      connection with other type cells of the body, it having been
      observed that, as a general matter, the application of north pole
      energies to an existing unhealthy or abnormal condition tends to
      have an arresting, quieting or relaxing effect, to induce an
      overall healing reaction akin to the body's own defense mechanism.
      On the other hand, the application of south pole energies tends to
      have a strengthening, activating effect, which has been found
      useful in treating some abnormal conditions, particularly those
      associated with a slowing or weakening in function. Cancer cells
      exposed to the north field show a significant decrease in the
      number of surviving cells after a period of incubation.
      Conversely, the same type of cells, when exposed to the south
      field, indicated an increase in the number of surviving cells
      compared to the unexposed controls. A more detailed description of
      magnetic pole energies can be found in Davis et al, Magnetism and
      its Effects on the Living System, Acres U.S.A., Kansas City, Mo.
      (1974) and Davis et al, The Magnetic Effect, Acres U.S.A., Kansas
      City, Mo. (1975).<br>
      <br>
      The north pole, which is defined as the north seeking pole, is now
      believed to provide a negative form of energy while the south
      pole, which is defined as the south seeking pole, is believed to
      provide a positive form of energy. It has also been found upon
      examination of the electron paths associated with the fields
      surrounding the respective poles that the south pole end of a
      magnet provides a right hand spin of electrons, i.e., a clockwise
      rotation of electron movement, as contrasted with the north pole
      electron spin, which provides a left hand spin or counterclockwise
      rotation of its electron field.<br>
      <br>
      It has been further observed that the lines of magnetic energy
      leave the south pole to re-enter the magnet at the Bloch Wall
      where the 180 degrees phase takes place, and leave the Bloch Wall
      at that point to go on as the north pole energy to re-enter the
      magnet at its north pole.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetic enhancement or retardation of bacterial or cellular
      growth rates has been reported in the literature. For example,
      Davis and Rawls presented numerous examples of enhancement to
      seeds and various types of cellular growth (Davis, A. R. &amp;
      Rawls, Jr., W. C., Magnetism and its Effects on the Living System,
      Acres, U.S.A., Kansas City, Mo., 1974). Bornstein reported
      magnetic inhibition of bacterial growth in burn wounds (Bornstein,
      L. A., in Argosy, June, 1968). Investigations sponsored by
      Bio-Magnetics Systems, Inc. have shown that unidirectional
      magnetic fields inhibited or increased the growth of cancer cells,
      depending on the field polarity, as disclosed by A. Trappier et
      al., in Evolving Perspectives On The Exposure Risks From Magnetic
      Fields, Journal of Nat. Med. Assoc., 82:621-624, September 1990.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In its broad aspect, this invention is directed to a method for
      the modification of microbial metabolism through the use of
      unipolar magnetic fields. In general, the method comprises
      exposing microbes to a unipolar magnetic field with gauss
      concentrations sufficient to effect microbial metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      Bioremediation processes, in which microbes are used to repair
      ecological damage, are under development at the Environmental
      Protection Agency and elsewhere to treat a range of contaminants
      including aromatic solvents, polychlorobiphenyls,
      trichloroethylene, petroleum hydrocarbons and other organic
      constituents. The use of unipolar magnetic fields has the
      potential for enhancing the applicability and cost-effectiveness
      of bioremediation for the treatment of contaminated groundwater
      and contaminated soil. Specifically, it has now been found that
      the application of unipolar magnetic fields enhances microbial
      activity and will result in increasing the efficiency and rate of
      bioremediation, and proportionally decreasing the time required to
      meet cleanup goals. Thus, the unipolar magnetic field technology
      can save significant remediation costs at those toxic waste sites
      amenable to biological degradation. In addition, this technology
      can provide an integrated process for remediation. Such an
      integrated process can be based upon pump, treat, reinjection
      and/or direct application of magnetic field to the vadose zone to
      stimulate in situ biodegradation.<br>
      <br>
      The method of modifying cells by exposing the cells to directional
      unipolar magnetic fields is also disclosed. The reproduction rate
      is increased when exposed to a south magnetic field, and decreased
      when exposed to a north magnetic field. The modification also
      applies to cells which derive energy for reproduction through
      fermentation. The modification can be either intracellular or
      modification is through the cell wall and the modification is
      retained within the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, one or more of the following objects will be achieved
      by the practice of this invention. It is an object of this
      invention to amplify or otherwise modify microbial metabolism and
      thereby enhance a process which employees microbes. These and
      other objects will readily become apparent to those skilled in the
      art in the light of the teachings therein set forth.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In its broad aspect, the present invention is directed to the
      modification of microbial metabolism by the application thereto of
      unipolar magnetic energy, i.e., the energy, north or south,
      emanating from a single pole of a magnet, under specific
      conditions to achieve the modification. The term modification is
      used herein to indicate an increase or decrease in the rate and/or
      efficiency of metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      The biochemical processes of assimilation (anabolism) and
      dissimilation (catabolism) describe metabolism in microorganisms.
      Assimilation is the process by which organisms synthesize organic
      compounds from simple organic chemicals, CO2, water, and other
      components. Dissimilation is the process by which organisms
      decompose organic compounds to CO2 and water, or partially
      decompose organics to lower molecular weight organics.<br>
      <br>
      This invention modifies microbial metabolism using directional
      unipolar magnetic fields. Laboratory experiments have shown that
      south pole magnetic fields increase the rate of dissimilation in
      simulated bioremediation processes whereas north pole magnetic
      fields inhibit the rate of dissimilation (comparing to a control
      consisting of no magnetic fields).<br>
      <br>
      Magnetically enhanced bioremediation is one area of application of
      the invention. Bioremediation is a process by which the use of
      living organisms, in conjunction with or independent from other
      technologies, is employed to decontaminate a polluted system. In
      bioremediation, contaminants are destroyed by the action of
      microbes such as soil bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a toxic waste site showing an
      integrated approach for utilizing unipolar magnetic fields to
      modify the microbial activity in a bioremediation process. The
      unipolar magnetic field can be applied to the microbes before or
      after their contact with the toxic waste. Magnetically enhanced
      bioremediation is applicable to organic and inorganic wastes
      located in solid and aqueous media, including soil, slurries,
      sludges, and sediments. The process can use water as an
      intermediary to provide contact between magnetically enhanced
      bacteria and toxic waste substances. The presence of water in the
      soil as well as groundwater, itself, is compatible with
      magnetically enhanced bioremediation.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 1 a pretreatment reactor 10 can be provided with
      a magnet 12. A directional magnetic field is applied to the
      contaminated stream 14, in the reactor 10, by means of the magnet
      12, which subjects the material in the pretreatment reactor to a
      south pole magnetic field. In the main reactor 18, microbes are
      added to the contaminated stream. A directional magnet 16 applies
      a south pole magnetic filed to the combined biomass in the main
      reactor 18. Optionally, nutrients are fed to the main reactor from
      a nutrient tank 11, or other source.<br>
      <br>
      The oxidase and treated microbes are reinjected into the ground
      and is permitted to percolate into the ground. A magnetic blanket
      consisting of 9 inch wide, 1/4 inch thick strips of pliable
      magnetic material 20, are laid over at least a portion of the
      field, thus subjecting the field to a south pole magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      A major advantage of this invention is that it can be used with
      existing bioremediation processes without introducing a major
      process modification or perturbation. The use of this invention
      could, however, result in the use of smaller, less costly process
      hardware and shorter operation times.<br>
      <br>
      This invention can also be used to enhance biochemical processes
      in which microorganisms assist in producing chemicals such as
      plastics. For example, bacteria will make polymers, such as
      polyester under the proper conditions, and the use of unipolar
      magnetic fields will modify the rate and/or efficiency of this
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Magnetically modified microbial metabolism would provide a basis
      for application to other governmental and commercial uses of
      microorganisms. Such uses can include any process where
      microorganisms such as bacteria are actively involved in a
      biochemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples are illustrative of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A recirculating flow type bioreactor was fabricated from
      nonmagnetic materials (plastics) and set-up as shown in FIG. 2.
      Solid state unipolar directional magnetic fields were applied to
      the reactor which contained 100 grams of alginate-immobilized,
      activated sludge prepared at the New Jersey Institute of
      Technology Biotechnology Laboratory, Newark, N.J. The bacterial
      culture in the sludge was immobilized in alginate matrix and
      activated by curing in 0.1 molar CaCl2 solution. The magnetic
      field strength applied was varied. Air was continuously supplied
      as the source of dissolved oxygen. The oxygen consumption was
      monitored using a Clark-type dissolved oxygen probe and a strip
      chart recorder. Phenol was added to a mineral salt medium as the
      sole carbon source. It was constantly monitored for biodegradation
      in the experiment by sampling the reservoir and analyzing the
      samples in a Varian 3300 gas chromatograph. The concentration of
      secreted aeration in the medium, which continuously circulated
      between the reservoir and the reactor, was measured daily using
      the standard Lowery color response test. Each experimental run was
      1200 hours (50 days) in length.<br>
      <br>
      Runs performed were:<br>
      1. Control: no magnet on the bioreactor.<br>
      2. South magnetic pole exposure to the bioreactor.<br>
      3. North magnetic pole exposure to the bioreactor.<br>
      4. Changing the north magnetic pole exposure to a south magnetic
      pole exposure and the south magnetic pole exposure to a north
      magnetic pole exposure in the bioreactor.<br>
      <br>
      Table 1 presents the results of these experiments. When the south
      pole magnetic energy was applied, biological oxidation rate was
      increased by a factor of two compared to the control run without
      magnetic energy present (from 0.656 to 1.545).<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the effect of magnetic fields on the rate of oxygen
      consumption. It can be seen that the rate increased dramatically
      after 4 days of directional south pole magnetic field exposure as
      compared to north pole magnetic field exposure or control.<br>
      <br>
      Results obtained from studies under the influence of north pole,
      south pole and during the control run are tabulated in Table 1. It
      can be seen that the highest average rate of phenol biodegradation
      and oxygen consumption is found during the run when south pole is
      attached to the bioreactor. When the magnetic south pole was
      applied, it increased the biological oxidation activity (oxygen
      consumption rate) by a factor of two as compared to the control
      run without magnetic field (from 0.7 to 1.5). FIG. 3 shows the
      effect of magnetic field on the rate of O2 consumption. It can be
      seen that the rate increases dramatically after 4 days under the
      influence of south pole as compared to the control and north. One
      of the measures of biodegradation is the increase in activity that
      is the rate of oxygen consumption by the microbes in presence of a
      substrate like phenol. An increase in oxygen consumption indicates
      that it is being utilized by the microorganisms to break down
      phenol into its metabolic products which ultimately are CO2 and
      water.<br>
      <br>
      The phenol consumption rate is faster by nearly 30% in case of the
      run with the south pole as compared to the control run.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 indicates that the phenol concentration goes down rapidly
      under the influence of south pole comparison to the north pole and
      the control. These observations are consistent with those from the
      rate of oxygen consumption monitoring.<br>
      <br>
      Significant amounts of protein build-up in the liquid phase
      verified that biological activity was enhanced when magnetic south
      pole was applied to the system as compared to the control as shown
      in FIG. 5. Microorganisms release enzymes extracellularly which in
      turn attack the substrate. A higher amount of proteins in the
      reaction medium is a positive measure of biodegradation. FIG. 5
      indicates that the south pole magnetic field greatly enhanced the
      concentration of protein in this reactor (protein is produced from
      phenol degradation). In this experiment it was observed that the
      pH changed from 7.9 to 8.5.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows the effect of repeatedly changing the south pole
      magnetic field to a north pole magnetic field and a north pole
      magnetic field to a south pole magnetic field in the bioreactor.
      The south pole field was consistently activating whereas the north
      pole field was inhibitory.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 and 8 show the effect of magnetic field on the rate of
      biodegradation and protein concentration under 1500 and 3500 gauss
      magnetic south pole. The highest rate of biodegradation is 25.6
      ppm/h and the highest protein concentration8s 2250 ug/ml after 11
      days under 1500 gauss.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows the effect of magnetic field on the rate of O2
      consumption. It indicates that the highest rate of O2 consumption
      is 1649 nmol/ml*hr after 10 days under the influence of 1500 gauss
      magnetic south pole.<br>

      </b><br>
      The recirculation flow type bioreactor shown in FIG. 2 was used in
      these studies. For pre-exposure, free microorganisms were exposed
      to south pole magnetic fields for 3 days prior to use in the
      bioreactor which contained immobilized activated sludge and
      phenol. Oxygen, phenol concentration and pH were measured as in
      Example 1. Each experimental run was 1296 hours (54 days) in
      length.<br>
      <br>
      Runs performed were:<br>
      1. Control: no magnetic on the bioreactor; bacteria not
      pre-exposed.<br>
      2. No magnetic field on the bioreactor; pre-exposed bacteria.<br>
      3. South magnetic pole exposure to bioreactor; pre-exposed
      bacteria.<br>
      4. Higher strength south magnetic pole exposure to bioreactor;
      pre-exposed bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 shows the results of these experimental runs. FIGS. 7 and
      8 show the effect of magnetic fields on the rates of oxygen
      consumption which indicates that the 1500 gauss south pole
      magnetic field yielded the higher oxygen consumption rate of 2500
      nmol/ml*hr after 15 hours into the run. FIG. 9 shows that oxygen
      consumption rates were higher for 1500 gauss south pole magnetic
      fields when compared to 3500 gauss fields.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A polyester copolymer of hydroxybutric acid and hydroxyvaleric
      acid (PHBV) is produced by bacteria in a reactor by fermenting a
      carbon source as shown in FIG. 10. When a bacteria such as
      Alcaligenes eutrophus is depleted of the nitrogen it requires to
      multiply, growth is inhibited. The carbon source, such as glucose,
      can then be added to the fermenter, causing the organism to make
      granules of polyester with the abundant carbon instead of using it
      to grow. The conventional process is so slow as to be economically
      unfeasible. The process is repeated with the exception that a
      south unipolar magnetic field is applied to the organism during
      the glucose fermenation step. The rate of fermentation will be
      substantially enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of unipole application is further applicable in the
      field of biology. The application of a south magnetic field speeds
      up the reproduction of cells, while the north field slows
      reproduction.<br>
      <br>
      Fermentation, a simple, anaerobic method to generate energy in the
      cell, is commonly used in yeast products and to produce alcholoic
      beverages. Carbohydrate molecules breakdown into simpler molecules
      such as ethyl alcohol, lactic acid, or carbon dioxide, releasing
      energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). An applied
      south field dramatically speeds up the fermentation process.
      Chemostats, with their controlled environment, are ideal rapid,
      mass reproduction of cells, through fermentation, in combination
      with a unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the magnetic fields influence the growth rate of the
      aerobically reproduced cells. The application of a south magnetic
      field increases the production of enzymes without fracturing the
      cells. The permeability of the cell walls is increased which
      allows for the influx and efflux of enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic fields affect the cells either of two ways. The first
      is through the cell wall and would include the production and
      expression of proteins, such as enzymes, insulin and other
      hormones, interferons and antibiotics. The second is affecting the
      cells intracellularly and retained the affect within the cell. The
      appropriate magnetic field is applied for a time period and an
      intensity which is based on the recepient of the field, the medium
      and the desired end result. Examples would be many new drugs under
      evaluation for their effectiveness against cancer and aids.<br>
      <br>
      Although research has been done on the affects of magnetism in
      both fermentation and other biological processes, they have used
      bipolar, complex or rotating fields. The instant invention relates
      to the consistent use of either a north or south magnetic field to
      produce a desired result. Thus, the cell reproduction can be
      decreased or increased dependent on the requirements.<br>

      Apparatus for magnetically treating seeds comprises a magnet for
      producing a unipolar magnetic field, an enclosed generally
      cylindrical housing having a closable access opening therein in
      which said seeds are placed for treatment, drive means associated
      with the housing for rotating said housing and imparting rolling
      and tumbling motion to the seeds within the housing, the housing
      being disposed with respect to the magnet such that the seeds move
      through the magnetic field as they roll and tumble. By
      magnetically treating the seeds in a unipolar magnetic field while
      rolling and tumbling the seeds, the characteristics of plants
      grown therefrom are favorably altered.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to magneto magnetic energy and, more
      particularly, to a method and apparatus for the application of
      such energy to seeds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      It is now generally accepted that when any biological living
      system lives in a strong magnetic environment, its physical and
      genetic development is to some extent altered. For example, it has
      long been known that the rate of seed germination and the rate of
      plant growth from seeds is affected by magnetism. This phenomenon
      is discussed in U. J. Pittman, "Biomagnetism--a Mysterious Plant
      Growth Factor", Canada Agriculture, Summer--1968 edition. In a
      more recent report, Moustafa, "Effect of Seed Exposure to Magnetic
      Field on Plant Physical Properties and Yield", ASAE Paper No.
      73-316 (June, 1973), concluded that exposing seeds to an
      electromagnetic field prior to planting appeared to increase the
      rate of germination and the total plant leaf area, at least under
      growth chamber conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In an effort to reduce the necessary exposure time for seeds to
      become adequately treated by magnetism so that the magnetically
      treated seeds can be commercially used, Amburn disclosed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,675,367 an apparatus for moving seeds through a
      magnetic field. The Amburn apparatus consists essentially of an
      elongated tube having an electromagnet mounted thereon
      intermediate its ends to establish a magnetic flux field within
      the tube. A conveyor assembly, comprising an auger, conveys the
      seeds through the tube in such a manner that the seeds roll and
      tumble while within the magnetic field to expose the seeds in a
      multiplicity of positions with respect to the magnetic field.
      Amburn reports that treating seeds in this fashion increased crop
      yield from the treated seeds as compared with crop yield from the
      untreated seeds.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic field to which Amburn exposed his seeds was bipolar
      in that it had both a north and a south pole applying their
      respective energies to the seeds. Amburn points out that there
      were some indications that greater success was achieved in
      treating the seeds when the north pole was located at the inlet
      end of the apparatus. However, there was no suggestion or
      appreciation that one of the poles could or would produce
      different results from the other of the poles. This is, of course,
      because Amburn subscribed to the commmon belief extant over the
      years relating to magnets, which has been that the two magnetic
      poles, north and south, are homogeneous and that they emanate the
      same potential type of energy. This belief has now been found to
      be a misconception--the two poles of a magnet are in fact totally
      different in electric potential and effect--and the application of
      the respective poles to living systems has been found to produce
      quite different results.<br>
      <br>
      The north pole (which is defined as the south-seeking pole) is now
      believed to provide a negative form of energy while the south pole
      (which is defined as the north-seeking pole) is believed to
      provide a positive form of energy. To support this discovery, it
      has been found that upon examination of the electron paths
      associated with the fields surrounding the respective poles that
      the south pole end of a magnet provides a right hand spin of
      electrons, i.e., a clockwise rotation of electron movement, as
      contrasted with the north pole electron spin, which presents a
      left hand spin or counter-clockwise rotation of its electron
      field. It has further been observed that the lines of magnetic
      energy leave the south pole to re-enter the magnet at the Bloch
      Wall where a 180 DEG phase change takes place, then leave the
      Bloch Wall at that point to then go on as the north pole energy to
      re-enter the magnet at its north pole. For a more detailed
      discussion of this phenomena, see Davis et al, Magnetism and its
      Effects on the Living System and The Magnetic Effect (Exposition
      Press, Hicksville, N.Y.).<br>
      <br>
      The differing effects of the north and south poles, respectively,
      on seed germination rate and plant growth height was appreciated
      in a somewhat different context by Tsukamoto in British Patent
      Specification No. 1,065,864 wherein a disintegrable permanent
      magnet for use in the soil is disclosed. Of course, the Tsukamoto
      teaching does not extend to an apparatus for pretreating the seeds
      prior to planting or to a method for rotating and tumbling the
      seeds prior to planting in a unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
      method and apparatus for unipolar treatment of seeds and/or
      seedlings in a magnetic field prior to planting.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the invention to provide a method and
      apparatus for closely controlling the exposure time of seeds in a
      unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      It is still another object of the invention to provide an
      apparatus which can accommodate, without damage, all sizes and
      shapes of seeds and seedlings while rolling and tumbling them in a
      unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of this invention to provide an apparatus
      for simultaneously exposing seeds or seedlings in contact with a
      liquid or gaseous medium to a unipolar magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the
      following description and appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly stated, in accordance with the aforesaid objects, the
      present invention provides a housing adapted for receiving and
      containing seeds or seedlings which housing includes drive means
      for causing movement of the housing, e.g., rotating the housing
      about an axis, to cause the seeds and seedlings to roll and tumble
      therein. One pole of a magnet produces a magnetic field through
      which said housing rotates such that the seeds and seedlings
      therein are more or less continuously exposed to the unipolar
      magnetic field. Timer means may be operatively associated with the
      drive means in order to closely control the exposure time of the
      seeds and seedlings to the field, which exposure time has been
      found to be critical for achieving optimum improved results. The
      housing has communicating therewith inlet and outlet ports for
      receiving and discharging gaseous or liquid materials therethrough
      and which provides the capability of magnetically treating the
      seeds together with said fluid materials for reasons which will
      become more fully apparent hereinafter.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is primarily concerned with the use of
      magneto magnetic energy, i.e., magnetic energy derived from a
      magnet as opposed to some other source, on seeds and seedlings. By
      use of the term "seeds" herein, it is intended to encompass any
      plant material from which further plants may by grown, e.g.,
      seeds, seedlings, bulbs, cuttings, stalks, and the like. One
      particularly advantageous "seed" are sugar cane stalks (e.g., 5-7
      feet long) which, after treatment in accordance with the present
      invention, may be planted horizontally. It has been found that
      after planting, shoots appear to grow from the stalk joints. Any
      type of magnet is suitable for use herein in which the poles are
      sufficiently separated that the energy of each pole can be
      isolated from the energy of the other pole. In this way a unipolar
      magnetic field can be applied to the seeds. Thus, separation of
      the poles is the prime requisite in selecting an appropriate
      magnet. Straight bar or cylindrical magnets provide maximum pole
      separation and are desirable. Either solid state or long-wound
      electromagnets, however, are equally useful.<br>
      <br>
      A typical apparatus for exposing seeds to a unipolar magnetic
      field is shown in FIG. 1 generally at 10. The apparatus consists
      of a magnet 12, a housing 14 which moves through the magnetic
      field created by magnet 12, and drive means 16 for causing the
      desired movement of housing 14. In one preferred form of the
      invention, housing 14 comprises a cylindrical enclosure having
      opposite generally parallel end walls 18, 20 joined by cylindrical
      surface 22. However, it will be appreciated that housing 14 need
      not be cylindrical but can assume any configuration consistent
      with the herein described objectives of the invention. Moreover,
      the housing may be of any suitable dimensions to accommodate the
      seed to be treated. An access opening 24 is formed in the
      cylindrical surface 22 to permit access to the inside of housing
      14. Seeds to be exposed to the magnetic field may be placed into
      and removed from the housing through opening 24. Removably closing
      access opening 24 is cover 26 which includes a handle 28 thereon
      for ease of removing from and replacing over opening 24. The cover
      may be held in place over access opening 24 by any conventional
      means.<br>
      <br>
      End walls 18 and 20 include a centrally disposed aperture 29, 30
      therein for receiving shaft 32 therethrough. The shaft passes
      longitudinally through cylindrical housing 14 and is fixedly
      mounted to the end walls such that rotation of the shaft rotates
      housing 14 (the axis of which is preferably coaxial with the
      shaft). One end 34 of shaft 32 includes a pulley wheel 36 on which
      drive belt 38 is mounted. Belt 38 is driven in the conventional
      manner through motor assembly 40 which includes motor 42, motor
      shaft 44 and motor pulley wheel 46. Shaft 32, pulley wheel 36 and
      motor assembly 40 comprise drive means 16. It will be appreciated
      that the invention is not limited to the drive means illustrated
      and may include any suitable drive means for imparting motion to
      housing 14 such that the seeds therein roll and tumble in the
      magnetic field, preferably for rotating housing 14 about its axis.<br>
      <br>
      Drive means 16 rotates housing 14 about shaft 32 in either
      direction to expose the seeds within housing 14 to the unipolar
      magnetic field created by magnet 12, which magnet preferably
      extends axially along one side of housing 14. Magnet 12 may be
      mounted in any manner that will permit the energies of a single
      pole thereof to be applied to the seed contents of housing 14. As
      shown, the magnetic field of magnet 12 penetrates the cylindrical
      surface 22 of housing 14. Alternatively, magnet 12 can be disposed
      adjacent either or both end walls 18, 20 directing its energy
      through the end walls of the housing. In still other
      configurations magnet 12 may be attached to the inner or outer
      surfaces of housing 14, the only limitation being that the magnet
      must be so oriented that the contents of housing 14 are exposed to
      the energies of only one of the magnetic poles. For convenience,
      in a preferred form of the invention magnet 12 is a substantially
      flat magnetic material, generally rectangular in configuration,
      wherein one side 12a thereof constitutes the south pole of the
      magnet and the opposite side 12b thereof constitutes the north
      pole of the magnet. An elongated magnet support enclosure 48
      having one open end is disposed adjacent one elongated side of the
      cylindrical surface 22. The flat magnet 12 is slidably received
      within enclosure 48 with one of its polar sides 12a or 12b
      directed toward housing 14 to expose the contents of the housing
      to the energies of that pole. For convenience, magnet 12 may
      include a knob or handle 13 projecting from one end thereof to
      provide a gripping portion for sliding the magnet into and out of
      enclosure 48. If it is desired to change the magnetic pole to
      which the housing contents are exposed, it is a simple matter to
      grasp knob 13, slide magnet 12 out of the open end of enclosure
      48, flip the magnet over to direct the other pole toward the
      housing and then reinsert the magnet into the enclosure 48 through
      the open end thereof. Of course, if magnet 12 is an electromagnet,
      then the polarity of the magnet can be changed electrically, e.g.,
      by reversing the current flow.<br>
      <br>
      To utilize apparatus 10 for exposing seeds to one of the poles of
      magnet 12, cover 26 is removed from opening 24, the seeds to be
      treated are placed within the enclosure, and cover 26 is replaced
      over the opening. The desired magnetic pole is selected and magnet
      12 is oriented so that the proper pole faces the seed housing,
      after which magnet 12 is placed into the magnet enclosure 48.
      Motor 42 is actuated and, via motor shaft 42, pulley wheels 46 and
      36 and drive belt 38, shaft 32 is rotated, thus rotating the
      housing 14 thereabout. As the housing rotates, the seeds therein
      are moved through the magnetic field directed toward housing 14 by
      magnet 12. The seeds tumble and rotate end over end and side over
      side through and in the magnetic field such that all portions of
      the seeds are exposed to the field. The motion of one seed against
      another or against the inner surfaces of the enclosure, which may
      optionally be lined with a soft, rubberized material to prevent
      physical damage to the seeds, has a frictional effect which causes
      the generation of heat with the result that both the seeds and the
      air in the housing tend to become warm. This warmth is believed to
      expand the seeds to a certain extent and to make them more
      receptive to the influence of the applied magnetic field. Rotation
      of housing 14 is continued for the desired exposure time interval
      after which the motor is shut off and rotation ceases. If the
      magnet used is an electromagnet, through appropriate electrical
      connection of the current flow control to the magnet and to the
      motor, a single switch could simultaneously shut both off.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that the parts of the rotating housing, the
      shafts, pulleys, drive means, magnet enclosure, etc. have very low
      magnetic retentivity in order that the seeds can remain in the
      housing without further exposure to a magnetic field after the
      desired exposure time has expired. Thus, construction materials
      such as plastic, aluminum, brass or like materials which will not
      retain magnetism are preferred for use. If a magnet other than an
      electromagnet is used, it is desirable to either remove it from
      enclosure 48 upon cessation of rotation or otherwise prevent its
      magnetic energies from further influencing the seeds. This latter
      objective can be achieved by interposing a magnetic field
      impermeable shield (not shown) between magnet 12 and housing 14 to
      prevent the magnetic field from reaching the seeds. Alternatively,
      of course, the seeds can be promptly removed from the housing.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in FIG. 2
      wherein rotation of housing 14 is achieved by a second form of
      drive means. Housing 14 is supported on two longitudinally
      extending shafts 50 and 52 with the outer cylindrical surface 22
      of the housing frictionally engaging the shafts. Shaft 50 is
      journaled for free rotation in support means 54 at opposite ends
      thereof. Shaft 52 is also journaled for rotation in support means
      54. However, shaft 52 is driven by motor assembly 40, which may
      include motor 42 directly coupled to shaft 52 as shown in FIG. 2.
      Alternatively, the motor assembly may also include motor pulley
      wheel 46 acting through a drive belt 38 and a shaft pulley wheel
      36 mounted on shaft 52 (as shown in FIG. 1). The rotation of shaft
      52 caused by motor assembly 40 is transmitted to and causes
      frictionally engaged cylindrical housing 14 to also rotate. The
      rotation of housing 14, which is supported on and frictionally
      engages shaft 50, causes shaft 50 to rotate also. In this manner,
      the seeds may be rotated and tumbled and exposed to the unipolar
      magnetic field created by magnet 12 in much the same manner as
      with the apparatus of FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      During exposure to the unipolar magnetic field the seeds may be
      treated with or exposed to gaseous or liquid media, such as air,
      water, liquid fertilizers, and the like. In order that gaseous
      media can reach the seeds, valve controlled inlet gas port 56 and
      outlet gas port 58 communicate with the interior of the housing
      through end walls 18 and 20, respectively. These gas ports are
      particularly useful for venting the warm air and/or introducing
      cool air into the housing. Likewise, valve controlled liquid inlet
      line 60 and discharge liquid line 62 communicate with the interior
      of the housing through end walls 18 and 20, respectively. Through
      lines 60 and 62, liquids such as water, liquid fertilizer, and the
      like can be intimately admixed with the seeds and simultaneously
      exposed to the unipolar magnetic field. It is believed that
      exposure of water and other liquids to the same unipolar magnetic
      field as influences the seeds alters the water sufficiently to
      beneficially improve its characteristics as a germination
      initiator.<br>
      <br>
      While the length of exposure time and the strength of the magnetic
      field to which the seeds or other housing contents are exposed
      will vary among seed varieties and types and are dependent to a
      large extent upon the desired characteristics sought in the plants
      resulting from the exposed seeds, the magnetic field strength is
      desirably maintained at the seeds in the range 600 to 3500 gauss.
      Most desirably, magnetic field strength at the seeds should be in
      the range 600 to 800 gauss. Optimum seed exposure time also varies
      considerably with seed varieties and types and with other exposure
      conditions. Nevertheless, it can fairly be stated that seed
      exposure times should be controlled generally to from 5 seconds to
      14 hours, and more usually from 5 seconds to 60 minutes. The
      extended exposure periods approaching 14 hours are useful only for
      a few seed types, e.g., tobacco. Too little exposure, of course,
      will not develop the desired characteristics in the seed. On the
      other hand, too great an exposure time can adversely affect the
      characteristics of the exposed seeds. Indeed, it has been found
      that there is an optimum exposure time for each variety of seed
      and the usefulness of the apparatus can be enhanced by operating
      motor 42 via a timer 64 which includes an indicator lamp 68 which
      lights when the apparatus is operating. The face of timer 64 may
      include a pointer dial 70 and a plurality of indicia 72 arranged
      thereabout whereby each indicia represents by number keyed to a
      chart or by seed name, the appropriate timer setting for each seed
      type. Where numbers are used as indicia, a typical chart would
      associate each number with one or more seed types. Thus, for
      illustrative purposes only, to process corn, dial 70 could be
      moved to position -10-; cotton and/or watermelon seeds might best
      be treated at position -8-; and the like. Preferably, the dial 70
      is spring-biased to the off position and is clockwise rotatable to
      point to one of the indicia 72 which indicate a predetermined time
      exposure for the seeds to be treated. When the dial 70 is other
      than in the "OFF" position, the electrical circuitry is closed and
      current flows to the motor which drives housing 14. The timer dial
      70 rotates counter-clockwise until it reaches the "OFF" position
      at which point the electrical circuitry to the motor 42 (and to
      the magnet 12, if it is an electromagnet) is automatically opened.
      If desired, in addition to lamp 68, other signals may be used to
      indicate the end of seed exposure time, such as bells, buzzers,
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      As a general matter, as will be more clearly indicated in the
      following examples, south pole exposure of seeds produces plants
      having lower acidity, thicker but shallower root structures,
      larger leaves, greater sugar content, faster germination rate and
      increased protein content compared to north pole exposed seeds.
      North pole exposure of seeds produces plants having greater yield,
      taller plants and longer and deeper roots than south pole exposed
      plants. As a result, south pole exposed seeds produce plants
      having generally better individual characteristics in terms of
      nutritional values and north pole exposed seeds produce plants
      having larger size and greater yields. However, the foregoing
      conclusions are merely generalizations, and the particular pole to
      which a particular seed should be exposed varies on a seed type by
      seed type basis. Aside from these general trends, there is little
      consistency in results attained between different seed types under
      similar exposure conditions although for each seed type the
      results appear to be consistently reproducible. Thus it cannot be
      stated categorically that north pole exposure is better or worse
      than south pole exposure--it depends upon the seed type and the
      desired results. For example, although south pole exposure may
      produce a plant having higher protein and sugars content than
      north pole exposure under ideal growth conditions, since the south
      pole root structure is shallow, such a plant would do poorly in
      arid areas. Therefore, it might be desirable to use north pole
      exposure to obtain deeper root penetration notwithstanding that
      the protein and sugars content in the resulting plant might not be
      as good under ideal conditions. Under the arid conditions, north
      pole protein and sugars content may turn out to be better because
      the plant will be healthier.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples illustrate how seed exposure in the
      apparatus of the present invention to north and south pole
      magnetic fields influences the chemical and physical
      characteristics of the plants grown therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE I</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Commercial dry corn and food table corn seeds were divided into
      three groups. The first group was exposed by rotating and tumbling
      in a magnetic field created by a magnetic north pole for a fixed
      time period. The second group was similarly exposed for the same
      time period to the magnetic field created by a magnetic south
      pole. The third group was rotated and tumbled in the apparatus,
      but without any magnetic field, for the same time period. The
      magnetic field strengths for both north and south poles were 600
      gauss at the seeds. The treatment time for all groups was 15
      minutes. A large number of separate plantings were made for seeds
      from each group under identical soil and ambient conditions. The
      seeds developed into plants and the plants were all harvested at
      the same time. The following Table I tabulates the averaged
      results for all plantings for each group for the indicated plant
      characteristic measured by conventional techniques.<br>
      <br>

      pH 6.3 6.5 6.2<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing data are noteworthy for a number of reasons. First,
      it appears that both north and south pole exposed seeds produced
      plants having improved quantities of sugars and proteins, although
      south pole exposed seeds produced plants which were superior in
      these characteristics. Second, south pole exposed seeds appeared
      to germinate more rapidly than north pole exposed seeds which, in
      turn, germinated more rapidly than the controls. Third, north pole
      exposed seeds produced the greatest yields, followed by south pole
      exposed seeds and then by the controls. In each case, yield was
      calculated in ears/acre. Finally, both north and south pole
      magnetic field exposure seemed to increase acidity in the cob
      compared to the control. However, in the kernels, south pole
      exposure decreased acidity although north pole exposure increased
      acidity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE II</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As in Example I, corn seeds in three groups were exposed to 600
      gauss north and south pole fields and to no magnetic field
      whatever while being rotated and tumbled in the apparatus of the
      present invention for 15 minutes. The purpose of this example was
      to demonstrate the effects of exposure on various corn seed
      varieties.<br>
      <br>
      Nine separate corn seed varieties were exposed to a south pole
      field and to no field at all and then a number of separate
      plantings of each seed variety were made. Measurements of stalk
      lengths in inches were made 30 days after planting. The results
      for each variety are set forth in Table II.<br>
      <br>

      11.7 15.6<br>
      <br>
      It is apparent that south pole exposure resulted in increased
      stalk length 30 days after planting. North pole exposure resulted
      in still greater growth increases relative to the controls,
      averaging about 35% increased growth as compared with the Table II
      data which averaged about 31% increased growth.<br>
      <br>
      The stalks were analyzed for protein content. It was found that
      the protein averaged 14.7% in the controls while south pole
      exposed seeds yielded plants averaging 22.7% as shown in Table III
      where the corn varieties are identified by their corresponding
      numbers from Table II.<br>

      9 14.6% 21.1%<br>
      <br>
      Protein measurements on the whole cob with the kernels intact
      showed that protein in the controls averaged 27% whereas south
      pole exposed seeds yielded plants averaging 36.4% protein.<br>
      <br>
      Stalk diameter measurements were also made at harvesting on each
      of the varieties. The results appear in Table IV.<br>

      Similar studies made on plants grown from magnetic field exposed
      soy beans, beans, sugar beets, peas, melons, cucumbers, oats,
      wheat, rye, barley and twelve other vegetable and grain plants
      yielded results indicating about 12 to 30% increases in plant
      growth and characteristics in the plants grown from north or south
      pole exposed seeds compared with the controls.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE III</b><br>
      <br>
      Seeds from radish plants were exposed in the apparatus of the
      present invention to north and south pole magnetic fields of about
      1200 gauss for varying time intervals. The seeds were planted in
      substantially identical adjacent plots and subjected to
      substantially identical environmental conditions. After 30 days
      the length of the plant leaves were measured to determine the
      optimum exposure time for radishes.<br>

      60 minutes 3 23/4<br>
      <br>
      It is interesting that the optimum exposure time period for north
      pole exposure of radish seeds as determined from 30 day leaf
      length is 5 minutes or 60 minutes. For south pole exposed seeds,
      the optimum exposure time appears to be 45 minutes or 25 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE IV</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example III was practiced on a variety of corn
      seeds using only the north pole field at 1200 gauss. The stalk
      height was measured after 30 days. The results are set forth
      below:<br>

      The optimum exposure time for this variety corn seed based upon

      minutes.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE V</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example III was practiced on another variety of

      The procedure of Example III was practiced on English pea seeds by
      exposing the seeds to 1200 gauss of a north pole field. Thirty
      days after planting, plant height was measured and appears below:<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE VII</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example III was practiced on English pea seeds by
      exposing the seeds to 1200 gauss of a south pole field. Thirty
      days after planting, plant height was measured and appears below:<br>

      40 minutes 4<br>
      60 minutes 41/4<br>

      The optimum time of south pole exposure for this variety pea seed
      based upon maximizing plant height appears to be 10 minutes.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE VIII</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example III was practiced on a variety of string
      bean seeds using only the south pole field at 600 gauss. Plant
      height measurements were made 19 days after planting with the
      following results:<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE X</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plant Height<br>
      South Pole<br>
      Exposure Time Plant Height (in.)<br>
      0 (control) 5<br>
      5 minutes 41/4<br>
      10 minutes 41/2<br>
      15 minutes 7<br>
      30 minutes 6<br>
      45 minutes 31/2<br>
      60 minutes 6<br>
      <br>
      The optimum south pole exposure time to maximize plant height for
      these string bean seeds appears to be 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE IX</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The procedure of Example VIII was practiced on cantaloupe,
      watermelon and tomato seeds using only the south pole energies at
      600 gauss. Plant height measurements were made 19 days after
      planting. Tabulated below are the optimum south pole exposure
      times for each type seed to maximize plant height:<br>
      <br>
      Watermelon 5 minutes<br>
      Cantaloupe 10 minutes<br>
      Tomato 10 minutes<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing examples indicate that rotating and tumbling plant
      seeds in the apparatus of the present invention while exposing
      them to the magnetic field energies of only one magnetic pole
      improves many of the characteristics of the resulting plant. No
      supportable explanation for the differing effects of the
      respective poles and the varying exposure times appears available.
      However, it is believed that each pole affects each element and
      organic bond in the plant structure in a different manner and
      because, by their nature, each seed and plant variety have
      differing elemental compositions and structures, the magnetic pole
      exposure effect differs for each plant. However, the common thread
      in the experimental results appears to be that exposure to a
      unipolar magnetic field generally improves plant characteristics
      over similarly treated but unexposed controls and that the
      exercise of control over exposure time is critical. Moreover, it
      has been found that unipolar magnetic field exposure in a distinct
      improvement over bipolar magnetic field exposure.<br>
