      The invention relates to the study of physical parameters of a

      different states, such as those associated with processing, aimed
      at improving the quality of products.<br>
      <br>
      The practical application of the technology of aviation and space
      engine and Apparatus (instrumental and primary production),
      medical diagnosis of the human condition, and others.<br>

      A method is known studieseletrophysiological surface conditions
      comprising that the material, one face of which was examined fixed
      with macroscopic gap relative to the receiving electrode, the
      receiving electrode connected to the input of the operational
      amplifier as a first stage and a differential amplifier as the
      second stage is isolated and reinforcing only varying part of the
      signal, an operational amplifier span feedback through a
      RC-circuit of a capacitor and a resistor, the free edge of the
      material is connected through a resistor to the free input of the
      operational amplifier having connections to the body of the device
      and the measurement of the signal produced at the output of the
      differential amplifier [1] Disadvantages of existing method
      associated with leakage of the charge through the input amplifier
      circuit at the time of measurement, and consequently,introducing
      systematic error, firstly, and low accuracy in the measurement of
      weak electrostatic parameters, and secondly, (since the signal
      gain can be achieved only by measuring the current through the
      receiving electrode when it approaches the surface when there is a
      change in capacitance between the surface and the electrode) does
      not allow the use of a method for identifying a substance and a
      category of state of the object.<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      A method is known studies of electrostatic fields surfaces,
      preferably after the various processing aimed at improving the
      quality of products comprising that material one of whose surfaces
      examined, fixed with a uniform gap relative to the plate of the
      receiving electrode, with a receiving electrode connected to an
      input of electrometer amplifier , the latter operate on the
      differential amplifier, the outputs of which the signals applied
      to the inputs of the operational amplifier and the electrometer
      amplifier span parallel negative feedback via a capacitor, in
      which the receiving electrode with induced charge without first
      modulating the electric field at the moment it approaches the
      surface under investigation,and measure the voltage at the output
      [2] The disadvantages of the method: the leakage of charge through
      the amplifier; low precision in the study of weak fields;
      one-parameter study does not allow the identification of the
      substance or category of object state.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      By identifying realize establishment of the fact whether the test
      substance or the state of the object to one of the known which on
      the basis of preliminary experimental data produced by the
      corresponding rank (systematization) the spectrum recorded
      characteristics (e.g., x-ray analysis for the presence of a
      particular line in the spectrum of the secondary X-ray judge about
      the object of its composition or state, for example, the
      allocation of the various chemical components of phase).<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      The closest technical solution chosen as the closest analog is a
      method of investigation of the electromagnetic fields surfaces
      consists in the fact that the object of investigation and the
      plate receiving electrode is placed in a shielded insulated
      chamber research facility is connected to the ground bus meter
      test surface has a fixedly on the fixed distance relative to the
      receiving electrode, the receiving electrode connected to the
      input of the operational amplifier through an electronic switch
      voltage amplifier span parallel negative feedback via a capacitor,
      on which a receiving electrode induces a charge, sets a
      predetermined switching frequency, produce at the amplifier output
      pulses of input current and a pulse current through capacity
      "investigated surface receiving electrode"increase induced on the
      capacitor negative feedback charge by integrating the pulsed
      increment of the input current of the amplifier within a
      predetermined period of time and measure the output voltage [3]
      The disadvantage of the closest analog-parameter study, does not
      allow identification of the substance or category of state of an
      object, including taking into account the presence of local Places
      outages in the composition of matter and the state of the object.<br>
      <br>
      Specific dimensions of local inhomogeneities could be identified
      with traditional scanning the surface of the object.<br>
      <br>
      Another disadvantage of narrow functionality due to lack of
      measuring the phase shift between the various frequency components
      of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      The goal is achieved by a method for the study of electromagnetic
      fields surfaces, lies in the fact that the object of study and a
      plate - a receiving electrode placed in a shielded insulated
      chamber, the object of investigation is connected to the ground
      bus meter piemny electrode is connected to the input of the
      operational amplifier via the electronic switch voltage
      operational amplifier span parallel negative feedback via a
      capacitor, in which the receiving electrode is induced with a
      charge, a predetermined set switching frequency, to provide input
      operational amplifier input current pulses and a pulse current
      through the capacitance "investigated surface receiving
      electrode"increase induced by the capacitor negative feedback
      charge by integrating the pulse increment input current amplifier
      for a predetermined period of time, measured the output voltage,
      unlike the prototype produces a change of the switching frequency
      in a predetermined range is determined corresponding to each value
      of the frequency of the output voltage and is plotted switching
      frequency output voltage, then built the spectral dependence
      determine the value of the switching frequency, the corresponding
      line of extreme output voltage and use the presence of this line
      and its intensity for identification.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      The drawing shows an equivalent circuit of the method of
      investigation of the electromagnetic field as the object surfaces
      prior art method and the proposed method.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      It is evident that a change in the input voltage is equal to where
      f is the switching frequency, &amp; omega; &amp; Pi = 2; f input
      resistance Rin of the operational amplifier.<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Through capacitance Ci flowing pulse current proportional to the
      input voltage Vin equal to Vin + &amp; Delta; Ui use of electronic
      switch voltage, connect it directly to the input of the
      operational amplifier; setting the switching frequency f, creating
      at the amplifier input pulses of the input current, and generates
      a pulsed current through the capacitance investigated surface
      receiving electrode integration pulsed increment of the input
      current of the amplifier within a predetermined period of time to
      increase the induced capacitor feedback charge investigated metal
      surface enable together exactly make measurement of weak
      electrostatic fields surfaces.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the switching frequency is changed in a
      predetermined range, the output voltage is determined for each new
      value of the frequency is plotted "switching frequency output
      voltage" is determined according to the maximum spectral
      constructed and used the presence of the line (maximum) and its

        <b>METHOD OF PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC ANOMALIES AT
          EARTH SURFACE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      FIELD: medicine; medical engineering. SUBSTANCE: method may be
      used to protect living organisms against detrimental effects of
      earth radiation anomalies. Method allows higher accuracy due to
      objectivization of determination of geopathogenic zone localizing
      boundaries and classification of anomalies. Method guarantees
      protection against other components of earth radiation of other
      nature. It also provides for protection against volumetric
      distribution of earth radiation anomalies. Method includes
      determination of objective noise phase-frequency characteristics
      of earth radiation electrical component within range of section
      being examined. Map of nonuniformities of field characteristic
      distribution over space located above section being examined is
      drawn up, and objects to be protected are arranged at places
      corresponding to those in map with the least values of field
      characteristics.; <br>
      EFFECT: higher accuracy, enhanced reliability<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of medicine and medical
      equipment and can be used to protect living organisms from harmful
      effects of the anomalies of terrestrial radiation, including
      electromagnetic, in the so-called geopathogenic zones, such as the
      placement of beds, planning jobs, the construction of houses, the
      choice , broken down and seeding garden and vegetable plots.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      There is a method to compensate for the geomagnetic field, which
      consists in the fact that they create an additional magnetic field
      with the help of independent auxiliary windings powered by power
      sources, which are controlled by signals from the magnetometers,
      proportional to the measured or the fluctuations of the
      geomagnetic field of the measurement of the current in the main
      compensating windings [1].<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of this method are the high complexity, low
      accuracy due to the impossibility of compensating all the
      irregularities of the field by a finite set of sources, low
      functionality for failure to compensate the volume distribution of
      the anomalies of the field, as well as the low reliability of the
      protection due compensation only part of the electromagnetic
      radiation of the earth.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      Known method of protection against terrestrial radiation,
      comprising the steps of determining the characteristics of the
      field distribution characteristics map a field and place the
      objects to be protected, at locations corresponding to the lowest
      values ??of the characteristics.<br>
      In addition, characteristics of the field is determined indirectly
      on the subjective feelings of the operator, and a map of the
      projections constitute a subjective sensation of the operator on
      the surface of the test site.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, an indication of subjective sensations of the
      operator is carried out by a spontaneous motion of a pendulum or a
      frame that keeps the operator in the handles and moves at a
      constant height above the surface of the investigated area [2].<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of the known method is the low accuracy and
      repeatability due to the placement of objects on the basis of the
      maps, which is a reflection of the subjective feelings of the
      operator moving across the survey area, which is largely dependent
      on the individual operator, its individual sensitivity, emotional
      and physical condition, the impact of external psychophysiological
      factors etc.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the drawbacks of the method are also low
      functionality, not allowing to protect objects from bulk geopathic
      formations.<br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention is to improve the accuracy by
      objectification delimitation localization of geopathic zones and
      classification anomalies, simplifying, improving the reliability
      due to the fact that the invention makes it possible to guarantee
      the protection of the other components of the terrestrial
      radiation of a different nature, as well as enhanced functionality
      through the definition and protection of the surround distribution
      of anomalies of terrestrial radiation, as well as increased
      sensitivity and reproducibility of measurements.<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this goal in the known method of protection against
      terrestrial radiation is the fact that determine the
      characteristics of the field, up map of the characteristics of the
      field and place the objects to be protected in the positions
      corresponding to the lowest values ??of the characteristics as the
      characteristics of the field is determined by objective
      phase-frequency characteristics of the noise electric component of
      terrestrial radiation map of the characteristics of the field up
      in space over the study area, and securable objects are placed on
      the map of the objective characteristics of the field, and the
      accommodations are spatial regions.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, phase response terrestrial radiation is determined by
      the fact that they take a receiving antenna noise signal electric
      component of the earth radiation, convert it to a noise electric
      signal from which is isolated by at least one harmonic component
      at a fixed frequency in the range of super-long wave is measured
      and indicates the amount of shift in phase between this component
      and the reference signal of the same frequency within the dead
      zone and the integral of the phase shift outside the deadband.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the map distribution characteristics of the field

      The method of protection against electromagnetic anomalies at the
      surface of the Earth is based on the objectification determine the
      exact boundaries of geopathic anomalies fixing distortion field,
      determined by the nature of change in phase-frequency
      characteristics of the noise component of the electromagnetic
      field of super-long radio frequency waves, while moving the
      antenna above the sample surface.<br>
      <br>
      Reading phase field parameters can significantly improve the noise
      immunity of determining geopathogenic zones and therefore the
      accuracy of the method, as interference are mostly amplitude
      character.<br>
      A background noise component of the electromagnetic field produced
      by the electric component of the background radiation over the
      survey area by measuring fluctuations of the charge receiving
      antenna, which can significantly weaken the magnetic component of
      noise having a frequency band used in precedence, for example in
      the form of radiation stations.<br>
      <br>
      The method uses the most informative signal noise components in a
      useful signal, which is achieved in combination with an additional
      operation input using ultrashort untuned wideband antenna whose
      dimensions are much smaller than the resonance at the frequencies
      that also provides attenuation of radio signals, aligns thereby
      gain characteristics received noise signals, which eliminates the
      need for gain control.<br>
      <br>
      All these operations are further in combination allow so increase
      the gain when detecting geopathic zones, making possible their
      objective localization with high accuracy, unlike the known
      existing methods, including the prototype, which significantly
      improves the reliability of the protection.<br>
      <br>
      The method of protection against electromagnetic anomalies in the
      Earth's surface is also based on the redistribution of protected
      sites in the most secure areas of the re-created the spatial
      pattern of the field.<br>
      <br>
      This takes into account the presence of not only the projection of
      the field inhomogeneities on the earth's surface (or the surface
      of the floor in a residential area) in the form of networks
      Hartman [3] Kurri [4] and geopathogenic spots [5], but also the
      spatial structure of the networks and spots topology with which a
      change in the height range of the human growth may largely differ
      from the cross section near the surface under study, which is
      usually the only way and taken into account in the known methods.<br>
      <br>
      This in turn imposes more stringent restrictions on the placement
      of objects to be protected than in the prior art, t. E. The
      operation of accommodation due to it is performed differently.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, identification of hazards in the spatial field
      pattern of the study area and the redistribution of protected
      sites effectively guarantees their protection from the harmful
      effects of the electromagnetic component, and on the components of
      a different nature, which is not true of the known methods of
      protection, based on the screening because they allow protects the
      lens only by a particular component of the radiation, such as
      electromagnetic.<br>
      To. It is known that in geopathogenic zones has a match in the
      topology status abnormalities fields of different nature (magnetic
      [6], the electromagnetic radio spectrum [7], the ultraviolet range
      [8], increased background radiation [9], climate anomalies [10]
      and may still unknown nature), then the best choice is the radical
      protection safe place for one of the most easily detected
      radiation components corresponding to the object arrangement and
      protection as is done in the proposed method.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      The method of protection against electromagnetic anomalies in the
      Earth's surface is as follows.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      By scanning the test area define the characteristics of the
      electromagnetic field at a constant height from the surface of the
      land and map the characteristics of the field inhomogeneities.<br>
      [0021]<br>
      <br>
      Features field determined by the fact that a portion of the
      surface parallel to the receiving antenna in the form of a
      conductive disc diameter of 2 - 10 cm, which forms the surface
      portion of electrical capacitance, the magnitude of charge which
      does not depend on the distance from the surface portion and an
      electrical signal proportional to the noise component of the
      radiophone.<br>
      <br>
      Since the reception is performed in the range of super-long wave
      (1 - 10 kHz), and the dimensions of the antenna are the super
      small compared to the operating wavelength, the antenna is tuned
      away from the resonance in this range, resulting in not performed
      amplification at a single frequency, and are received noise
      signals over a wide range.<br>
      Since such an antenna is not resonant, then it ensures uniform
      amplitude-frequency characteristic around the operating frequency
      range, resulting in no need to adjust the gain in the search
      process, which greatly simplifies the method.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the noise signal that is proportional to the charge of
      the antenna component is isolated by filtering the frequency
      narrow-band filter with a bandwidth equal shares of Hertz and
      determine its phase shift relative to the reference signal whose
      frequency is equal to the average frequency notch filter settings.<br>
      <br>
      This value of phase difference and is used as a characteristic of
      the field plot.<br>
      <br>
      Since the change of phase shift, a diverse field in geopathogenic
      zones are small, are calculated and displayed the integral of the
      phase shift.<br>
      <br>
      Before driving the antenna at any reference point sample portion
      compensates the interfering background alignment phase shift
      between the received and the reference signal by adjusting the
      phase of the reference signal.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the antenna is moved at a constant velocity at a height
      of 0.8 - 1 m above the test site or at a predetermined level, and
      the appearance and sharp increase in the signal integral of the
      phase shift is judged to join the geopathic zone.<br>
      <br>
      Fixing the integral of the phase shift can significantly improve
      the accuracy of recording the presence of small phase shifts,
      since the appearance of even small quantities of the phase shift
      is a continuous growth of its integral, until reaching the
      saturation value of the integral over a finite time, it is easy to
      find on the display.<br>
      <br>
      The speed of this growth at a constant rate of movement of the
      antenna can judge the intensity of geopathic anomalies.<br>
      <br>
      The exact definition of the boundaries 1 geopathic zones (GPZ) 2
      (1) produced by the appearance of a small reversible phase-shift,
      smaller dead zone and integrator immediately preceding
      integration.<br>
      <br>
      Since the intervals between geopathogenic zones 2, i.e. Zones
      sharply pronounced change in phase shift 3 present his small
      fluctuations 4, the presence of a dead zone 5 integrator to avoid
      integrating them (Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      The exact boundaries of GPP 2 is determined while fixing the
      position since the start of integration 6 and subsequent fixation
      of the position immediately preceding the date the integration
      resetting the integrator 7, which is the exact boundary of 1 ILI
      2.<br>
      <br>
      Position the start of integration 6 is determined by the fact that
      immediately after the sharp increase of the indicator come back
      for a short distance, set the zero initial conditions of
      integration and continue to move forward at a constant speed, but
      oscillating 8 amplitude of several centimeters back and forth by
      the receiving antenna 9 (Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      The position is determined by the beginning of the integration
      between the last swing of the antenna 9 in which a reversible
      change of the indicator, and the first swing, which while
      advancing backwards indicator is not reduced.<br>
      <br>
      The distance between the exact boundaries of GPP 1 and the start
      of integration 6 is typically a few centimeters.<br>
      <br>
      If this accuracy is not required, it can be considered the
      beginning of ILI starting position of integration 6, and the
      display indicate only signals exceeding the dead zone of the
      integrator 5 (2).<br>
      [0022]<br>
      <br>
      In order to avoid the accumulation of hardware drift before and
      during measurements periodically set the initial conditions of the
      integrator to zero.<br>
      [0023]<br>
      <br>
      After identifying the topology of the borders of geopathogenic
      zones characterized by the presence of a phase shift greater than
      the dead zone integrator and mapping projection irregularities
      electromagnetic field on the surface of the entire study area,
      producing movement of objects to be protected (plants, places of
      permanent residence of people, for example, sleeping, working and
      etc.) in place with the minimum values ??of the characteristics of
      the field, ie, with zero phase shift (with a constant phase shift
      without sudden changes).<br>
      [0024]<br>

      In drawing up the three-dimensional map of the field

      parallel to the three mutually perpendicular planes at different
      levels and for each level up my card section for measuring time

      In order to expedite the more detailed measurement is carried out
      in areas identified ILI (3).<br>
      [0025]<br>
      <br>
      Redistribution protection objects is carried out in accordance
      with their size and shape in three dimensions so that no part of
      the object does not reach the place of his permanent residence in
      any part of the GEA. For example, no part of the body of a man
      sitting behind a desk or standing at the workplace should not fall
      into the GEA throughout the growth (Figure 4). The inadmissibility
      of stay in the workplace 4 can only be determined by the proposed
      method, t. To. The known methods show that the spot (GPP
      projection on the floor) is located outside the workplace.<br>

      The proposed method of protection against electromagnetic
      anomalies in the Earth's surface has been applied at the request

      cross sections of said vertical columns with a height dowsing

      functionality of the method in determining the volumetric topology

      <br>
      For half of the year (1992) of the proposed method of protection
      against electromagnetic anomalies in the Earth's surface have been
      surveyed about 1,000 sites, of which 10 per cent are garden plots.
      The total area of ??all objects was not less than 25,000 square
      meters. We were given the relevant scheme of permutations that are
      in 80 percent of cases. A significant improvement in well-being,
      health, sleep, interpersonal relationships reported about 54
      percent of people whose sleeping and jobs were geopathogenic zones
      before applying the method. There are cases of severe changes in
      course of disease and cure infertility.<br>
      [0039]<br>
      <br>
      Prepared to release new building codes, taking into account the
      placement of geopathic zones on the ground during the planning of
      residential and industrial buildings.<br>
      [0040]<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method for protecting against electromagnetic anomaly
      in the earth's surface has the following advantages over known
      methods, including the prior art: - a high accuracy by
      objectification of a method including the steps of determining the
      boundaries and classification geopathic zones, and also by use of
      the phase method and the method,allows to realize high sensitivity
      due to the display of the integral of the phase shift; - Low
      probability of error due to the high noise immunity operation
      locate geopathic zones and their mapping from the use of phase
      measurements, coupled with the natural noise of the electric
      component of the electromagnetic field as a useful signal; -
      Significantly enhanced functionality at the expense of the
      protection of the volume distribution of geopathic zones around
      the living space above the test site; - Significantly higher
      reliability of protection, because by further introduction of the
      operation is carried out keeping the bulk configuration of
      geopathic zones, which differ in general by their projection on a
      horizontal surface,which alone is taken into consideration in the
      prior art, thereby realizing tighter security requirements
      geopathogenic; - Significantly higher reliability of protection,
      since the proposed method, in contrast to the known can guarantee
      protection against all types of terrestrial radiation component
      not only of electromagnetic nature; - Simplicity and accessibility
      implementation due to lack of need for any special protective
      equipment such as screens, pyramids, pastes, special clothing,
      etc.<br>

      FIELD: medicine; medical engineering. SUBSTANCE: method may be
      used for noninvasive remote diagnostics of pathologic and
      prepatologic conditions. It may be used as means for preliminary
      diagnostics, topological diagnostics of organ diseases in
      dynamics, as well as for checking the dynamics of treatment
      process. Method includes estimation of topology of equipotential
      surfaces of biological object magnetic field by phase shift
      parameter, topological diagnostics of organs and tissues, use of
      super-long-wave range and phase-frequency analysis, as well as use
      of noise as useful signal.; Topological analysis of configuration
      of equipotential field surfaces allows estimation of total
      potential of organism protective forces by relative dimensions of
      equipotential surfaces and localizing of pathologic foci by
      position of concavities and convexities in picture of
      equipotential surface relative to biological object body.
      Deviation of received signal phase from reference signal phase is
      checked by recording the signal equal to integral of received and
      reference signal difference. Equipotential curve may be plotted by
      great number of points with any preset discreteness which is
      expedient in automation of measurements and plotting of topograms.
      When tracking system is used continuous scanning of equipotential
      curve with controlled movement of receiving electrode may be
      provided. EFFECT: enlarged functional and diagnostic capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      [0001]<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of medicine and medical
      equipment and can be used for non-invasive diagnosis of
      pathological and remote prepathological states, as a means of
      pre-diagnostic for the diagnosis of diseases of the topological
      dynamics, as well as to control the dynamics of the process of
      treatment.<br>
      [0002]<br>
      <br>
      There is a method for remote monitoring of internal physiological
      processes of a person due to the fact that the measured
      electromagnetic signals emanating from the body over time in the
      range of 0.3-0.4 Hz 40 ... and share the signals on the ECG, EEG,
      EMG, EOG and respiratory wave due to the fact that a distance of
      up to 12 feet. from the body supercooled superconducting complex
      antenna, the temperature of which is maintained at approximately
      3,7 K, produce optimal filtering the received signal thereby
      maximize the signal / noise ratio, received signal is converted to
      digital form, is transmitted to a digital processor which divides
      the received signal into components that characterize the
      physiological processes in the body, namely, ECG, EEG, EMG, EOG
      and breath wave and display it on the display [1].<br>
      [0003]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of this method are the limited functionality of
      the diagnosis since it is possible to observe only the
      instantaneous values ??fleeting electrophysiologic processor
      organism and does not allow to evaluate the characteristics and
      condition of nearly constant field electromagnetic envelope around
      the body, and also allows for topology diagnosis of organs and
      tissues due to registering a total instantaneous amplitude
      intensity of the electromagnetic field of the patient.<br>
      [0004]<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the proposed method is known for mapping the
      electrical comprising that above the surface of bioobject measured
      spatial distribution of the electric charge, and the measurement
      is carried out by the fact that at a distance above the bioobject
      a receiving electrode and measure its charge.<big> </big>Furthermore,







      the other side of the bioobject symmetrically to the first
      receiving electrode located at a distance above the bioobject
      second receiving electrode and form electrical capacitance with
      the first receiving electrode, and the biological object is placed
      in the interelectrode space, whereupon before measuring the charge
      of the first receiving electrode produce charge bioobject
      high-frequency electric field [2 ].<br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of this method are low functional and diagnostic
      capabilities, and low diagnostic accuracy. This is because the
      known method allows to obtain the card only fast processes, namely
      insensible perspiration, reflecting thermoregulatory response of
      the organism, as well as mechanical vibrations of a charged
      surface of the body associated with the mechanical functioning of
      the internal organs. In view of the rapid dynamics of these
      processes, its connection with the disease is extremely difficult
      because of the high unsteadiness, stochasticity and large
      individual variation. In addition, the conclusion of any
      abnormalities shall be made regarding the status of that developed
      in a patient over an extended period of time calculated in months
      or more, that is. E. Observability is commensurate with this
      period. This is a clear disproportion between the temporal
      organization of the disease and informative signs, taken as a
      diagnosis in the known method, greatly complicates the diagnosis
      and reduces the accuracy of the diagnosis, and, moreover, does not
      allow to identify the underlying causes of the disease, allowing
      the judge only on its external manifestations. The known method
      eliminates the need for cryogenic technology, which makes it
      relatively simple and affordable, but at the same time it requires
      a preliminary charge of skin outside a sufficiently strong
      high-frequency electric field is created on the surface of the
      body of a regular electric charge that makes the known method of
      actively using rough external influences on a person negatively
      affects its bio-energy and introducing distortion in the
      measurement.<br>
      [0006]<br>

      Known cryogenic physiographer comprising a receiving antenna
      triangular shape, consisting of three identical metal plates and
      supercooled superconducting three identical supercooled analog
      blocks, each of which is connected to a respective plate; analog
      block containing circuitry noise reduction, the input of which is
      the input of the analog block, and is connected to the outputs of
      the three supercooled analog blocks antennas, fiber optic link
      having an input coupled to the output of the circuit noise
      reduction low-pass filter having an input connected to the output
      fiber optic line connection, and the output is an analog output
      unit; analog-to-digital converter having an input connected to the
      output of the analog block; Four-memory blockinputs connected to
      the outputs of the analog-to-digital converter; four Fourier
      processor and four correlators whose inputs are connected to the
      respective outputs of the four channels of the storage unit; a
      mini-computer with a display having inputs connected to the
      outputs of the correlators and Fourier processors, and four
      outputs connected to four digital-analog converter to the inputs
      of four-recorder [3].<br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of the known device is the high degree of
      complexity and low performance, including by reason of the
      application of cryogenic technology, as well as low functional and
      diagnostic capabilities for failure to assess the stationary
      states of the body, inability to conduct topologichnskoy
      diagnostics, as well as due to control only the instantaneous
      values ??of physiological parameters having a very complex and
      difficult relationship with the general condition of the patient.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      The closest to the proposed device is to measure the electrical
      charge bioobject comprising measuring a receiving electrode and
      the recording device having an input electrically coupled to the
      receiving electrode. Furthermore, the device comprises a grounded
      shield configured in the form of two connected telescopically,
      hollow cylinders, the inner cylinder is arranged plugged end, and
      the outer is provided with a flat annular fifth fixed at its end
      opposite the anechoic end of the inner cylinder, in the cavity
      which is situated measuring a receiving electrode and secured at a
      fixed distance from the open end [4].<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      The disadvantages of the known device is the low functionality and
      diagnostic capabilities for failure to assess the configuration of
      the field, low accuracy and noise immunity due to the measurement
      of the surface of a static field, which is highly variable and
      dependent on external conditions, but because of low information
      content, particularly on the state of internal organs.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention is to expand the functional and
      diagnostic capabilities through the implementation of the
      possibility of assessing the topology of the equipotential
      surfaces of the electromagnetic field biological object to a
      parameter of the phase shift of the topological diagnostics of
      organs and tissues, increase diagnostic accuracy and noise
      immunity due to the use superlong range and phase analysis as well
      as through the use of noise as the useful signal.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      To achieve this goal in the known method the electric mapping
      comprising that above the surface of bioobject measured spatial
      distribution of the electric charge measurements are made due to
      the fact that at a distance above the bioobject a receiving
      electrode and measure the battery charge, an additional range of
      super-long radio waves on the noise component of the electric
      charge receiving electrode due to the fact that they take the
      noise signal from the receiving electrode separated frequency
      component at a fixed frequency of the noise signal fluktatsy
      charge receiving electrode, and as a parameter to estimate the
      field using the phase shift amount between the selected frequency
      component and the reference signal of the same frequency,
      configuration, location and shape of the curve with respect to the
      biological object parameter estimation of a field trial, the
      extent and localization In addition, measurements are made loft
      space around the biological object, with each section building
      curve equipotential surface of the measured parameter field.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the receiving electrode is moved parallel to the
      surface of the biological object at the same distance from it,
      wherein before moving align the phase of the reference and the
      received signal by adjusting the reference signal, and during the
      movement of the seating area on the bioobject, above which there
      is a phase change which is judged on the localization processes
      and pathological changes.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the curve of equipotential surface evaluation of
      fields in each section bioobject building due to the fact that
      every time aligned interfering background because the set
      receiving the electrode at the same distance from the biological
      object, by adjusting the phase of a reference signal aligned phase
      of the reference and the received signal is then transferred to
      the constant velocity along a straight receiving electrode toward
      bioobject and determine the distance from the receiving electrode
      to the biological object from which recorded a non-zero value, or
      the excess of the prescribed constant phase difference between the
      received and reference signals. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, each time changing the frequency of the reference
      signal within a range of super-long radio waves, and for each
      frequency corresponding curve build equipotential surface measured
      parameter field. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the phase deviation of the received signal from the
      reference register by the fact that the determined value of the
      integral of the phase difference of the received and reference
      signals, by its presence and change judging the phase deviation of
      the received signal from the phase reference signal, and the slew
      rate - of the magnitude of the phase difference and every time you
      install a new dimension zero initial conditions of integration. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the curve of the equipotential surface of the field
      in the section are building due to the fact that carry automatic
      movement of the receiving electrode directly on a curve
      equipotential surface around bioobject within each section due to
      the fact that they produce the movement of the receiving electrode
      around the circumference of the biological object in the plane of
      the section, determine the amount of deviation of the phase
      difference of the reference and the received signals from the
      preassigned value to control the radial movement of the receiving
      electrode from the deviation of the phase difference from the
      target value and determining the distance and configuration of
      equipotential curve to the bioobject. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the obtained sections bioelectromagnetic fields
      produce three-dimensional reconstruction of the equipotential
      surfaces of the field for each frequency. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the change of sections bioelectromagnetic field
      bioobject automatically generate pre-programmed so that the
      exercise continuous scanning receiver electrode equipotential
      surface field parameter biological object, such as a helical path.
      In addition, simultaneously with the measurement of the surface
      configuration of the field determines the biological object or a
      major proportion and combine them into one scale derived from the
      equipotential surface of the field.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, in determining the configuration of the equipotential
      surfaces to reduce the size of the judge lowered the general
      defenses, and localization of local depressions and bulges
      equipotential surface is judged on the localization of
      pathological morphological and functional changes in the relevant
      field of tissues and organs bioobject.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the section of the equipotential surface is arranged
      so as to extend through the centers of the autonomic nerve plexus
      and subcortical structures, and the localization of deformation of
      the equipotential surface in the respective centers are judged on
      the pathology of managed these centers.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, measurements are made periodically during the course
      of medication, physiotherapy, reflex, manual, or other types of
      therapy and form the feedback parameters therapeutic effect due to
      the fact that the dynamics of change in the configuration of the
      equipotential surfaces in the course of therapy is judged on its
      effectiveness and accuracy and if necessary, make the correction
      circuits doses and treatments.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>

      A method for evaluating the electromagnetic field biological
      object based on the topological analysis of the equipotential
      surfaces of a stationary electromagnetic field surrounding
      biological object.<br>
      As an option, which is being built on equipotential surfaces, used
      in contrast to all the known literary sources, the magnitude of
      the phase shift between the reference signal of fixed frequency
      and the harmonic component of the received noise signal.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the noise signal held about the biological object is useful,
      and use as a working range of super-long radio waves from 1 to 10
      kHz allows tune out fast rhythmic physiological processes (such as
      ECG, EEG, KRG, EMG, circadian rhythm and etc.) and judge slowly
      changing stationary field, bearing the imprint of the total
      functional and morphological state organs, tissues and systems of
      the body, and responds to medication and other types of treatment
      modalities.<br>
      <br>
      At the same topological analysis of the configuration of the
      equipotential surfaces of the field allows us to estimate how
      common the potential of the body's defenses in the relative size
      of the equipotential surfaces, and localization of lesions on the
      location of cavities and protuberances on the film surface with
      respect to the equipotential body bioobject.<br>
      [0030]<br>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that the change in phase of the received signals
      represent a relatively small value to increase the overall
      sensitivity and noise immunity of the process control of the phase
      deviation of the received signal from the reference produced by
      the fact that the recorded signal is equal to the integral of the
      phase difference of the received and reference signals.<br>
      <br>
      It is sufficient, even minor deviations phase to the phase
      difference signal integrator began to grow continuously and for a
      finite time interval peaked, which is easily detected by
      conventional instrumentation.<br>
      <br>
      Estimates of the rate of increase of the integral of the phase
      difference at a constant speed of the receiving antenna (receiving
      electrode) or the evaluation of its value over a fixed period of
      time to judge the magnitude of the phase jump.<br>
      <br>
      To fix the next phase jump over another portion of the patient's
      body, previously set zero initial conditions of integration.<br>
      [0031]<br>
      <br>
      A method for evaluating the electromagnetic field biological
      object is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Patient 1 (FIG. 1) is placed in the supine position on a reel 2.
      To reduce non-automated diagnostic procedures of the
      electromagnetic field evaluation of a person made in the spatial
      orientation of the receiving electrode (antenna) 3 on each of the
      seven main energy points of the human channel along the spine.<br>
      <br>
      Points 4 front and rear surface of the body of the patient 1,
      broadly in line with the projections on the skin autonomic nerve
      plexus and subcortical structures.<br>
      <br>
      Accepted point measurements (conventional and literature data on
      vegetology [5]) were as follows (see. Table).<br>
      [0032]<br>
      <br>
      It was assumed that the measurement of the electromagnetic field
      of the respective vegetative plexus allow to interpret functional
      or organic changes in organs and systems, adjusts these tangles.<br>
      [0033]<br>
      <br>
      The antenna 3 is located above the selected point 4 on a permanent
      (for all 4 points) a height of 1.5 mm, and compensates by
      adjusting the value of background interfering signal phase
      reference generator for the value of the phase of the harmonic
      component of the signal received by the antenna 3 background noise
      fluctuations of the charge capacity of the antenna.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, at a distance of 1.5 m are installing a zero phase
      difference between the received and reference signals.<br>
      <br>
      Further, by moving the antenna 3 at a constant velocity along a
      straight line connecting the antenna 3 and the selected point 4 of
      the patient 1 in the direction of the patient 1, with simultaneous
      observation of the magnitude of the phase difference, or to
      increase the sensitivity of its integral.<br>
      [0034]<br>
      <br>
      Moving the antenna 3 is performed along the line, such as a rod
      (FIG. 1), or manually by rapid diagnosis holding the antenna with
      the device in the hand or automatically by means of a
      servomechanism.<br>
      [0035]<br>
      <br>
      At the time of the non-zero phase difference (or an abrupt change
      of the integral of the phase difference) or exceeding their
      preassigned threshold measure distances to a selected point 4 at
      the appropriate place on the skin of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      These distances over each point used to construct the curve of
      equipotential surfaces of equal phase in a given combination (Fig.<br>
      2 - 8).<br>
      <br>
      Building equipotential curve in the required section can be
      produced on a large number of points with any desired degree of
      discreteness that it is appropriate to do in the automation of
      measurement and construction topograms.<br>
      <br>
      By using the tracking system may continuously scan the
      equipotential curve to control the movement of the antenna 3 to
      the phase deviation of the received signal from the phase of a
      reference signal.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, according to the experimental data, the
      projection of defects (cavities or bulges) equipotential surface
      on the skin, usually coincides with the localization of lesions
      (Fig. 2-8), which confirms the known clinical methods.<br>
      <br>
      Measuring the distance from the skin to the position of the
      antenna 3, which recorded a non-zero predetermined value of the
      phase difference in the case of a simplified assessment of the
      field for seven major points on a scale of distances 5, along
      which the antenna 3.<br>
      <br>
      Thus before the measurement at each point was performed four
      positioning antenna 3 to contact with a given point at a distance
      of 4 or 2-3 mm away from the initial distance and the mark on the
      scale 5 that is subtracted from the distance mark on a scale of 5,
      which was recorded on the phase shift.<br>
      [0036]<br>
      <br>
      If automation of a method by increasing the number of measurement
      points, determination of distances can be made by known electronic
      methods using rangefinders (e.g., via radio waves, optical,
      infrared or ultrasound, etc.) or by means of contact sensors, and
      stepper motors which allow a continuous scanning topogram field
      and output for print and display.<br>
      [0037]<br>
      <br>
      In the case of rapid diagnosis (perhaps in field or field
      conditions, rescue operations, emergency situations, etc.)
      receiving electrode - antenna 3 arranged parallel to any part of
      the body of the patient 1 (Fig. 9) at a distance of 0 2 - 0.3 m
      and produce background interference alignment installation phase
      reference signal equal to the phase of the received and the
      installation of zero initial conditions for integration, and then
      the receiving antenna is moved parallel to the surface 3 of the
      body at the same distance from it. In this fixed place on the body
      surface over which there is a sharp change in the signal integral
      of the phase difference of the received and reference signals.<br>
      <br>
      After locking the phase jump every time again set zero initial
      conditions of integration and continue to move the antenna 3 to
      the new sharp change in the integral of the phase difference, etc.<br>
      The receiving antenna 3 is moved so as to fix the border start
      integration and thus mark at the surface portions of the body
      where the phase difference is not zero.<br>
      <br>
      These sites are supposedly projections of lesions within the body
      or damage.<br>
      [0038]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1.</b><b><br>

      sagittal plane of the flat, elliptical, indicating that the normal
      functioning of the patient (Fig. 2). In this and the following
      examples, measurements were taken at a frequency of 7.4 kHz.<br>

      department of the Republican Clinical Hospital. Kuvatova with a

      the electromagnetic field detected, in that the V of the rear and
      in the area V, IV, III front attaching points with abrupt
      deformation scallops, constrictions. Based on these data (Fig. 3)
      could be assumed that the electromagnetic field of the patient is
      not only misshapen due to lung diseases, but also include changes
      in the heart and gastrointestinal tract, which was confirmed in
      further clinical studies further.<br>
      [0040]<br>
      <br>

      the field in the sagittal plane (Fig. 4) revealed a substantial
      deformation field at the points II and IV behind. In the frontal
      plane (Fig. 5) changes in the field are registered in the area IV
      and III points, a significant reduction of the distance - in terms
      VII. After 5 months after discharge, the patient re-admitted to
      hospital with ischemic attacks, indicating that the high
      diagnostic accuracy of the method in the early stages of the

      equipotential surface of the field at point IV (cardiopulmonary
      plexus) compared to the V point and an asymmetrical restriction on
      a section through III point (solar plexus), mainly on the right,
      which fully meets the clinical diagnosis.<br>

      When moving the receiving electrode at a constant speed of about
      0.1 m / s parallel to the surface of the body along parallel
      vertical lines were found two zones substantial phase deviation
      shown in Figure 10. Later, during the clinical studies were found

      disease, 61 with hypertension, 22 with asthma, 40 with
      cholecystitis, 25 with gastric ulcer and 40 with pulmonary
      tuberculosis. The control group consisted of 30 healthy

      object at the point of placement of the antenna 6, and fluctuating
      in the form of "white noise".<br>
      <br>
      Since the antenna 6 is electrically small, ie, its dimensions are
      negligible compared to the operating wavelength range, the
      resonant amplification of a single frequency does not occur and
      the antenna 6 receives the noise signal with a uniform frequency
      response, whereby the adjustment is not required, and gain
      control.<br>
      <br>
      Noise electrical signal proportional to the charge antenna
      capacitance is amplified by the head amplifier 7, which is a
      charge amplifier and to a first input to pulse bandpass filter 8
      with a narrow bandwidth allocated from the noise signal one
      spectral line at a frequency equal to the frequency generator 9 of
      the reference signal, specifies the voltage which is supplied to
      the second input pulse filter 8.<br>
      <br>
      Dedicated harmonic frequency component of the noise signal output
      from the pulse filter 8 into ac amplifier 10 with high gain, which
      is amplified to saturation of amplifier 10 and to a first input of
      the phase detector 11, the second input of which receives the
      voltage reference signal of the reference frequency and phase
      generator 9.<br>
      <br>
      In the phase detector output pulse signal 11 appears, the pulse
      area is proportional to the phase difference of the selected
      frequency component of the received noise signal and the reference
      signal generator 9.<br>
      <br>
      This voltage is smoothed by a filter 12 with a lowpass long time
      constant, whereby the output of the last there is a steady voltage
      proportional to the average value of the pulse voltage output from
      the phase detector 11, i.e. proportional to the magnitude of the
      phase difference, the output voltage of the filter 12 is amplified
      by the DC (DCA) 13 whose output is the output of the measuring
      unit 14, and is input to the display unit 15.<br>
      <br>
      When placing a receiving antenna 6 at alignment interfering
      background (see. Mode) obtained at the output DCA 13 voltage
      proportional to the phase shift at a given point offset selection
      balancing voltage output unit 16 compensating for an interfering
      background, which enters the DCA 13 and subtracted from the
      voltage phase difference.<br>
      <br>
      The output voltage of the block 16 is selected so that the output
      voltage DCA 13 was zero at the point of placement of the antenna
      6.<br>
      Thus since output voltage of the integrator 17, the display unit
      15 is zero, and the integrator 17 is set to zero initial
      conditions 18 pressing integration reset, the voltage at its
      output is also zero, indicating that the element 19 is shown.<br>
      <br>
      When moving the antenna 6 along a straight line towards the
      bioobject on moving system 20 or parallel to the surface of
      bioobject's hands of the operator (see. Mode) occurs when the
      phase difference between the received signal and the reference
      oscillator 9 is different from the value of the offset voltage
      from the output 16 of compensation, with the result that the
      output signal appears TF 13, which is proportional to the voltage
      difference between the output of the filter 12 and the lowpass
      output unit 16.<br>
      <br>
      This signal is input to the display unit 15, the input of which is
      the input of the integrator 17, causing the latter begins to
      integrate, that is indicated by 19, the input of which receives
      the output signal of the integrator 17.<br>
      <br>
      If the imbalance is stored and the phase difference signal
      continues to differ from the offset voltages from the block 16,
      the integrator 17 continues to integrate the voltage saturation
      regardless of how small this mismatch.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the speed of integration is proportional to the
      error, ie, is proportional to the increment of the phase shift of
      the received signal at a given point in space, whereby the speed
      of integration can judge the magnitude of the phase jump.<br>
      <br>
      If you want to register the value of the phase discontinuity in
      excess of preassigned constant, display unit 15 may comprise a
      non-linear element 21, such as "dead zone" area with controlled
      variable voltage output adjustment member 22 (12, 13).<br>
      <br>
      Since the nonlinear element 21 is connected to the input of the
      integrator 17, the latter begins to integrate the error signal
      output from the DCA 13 only when it exceeds in magnitude the
      magnitude of the deadband, which is determined by the voltage from
      the element 22 and the configuration can be tuned.<br>
      [0055]<br>
      <br>
      The device may be formed in the stationary embodiment (FIG. 14)
      with manual movement of the receiving electrode 6 and the rod
      antenna 23 provided with a distance scale 24.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the whole device can be placed on a trolley 25, and
      measurements are performed with the patient lying on the couch
      (FIG. 1), or sitting on a chair (1) according to the measurement
      point.<br>
      Distance to the equipotential surface of the parietal region of
      the patient is measured in a sitting position.<br>
      <br>
      Alignment of background interference is produced whenever a new
      position stretcher 25 relative to the patient 1 in the upper
      position of the antenna 6 on the rod 23, i.e. for each new
      measurement point.<br>
      The measured quantity is the distance from the skin to the surface
      of equal phase, measured by the distance scale 24 and the LED 19
      allows to fix the distance reference point.<br>
      [0056]<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the device for rapid assessment of the biological
      object electromagnetic field may be configured as a hand-held
      device with a self-powered, located in the hands of the operator
      and used according to the method of (9), with manual movement of
      the receiver antenna electrode 6 is rigidly mounted on the housing
      26 and moves together with the unit parallel to the biological
      object 1.<br>
      [0057]<br>
      <br>
      For fast (but less accurate), the phase of construction of the
      equipotential surface of the field with the biological object via
      the manual device, the latter may comprise a range-finder 27, for
      example, optical, infrared or ultrasonic type indicator 28, the
      distances (15, 16, 17).<br>
      <br>
      In this case the displacement of the receiving antenna 6, along
      with the device along a straight line towards bioobject is carried
      hands of the operator, and the count distances by range finder 27
      with its indicator member 28 on the investigated point is produced
      in the time integrator 17 starts integrating observing indications
      of the first display element 19.<br>
      [0058]<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the device may provide automatic movement of the
      receiving antenna, as well as automatic construction and
      reconstruction phase equipotential surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      This arrangement enables the evaluation of the electromagnetic
      field bioobject most accurate view of the automatic execution of
      all procedures, as well as by carrying out measurements with any
      degree is discrete to continuous scanning phase equipotential
      surfaces.<br>
      [0059]<br>
      <br>
      An automated version of the apparatus for evaluating the
      electromagnetic field bioobject operates as follows.<br>
      [0060]<br>
      <br>
      The patient is placed on a couch 29 (18 - 21) on the back or
      stomach and make the installation of sensors 30 of the patient
      with his height, proportions, location of the vegetative centers,
      etc. by moving them along the couch 29 and opposite the respective
      fixing points of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, a switch unit and is introduced into the
      program-controlled unit 31, for example, from the keyboard 32,
      when it is implemented on the basis of the microcomputer 33, the
      starting point coordinate A compensating for an interfering
      background (19), the magnitude of the phase difference of the
      surface equal to the phase (in particular case zero) and enter the
      command started.<br>
      <br>
      In this program, the control unit 31 (the microcomputer 33, for
      example, serial port) by controlling the output electrical signals
      drive 34 - 36, generates control signals from the first three
      output unit 31 inputs drive 34 - 36, carrying out the movement of
      the receiving electrode 6 and the mobile system 20 so that the
      electrode 6 is established at the point A. After this the
      program-controlling unit 31 includes a first control circuit,
      formed by a fourth output unit 31 connected to the control input
      of the measuring unit 14 which is a control input of the
      compensation unit 16, and the compound output measuring unit 14 to
      the first input of the unit 31.<br>
      <br>
      Wherein the fourth output of unit 31 to the control input of the
      measuring unit 14 begins to receive the control signal on the
      control input unit 16, correction and changes its output voltage
      to decrease to zero error voltage output from the measuring unit
      14, ie. E. Output from DCA 13 proportional to the phase difference
      of the reference oscillator 9 and the received signal is an
      interfering background to point A. The output voltage setting unit
      16 is continued until complete compensation of an interfering
      background, then unit 31 disconnects the first control loop and
      comprises a second control circuit consisting of a third output
      section 31 connected to the input drive 34 from the radial
      movement of the antenna 6 connected to the input of the measuring
      unit 14, the output of the measuring unit 14 connected to the
      first input of the unit 31.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the block 31 produces a signal in the second control circuit
      applied to an actuator 34, causing it to move the antenna 6
      towards the patient 1 on a couch 29 and until the output of the
      measuring unit 14 starts to differ from zero and equals modulo a
      predetermined phase difference value inputted from the keyboard
      32.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the second control circuit 6 by moving the antenna
      radially monitors this value until the end of the device.<br>
      <br>
      Along with the inclusion of the second control circuit and
      software control unit 31 produces the first and second output
      control signals applied to the input drive 35 and 36 of the
      movable system 20 with its antenna located at 6.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the antenna 6 with moving system 20 moves laterally
      relative to the patient over the semicircle around and
      longitudinally along the body along embedded in the program unit
      31 need move the antenna 6.<br>
      <br>
      All the movements of the antenna 6 and the storage unit 31
      constitute a release surface equal phase (phase equipotential
      surface) or a projection section which are displayed on the
      display element 19, which may serve, in particular, the display
      screen 37 at block 31 the microprocessor implementation.<br>
      <br>
      If the device has a range finder 27 instead of position sensor 30,
      the parallel movement of the antenna 6 is measured by the distance
      from it to the patient's body surface and a signal proportional to
      the distance to the second input unit 31, which is stored and
      displayed on the display 37 in the form of profiles projections or
      body surface, superimposed on the corresponding profiles or
      projections phase surface.<br>
      When implementing the block 31 using the computer 33 signals
      outputted from the measuring unit 14 and the range finder 27 are
      fed through the first and second inputs of the block 31 to the
      microcomputer 33 through analog-to-digital converters 38 and 39,
      and a control signal compensating for an interfering background is
      transmitted from the output of the microcomputer 33 in the fourth
      the output of the DAC 31 through 40.<br>
      [0061]<br>
      <br>
      If there are more degrees of freedom motion system 20, performing
      the angular movement of the antenna 6 in the longitudinal plane
      (21), the drive control signal of the angular displacement of the
      longitudinal supplied at its input with the output of the fifth
      unit 31 embodied in accordance with a control program (FIG. 22),
      similarly drives 34 - 36. At the same time with other movements of
      the antenna 6 (radial, circular in a transverse plane along the
      longitudinal couch 29) rotates the antenna 6 in the longitudinal
      vertical plane (23).<br>
      <br>
      This ensures that the orientation axis of the antenna 6 on a
      normal phase along the entire equipotential surface having any
      complexity of shape, in any section.<br>
      [0062]<br>
      <br>
      Electromechanical actuators 34 - 36, 41 may be implemented in the
      form of electric motors, such as stepper type.<br>
      <br>
      Actuators 34 - 36, 41 may also be made in the form of servos with
      local feedback connected to the program-controlling unit 31.<br>
      [0063]<br>
      <br>

      proposed method and apparatus are based upon topological analysis
      of configuration of equipotential surfaces of electromagnetic
      field for estimating pith total potential of protective forces of
      human body judging by relative dimensions of equipotential
      surfaces, and also estimating localization of pathologic foci
      judging by location of recesses and convexities on equipotential
      surface image with respect to patient's body. Received signal
      phase shift in relation to reference signal phase is detected and
      controlled by recording signal equal to integral of phase
      difference between received signal and reference signal.; In this
      manner, great number of points with any in advance predetermined
      discreteness can be obtained for plotting equipotential curve in
      any required cross-section. Advantageously, this can be done by

      from reference signal phase. With this approach, noise is used as
      useful signal. Invention can be used for preliminary diagnostics,

      A method of treating patients with hypertension I-II degree and
      vascular dystonia, based on the interaction of electromagnetic
      fields the operator and patient and including the impact on the
      patient while the infrared radiation of 8-14 microns, microwave
      radiation in the range of 8-30 cm and alternating electric field
      frequency up to 10 Hz, while the radiation source used the hands
      of the operator [1] The disadvantage of this method is the low
      efficiency of the impact and long-term treatment because of the
      impact of randomly without exact knowledge of an objective picture
      of the electromagnetic field of the patient, and also because of
      the instability effects because it depends on the subjective state
      of the operator.<br>

      <br>
      There is a method aural correction, including the measurement of
      electromagnetic fields and the construction of aurotopogrammy

      In addition, the alignment aurotopogrammy produced by psychic
      effects of the operator, and the construction aurotopogrammy
      performed using ESP [2] The disadvantages of this method are
      long-term treatment due to low accuracy due to the high degree of
      subjectivity measurements and influences that determine high
      dependence of the condition and operator skill and low
      reproducibility.<br>

      The method is based on the aural correction autoaktivizatsii
      electrolyte metabolism and redistribution of ions and electrolytes
      in body tissues due to its own generated his own electrical and
      electromagnetic energy without any external energy sources.<br>
      Exposure is carried out purposefully through a defect phase
      potential pattern of the electromagnetic field around the patient
      aurotopogrammy, ie through areas of the skin, corresponding to the
      most topographically pronounced deviations field pattern of the
      patient from the picture of the field of a healthy person.<br>
      Superimposed on the skin electrodes made of dissimilar metal (for
      example, the positive copper, zinc negative) form a galvanic cell,
      the role of the electrolyte which operate tissue and internal
      environment of the body.<br>
      Since the latter have a much more active and reactive electrical
      resistance, in connection with such an electrochemical cell bus
      low-voltage power generator of electrical oscillations and the
      latter, on the resistances of the body tissues and fluids is
      allocated a significant portion of the variable component of the
      oscillator (Fig.<br>
      1).<br>
      As a result, the electrode is formed with a variable voltage and
      constant component of the tissues of the body between the
      electrodes an alternating current (20-100 mA) generated by itself
      without any external power supply, and therefore completely
      eliminates unwanted side effects.<br>
      Electrodes placed on the skin in places, is a projection of the
      spatial pattern of defects of the electromagnetic field
      surrounding the patient and the pre-measured and constructed to
      cause general and local stimulation of the electron-ion exchange
      of the whole body, as well as a favorable stable distribution of
      dipoles persists after removing the electrode.<br>
      This distribution produces a displacement of electric dipoles
      domestic media and tissues of the body, aligning the data field
      defects causing a change in its pattern and sizes approaching
      normal, healthy state of the body accordingly.<br>
      In turn, the alignment of the electromagnetic fields and keeping
      them in this state has a causal inverse effect on the patient
      health-improving effect and helps to eliminate the causes of
      change in the field [3] The process is carried out as follows.<br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      For remote examination of the patient in the prone position on the
      couch using fazoaurometrii.<br>
      Measurement fazoaurotopogrammy produce, for example, using the
      meter of the phase shift in the spatial orientation of its movable
      receiving electrode with respect to each of the seven points of
      main power channel person along the backbone [4] points (front and
      rear surfaces of the patient) to substantially correspond to the
      projections on the skin autonomic nerve plexus and subcortical
      structures.<br>
      Accepted point measurements (suspended and literature data on
      vegetology) distributed as follows (see Table 1).<br>
      [0009]<br>
      <br>
      Next, a movable electrode 1 (Fig. 2) the meter phase shift 2
      located on the rod 3 is fixed along lines 4 passing through each
      of the seven points (Table. 1), defects deflection field pattern
      from the normal corresponding healthy man ( dips, low values ??of
      the distances from the equipotential surface fazoaurotopogrammy
      phase to the surface of the patient's body, local or general wears
      off of the field).<br>
      Measurements were carried out on the same frequency f1 and values
      ??for a number of fixed frequencies f1, f2, f3, fn.<br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      Then the overlay therapeutic pairs of electrodes 5, 6 made of
      dissimilar conductive materials, wherein the negative electrode 5
      is applied to the skin, preferably in places fazoaurotopogrammy
      failures and the positive electrode 6 in a position corresponding
      normal areas fazoaurotopogrammy or convexity.<br>
      With this arrangement, the pair of electrodes in pairs can be
      either one-way (front or rear, for example, FIG. 3) and
      double-sided (positive electrodes 6 on one side of the body of the
      patient, and negative on the other hand 5 (FIG.<br>
      4)).<br>
      The electrodes are secured, for example, plaster, connected
      respectively to a negative 7 and positive 8 supply rails of one or
      more generators 9, electromagnetic waves, the tuning frequency of
      which is (are) equal to f1 frequency detachably fazoaurotopogrammy
      and left in that position on a patient for an extended time Tlech.<br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      After Tlech electrodes are removed and re-produce the control
      fazoaurogrammy build on the frequency f1, fixing the dynamics of
      the normalization of the topography of the electromagnetic field
      in the form of reduced failures and restore a healthy state
      dimensions, respectively.<br>
      If necessary, the measurement is repeated exposure session.<br>
      To achieve a sustainable pattern of normalization effect of the
      electromagnetic field produced a course of several repeated
      sessions with simultaneous control of the field at intervals of
      1-7 days between sessions.<br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      If necessary analogously produce building family fazoaurotopogramm
      for a number of frequencies f1, f2, fn and corresponding
      correction field at each frequency separately, sequentially
      rearranging generator 9 for these vibrational frequencies, either
      simultaneously using multiple generators 9 are configured, each on
      a different frequency f1, f2, fn and several corresponding pairs
      of generators electrodes 5 and 6 (Fig.<br>
      5).<br>
      [0013]<br>
      <br>
      Example 1.<br>
      Patient P. 52 years.<br>
      Clinical diagnosis: coronary artery disease, angina FC III.
      Experience periodic bouts of tightness in the chest at rest,
      sometimes passing into a strong chest pain that occurs usually
      during physical exertion.<br>
      Seizures are removed by nitroglycerine.<br>
      During the attack there is an increase in blood pressure, in areas
      Zakharyin-Ged noted hyperalgesia skin.<br>
      Electrocardiography in the application of dosed physical load of
      50 W indicates the offset segment STV3-5 below contours to 1.5 mm,
      sometimes - go to STV4-5 (-).<br>
      Sick for five years, it has repeatedly held hospital treatment.<br>
      Before hospitalization observed acceleration and intensification
      of attacks, which was assessed as a progressive form of angina.<br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      Fazoaurogramm measurement at a frequency of 7.4 kHz showed the
      presence of significant bilateral failures field in the 4th point
      along the spine (see. Table. 1 and Fig.<br>
      6).<br>
      [0015]<br>
      <br>
      The patient is in the supine position at rest were placed two
      pairs of electrodes as follows: the negative electrodes in the
      front and rear skin of the 4-th point; positive one in front in
      the 2nd point, the other behind in the 3rd point.<br>
      Electrodes were fixed plaster and joined the positive and negative
      supply rails generator electrical sinusoidal wave tuned to the
      frequency of 7.4 kHz, which begins to generate immediately after
      joining the electrode.<br>
      The duration of the procedure was 30 minutes, after which the
      electrodes were removed and the field measurements were repeated.<br>
      Building fazoaurotopogrammy after exposure showed a significant
      alignment of the failures of the electromagnetic field of the
      patient (Fig.<br>
      6).<br>
      [0016]<br>
      <br>
      The next day was a repeat measurement fazoaurotopogrammy that
      showed the effect of preserving the alignment of the field with
      some decrease in adjusted areas (approximately half).<br>
      After that, the repeated session with the same electrode placement
      and exposure time and then adjusted topography plots approximately
      returned to the state after the first exposure.<br>
      Sessions lasting 30 minutes were performed daily (all held 7
      sessions), after which he was made persistent effect of leveling
      the field, which confirmed a control measurement of topography of
      the field in 7 days after the end of sessions.<br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      Clinical examination and observation showed that after treatment
      significantly reduced the intensity and frequency of angina
      attacks, dosed physical load increased to 100 W, the dose of a
      drug used in the treatment of decreased three times.<br>
      All of this allowed us to estimate the second angina.<br>
      [0018]<br>
      <br>
      Control measurement fazoaurotopogrammy 30 days after discharge,
      conducted on an outpatient basis showed stabilization of the
      clinical status of the patient at the level of angina FC II
      without symptoms of its progression.<br>
      [0019]<br>
      <br>
      Example 2.<br>
      Patient K. 45 years old, passed medical examinations of 26.02.93<br>
      About a year ago I suffered sinusitis with several subsequent
      relapses accompanying colds.<br>
      There were also complaints of episodic pain that occurs sometimes
      in the lumbosacral and cervical regions of the motion under load,
      is often a stiff neck and neck.<br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      A dimension and construct a family fazoaurotopogramm different
      frequencies ranging from 2.0 kHz to 8.0 in increments of 1 KHz
      (FIG.<br>
      7).<br>
      The study showed the presence of a number of defects in the form
      of the dips and bumps equipotential phase surface frontal-sagittal
      section bioelectromagnetic field, especially in the 6th point
      (between the eyebrows. See Table. 1) front and rear and in the 2nd
      and 3rd points (hypogastric and solar plexus), front and rear.<br>
      [0021]<br>
      <br>
      A 5 sessions bioelectromagnetic field correction by the proposed
      method, a duration of 60 minutes.<br>
      Each session consisted of three similar consecutive procedures of
      20 minutes each with a different arrangement of electrodes.<br>
      The circuit arrangement of the electrodes for each point are given
      in Table Overlay.<br>
      2.<br>
      [0022]<br>
      <br>
      In the first procedure of each session shall adjust at the same
      time two independent generators for the frequency of 2 kHz and 8
      (Fig. 8), for example, for a frequency of 2 kHz on the table. 2
      electrodes are applied as follows: in the 4th point 4P front, rear
      4h for the negative electrode, the positive electrode is applied
      in the 1 st point: 1h back; in the second procedure for three
      generators 3 kHz, 4 kHz, 7.1 kHz (Fig. 9); the third three
      generators at frequencies 3, 5, 6 kHz (Fig.<br>
      10).<br>
      [0023]<br>
      <br>
      Sessions correction carried out 2 times a week at regular
      intervals (4 days).<br>
      By the fifth session was achieved sustained correction
      fazoaurogrammy (Fig. 11), repeatability with virtually remained a
      month after the end of the session.<br>
      [0024]<br>
      <br>
      The results of correction: the well-being has improved
      significantly, pain and cervical spine stopped; increased
      non-specific resistance of the organism.<br>
      [0025]<br>
      <br>
      Proposed method aural correction human electromagnetic field was
      applied in the treatment of 74 patients in the clinic cardiac
      diseases concurrently with the assigned medication.<br>
      The results of treatment were compared with a control group of 15
      people. with similar diagnoses who received only medical
      treatment.<br>
      It was found that the use of the method in conjunction with known
      treatments reduced the time average of 1.5 times and reduce the
      incidence of disease progression, particularly in the subsequent
      application of additional ambulatory fashion.<br>
      [0026]<br>
      <br>
      The proposed method was also used in the treatment of various
      types of degenerative disc disease of the spine (cervical,
      thoracic and lumbar), and 52 patients in the clinic of chronic
      gastroenterological diseases (23 pers.).<br>
      Comparison with two control groups of 10 patients with similar
      diagnoses showed a high efficiency of the method as in combination
      with conventional treatments, and for self-application, shortening
      of treatment an average of 2-2.5.<br>
      [0027]<br>
      <br>
      Application of the method on an outpatient basis at a dispensary
      examination of 100 people led to the reduction in average 3-5
      times the total incidence after prophylactic correction
      bioelectromagnetic field.<br>
      [0028]<br>
      <br>
      Method aural correction in comparison with the known methods of
      physical therapy, including the prototype has the following
      advantages: much shorter period of treatment due to the high
      precision exposure in accordance with the needs of the organism,
      because by introducing additional operations constitute a single
      interconnected on the proposed scheme complex operations prototype
      method is carried possibility of purposeful corrective action
      directly on parts of the body, generating defective areas
      bioelectromagnetic field the patient and the possibility of visual
      inspection of the alignment of the field; high compatibility with
      other treatments, such as medication,which significantly reduces
      the treatment by enhancing the effectiveness of the medications by
      1.5-2 times; high accuracy and a high degree of exposure
      reproducibility, as well as the lack of any dependency on the
      state of the operator, the external environment impact on the
      level of training and skill of the operator because of the large
      objectification of a method; high physiological because through
      the use of optional operations introduced, providing a targeted
      stimulation of the body he himself used the currents and voltages
      do not differ from the internal voltages and currents of the body
      and has the same nature as generated by himself according to his
      needs without any external energy sources,whereby there is
      practically no negative side effects of the treatment; high
      resistance of the resulting effect of the correction of the field,
      continuing the weeks and months that allows the impact of the weak
      for a long time, allowing, in turn, carry sparing regimen and also
      contributes to the lack of side effects and contraindications;
      reduction of terms of treatment by improving the efficiency of
      preventive actions of a method that allows to work towards the
      cessation of the disease at an early stage and at the stage of
      predzabolevaniya manifested so far only at the field level; high
      electrical safety and security of patients from infection, since
      it does not use external sources of energy and by the introduction
      of the operations,and therefore it needs only the simplest of
      disinfection; small time of procedures and the high ease of
      operation and ease of training of medical personnel; high economic
      efficiency due to a lack of supplies and drugs.<br>
