      </div>
      <br>
      With help from Isis Innovation, the University’s technology
      commercialisation company, a new heat-efficient cooking pan based
      on research by University of Oxford Professor of Engineering
      Professor Thomas Povey has been launched by Lakeland (the UK’s
      leading kitchenware specialist).<br>
      <br>
      Flare PanProfessor Povey applied his research into the design of
      high-efficiency cooling systems for next-generation jet-engines to
      an everyday object which transfers heat: the domestic saucepan.
      The brand new pan design considerably speeds up cooking, providing
      substantial savings of time and energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      Formed from cast aluminium and incorporating patented ‘FIN-X’
      technology, Flare Pans are most effective on gas hobs, estimated
      to be used by over two thirds of the UK. The unique, patented,
      finned design channels heat from the flame across the bottom and
      up the sides of the pan, resulting in highly efficient, even heat
      distribution. This means the pans heat up significantly more
      quickly and food cooks faster, saving time and using much less
      energy too – in fact, an equivalent pan of conventional design was
      shown to need 40% more energy to heat up than a Flare pan.<br>
      <br>
      Tom Hockaday, managing director of Isis Innovation said: "This is
      a great example of clever thinking from Oxford being applied to an
      everyday object, one which anyone can use to speed up our cooking
      and improve our energy consumption. Isis is delighted to have
      helped Professor Povey and Lakeland commercialise the Flare Pan".<br>
      <br>
      Linda Naylor, Executive Director at Isis, said: “This project has
      been a rewarding one in that we were able to bring together the
      right expertise and co-ordinate with multiple parties, in order to
      enable a quick launch to market.”<br>
      <br>
      Even before their official launch, Flare pans have already become
      an award winning product. The Worshipful Company of Engineers, a
      Livery Company of the City of London operating under Royal
      Charter, has awarded Professor Povey their prestigious ‘2014
      Hawley Award’ for ”the most outstanding Engineering Innovation
      that delivers demonstrable benefit to the environment”.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on winning the award, Professor Povey said, "I am
      delighted that the Worshipful Company of Engineers have recognised
      the engineering complexity that lies behind Flare’s apparently
      simple design and have selected it for their Hawley Award for
      engineering innovation that benefits the environment."<br>
      <br>
      Professor Povey and Isis Innovation went through Design Council’s
      Design Leadership Programme, a mixture of workshops and direct
      support part-subsidised by the Department for Business, Innovation
      &amp; Skills.<br>
      <br>
      It is designed to help turn scientific and technological ideas
      into innovative, profitable products and services. John Mathers,
      Design Council CEO, commented: “The Flare Pan is a fantastic
      example of British design. Design Council is delighted to have
      been part of developing Professor Povey’s idea. It resonates well
      with our values - it is innovative, beneficial for users and also
      the environment. We are sure that it will prove to be a great
      success story.”<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the launch, Matthew Canwell, Lakeland’s Buying
      Director said, "Innovative thinking has been cemented into all
      that Lakeland do for 50 years, and we’re always looking for new
      innovations that will save our customers both time and money.
      Flare does just that, and we’re extremely excited to be able to
      bring this incredible new technology to our customers."<br>
      <br>
      The new range of innovative pans will be available in the UK
      exclusively through Lakeland stores and website.<br>

        <div align="left">Lakeland actively seeks out innovation, so
          Matthew, our Buying Director, was really excited by these
          scientific saucepans that cook faster and cook better…<br>
          <br>
          A world first, Flare® pans embrace the latest breakthrough
          FIN-X technology, developed in conjunction with Dr. Tom Povey,
          a real-life rocket scientist from Oxford University.
          Exceptionally effective on a gas hob, the uniquely-designed,
          high-performance ‘fins’ channel heat from the flame across the
          bottom and up the sides of the pan, resulting in really
          efficient, even heat distribution. This means the pans heat up
          significantly quicker so food cooks faster, saving you time
          and using less energy too – in fact, they cook about 44%
          faster than standard pans!<br>
          <br>
          They’ve been given a thorough trial by our Buyer Veronica who
          made a big stockpot of her trademark chilli and achieved an
          even, low simmer that remained consistent throughout cooking,
          so it was much easier to avoid messy boil-overs or food
          catching on the bottom of the pan and it cooked so much
          quicker than usual. Suitable for gas, electric, ceramic and
          halogen hobs. Oven safe up to 205°C.<br>
          <br>
          Performance ‘fins’ funnel flames into position around the pan.<br>
          Heat is distributed uniformly across the base and up the
          sides.<br>
          Food cooks much quicker without burning or scorching.<br>
          Formed from cast aluminium for excellent heat conduction, with
          stainless steel handles and fins.<br>

        <b>WO2014009701 </b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A vessel (1 ) for heating the contents thereof by means of an
      external heat source (8) comprises a non-horizontal side wall (2)
      and a heat transfer structure (6) attached to and in good thermal
      contact with, or formed integrally on, an outer surface of said
      side wall.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to vessels for heating the contents thereof
      by means of an external heat source, e.g. cooking pans, in
      particular vessels designed to improve the heat transfer into the
      vessel, e.g. on gas stoves.<br>
      <br>
      Cooking pans, as used in kitchens around the world, are generally
      simple vessels whose designs have not changed much over many
      years. Typically they will have a horizontal base and a typically
      circular side wall extending upwards from the base to contain a
      volume within which liquid and foodstuffs can be heated. The
      Applicant has recognised however that such pans, particularly when
      used on gas stoves, allow lots of heat energy from the heat source
      to dissipate into the surrounding atmosphere rather than being
      captured by the pan to heat its contents. As will be appreciated,
      this results in the heating of the pan's contents being far from
      efficient, thus wasting time and energy.<br>
      <br>
      It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved
      heating vessel. The invention provides a vessel for heating the
      contents thereof by means of an external heat source comprising:<br>
      a non-horizontal side wall; and a heat transfer structure attached
      to and in good thermal contact with, or formed integrally on, an
      outer surface of said side wall.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it will be appreciated that the invention provides a heat
      transfer structure in good thermal contact with the side wall of
      the vessel, so that heated air and/or any flame which travels up
      the side of the vessel can be captured by the heat transfer
      structure and the heat conducted into the walls of the vessel and
      so be used to heat the contents of the vessel. This contrasts with
      known cooking pans in which the majority of the heat from the gas
      flame and the heated air passing up by the side of the pan is
      lost. The increased heat energy available for heating the contents
      of the vessel thus greatly increases the efficiency of the heating
      process, i.e. the heating of the vessel's contents is quicker and
      uses less fuel. Such a design, in certain embodiments, has been
      found by the Applicant to increase the efficiency with which
      energy available from a gas flame is transferred into the vessel
      from 30% to 80%, with the greatest benefit being obtained when the
      gas flame is largest, because this results in more of the flame
      and heated air travelling up the side wall of the vessel. The
      vessel of the present invention is particularly suitable for
      placing on a gas stove because of the resultant flame and hot air
      which pass up the side wall of the vessel during use, the heat
      from which is captured more effectively by embodiments of the
      invention. However vessels in accordance with the invention do not
      need to be used exclusively on gas stoves, they could be used with
      a number of different heat sources, e.g. a hot plate, an induction
      heater, an electric ring or a halogen hob, albeit with a smaller
      enhancement to efficiency compared to a conventional pan.<br>
      <br>
      The vessel could comprise any container which is suitable for
      heating liquid or food contents, e.g. a cooking pan, frying pan,
      wok, steamer, pressure cooker, casserole, kettle or a moka maker.<br>
      <br>
      In vessels suitable for receiving and heating liquids and
      foodstuffs, generally the side wall will be continuous around the
      vessel and will extend upwardly from a horizontal base. The side
      wall could be any suitable shape. Commonly it may comprise a
      circular cylinder shape but equally it could be bowed, tapered,
      waisted etc. in vertical profile. Similarly the side wall need not
      be circular in plan profile - it could be faceted - i.e. polygonal
      in cross section, or even asymmetric.<br>
      <br>
      The vessel may have a discrete horizontal base, however this is
      not essential. Embodiments are envisaged in which there is no
      defined transition between the bottom of the vessel and the side
      wall, e.g. the vessel may be continuously curved as can be found
      in woks. In such vessels it is desirable that the heat transfer
      structure is provided on or extends to a part of the side wall
      outside the region which a typical gas flame plays on directly.
      Thus in a set of embodiments the heat transfer structure is
      provided on a portion of the side wall spaced at least 7 cm, or at
      least 10 cm from the centroid of the underside of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      The side wall may have the same outer and inner profiles, e.g. if
      it is made of a relatively thin material of constant thickness.
      However, particularly if the vessel has a double walled structure,
      the side wall may have a different inner profile to its outer
      profile. For example, the vessel could have a flat base and
      straight sides on the outside to provide better heating and
      stability, and a more continuously curved interior to facilitate
      cleaning and stirring of the contents. The Applicant has found
      that the present invention delivers a greater benefit with vessels
      which are tall sided, e.g. pasta pans or coffee makers, than with
      shallower pans and woks. Therefore in one set of embodiments the
      height of the vessel is greater than its diameter. If the vessel
      is non-circular, the diameter is taken to be the greatest
      dimension of the vessel perpendicular to the height of the vessel
      when the vessel is placed in its natural operating orientation,
      i.e. when being used on a heat source.<br>
      <br>
      The heat transfer structure could comprise any suitable member or
      members or other physical structure which is attached to and in
      good thermal contact with the side wall of the vessel. To maximise
      the conduction of heat energy from the heat transfer structure to
      the side wall of the vessel, the heat transfer structure could be
      directly and/or permanently attached to the side wall, e.g.
      brazed, welded or soldered, though the method of attachment may
      depend on the materials used for the side wall and heat transfer
      structure. Attachment by mechanical fixings is also envisaged
      although these would not typically be such that they are intended
      to allow removal of the structure by a user.<br>
      <br>
      In one set of embodiments the heat transfer structure comprises a
      plurality of ribs or fins attached to the side wall. The ribs or
      fins may take any convenient shape. For example they could
      comprise discrete protrusions. In a set of embodiments they
      comprise strips. The ribs or fins could, for example, have a
      cross-section which is rectangular - with the short or long side
      attached to the vessel side wall - square, semi-circular,
      triangular, semi-elliptical, L, T or U-shaped etc. Having the ribs
      or fins tapering in a direction away from the side wall has been
      found to give a good performance for a given volume of material.
      The fins or ribs may have a flange or tab for attachment to the
      side wall.<br>
      <br>
      The ribs or fins could extend horizontally or diagonally but
      preferably they extend vertically. This still allows heated air
      and any flame to pass up the side of the vessel and thus encounter
      a large surface area (comprising the side wall itself and t e ribs
      or fins) to maximise the transfer of heat into the side wall. The
      ribs or fins could extend part of the way up the side wall, e.g.
      more than half the way, but preferably the ribs or fins extend
      along the whole length of the side wall. The ribs or fins could be
      parallel, divergent or convergent. The cross-section and/or shape
      thereof could increase, decrease or otherwise change along their
      length. For example in a set of embodiments the ribs or fins are
      wider, e.g. in a direction away from the side wall, at the ends
      (generally the top and bottom of the ribs or fins) than in the
      middle, as this has been found to capture heat more effectively.
      The fins or ribs could be a continuous strip of material, e.g.
      with a shape that is wider at the ends as discussed above, but in
      one set of embodiments the fins comprise one or more cut outs. The
      cut outs could be positioned anywhere along the fins, e.g. in the
      middle as holes or at the outer edge (away from the side wall),
      but in one set of embodiments the fins comprise one or more cut
      outs along the inner edge of the fin, i.e. the side of the fin
      attached to the side wall of the vessel. The Applicant has
      appreciated that, particularly in the set of embodiments in which
      a fin is attached to the side wall, providing cut outs along the
      inner edge of the fin enables more accurate contact of the fin to
      be achieved with the side wall of the vessel which aids the
      operation of attaching the fin to the side wall, e.g. by laser
      welding. The cut outs could be any suitable shape but,
      particularly in the embodiments in which the cut out is along the
      inner edge of the fin, preferably the cut outs extend in a
      direction generally perpendicular to the side wall of the vessel,
      i.e. their horizontal width is greater than their vertical height.
      The fins, ribs or any other type of discrete heat transfer
      structure, could be arranged in an irregular pattern around the
      side wall. However in one set of embodiments the ribs or fins are
      equally spaced around the side wall, i.e. around the perimeter of
      the side wall, though there may be a different, e.g. larger,
      spacing where a handle is provided on the vessel. In one set of
      embodiments there are at least four, e.g. at least eight, e.g. at
      least twelve, e.g. at least twenty-four ribs or fins. The heat
      transfer structure may project from the side wall. The heat
      transfer structure may project at least 5% of the diameter of the
      vessel, e.g. at least 10% of the diameter of the vessel, e.g. at
      least 15% of the diameter of the vessel. This could also be
      defined absolutely, e.g. the heat transfer structure could project
      at least 1 cm from the side wall, e.g. at least 2 cm, e.g. at
      least 3 cm, which will generally be taken to be in the radial
      direction, i.e. perpendicular to the side wall. In the case of
      fins or ribs having a width which varies along the length thereof,
      this is taken to be the maximum width of the fin or rib (defined
      in a direction perpendicular to the side wall) as in some
      embodiments the width of the fins or ribs may taper to zero.<br>
      <br>
      The fins or ribs could be separate members attached to the side
      wall or could be joined - e.g. at one or both ends or part-way
      along their length. In other embodiments a plurality thereof (e.g.
      all of them) could be formed integrally - e.g. by a suitably
      profiled sheet.<br>
      <br>
      In another set of embodiments the heat transfer structure is
      formed directly on the side wall of the vessel, e.g. by being
      cast, milled or drilled. The heat transfer structure so formed may
      have any of the shapes or forms described above in relation to
      structures attached to the wall. Of course both integral forming
      and attachment could be used in combination.<br>
      <br>
      The vessel and heat transfer structure will generally be made from
      materials with a high thermal conductivity, e.g. metal. When not
      formed integrally, the vessel and heat transfer structure could be
      made from the same or different materials depending on their
      suitability for manufacture. Typical materials include aluminium,
      copper and stainless steels. Stainless steels are easy to weld
      thus enabling the heat transfer structure to be attached easily to
      the side wall. The material could be laminated, e.g. aluminium
      with stainless steel either side. This is advantageous because
      aluminium has a high thermal conductivity and stainless steels are
      corrosion resistant, give a good finished appearance and are also
      easy to clean. The material could be metal plated, e.g. using
      copper, to give an attractive finish without detracting from the
      mechanical and/or thermal properties of the vessel. Using such
      materials the vessel, e.g. a pan, could be made using known
      techniques. The heat transfer structure could be stamped, water
      jet or laser cut before being attached to the side wall, e.g. by
      brazing, welding or soldering.<br>
      <br>
      In one set of embodiments a heat transfer structure is also
      provided on a base of the vessel. Although the Applicant has found
      that this does not give as great a benefit as the heat transfer
      structure provided on the side wall of the vessel, an improvement
      over the heat transfer into the vessel from a conventional base is
      noticed. All the features discussed above regarding the heat
      transfer structure provided on the side wall are applicable to a
      heat transfer structure on the base of the vessel. The heat
      transfer structure provided on the base of the vessel could be
      separate from the heat transfer structure provided on the side
      wall. However in one set of embodiments the heat transfer
      structure provided on the side wall extends to the base of the
      vessel. For example, the ribs or fins could extend from the side
      walls underneath the vessel onto the base.<br>
      <br>
      For heat transfer structures, e.g. ribs or fins, which are shaped,
      or for a vessel which is shaped, the outer profile of the vessel
      does not need to match the outer profile of the heat transfer
      structure. For example, the side wall of the vessel could be
      straight and the ribs or fins could be shaped differently as
      described above, or the side wall of the vessel could be curved
      and the ribs or fins could have a straight outer edge.<br>
      <br>
      This also extends to the set of embodiments comprising a heat
      transfer structure provided on the base of the vessel, where
      preferably the heat transfer structure is arranged to stand flat
      on a flat surface. For example, if the vessel comprises ribs or
      fins provided on the base, their bottom edge is preferably flat so
      they are able to stand stably on a surface or a gas stove.
      Furthermore, even if the vessel does not comprise a heat transfer
      structure provided on the base, the heat transfer structure
      provided on the side wall could project below the level of the
      base of the vessel. Again, preferably the heat transfer structure
      is arranged to stand flat on a flat surface. This allows vessels
      which do not have a flat base to be able to stand stably on a flat
      surface or stove.<br>
      <br>
      In the sets of embodiments in which a heat transfer structure is
      provided on the base, extends from the side wall and/or projects
      from the side wall below the level of the base, the vessel could
      comprise a mount arranged to stand flat on a flat surface, e.g.
      attached to the heat transfer structure or the base of the vessel.
      Thus, even if the heat transfer structure is not arranged to stand
      flat, the mount provides a base which can stand flat, e.g. for
      enabling the vessel to be stably placed on a stove or other
      surface. Typically the mount comprises a continuous flat surface,
      e.g. a ring, which enables it to stand on the pan support of a gas
      stove. Such a mount could be removable so that it can be fitted
      when required and removed after use for cleaning and storage. The
      removable mount could fit onto the vessel in any number of ways,
      e.g. directly onto the base of the vessel or onto the heat
      transfer structure itself, and be spring or clip mounted for easy
      attachment and removal. Alternatively the mount could be
      permanently attached to the vessel. Preferably the mount comprises
      holes to allow the heated air and any flame to flow easily through
      and around the mount.<br>

      Figs. 1 and 2 show a vessel 1 , e.g. a cooking pan, in accordance
      with the present invention. The vessel 1 comprises a cylindrical
      side wall 2 with a circular cross- section that projects
      perpendicularly from the base 4 of the vessel 1 . The main body of
      the vessel 1 , i.e. the side wall 2 and base 4, is made from a
      material such as aluminium or stainless steel as is conventional.
      Attached to the outer surface of the side wall 2 is a heat
      transfer structure comprising a plurality of fins 6. The fins 6
      are made from rectangular strips of the same material as the main
      body of the vessel 1 , e.g. aluminium or stainless steel, which
      are produced by laser cutting a blank sheet of the material, and
      are laser welded to the side wall 2 to attach them in good thermal
      contact. Though not shown, a handle could be attached to the
      vessel 1 to allow it to be carried, particularly when hot. In
      operation, a gas flame 8, e.g. from a gas stove, is applied to the
      base 4 of the vessel 1 to heat contents, e.g. liquid or other
      foodstuffs, (not shown) contained within the vessel 1 . Owing to
      convection, the air heated by the gas flame 8 passes from
      underneath the base 4 of the vessel 1 and up along the outer
      surface of the side wall 2. If the gas flame 8 is particularly
      large compared to the size of the base 4 of the vessel 1 , part of
      the edges of the gas flame 8 will also protrude from the base 4
      and up the side wall 2. For a conventional pan, most of this heat
      is lost, as only a very small layer of the heated air and/or gas
      flame 8 is able to conduct heat into the side wall 2 of the
      vessel. However, for the vessel 1 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the fins
      6 act to capture this lost heat, owing to the increased surface
      area and greater penetration into the heated air layer presented
      by the side wall 2 and fins 6 to the heated air and/or gas flame
      8. As the heated air and/or gas flame 8 passes up the side wall 2
      of the vessel, the fins 6 are heated. The fins 6 are attached to
      and in good thermal contact with the side wall 2 of the vessel 1
      so this heat is conducted into the side wall 2 where it acts to
      heat the contents of the vessel 1 .<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 shows a vertical cross section through a vessel 101 which
      is a variant of the vessel shown in Figs. 1 and 2. For this vessel
      101 the fins 106, as well as being attached in good thermal
      contact to the side wall 102 also extend under the base 104 of the
      vessel 101 where they are also attached in good thermal contact.
      The operation of the vessel 101 shown in Fig. 3 is the same as the
      vessel shown in<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 1 and 2, with the portion of the fins 106 attached to the
      base 104 of the vessel 101 also acting to increase the surface
      area of the vessel 101 available to be heated, thus increasing the
      heat energy transferred into the contents of the vessel 101 . A
      mount 107, in the form of a ring, is attached, by welding, to the
      underside of the portion of the fins 106 extending under the base
      104 of the vessel 101 , thus enabling the vessel 101 to be stably
      placed on a stove or flat surface, e.g. a gas stove in which the
      pan support ring generally has radially aligned prongs.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 shows a vertical cross section through a vessel 201 which
      is another variant of the vessel shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The
      vessel 201 has a curved side wall 202 and base 204, with fins 206
      attached to the side wall 202. The fins 206 have a curved portion
      in the middle to match the profile of the side wall 202, and
      extend partly to the base 204 of the vessel 201 . As in Fig. 3 a
      mount 207 is attached to the underside of the bottom portion of
      the fins 206 to enable the vessel 201 to stand on a stove and a
      flat surface. Operation of the vessel 201 shown in Fig. 4 is the
      same as has been described above.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5 shows a plan view of a segment of a vessel 301 showing an
      alternative embodiment of the fins 306 attached to the side wall
      302. In this embodiment the fins 306 have a tapered distal edge
      which has been found to increase the heat transfer into the vessel
      301 . The fins 306 are each attached to the side wall 302 by means
      of a flange 310, e.g. by welding.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 shows a vertical cross section through a vessel 401 which
      is a variant of the vessel shown in Fig. 3. The vessel 401 is
      cylindrical with a flat base 404, and as in Fig. 3, the fins 406
      attached to the side wall 402 extend under the base 404 of the
      vessel 401 . In this embodiment the fins 406 are shaped with a
      wider upper and lower portion and a waisted middle. This profile
      of the fins 406 has been found to be more effective in
      transferring heat into the vessel 401 . The top and bottom corners
      of the fins are curved, i.e. blunt, to protect the user from sharp
      edges. As the fins 406 extend radially, there is not a continuous
      bottom to enable the vessel 401 to be placed stably on a gas
      stove. Therefore a removable mount 412 with a circular base 407 is
      provided to create a flat bottom for the vessel 401 . The
      removable mount 412 is sprung so that it simply clips on and off
      over the fins 406.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 7a and 7b show perspective and underside views respectively
      of another vessel 501 in accordance with the invention, along with
      two ring jigs 514 and a star jig 516 to hold the components of the
      vessel 501 in place during assembly. The vessel 501 , similar to
      some of the vessels shown in the previous drawings is cylindrical
      with a straight side wall 502 and a flat base 504. As in Figs. 3
      and 6, the fins 506 extend under the base 504 of the vessel 501 .
      Also as in Fig. 6, the fins 506 are shaped with a wider upper and
      lower portion and a waisted middle.<br>
      <br>
      However, in this embodiment the fins 506 comprise cut outs 518
      which extend in a direction perpendicular to the side wall 502.
      These assist the laser welding of the fins 506 to the side wall
      502 and base 504 of the vessel 501 . An additional feature shown
      in this embodiment is the provision of a ring mount 507 which is
      welded to the bottom of the fins 506 in order to provide a
      continuous flat surface to allow the vessel 501 to be stably
      placed on a gas stove. The mount 507 comprises a plurality of
      holes 520 which allow the gas flame, entrained cold air and/or
      heated air through the mount 507.<br>
      <br>
      Also shown in Figs. 7a and 7b are two ring jigs 514 and a star jig
      516 which each comprise a plurality of slots 522 corresponding to
      the fins 506. The ring jigs 514 and star jig 516 hold the fins 506
      in place during welding and are removed when this has been
      completed. Operation, during normal use, of the vessel 501 shown
      in Figs. 7a and 7b is the same as for the previous embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 8a and 8b show perspective and underside views respectively
      of a further vessel 601 in accordance with the invention, similar
      to the vessel shown in Figs. 7a and 7b but without the assembly
      jigs shown. The vessel 601 shown in Figs. 8a and 8b again has fins
      606 attached to the side wall 602 which are shaped with a wider
      upper and lower portion and a waisted middle, and which extend
      underneath the base 604 of the vessel 601 . As in Figs. 7a and 7b
      the fins 606 comprise cut outs 618 which extend in a direction
      perpendicular to the side wall 602, and have a ring mount 607
      attached to the bottom of the fins 606. The vessel 601 shown in
      Figs. 8a and 8b is different from the vessel shown in Figs. 7a and
      7b in that it has a tapering side wall 602 such that the opening
      at the top of the vessel 601 is narrower than the base 604, but in
      use its operation is the same. Fig. 9 shows a graph of heat
      transfer efficiency for vessels in accordance with the invention.
      The graph plots efficiency against heat flux into the air, for
      experimental test data taken by the Applicant using a normal gas
      burner in a purpose built test rig. Pan 1 (724) is a conventional
      pan without any heat transfer structure attached to the side
      walls, and Pan 2 (726), Pan 3 (728) and Pan 4 (730) are vessels in
      accordance with the present invention, i.e. similar to those shown
      in the embodiments in the drawings. Best fit lines for each of the
      vessels shown are also plotted through the data points. The graph
      shows that an improved efficiency, particularly at high heat flux,
      is obtained for all the vessels in accordance with the present
      invention. At a heat flux of 4 kW, the (extrapolated) efficiency
      of Pan 1 (724) is 45%, whereas the other vessels have efficiencies
      between approximately 60% and 67%, representing an improvement of
      between 33% and 49% in efficiency. At higher heat flux the
      improvement is expected to be even greater.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that only a
      small number of possible embodiments have been described and that
      many variations and modifications are possible within the scope of
      the invention. For example the vessel and fins could be any shape
      and made from any material, and the fins may only extend part way
      up the sides of the side wall of the vessel. Furthermore, any
      number of fins could be provided and it is not necessary for them
      to be equally spaced around the perimeter of the side wall or to
      be parallel to each other. Heat transfer structures other than
      fins could be provided. Rather than being attached to a vessel the
      heat transfer structure could be formed integrally in the side
      wall of the vessel through casting or machining.<br>
