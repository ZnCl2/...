      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An invention which has been
          termed the greatest American war achievement is the Rogers
          underground and sub-sea radio system. The Rogers system does
          away entirely with aerial wires, and it is only a mater of
          months now before all aerial wire systems the world over will
          be pulled down. Wonderful things have been accomplished by the
          new system, chief of which is the total elimination of static
          and the increase of the loudness of received signals, which is
          often as high as 5000 times the usual strength. Interference,
          too, is done away with almost entirely now. The Rogers
          invention is of tremendous importance and revolutionizes our
          previous ideas on wireless to an extent never dreamt of
          before. We urge every one interested in radio to read the
          accompanying authoritative article which discloses the full
          technical data on the new system for the first time in any
          periodical.</font> </p>
      <center><font face="Times New Roman,Times">~~~~~</font></center>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Top photo [Photos not shown
        here: poor quality photocopy] shows antenna wires being placed
        in river by Mr Rogers’ assistants. The inventor has found that
        his system works just as well under water as through the earth.
        All of the high power stations in the world, from Nauen and
        Lyons to Honolulu, are heard in Mr Rogers’ laboratory at
        Hyattsville, MD, shown in the center and lower views herewith.
        The author of this article also heard the transatlantic stations
        coming in loud and clear. Mr Rogers invention is the greatest in
        the war and is so recognized by the government.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is revealed now that the
          Navy Department had been using a powerful undersea wireless
          during the war. The instruments and system were invented by
          James H. Rogers, of Hyattsville, MD, and were adopted by the
          Navy Department as an invaluable addition to the wireless
          system of the Navy. The two lower photos show the inventor, Mr
          Rogers, in his laboratory at Hyattsville.</font> </p>
      <center><font face="Times New Roman,Times">~~~~~~</font></center>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The greatest invention in the
        field of wireless telegraphy since Marconi first placed
        commercial radio-communication on a firm basis by his historic
        experiments in Italy, and later in England, is without a shade
        of doubt the latest triumph of radio research --- the
        "Underground and Sub-Sea Wireless", conceived and developed by
        an American scientist and inventor, James Harris Rogers. Mr
        Rogers is known as a second Edison among his towns-people in
        Hyattsville, Maryland, where he has lived for many years, and
        now the whole world acclaims him.</font>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Who Is Mr Rogers? ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">James Harris Rogers,
          practically unknown a few years ago in radio circles, except
          by a few select radio men who were investigating his invention
          for the navy Department, has practically become overnight the
          center of all attractions in the field of science. Mr Rogers
          is a son of the confederacy and a veteran of the CivilWar. He
          has followed electrical experimenting ever since and has been
          a strong devotee of radio telegraphy since Marconi performed
          his first experiments in this new branch of applied science.
          He is a refined, cultured southern gentleman who makes you
          feel at home at once; an invariable attribute of all of the
          truly great. Mr Rogers was one of the first inventors of the
          "printing telegraph" and his full-sized working models saw
          actual commercial service on a circuit between Baltimore and
          Washington, also in New York, back in 1880. These were seen by
          the writer and are wonderful pieces of mechanism.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Rogers laboratory, which
          comprises several large rooms, is lined on all sides with
          glass cabinets containing electrical apparatus which he has
          invented from time to time through his studious career. A
          novel and original high frequency generator was another of the
          devices that greatly interested the writer. It employed a jet
          of water shunted by a large capacity, the stream of water
          being connected to a high potential source of direct current.
          High frequency currents of any range up to the limit of
          audibility, or about 30,000 cycles per second, could be
          readily obtained with this apparatus. The writer merely cites
          these facts to substantiate the standing of Mr Rogers in the
          scientific field. Hundreds of other electrical inventions have
          been made by this modest genius of the quiet little Maryland
          town of Hyattsville, and the principal outstanding fact of his
          work is that he can show you a working model of each of these
          inventions, unlike many other inventors whose ideas exist only
          on paper, and which often fall down, miserably, when actually
          built and tested.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this connection it is
          interesting to consider for a moment that not one of the new
          wireless "static and interference preventers" proposed to the
          government radio experts during the war, proved practicable in
          the least.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Official recognition of Mr
          Rogers as the one and only inventor or "Underground and
          Undersea Wireless Communication" was soon forthcoming, and
          here it is in brief. These two official letters of recognition
          if Mr Rogers’ wonderful and revolutionizing invention
          represent but a very small fraction of those he has received
          from radio engineers of high repute in all parts of the world,
          congratulating him for his masterly work. The Navy Department
          has just permitted information on the Rogers system to be
          given out, and how well they kept their secret during the
          World War during which time this system has been in use by the
          Navy Department, may be judged by the fact that radio men
          everywhere are amazed at this feat. The distinguished radio
          savant Prof. George W. Pierce of Harvard University,
          congratulated Mr Rogers heartily when he first tested and
          heard the new system work through salt water, which he at
          first thought absolutely impossible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Below we give two letters of
          official recognition by the Navy Department of Mr Rogers’
          accomplishments, which are all that we have space for.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In response to an inquiry
          from Clarence Owens, director general of the Southern
          Commercial Congress, Admiral Griffin, USN chief of the Bureau
          of Steam Engineering wrote under date of December 27, 1918, as
          follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In reply to your question
          regarding the originator of the underground radio system, you
          are advised that Mr. J. H. Rogers of Hyattsville, MD, was the
          originator of this system. There have been other claimants to
          methods of underground radio signaling, but none were useful,
          within the Navy Department’s knowledge to the extent of being
          a valuable asset to the general scheme of radio
          communications. The introduction of Mr Rogers’ receiving
          system marked the beginning of the use of underground aerials
          for receiving, to great advantage over raised aerials, and has
          been valuable to the Navy during the war".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rear Admiral Strother Smith,
          then Capt. Smith, wrote Mr Rogers on December 7, 1917:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is a great pleasure to
          me to feel that I have been instrumental in bringing the
          result of your work before the Navy Department and assisting
          somewhat in putting it into actual practice. Out of the many
          thousand ideas presented you realize that a very, very small
          percentage are valuable and it is worth at least a year’s work
          to get one that I feel will give lasting benefit to the
          service that I take pleasure in serving".</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Navy Department
            Interested ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Through Dr George Lamar and
          Senator Blair Lee the discovery and the status of the patents
          were brought to the attention of Secretary Daniels of the
          Navy, Secretary Daniels ordered inquiry into Mr Rogers’
          claims, which showed that his invention worked, and requested
          Secretary Lane to give special consideration to pending patent
          applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Secretary Daniels then
          submitted the Rogers system to Rear Admiral (then Captain)
          Strother Smith, who called into consultation Capt. Hooper.
          These officers made a thro study of the system and found it
          practicable. Capt Hooper ordered it installed at New Orleans
          first and since then it has been employed at Belmar, NJ, and
          at other stations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a decade Mr Rogers has
          been studying radio subjects, and long before the US entered
          the war he had experimented with the problem of ridding aerial
          communication of this static atmospheric activity. He
          disagreed with all authorities who believed that the air, and
          not the earth and water, was least suited for wireless
          communication.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first Mr Rogers used the
          earth alone for sending messages to amateurs stationed nearby.
          Using an audion bulb, he then buried a wire from his
          laboratory and heard Philadelphia and other stations. Further
          experiments were conducted at a laboratory near Bladensburg,
          which he calls "Mount Hooper" in honor of Commander Hooper of
          the Navy, who rendered excellent service in adapting the
          invention to the needs of the Navy Department.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When Mr Rogers first stated
          that messages could be received and sent from submarines when
          submerged it was unanimously declared to be impossible and the
          officials of the Bureau of Standards were not alone in this
          belief, as no less a personage than Marconi declared at a
          banquet given in his honor in Washington, that when wireless
          was used on submarines, "it was necessary for the submarine to
          come to the top in order to catch the ether waves".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To demonstrate more clearly
          the underground system and to show how it could be used in
          trench warfare, Mr Rogers constructed an underground station,
          wholly inclosed beneath the surface of the earth, there being
          no visual existence outside. This place in Prince Georges
          country was visited by some very noted men, including Dr
          Abraham, the head of the French Scientific Commission, who,
          upon entering the cave at Mt Hooper expressed his amazement
          and remarked, "The Germans can’t get us here". Lieutenant
          Paternot, of the French Scientific Commission and the radio
          representative of France, also heard his native stations
          talking and expressed equal satisfaction, pleasure, and
          amazement.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How He Conceived the
            Underground System ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The writer asked Mr Rogers
          just how he came to form the idea of the "Underground and
          Subsea Radio". He explained that from his very first study of
          the method of transmitting radio signals by means of an
          elevated antenna, the question constantly presented itself to
          his mind --- "If 50 units of power are past into the aerial,
          then what becomes of the equal amount of energy which passes
          into the ground". He became so obsessed with his conundrum
          that he finally asked several prominent radio savants this
          question. What do you suppose the answer was? --- "It is
          dissipated in the form of heat in the ground", they answered.
          But still Mr Rogers thought they were wrong and now he has
          proved it. Another early idea of his in the theoretical aspect
          of radio-communication was as follows, and very logical it
          was, too, as you will agree: He held that if the outer crust
          of the earth is a conductor, and the surrounding atmospheric
          envelope is the insulator, then how infinitely better must the
          former be for the transmission of any form of electric
          current.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To Mr Rogers’s mind it was
          more reasonable to suppose that the energy liberated at the
          base of an aerial was propagated through the earth as well as
          through the ether above, and that an elevated aerial, at great
          distance, would be actuated by them as effectually as if the
          waves reached the same point through the ether above; when the
          waves through the earth reached the base of the aerial the
          potential of the plate would be raised and lowered and the
          aerial would accordingly be energized. Thus was his basic and
          original idea conceived and settled upon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Rogers’ first trial with
          the underground wireless to nearby radio amateurs began about
          7 years ago, but his theory of the reason why it must work was
          formulated over 10 years ago. Further, he conjectured that
          much less power would be required to propagate a wave or
          current through the earth’s conducting crust, which for one
          thing has smaller geometrical dimensions, than to propagate it
          through the insulating atmospheric envelope alone. See Fig. 1.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Theory of Operation ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A number of other radical
          ideas were entertained for several years by Mr Rogers, and in
          the course of time he has found that his ideas were correct
          --- it worked! It worked! And now the radio experts far and
          wide are holding a post mortem inquest on their theories and
          how it all happened. To start with, Mr Rogers stated, "special
          credit is die the following gentlemen, who have remained
          enthusiastic and sincere in all the tests and installations
          made of my underground radio system through all the trials and
          disappointments of its development, even when the system
          seemed to be unworkable. Their perseverance and high skill in
          the radio art has hastened the official endorsement and the
          installation of the buried and submerged antenna":</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Commander A. Hoyt, D Sc.,
          USN; Dr L. W. Watson, Bureau of Standards; Admiral Strother
          Smith, USN; Commander Hooper, USN; G.H. Clark, Expert Radio
          Aid, USN; Dr George W Pierce, of Harvard University; and
          Ensign A. Crossley, USN, who ahs actively engaged on the
          installation of the Rogers system at the Great Lakes Radio
          Station, New Orleans, New London, CT, and Norfolk, VA.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Like many other great
          inventions the exact mode operation is hard to ascertain and
          define. The views of Mr Rogers on the operation of this
          wireless system are briefly defined as follows: ---</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First, that the electrical
          energy liberated at the base of an antenna will be propagated
          through the earth even in the absence of etheric space waves
          above, if such a condition were possible, and which in reality
          does occur when great distances are signaled over, so he
          believes. Second, that the propagation of earth waves no more
          depend upon the ether waves above the surface than these
          etheric waves depend upon the earth waves. Further, that both
          waves are propagated simultaneously, one above and another
          below the surface of the earth, and that at the initial start
          each is dependent upon the other, although thereafter neither
          is dependent upon the other. Furthermore, Mr Rogers believes
          that the ether waves gradually die out in intensity in
          proportion to the earth’s curvature, and the distance over
          which they are propagated, and that at great distances the
          ether space waves do not have any appreciable effect upon
          receiving appliances, and that these are energized solely by
          the energy transmitted through the earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These ground currents travel
          with the speed of light and are picked up at the receiving
          station. The space waves persist for an appreciable distance,
          which accounts for airplane-to-airplane and airplane-to-earth
          communication, but it is the belief of Mr Rogers that in such
          long-distance radio transmission as half-way around the globe
          (12,000 miles) that it is the ground wave current that does
          the work, and that the free space wave above the surface of
          the earth never reaches the station, due to the high
          resistance of the atmospheric envelope.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the Naval experts
          present mentioned that it had been found that the penetration
          of the ground wave component increases with an increase in
          wavelength. This is an important fact and helps to explain the
          operation of this new radio system, with its aerials buried in
          the ground. He also mentioned that "Radio to Mars" or other
          planets would be impossible, if we are to believe in the
          well-known "Heaviside" ionization layer, surrounding the earth
          at a height computed at from 30 to 50 miles, for no etheric
          wave can pass this layer without being reflected back to the
          earth, or at least restrained within this passageway.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rogers System Eliminates
            "Static" &amp; "Interference" ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Rogers stated that his
          underground antenna, in itself, did not solve entirely the
          static or interference problem, but made it the nearest
          approach to this ideal condition -- the goal of all radio
          engineers -- than had ever been accomplished before. This
          problem has, thanks to a new arrangement perfected by Comm. A.
          Hoyt Taylor, D. Sc., been solved and static and interference
          have been practically eliminated, for all-year-round radio
          service. Think what an advance this means! Further, there is
          no rise and fall in the signal strength during the night or
          day, at any time of the year, due to the sun’s ionization
          effect, as is the case where elevated antennae are employed.
          The US Naval reports and tests made with the Rogers ground
          aerial in comparison with the usual form of elevated aerial,
          several of which are appended herewith, show the incomparable
          efficiency of this new radio system.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What The Facts Show ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First we will mention the
          test which Mr Rogers and a naval officer conducted for the
          writer. The apparatus used in these tests are shown in the
          accompanying photographs. They included several tuning
          inductances, variable condensers, a one-step audion amplifier
          (single Audiotron bulb only!) and two pairs of Baldwin phones
          (telephone receivers). This apparatus was connected up to one
          of Mr Rogers’ latest buried antennas --- a single
          rubber-covered, stranded copper cable, extending westward for
          a distance of 4,000 feet, so as to be in a plane with the
          high-power European radio stations. This cable is encased in
          iron pipe (gas pipe), each 20-foot section of which is
          insulated from the abutting sections by means of a rubber hose
          (garden hose) slipped over the pipe ends for a few inches.
          This is buried in a dirt trench about 3 feet deep, filled in
          with soil. The cable is insulated at the free end and is
          connected up as in Fig. 2. The rubber covered wire alone has
          been used in all sub-aqueous tests, and gives fine results
          when simply buried in the ground, the decay not being so rapid
          as probably would be imagined. This latest aerial in the iron
          pipes is a new development and experiments are still going on
          with it. It works wonderfully well. The 4,000 foot aerial here
          described is best suited to receiving radio lengths of 6,000
          to 16,000 meters. For shorter wavelengths aerials of smaller
          dimensions are employed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Here’s the Lyons station in
          France", said Mr Rogers. A turn of the knob on the specially
          calibrated condenser, and there was Lyons (France), sure
          enough. Static and interference were unheard. Next the great
          stations across the broad Atlantic, at Nauen, Germany;
          Carnarvon, Wales, (England; and Rome, Italy, were heard with
          equal loudness and clarity. This laboratory station, which has
          picked up practically all the high power stations on the
          globe. American stations are then picked up by changing the
          wavelength, and finally a test was made on a short (250 feet
          in length) buried ground antenna, adapted to receiving
          wavelengths of 200 to 800 meters. Wireless telephone messages
          were picked up from Washington, a distance of about 7 miles.
          It is most interesting to note at this juncture, as other
          tests have shown, that a radio message from an airplane cannot
          be picked up on the underground aerial, until the plane is
          directly over the station. This would seem to prove two
          things: first, that the short waves sent out by the airplane
          radio set do not penetrate into the ground very far, if at
          all, --- and second, that airplane radio transmission and
          reception are effected solely by etheric waves.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to Figures 3 and
          4, we find several interesting points. Figure 3-A shows how a
          double ground aerial is sometimes connected. Also,&nbsp; as in
          the case of Mr Rogers’ test station, several sets of these
          buried antennae are best employed, distributed about the
          station as shown in Fig. 3-B.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;The Rogers underground
          antenna system has been used at the Belmar, NJ, station during
          the war with most gratifying results, as reported by the Navy
          Department, and its successful and unfailing operation during
          the 24 hours of the day, resulted in trebling and quadrupling
          the capacity of this great trans-Atlantic highway of
          intelligence communication. The official reports in connection
          with the work accomplished with the underground Rogers system
          at Belmar state that not a single word of communication was
          lost during the reception of thousands of important messages
          from Europe. The station at Tuckerton, NJ has also been
          equipped with the Rogers underground aerial system and all of
          the larger stations of the Allied powers in Europe have been
          copied successfully through the 24 hours, at this point also.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Submarine Wireless ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the most interesting
          tests of all are those which were made on submerged submarines
          in salt water! The aerial in this case was of heavily
          insulated stranded cable, stretched from stem to stern as Fig.
          4-A illustrates. The two aerials were brought down through the
          conning tower and joined to the receiving apparatus. A second
          form of aerial is illustrated in Fig. 4-B, where the insulated
          aerial wires are placed in iron pipes within the submarine.
          Here are the results of some of these tests, which do not
          include the transmitting tests to the submarine from a ground
          antenna on shore. When submerged 8 feet, the German station at
          Nauen was picked up by the submarine while lying off the
          American coast! Submarines have, in other official tests,
          picked up distant stations when submerged 21 feet, on a
          wavelength of 12,600 meters or greater wavelengths.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the naval officers,
          who has had much to do with the testing of the Rogers system,
          stated that experience had demonstrated that in fresh water
          the submerged antenna may be placed at any depth. Salt water
          acts differently, but the aerial may be submerged at any
          desired depth for wavelengths above 10,000 meters.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The same officer, who has
          made a close study of all American and European work in radio,
          explained how the best work ever done in radio was
          accomplished at the Great Lakes Naval Station, on the shores
          of Lake Michigan. Figure 5 gives the general arrangement of
          the station. The test station was on the beach and acted as a
          "remote control" station for standard station at A. The
          shortest distance between a "receiving and control station" in
          the naval radio service heretofore has been 36 miles. Here a
          distance of 600 feet only separates the elevated aerial of the
          main station from the submerged Rogers antenna terminating at
          the test station. Said he, "Now let the inventors of ‘static
          and interference’ preventers trot out their little pets, and
          show what they can do! Here’s what this station actually did
          on schedule service: with 48 amperes, at 4,000 meters
          wavelength, being radiated in the elevated main antenna ---
          the beach station, only 600 feet away, was picking up Nauen on
          12,000 meters, and New Orleans on 5,000 meters, without any
          interference or static --- all on the Rogers sub-aqueous
          aerials. These were rubber-covered cables spreading in
          different directions, any one of which could be used, and
          laying 50 feet deep in the water at their outer extremities.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Imagine such a wonderful
          performance! But this is not all. The official tests show that
          the station at Cavite, PI, 8,100 miles away, was received
          regularly on the Rogers aerials at the Lake Michigan Station,
          on schedule service.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Transmitting On
            Underground Aerials ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tests were made by the naval
          experts, as well as by Mr Rogers in his very first experiments
          in transmission from a ground or underwater antenna. These
          were all successful. It is only a matter of properly
          insulating the antenna so that it will not break down under
          the high potential applied to it by the transmitter. The early
          tests by the inventor were made with a one inch spark coil to
          the Bureau of Standards Radio Laboratory, a distance of 7
          miles, the received signals having an audibility of 2,000,
          i.e., 2,000 times the strength of a clear, readable signal.
          The audibility of the signals at the Washington Navy Yard was
          1,000. The transmitting tests at the Great Lakes Naval Station
          were made at first with a low power Oscillion bulb transmitter
          and later with a Clapp-Eastham hytone set. An elevated amateur
          style antenna of two wires was strung up between two houses 38
          miles away. Clear signals were received with an audibility
          strength of 2,000. The ignition cable used for the aerial
          finally punctured, but even then the signals received were
          four times louder than the best amateur transmitter could send
          on a regular aerial, as tests proved.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general (relating to the
          Rogers system), the point of interest lies in the use of wires
          buried in the ground, for both the transmitting and the
          receiving antenna. For instance, in receiving, a wire buried
          one foot below the surface of the earth extends for several
          hundred feet south of the receiving station, and a similar
          wire north, the receiver being located between the pairs of
          wires. The ordinary receiver was used. With this arrangement,
          signals from Darien, Nauen, and all Atlantic stations were

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of particular interest is
          the fact that when static prevents reception on the main

          storm, when the main antenna would have been dangerous without
          grounding. Reception is also directional and permits of
          avoiding interference to some extent by using wire "off
          direction" of an interfering station.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Strays are as a rule
          practically absent. On a few occasions, strays have risen to
          an audibility in excess of 5,000 on separate cracks, but even
          in this case, reception of signals, although a little
          difficult, was not interrupted. On these occasions it was
          necessary to ground both of the elevated aerials at the main
          station.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Considering the matter of
          strays, it can be said that on four or five occasions marked
          by tremendous storms, that strays rose to an audibility in
          excess of 10,000 at the beach station. Even in this case,
          however, signals from boats within 100 miles and from shore
          stations such as Milwaukee, were usually readable, because the
          strays while very loud, were nowhere near as numerous as on
          the elevated aerial..</font> </p>

          appreciable advantage in using more than one wire --- No. 12
          weather proof insulated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The experiments at Great
          Lakes confirm the work of the Bureau of Standards on the
          importance of adequate insulation of the wire. If the wires
          are grounded a the ends, it does not necessarily make much
          difference unless they are adjusted to the optimum wire
          length; but if properly adjusted to this length, grounding of
          the wires produces a diminuation of the signals, which,
          however, even with the intentional grounding of the two ends,
          still leaves them 50% of their maximum value. Therefore, while
          the question of insulation is important, it does not mean that
          the system will fail entirely if the insulation becomes
          faulty.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the publication of the
          original article on the Rogers Underground Wireless System,
          published in March, 1919, the Editors have been besieged by
          hundreds and thousands of letters from radio experimenters in
          all parts of the world, asking for data on the construction of
          the Rogers Underground Aerial suited for the requirements of
          the Wireless Amateur. The original article contained a great
          deal of valuable data, which should be carefully read and
          digested by every radio man, whether he be a student or a
          professional. In the present article an effort has been made
          to answer some of the questions which have seemed to annoy the
          average radio "bug" considerably, --- especially those
          residing in cities where it is difficult and frequently
          impossible to bury an aerial longer than a few feet. We may
          say right here, that for those experimenters so situated,
          there is a solution, or in fact, two solutions, namely --- to
          use a spiral antenna, such as has been tried out successfully
          in US Navy tests on the Rogers system, and which spirals may
          be buried in the ground a few feet, or placed in a well or a
          body of water; and secondly, for the experimenter who is not
          allowed to disfigure an apartment house or other dwelling with
          a ugly-looking aerial, there is a newly developed loop
          antenna, which can be used right in the radio room. Indoor
          aerials have been greatly perfected during the war, and now by
          means of greatly improved and highly sensitive wireless
          receiving instruments and amplifiers available, particularly
          those using audions as detectors and amplifiers, they are
          excellent, and satisfactory results are obtainable by means of
          a concentrated loop or spiral antenna, small enough to be
          placed in the radio laboratory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the present, we will
          listen to the sound advice given by our mutual friend, Mr
          James Harris Rogers, on some of the practical outstanding
          features of his underground system, used in conjunction with
          straight-away single wire underground aerials, as well as loop
          aerials. Among other things, Mr Rogers has the following to
          say regarding the installation of simple underground aerials:</font>

          my underground antenna was made in the woods about a mile from
          my laboratory and consisted in burying wires in the earth; the
          wires radiated from the station as the spokes of a wheel, ---
          some wire bare and some insulated; their lengths varied from
          200 to 1,000 feet. ( Figure 1)</font> </p>

          of persons can receive at the same time, one operator to each

          circuit. With this switch any individual wire may be grounded,
          or any two wires may be used. Bare wires give the loudest
          signals but static is more pronounced. The deeper the wires
          are buried, the better the signals, with a corresponding
          reduction of static. Short wires show a remarkable degree of
          directivity; long ones to a lesser degree and in proportion to
          their length. (See Figs. 2 &amp; 3)</font> </p>

          and the results were the same, excepting that the note of the
          sending station became higher and higher as it was lowered.
          Upon revolving it around, I found the directional
          characteristics were the same in the water as when out. These
          tests were made about 2 years ago, and I at once realized that
          the loops or cages could be used in the dugouts of France, or
          on submarines when submerged.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kind of Wire Used for
            Underground Aerials ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;Most of the inquiries
          from Radio Experimenters and those intending to install
          experimental stations, and wishing to make use of the
          "static-proof" Rogers underground antenna, on which signals
          may be received even through a thunderstorm, indicate that the
          greatest problem to solve seems to be the size and the kind of
          wire to be used, and how it shall be buried. Some very
          excellent results have been obtained in experimental work
          carried out at one of the leading American universities with
          aerial conductors laid on the ground, and where the
          experimenter has the time and space to try this out, he may
          gain some useful and valuable knowledge by experimenting in
          this direction. Ordinarily the wire, of whatever kind it may
          be, as used when installing the Rogers underground aerial, is
          buried about 3 feet deep in the earth. For most amateur
          requirements, the wire need only be about 100 to 200 feet
          long, and so the digging of the trench is not such a great
          problem; in fact, it can be plowed open, at least part of the
          depth, and where rivers, brooks or ponds are available the
          insulated wire can be placed in them directly and allowed to
          rest on the bed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Regarding the choice of wire
          to be used, it becomes evident that even bare copper or other
          wire may be utilized when desired, as Mr Rogers has pointed
          out in the above contribution. The size of this wire should be
          about #12 or 14 B&amp;S gage, the heavier the better.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The official US Navy report
          of tests on the Rogers Underground System mention that no
          increased efficiency is obtained by using more than one wire,
          and that this may be a # 12 or 14 B&amp;S gage, weather-proof
          or rubber-covered copper conductor. In any case, the free end
          of the wire should well taped, and preferably covered with
          some rubber cement, so as to keep it insulated. Experiments
          have been tried both by Mr Rogers at his Hyattsville MD
          laboratory, and also by the Navy Department, with underground
          aerials in terra cotta pipes, but this construction is rather
          expensive, and the results obtained do not justify its use.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other forms of wire used
          both by Mr Rogers and the Navy Department experts include
          lead-covered telephone cable, which is, of course, thoroughly
          damp-proof, while a conductor holding considerable favor with
          the inventor is the heavy rubber-covered, high-tension,
          auto-ignition cable. This is highly efficient for aerial
          requirements, as it is stranded and therefore of low high
          frequency resistance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In any case, a little common
          sense and logic will give the answer to many of the simple
          problems arising in connection with the installation of these
          aerials, such as, for instance, the length of aerial to be
          used for a certain range of wavelengths. It is manifest that
          the longer the wavelength to which it will properly respond.
          Considering that an antenna is used having a length of, say,
          150 to 200 feet, then practically all the shorter wavelengths
          up to 600 meters and more should be readily picked up on this
          antenna, especially with the variable condenser hooked up in
          series with the primary of the loose coupler, as shown in the
          accompanying diagrams. Naturally the wire buried in the ground
          has a higher electrostatic capacity than the old style antenna
          wires, elevated 40 to 50 feet above the ground, and we can
          reduce this capacity as desired, so as to tune any certain
          wavelengths, by connecting another capacity in series with it:
          in exactly the same manner as short wave lengths are tuned in
          on the regular elevated aerials, by connecting a variable
          capacity in series with the antenna circuit, and the primary
          of the loose coupler. Long wavelengths are tunable by using
          large condensers and loose couplers preferably.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Spiral or Loop Aerials ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in the diagram,
          Fig. 7, interesting results were obtained with a spiral
          antenna, composed of a dozen or so turns of insulated wire,
          such as a high tension cable or # 14 RC solid conductor
          lowered into a well. Both with and without water in it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As pointed out in the
          original article on the Rogers underground system in the March
          issue, very promising results have been obtained in
          transmitting with the underground antenna, and Fig. 8 shows
          how a small transmitting set was operated with such an aerial,
          coupling the exciting or spark gap circuit with the antenna
          oscillatory circuit by means of a two-coil oscillatory
          transformer, L, C. In this case two metal plates, about one
          yard square, are placed in the earth adjacent to the well, one
          of which connects with the secondary, S, of the oscillation
          transformer, while the other plate connects with the free end
          of the spiral antenna.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the spiral antenna is
          used, it should be placed on its vertical axis, and it should
          be placed in the vertical placed in the vertical plane as
          shown as shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Excellent results have been
          had should be obtained in transmitting with the underground
          antenna, with the usual insulation incident to the form of
          conductors above specified, where the transmitting set is one
          employing an audion oscillation generator. The voltage in this
          case will not be extremely high and special precautions need
          not be taken to provide extra heavy insulation on the buried
          antenna. The wire in such a case, however, should be
          especially. Official tests by the US Navy have shown
          transmission by radio over 50 miles with the Rogers
          underground antenna. The wire in such a case, however, should
          be especially well insulated to stand the higher voltage.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Regarding loop aerials in
          general, it would appear that we can expect a great deal from
          them, as some of the really remarkable results achieved during
          the war would seem to point out. The number of turns and the
          amount of wire to be used in a spiral wire to be used in a
          spiral antenna, such as shown at Figs. 7 and 8, will vary of
          course for different wavelengths, etc., and here is where the
          radio Amateur will have a chance to carry out some original
          experiments, which may net him some real knowledge, fame and
          money. Another form of loop antenna, so-called, and which has
          been tried out several years ago with such success that
          European stations could be copied in a laboratory located in
          Florida, is one composing a square form, several feet in
          height. This was used, as just mentioned, to receive stations
          using fairly long wavelengths, say from 8,000 to12,000 meters.
          Here the insulating form was wound with a layer comprising
          several hundred turns of insulated wire. This antenna was
          successfully used in some tests made by Marconi radio
          engineers at a laboratory in Florida several years ago.
          Trans-Atlantic radio reception was effected at the radio
          laboratory of Union College, Schenectady NY, just prior to
          America’s entrance into the world war. This aerial comprised
          about two dozen turns of # 14 or 12 bare or RC wire, mounted
          on porcelain know insulators screwed on the inside wall of the
          laboratory. The turns were spaced about 3 inches apart. The
          inside turn was 3 feet square. Flexible leads, fitted with
          clips, serve to connect as many turns as desired.</font> </p>

      <p>This article is without doubt the most important one that has
        appeared in print for some years, as far as amateurs are
        concerned. When the Rogers Underground Aerial was first
        announced, many amateurs, particularly those living in cities
        were bitterly disappointed for the reason that they could not
        make use of this form of aerial die to the fact that long earth
        trenches were necessary. Now comes along Mr Jones with his new
        invention, showing us how to use a concentrated underground
        aerial that all of s can use in every city without any trouble
        whatsoever. The article is epoch-making and should be read by
        every radio enthusiast worth his name. – Editor&nbsp; [ Hugo
        Gernsbach ] </p>
      <p>The readers of Radio Amateur News will undoubtedly greet this
        article with open arms since it deals with an underground system
        accessible to all, no matter how small the back yard. </p>
      <p>As is well known, the Rogers system with its lengthy wires
        stretching in all directions cannot be employed by the Amateurs
        of today. Take, for instance, reception of long wavelengths
        where a stretch of 2000 feet is required. This would mean that
        the Amateur would have to dig under fences, etc, for three city
        blocks in each direction --- impossible --- and worse than that.
        This state of affairs bothered me constantly and I was
        determined to find some possible solution for this impractical
        method…. </p>
      <p>One sleepless night visions began to parade before my
        half-conscious vision and amongst the crowd was a coil of wire
        rolling merrily along --- Ah! The problem was solved… </p>
      <p>In the morning I went forth with vim and vigor to plant some
        coils in old Mother Earth. Finding labor scarce&nbsp; decided to
        throw them into the lake for a trial. Ouch! Then the fun began.
        Now to get back to business we will begin with the first
        experiment carried out at this lake, in order to prove my
        sanity. </p>
      <p>The first experiment made use of two coils, each 200 feet of
        Packard auto cable, wound to have an overall diameter of 2 feet.
        After being bound so as to hold their form, they were lowered
        into the water (Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana) and rested on the
        bottom at a depth of approximately 4 feet. The two coils were
        spaced about 10 feet apart, but bringing them as close as within
        2 feet of each other did not seem to have any noticeable effect
        upon their proper functioning. The following stations were
        picked up with very good audibilities [ list not included here
        ]. There was of course no directional effect, in that the coil
        was in a favorable position to respond from practically all
        directions. Later on it will be shown how coils were used
        embodying directional effects. </p>
      <p>The exceptional results obtained with this arrangement prompted
        me to believe that such an antenna for underground work as I had
        discovered would, if consistent in operation in different
        localities, eliminate the present practice of digging lengthy
        ditches in which to lay the wires. Besides, since it is
        recognized that the picking up of strays is governed by the
        length of the wire, it is to be expected that a great reduction
        in respect to such disturbances will be noticeable under actual
        operation. When employing such small antennae, what little
        static is picked up on the wires is entirely eliminated, and the
        strength of signals is not weakened in the least by employing
        such small coils. The position of the coils is shown in Figure
        1. </p>
      <p>The second experiment followed immediately after obtaining such
        remarkable results from the first, and the two coils which were
        used in the first experiment were taken up and put into the
        Mississippi River. The leads from the two coils were brought
        into a Naval building. In this instance the coils were sunk to a
        depth of 12 feet in the water; they rested upon the mud bottom
        of the river, and the distance between the waterline and the
        wharf was approximately 15 feet. Reception… demonstrated that
        the possibilities of such antennae were indeed practical. The
        following stations worthy of note were received: [ list not
        included here ]. </p>
      <p>Of course in this experiment, as well as the first, there were
        practically no directional effects present, as I expected when
        making use of coils as described; but the exceptional results
        obtained through the employment of the same was more than
        gratifying, and I think that the results of the foregoing
        experiments, if consistent in various localities, will provide a
        means of saving considerable expense involved in installing the
        usual Rogers system. Likewise the ration between signal and
        static audibility will be increased, since the inductance is
        concentrated, and not distributed at considerable lengths. </p>
      <p>The coils employed in both experiments were, at each location,
        drawn from the water and placed on the dock at various angles
        with absolutely no results in respect to signals, but local
        strays and heavy jolts were picked up. Of course the local
        stations could be heard, but this was of no value. Immediately
        after placing the coils back into the water the static and
        strays disappeared and signals were picked up from the various
        stations listed previously. Very heavy jolts of static and
        lightning were recorded by faint clicks. This may have been
        augmented by making use of non-shielded wires for the leads from
        the coils to the receiver proper. They acted as an open antenna
        from the waterline to the receiving apparatus; besides, the
        apparatus was not screened nor shielded. </p>
      <p>Two circuits, which gave exceptional results, are shown in
        Figures 3 and 4, In Figure 3 the tickler arrangement was
        employed to complete the regenerative circuit; however, the
        connections shown in Figure 4 greatly increased the selectivity
        of the system. In this case the plate circuit was tuned by
        making use of the variable condenser C2 and inductance L; and
        the tickler coil was set a ‘minimum’ adjustment or relation to
        the secondary coil. As the inductance of the secondary or tuning
        circuit was increased, the inductance L also had to be
        increased, and the maximum response was had by varying condenser
        C2 until the bulb began to oscillate. This arrangement provides
        a much wider range of tuning, and instead of acting similar to
        the tickler coil, which has practically a very sharp point of
        resonance, the plate tuning circuit commences to oscillate
        slightly at first and gradually increases until maximum response
        is had… </p>
      <p>In the next experiments the coils were increased in size to
        ascertain what effect this change would have upon the reception
        of signals and strays. These coils were wound and supported by
        the cross sticks shown in the photos having a diameter of 4
        feet. The strength of signals was greatly increased; in fact, to
        such an extent that it was possible to read ships from 100 to
        400 miles off the Mississippi river bar. </p>
      <p>The occasional jolts of very weak audibilities were picked up
        by the leads from the coils to the receiver, also by the
        connections and coils in the receiving circuit proper. This was
        proven when the same amount of strays was noticeable without the
        leads connected to the receiving apparatus. The leads of the
        coils as well as the receiving apparatus and the operator should
        be screened and grounded to totally eliminate the static. </p>
      <p>These coils were spaced 15 feet apart on the riverbed, 12 feet
        below the waterline, but by increasing this distance to 30 feet
        the signal strength was practically doubled… </p>
      <p>While Swan island was transmitting, the coils were changed from
        15 feet apart to approximately 2 feet, and Swan Island’s signals
        were reduced to a minimum (just audible); then the coils were
        moved so as to be separated 50 feet, at which position Swan
        island signals were almost doubled in strength as was had when
        the coils were but 15 feet apart. This was the greatest distance
        possible, under the circumstances, but arrangements were made in
        order to ascertain whether spacing them further apart would have
        any noticeable effect on the strength of signals received and
        the results proved that increasing this distance did not
        materially increase the strength of received signal strength. </p>
      <p>Next the coils and receiving apparatus were removed to the New
        Orleans station grounds (NJK) where the coils were buried at a
        depth of 4 feet, having encountered water 3 feet below the
        surface. They were separated 30 feet apart, as was found best by
        experiments carried out at the naval building where the coils
        were placed in the river, and it was an easy matter to change
        their position. </p>
      <p>In order to have this circuit function properly, the apparatus
        in the receiving room of the station proper was disconnected and
        notations were supplied from our log, because whenever both of
        us were on the same setting, say 600 meters, the distance
        between the two receiving rooms being approximately 125 feet,
        any change in my apparatus cut him out and vice versa. Also his
        bulb, when setting on the same wavelength as mine, was easily
        picked up and hindered reception on that wavelength. The same
        effect was noticeable at his apparatus. </p>
      <p>With these coils buried as outlined, signals were received
        which compared favorably with those picked up from the overhead
        antenna. This increase in signal strength as recorded here was
        brought about by the improvement noticed in diagram Figure 5,
        where the 1 mfd condenser C was connected between the ground and
        the RE lead as shown. </p>
      <p>In order to get some idea of the fundamental wavelength and
        capacity of the coils, measurements were taken and the results
        were quite surprising. </p>
      <p>Coil 1 --- Capacity 0.035 mfd --- 1150 meters <br>
        Coil 2 --- 0.037 mfd --- 1250 meters. </p>
      <p>These coils were both free-ended and are of the dimensions
        given previously (200 feet Packard cable, 4 feet diameter,
        approximately 14 turns). </p>
      <p>Free ended coils are used throughout and can be pointed out as
        the invention itself, since it is absolutely necessary that such
        coils be used in this work. It has been found through experiment
        that a buried closed loop will not function, while the open
        concentrated coil will give the same results as a length of wire
        stretched underground. </p>
      <p>Naturally, it is necessary to employ a two-step amplifier, for
        signals will not be audible up to any considerable distances
        without this essential piece of apparatus. </p>
      <p>The foregoing experiments proved beyond a doubt the value of
        such concentrated antennae for underground reception and the
        following summary can be drawn: </p>
      <p>1. The length of wire, having serious and detrimental effects,
        when longer than 2000 feet, can in this manner be concentrated
        and will furnish the same results, if not better, in respect to
        signal-static ratio. Since the coils need not occupy more than a
        reasonable amount of space, at any rate for long waves 1/100
        that necessary when employing the wires stretched to the full
        length, as in the Rogers system, is sufficient. </p>
      <p>2. That practically the same signal strength is received in
        these tests as was had when employing the outstretched wires and
        the static was reduced. </p>
      <p>3. In this short space of time the foregoing experiments were
        the only ones that could be tested thoroughly; but it is
        needless to say that this is only a beginning of this new type
        of antenna in connection with underground reception, which will
        undoubtedly save thousands of dollars at initial installation. </p>
      <p>4. The coils themselves, being so small, could be easily
        encased in some form of insulating tube and finally set in a
        concrete casing which would undoubtedly increase the life of the
        coils. </p>
      <p>5. The coils could be enclosed on the surface of the earth by
        large tanks which in turn must be grounded to act as the shield.
        In this manner it would be possible to construct large coils
        which could be rotated at any angle desired and thereby cause
        maximum reception from various directions. The coils could be
        rotated by motors and at the will of the operator, or they may
        be buried and caused to rotate in the same manner described
        above. In this case they would have to be installed in a
        concrete cellar built underground. </p>
      <p>Some further experiments which were carried out using the same
        principle were tried later. The coils employed in this series of
        tests are shown in the photographs where the author and inventor
        is seen standing between the two [ tubular ]coils. </p>
      <p>With these coils laid in the earth or in the water very good
        results were obtained, and pointing the coils towards or away
        from any given transmitter did not change the strength of its
        signal to any noticeable extent. However, it is believed that
        were the coils constructed at greater lengths directional
        effects would be present. </p>
      <p>These coils were laid in holes dug in the ground, then water
        was pumped into the holes. This maintained the coils under water
        at all times and permitted such tests as were necessary to
        ascertain whether or not they possessed directional properties.
        However, no directional effects were present, so the coils were
        discontinued and square frame coils were used in their place. </p>
      <p>Experiments were carried out with large square framed coils (
        200 feet to the turn, or 50 to each side of the square ) laid on
        the ground. This was tried for long wave undamped reception and
        exceptional results were had when the ground was wet,
        immediately after a good rain, for then the wires were
        practically buried. However, when the ground dried out, the
        signals vanished and were not received with a readable
        audibility. It was only necessary to have these coils buried in
        moist earth and excellent results have been obtained. Receiving
        on underground from short wavelengths with long outstretched
        wires demands a critical length of the wire. However on a loop
        or concentrated open ended coil such as mine, the length does
        not materially affect such reception until the length exceeds
        500 feet to the coil. </p>
      <p>Now all ye Amateurs get busy and dig those 4-foot holes until
        permanent moist earth is assured and place your little coils
        some 50 feet apart, hook her up, and there you are… Underground
        at last in reach of the average Experimenter and Amateurs at
        large. </p>
      <p>The Amateurs not only have my permission to use this system byt
        are encouraged to do so… </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Insulator For Rogers Underground System</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Amateurs experimenting with the Rogers underground wireless
        will find difficulty in making an insulator for the end o their
        antenna. This scheme affords the necessary insulation and gives
        a neat finish to the antenna. </p>
      <p>From the drawing it is clear that I employ a bottle of suitable
        size to hold the wire and after inserting the wire into the
        bottle molten rosin or wax is poured into the bottle and
        permitted to cool. For those not familiar with the use of such
        accessories it may be explained that when burying wires to be
        employed in underground reception the end of the wire must be
        well insulated. This is accomplished easily and very
        satisfactorily in the manner shown. --- Contributed by W.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our invention relates to the
          transmission of electrical impulses or oscillations to a
          distance, primarily for the purpose of conveying intelligence,
          and it pertains to means for both sending and receiving.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In systems of wireless
          sending and receiving now in general use, one or more
          conductors or capacities are employed disposed above the
          surface of the earth, which conductors or capacities serve to
          radiate or receive the impulses in the sending or receiving of
          messages. Such elevated conductors are costly to erect and
          maintain, as to obtain efficiency and long distance
          transmission it is necessary to have them at considerable
          distance above the surface of the earth. This necessitates
          expensive towers and masts, and moreover both the conductors
          and the towers or masts are exposed to weather conditions ---
          wind storms, lightning, snow and ice --- which often impede or
          entirely prevent the operation of the system. We are aware
          that it has been proposed also to employ a conductor elevated
          above the earth in connection with a buried conductor.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our invention has for its
          principal object the provision of a system not subject to the
          above conditions; a system in which the communication, both
          sending and receiving, is clear and effective; in which the
          communication is selective and the direction may be readily
          determined; in which multiple transmissions may be effected;
          and in which the sending and receiving of messages to and from
          stations on land and on the water may proceed independent of
          weather conditions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have discovered that
          signals can be sent and received with great difficulty by the
          employment of wires buried beneath the surface of the earth
          but insulated therefrom substantially throughout their length
          and extending in direction substantially parallel to the
          earth’s surface, so that while the wires are not in direct
          contact with the earth they are intimately associated
          therewith.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention consists in
          the novel features and combinations of circuits and apparatus
          in the wireless signaling system hereinafter described and
          claimed, and illustrated in diagram in the accompanying
          drawings, in which: ---</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 1 is a system in
          which a single antenna is shown below the surface of the
          earth, but insulated therefrom by being mounted within a

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the drawings,
          signal instruments are indicated at 10, and in Fig. 1 and Fig.
          2 are those of the receiving station, while in Fig. 3 the
          instruments pf a sending station are shown. In Fig. 1 and Fig.
          2, 11 is a detector of any type, preferably an audion, 12 a
          telephone, and 13 and 14 are the usual condensers. Any desired
          type of instruments and arrangement of connecting circuits may
          be employed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The surface of the earth is
          indicated at 15, and the antenna at 16. This latter extends in
          a direction substantially horizontal, and as shown in the
          figures is preferably buried below the surface of the earth.
          Referring particularly to Fig. 1, the antenna is mounted
          within a non-conducting material such as terra cotta. The
          mounting within the conduit may be of any preferred type, that
          shown being by mounting the antenna upon a series of lugs or
          projections 18 extending upwardly from the bottom of the
          conduit. From the end of the conduit connection is made
          between the antenna and the signal instruments. The antenna is
          thus intimately associated with the earth throughout its
          length but is insulated therefrom and, it is believed, a
          considerable portion of the earth’s surface about the antenna
          thus cooperates with the latter in sending or receiving
          oscillations.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The cooperation of the
          antenna with a ground connection or a second antenna is
          desirable for proper transmission or reception of signals, and
          in Fig. 1 we have therefore shown the other side of the
          instruments connected to ground plate 19.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 2 is an embodiment of
          the invention in which two antennae are employed extending in
          opposite directions, the second antenna 20 being connected in
          place of the ground plate shown in Fig. 1. This arrangement is
          more effective than with the use of the ground plate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to obtain the
          maximum efficiency it is desirable to have the antennae
          disposed in a line at right angles to the wave fronts, and in
          order that this may be accomplished for the different
          directions a plurality of antennae are employed extending
          outwardly in different directions but substantially horizontal
          and parallel to the surface of the earth, and under the
          surface as already explained. This arrangement is fully set
          forth in our application Serial # 130,603 (field Nov. 10,
          1916), to which reference is made for complete details. It is
          therefore thought unnecessary to illustrate or describe such
          arrangements as in the present application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 3 shows the same
          arrangement as Fig. 2m but with sending instruments instead of
          receiving instruments. These latter comprise a generator 21,
          transformer 22, spark gap 23 and condenser 24. Any other
          sending arrangement and instruments may be employed instead of
          those shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now more
          particularly to Fig. 4, in place of the conduit of pipe, an
          ordinary insulating envelope for the antenna is shown at 25,
          and for this purpose the antenna may be an ordinary insulated
          wire of the proper size and length. It may be buried beneath
          the surface of the earth, as already explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention is also
          applicable to the surface of the earth where there is water.
          For instance, on the sea coast the antennae may be run out
          from the shore into the water, and although insulated from the
          latter it is so closely associated therewith that there is a
          cooperation between the antenna and the surrounding water in
          the sending and receiving of oscillations. The insulated
          antenna may also be employed for sending and receiving signals
          to and from vessels in the manner fully set forth in our
          above-mentioned application, it being believed unnecessary to
          fully describe these arrangements here.</font> </p>

          figure, as also in Figures 3, 4, and 5, the sending and
          recalling instruments, whichever is connected for use at any
          given time, is merely indicated by one coil 23 of the
          coupling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 3 the antennae and
          their inclosing screens are shown buried beneath the surface
          of the earth, in which case the instruments may be in a
          covered chamber 29 below ground.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 4 is shown an
          arrangement in which, instead of associating one set of signal
          instruments with both antenna, two sets of instruments are
          provided, one set 23’ being connected to antenna 20 and screen
          or pipe 24" and instruments 23" being connected to antenna 21
          and instruments may be used simultaneously, both sets for
          sending or receiving, or one set for sending and the other set
          for receiving.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In using the terms "surface
          of the earth" I intend to designate the surface where there is
          water as well as well as where there is land. The invention is
          therefore applicable to boats or vessels, particularly
          submarines on which it is operative whether afloat or
          submerged. Such an embodiment of the invention is shown in
          Figure 5 in which the vessel is indicated at 30, and the other
          parts designated as in Figures 1, 2, and 3, so that they
          require no further description. The screens 24 are preferably
          extended through sheathings or hull, so that each antenna is
          inclosed substantially throughout its length is inclosed
          substantially throughout its length within the vessel. The
          ground plate 26’ at the forward end of the vessel is
          preferably pivoted mounted at its forward edge on brackets 31,
          32 so as to swing freely with the movements of the vessel, but
          is insulated therefrom as shown diagrammatically at 33. The
          antenna 20 is connected to plate 26’ in any suitable manner.
          Ground plate 27’ is similarly mounted on brackets 31’, 32’ at
          the stern of the vessel, and is connected to antenna 21. These
          plates may be mounted in ay other suitable manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In all of the embodiments of
          the invention the pipe or screen is preferably filled with oil
          such as is ordinarily used in transformers, for the purpose of
          preventing brush discharge, this being indicated at 34.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My invention relates to
          radio signaling systems and apparatus for sending and
          receiving signals through space by means of electromagnetic
          waves, and it relates particularly to that portion of such
          systems known as the antenna.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have discovered that radio
          conductors or antennae are highly efficient when disposed
          horizontally to the surface of the earth but completely
          insulated therefrom and inclosed in an inclosing metallic
          covering screen or casing practically throughout their entire
          length, but insulated therefrom. The metallic covering thus
          inclosing the antenna, but from which the latter is insulated,
          takes up the electromagnetic waves, in receiving, and
          transmits them to the antenna within at full strength and even
          with greater effect than when the antenna is used without the
          covering. A highly efficient action is thus obtained, the
          static is reduced, and at the same time the antenna is fully
          protected from deterioration by the corroding action of earth
          and water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention consists in
          the novel construction and arrangement of apparatus and parts
          thereof for sending and receiving radio signals hereinafter
          described and claimed, and illustrated in the accompanying
          drawings, in which drawings: ---</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 1 is a diagrammatic
          view showing the antenna buried beneath the surface of the
          earth, receiving instruments being associated with the
          antenna;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 1a shows a
          conventional arrangement of sending instruments which may be
          substituted for the receiving instruments for transmitting
          signals, it being understood that either the sending or
          receiving instruments shown in Fig. 1 are to be used in
          connection with the arrangement shown in the remaining
          figures;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 2 is a view similar
          to Fig. 1 showing two antennae extending in opposite
          directions beneath the surface of the earth, the connection
          for signaling instruments being located between the antennae
          and also beneath the surface of the earth;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 3 shows an antenna
          incased according to the invention and lying upon the surface
          of the earth, a ground connection and the instruments
          connected between the antenna and the ground connection;</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the drawings,
          10 indicates the signal instruments, which in Fig. 1 are those
          for receiving signals, while in Fig. 1a the instruments for
          sending signals are shown. In Fig. 1, 11 is a detector of any
          type, preferably an audion, 12 a telephone, and 13 and 14 the
          usual condensers. Any desired type of instruments and
          arrangement of connecting circuits may be employed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Fig. 1a suitable sending
          instruments are conventionally shown. These comprise a
          generator 15, transformer 16, spark gap 17, and condenser 18
          and key 19.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above-mentioned
          instruments are well known in the art of radio or magnetic
          wave signaling, and need not be further described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">20 is an antenna for
          radiating or receiving electromagnetic waves, and as shown in
          Fig. 1 extends horizontally or substantially parallel to the
          earth’s surface and buried in the earth. This antenna may be
          of any suitable or desired length, and is completely inclosed
          within a metallic covering, casing or screen 21 which may be a
          tube or pipe of lead, iron or any other suitable metal. The
          antenna is insulated from the metallic covering or casing by
          means of insulation 22. It will thus be seen that while the
          antenna is buried in the earth it is completely insulated
          therefrom and from the metallic covering or casing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The receiving instruments
          shown in Fig. 1 are associated with the antenna by means of an
          inductive coupling comprising windings 23 and 24 of a
          transformer, but may be associated therewith in any other
          suitable manner. The other terminal of winding 24 of the
          coupling is connected to ground at 25.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment of the
          invention shown in Fig. 2 the ground connection is replaced by
          a second antenna 20’ extending in a direction different from
          the direction of antenna 20, the signal instruments being
          connected between the antenna as indicated by the windings 24
          of the indirect coupling, In this figure also is shown the
          arrangements by which the signal instruments are located in
          the chamber 26 below the surface of the earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment of the
          invention shown in Figure 3, a single antenna is employed and
          is shown extending horizontally substantially parallel with
          the surface of the earth and with the inclosing metallic
          covering or casing resting upon the surface of the earth,
          which latter is indicated at 27.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 4 shows an arrangement
          similar to Fig. 3 but with the employment of a second antenna
          20’ in place of the ground connection shown in Fig. 3.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 5 shows an arrangement
          similar to Fig. 4, but with the antennae slightly elevated
          above the surface of the earth by means of struts or pins 28.
          Thus while the antenna extend substantially parallel with the
          surface of the earth, the metallic covering or casing is not
          in direct contact with the earth but is separated therefrom by
          a short space. It may or may not be insulated from the earth
          according to the material of which the struts or pins 28 are
          made that is whether they are made of conducting or of
          non-conducting material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fig. 6 shows the employment
          of two antennae submerged beneath the surface of the earth
          where there is water, the water being indicated at 29. Here
          the metallic covering or casing is in contact with the water,
          but the antennae and their connecting circuits are insulated
          from the water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be understood that
          while I have shown and described arrangements embodying my
          invention in which one antenna and also two antennae are
          employed, any desired number may be used, and it is desirable
          to have them extend in the proper direction to obtain the
          maximum effect both in sending and receiving of
          electromagnetic waves. For this purpose a number of antennae
          may be employed radiating in different directions from the
          instruments, and suitable switching mechanisms may be provided
          for connecting any one or more of the antennae to the signal
          instruments. Such an arrangement is shown and described in US
          Patent 1,322,622, dated Nov. 25, 1919, issued jointly to
          myself and Henry H. Lyon, to which reference is made for
          further details.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been stated that the
          invention is applicable to the surface of the earth by means
          of struts or pins 28. Thus while the antennae extend
          substantially parallel to the surface of the earth where there
          is water, one such application being illustrated in Fig. 6. It
          will be understood also that the invention is also applicable
          to ships at sea, but as the employment of my new antenna in
          such connection is obvious it is thought that illustration is
          unnecessary.</font> </p>
