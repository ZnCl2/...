      <p><b>Sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation</b>,
        or <b>SASER</b>, is the acoustic analog of a laser. Instead of
        a feedback-built potent wave of electromagnetic radiation, a
        saser would deliver a potent ultrasound wave. </p>
      <p>The concept has been around for years and several labs have
        implemented models with differing features. In a new version,
        undertaken by scientists from the University of Nottingham
        (Anthony Kent, anthony.kent@nottingham.ac.uk) in the U.K. and
        the Lashkarev Institute of Semiconductor Physics in Ukraine, the
        gain medium -- that is, the medium where the amplification takes
        place -- consists of stacks (or a superlattice) of thin layers
        of semiconductors which together form "quantum wells." </p>
      <p>In these wells, really just carefully confined planar regions,
        electrons can be excited by parcels of ultrasound, which
        typically possess millielectronvolts of energy, equivalent to a
        frequency of 0.1-1 terahertz. And just as coherent light can
        build up in a laser by the concerted, stimulated emission of
        light from a lot of atoms, so in a saser coherent sound can
        build up by the concerted emission of phonons from a lot of
        quantum wells in the superlattice. </p>
      <p>In lasers the light buildup is maintained by a reflective
        optical cavity. In the U.K.-Ukraine saser, the acoustic buildup
        is maintained by an artful spacing of the lattice layer
        thicknesses in such a way that the layers act as an acoustic
        mirror. </p>
      <p>Eventually the sound wave emerges from the device at a narrow
        angular range, as do laser pulses. The monoenergetic nature of
        the acoustic emission, however, has not yet been fully probed.
        The researchers believe their saser is the first to reach the
        terahertz frequency range while using also modest electrical
        power input. Terahertz coherent sound is itself a relatively new
        field of research. Essentially ultrasound with wavelengths
        measured in nanometers, terahertz acoustical devices might be
        used in modulating light waves in optoelectronic devices. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A sound wave of a particular frequency
        and travelling in a particular direction is amplified by causing
        it to interact with a high-amplitude standing wave of the same
        frequency, but oscillating in a different direction to the sound
        wave. The standing wave (pump mode) is set up in a suitable
        medium, e.g. a liquid alcohol such as ethanol, between acoustic
        mirrors 1. The sound wave to be amplified (sasing mode) enters
        the medium through partly-transparent mirrors 2. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">SASER</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A SASER operates on principles remarkably similar to those of a
        laser. A stack of thin semiconductor wafers are placed in a
        lattice within an acoustically reflective chamber. Upon the
        addition of electrons, short-wavelength (in the terahertz range)
        phonons are produced. Since the electrons are confined to the
        quantum wells existing within the lattice, the transmission of
        their energy depends upon the phonons they generate. As these
        phonons strike other layers in the lattice, they excite
        electrons, which produce further phonons, which go on to excite
        more electrons, and so on. Eventually, a very narrow beam of
        high-frequency ultrasound exits the device. </p>
      <p><b>Uses</b> </p>
      <p>Apart from allowing the investigation of terahertz-frequency
        ultrasound, the SASER is also likely to find a myriad of uses in
        optoelectronics, as a method of signal modulation and/or
        transmission. [1] </p>

      <p>A theoretical scheme of a saser (Sound Amplification by
        Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is proposed. A liquid with gas
        bubbles is used as the active medium. Pumping is performed with
        an alternating electric field or mechanical vibrations of the
        resonator. Phase bunching of initially incoherent radiators
        (bubbles) occurs under the action of acoustic radiation forces.
        The proposed scheme is similar to that of a free-electron laser.
        Two models of an active medium are studied. In the first model
        it is assumed that all bubbles have the same radius. In the
        second model a continuous distribution of bubble radii is
        studied. The starting values for sasers with square and
        cylindrical resonators are calculated. It is shown that in all
        cases studied these conditions are identical, to within a
        numerical factor. The operation of a saser in a nonlinear regime
        and the directional pattern of a saser in the saturation regime
        are studied. </p>

      <p>Use your imagination. You can make somebody miles away hear,
        what you want to say. And probably only he hears the sound "in
        his head" and nobody else near him. <br>
        And you could brake walls, resonating at the right spots with a
        right rythm/amplitude(/wave shape) - from a distance. It can be
        also very harmful to the people. </p>
      <p>And maybe with that principle you can transmit some quantity of
        energy through the air. Ad more: think of leaver and ultrasonic
        technology. If they can break stones inside the soft tissue,
        maybe they could cause changes on a microlevels of matter being.
        Let's say melt a metal without heating it then mixed it with
        some liquid. And break stone or ice in the mountains, on a safe
        distance. Clean work, cheap too. Very harmful. </p>
      <p>And the new era of discoteques... where each wisitor would hear
        different music, according to his coordinates/position in the
        room. The name could be Music on the spot or something. <br>
        Anyway, there's an interesting stuff on a google video named
        Cymatics soundscape. There you can see, what soud does to
        matter. </p>
      <p>Or better, you see a dance of creative sound and willing
        matter. </p>

      <p>The paper is devoted to one of approaches to the solution of
        so-called problem of ``Acoustical Laser'' (acoustical analogy of
        laser system). In this connection primary attention is focused
        on the heterogeneous structure of reactive liquids containing
        macroinhomoheneities which can be a main reason of arising such
        known phenomena as bubbly detonation and explosion of a
        combustible liquids stored under pressure in containers when
        they are suddenly depressurized. </p>
      <p>One can mention about some analogies of LASER/SASER systems :
        1. adiabatic explosion of gas mixture into the bubbles (hot-spot
        system formation) of reactive bubbly system can be considered as
        a physical analogy of pumping process of laser system; 2. an
        energy release during the process of wave propagation above the
        hot-spot system and its amplification is an analogy of ``forced
        radiation'' effect. Statement features of numerical study
        presented consist in that a wave process development both in
        passive and reactive bubbly systems as a set of layers is
        considered when boundary as well as physical conditions can be
        changed for the certain instants of time according to the given
        program. In particular the model allows a reactive gas mixture
        to be reconstracted after an igniting detonation behind the wave
        passed. The calculations have shown that in such kind systems a
        pressure can be ``pumped'' up to a rather high level. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- We describe an electrically pumped sound
        amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASER) device
        for terahertz frequencies. The gain medium of the device is a
        weakly coupled AlAs/GaAs superlattice (SL). It is incorporated
        into a multimode acoustic cavity formed between the top (free)
        surface of the structure and a second SL acting as a phonon
        reflector. We report measurements on a prototype device using
        bolometers to detect the emitted phonons. An enhancement of the
        phonon emission parallel to the SL growth direction is observed
        when the energy drop per period of the gain SL matched the
        cavity phonon energy. This was accompanied by a small increase
        in device current. We argue that these results provide evidence
        that the device is operating as a SASER. (© 2004 WILEY-VCH

      <p><b>Summary</b>: Musical sands, as well as common materials such
        as silica gel, emit inordinately intense audible sounds when
        sheared by wind, waves or other mechanical means. Hand shaken
        laboratory size samples of these materials produce very coherent
        beat-like signals, when displayed on an oscilloscope. Frequency
        parameters of these patterns have been related to particle size,
        and, more surprisingly perhaps, to sand sample size. By
        combining these two relationships, a simple method for creating
        a source of single frequency sound has been developed. It
        consists of filtering musical sands into narrow size fractions
        and then tailoring an appropriate size distribution which can be
        finely tuned to any given frequency within the frequency range
        defined by the whole sample. Thus, the principles for developing
        an active device that converts input mechanical energy into a
        narrow intense beam of coherent audible sound have been
        established </p>
