      <big> <br>
        Dr Hugh Franklin has a "cow" in his backyard that can eat 1123
        lbs of fodder and yield 40 quarts of milk -- every hour. What's
        more, the milk that it gives is homogenized.<br>
        <br>
        But the "cow" doesn't look anything like a cow -- because it's
        not a real cow. it's a mechanical one that Dr Franklin, a
        chemical engineer of London, built after 8 years of experiments
        at a cost of $8500 in second-hand parts, and it may literally be
        a life-saver for any countries where weeds are plentiful but
        cows are scarce.<br>
        <br>
        The mechanical cow is about 5 times as efficient as the genuine
        animal when it comes to making milk.<br>
        <br>
        "Real cows can only get about 4 lbs of protein out of 100 lbs of
        fodder", Dr Franklin said when interviewed by an ENQUIRER
        reporter. "Our process yields 20 lbs".<br>
        <br>
        Dr Franklin has spent most of his working life developing
        processes for the food industries. he describes himself as "a
        bit of an inventor".<br>
        <br>
        He was led to invent the mechanical cow by a visit to a British
        agricultural experiment station where scientists had been
        working for 15 years on the problem of producing a solid protein
        that could be eaten in underdeveloped parts of the world.<br>
        <br>
        Protein is the scarcest of the food components that are vital to
        a nourishing diet. In those parts of the world where the
        population os chronically undernourished, shortage of protein in
        the diet usually is the cause.<br>
        <br>
        Several artificial proteins have been developed, but their
        strange taste and texture have kept them from becoming popular
        among those who need them.<br>
        <br>
        "The scientist at the experimental station were interested in
        getting solid protein", Dr Franklin said. "I decided to take it
        a step further and get milk".<br>
        <br>
        This involved studying how the cow gets it. Dr Franklin's method
        closely resembles that of the cows.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike the horns-hoof-and-hide variety, Dr Franklin's "cow" is
        anything but a fussy eater. "We use any domestic vegetable
        waste. Brussel sprout trimmings, cauliflower leaves, cabbage,
        spinach, beet tops -- anything handy. I am using sugar cane
        leaf, ferns, herbs and plants. And grass, too".<br>
        <br>
        The raw material first goes into a shreddeer that grinds it a
        good deal finer than the cows' jaws do. "You feed in the raw
        material at the top, and out of the bottom comes a pourable
        pulp", Dr Franklin said.<br>
        <br>
        "The pulp then goes into a centrifuge -- a sort of giant
        spin-dryer -- that whirls at 800 rpm. We then end up with a tank
        full of green juice.<br>
        <br>
        "This green juice then goes to a machine that extracts the gummy
        matter.<br>
        <br>
        "After that comes another, smaller centrifuge that takes out
        more particles and leaves a clear juice.<br>
        <br>
        Now comes the trickiest part of the process.<br>
        <br>
        The clear juice is finally passed to a device called an
        "electro-dialyzer", a stack of plastic frames containing
        stainless steel filters and electrical terminals.<br>
        <br>
        When an electric current is passed through the juice, any plant
        poisons colelct at the terminals. Different plants have
        different poisons and the material of which the electrodes are
        made has to be changed depending upon what poison is to be
        extracted.<br>
        <br>
        "What comes out of the electro-dialysis is a pure, colorless
        liquid with a bit of a head on it, due to the gases released by
        the electric current.<br>
        <br>
        This then passes to the protein-collecting tank, where the
        protein quickly sinks to the bottom. It is almost white. We
        collect it together with a measured amount of the fluid. We add
        some oil and unrefined sugar -- to keep the milk nice and white
        -- heat it up to homogenize it ... and it's milk".<br>
        <br>
        Soya and sunflower seed oil are the oils Dr Franklin generally
        adds. The mechanical "cow" also can digest cotton seeds,
        soybeans, cashews, or other oily nuts and seeds added to the
        shredder at the beginning of the process. Since these are all
        vegetable oils, the milk forms no cholesterol in the drinkers'
        blood, as animal fats do.<br>
        <br>
        Mexico and Chile, where there is not enough milk to meet the
        needs of the population, have expressed interest in Dr
        Franklin's invention, but the one country that already is
        importing the milk is Sweden, where there is no shortage of
        dairy products.<br>
        <br>
        "There is a dietary angle to this, too", Dr Franklin pointed out
        to The ENQUIRER. "In Sweden the milk is used by vegetarians and
        by those people -- about 1 in 1000 -- who are allergic to cow's
        milk.<br>
        <br>
        "We're also finding that hospitals want it for infant feeding.
        it is used for a condition called galactosemia, in which the
        infant can't keep down cow's milk or its own mother's milk".<br>
        <br>
        The only thing that plant milk doesn't have that is found in
        cow's milk is lactose, or milk sugar.<br>
        <br>
        "I don't think lactose is very important", says Dr Franklin. "It
        can be fatal for some infants. Cow's milk, after all, is made
        for calves. Ours is made for humans".<br>
        <br>
        Although he could not comment on plant milk itself, since he did
        not have a complete analysis of it, Dr W.F. Shipe, Prof. of Food
        Science at the New York State College of Agriculture, Cornell
        University, pointed out that it is not too difficult to make
        various combinations of ingredients that roughly resemble milk.<br>
        <br>
        Most of these, he said, are laboratory curiosities.<br>
        <br>
        Whether or not they will provide the same nourishment as cow's
        milk is the question.<br>
        <br>
        "It all depends upon whether the protein is in a form that's
        usable by humans". Dr Shipe said.<br>
        <br>
        "Alfalfa, for example, is high in protein, but the protein is
        not in a form that we can make use of. The same is true of
        fingernails.<br>
        <br>
        "The fingernails are almost pure protein, but biting your nails
        is no way to get nourishment".<br>
        <br>
        The man who sparked Dr Franklin's interest in the problem of
        providing protein for the underfed areas of the world is one of
        the world's leading reserachers in protein production: Dr N.W.
        Pririe, of the British government's Rothamsted Experimental
        Station.<br>
        <br>
        Queried by The ENQUIRER, Dr Pririe gave his approval, with a
        reservation.<br>
        <br>
        "Plant milk is in a form that is safe and usable for humans", he
        decalred, "but it has only about 75% of the nourishment of
        ordinary cow's milk".<br>
        <br>
        The inventor drinks it himself, almost exclusively, and claims
        that he has served it to friends, in tea. "They all seem to like
        it".<br>
        <br>
        This reporter asked Dr Franklin whether the mechanical cow also
        produced any usable side product similar to animal-produced
        fertilizer.<br>
        <br>
        "Certainly", said Dr Franklin. "We use the residue from the milk
        process as a fertilizer".<br>

        <br>
        In preparing a milk substitute, non-woody plant material, e.g
        cabbage leaves, is macerated, with water if necessary, and the
        resultant pulp filtered, preferably after agitation with
        decolourizing carbon, to produce a filtrate from which the
        protein is precipitated, e.g. by heating to 55 to 90 C., and
        decanted or centrifuged out to yield a slurry which is converted
        to a colloidal dispersion, e.g. using a colloid mill. The
        colloidal dispersion, which may also be prepared by vacuum
        evaporating the filtrate at or below 30 DEG C., is then blended
        with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat, e.g. maize oil,
        containing 2 to 5% by weight, of fat, a small amount of soya
        lecithin as emulsifier, and, if desired 3 to 5% of unrefined
        sugar, to produce an emulsion, preferably of droplet size 5 to
        20 m , to which further additions, e.g. of vitamins and/or
        mineral supplements, may be made. The milk-substitute emulsion
        may be dried, condensed or converted to cheese or yogurt. A
        modification of the process comprises adding live yeast to the
        precipitated and separated protein slurry, autolysing, e.g. at
        50 to 55 C. for 24 hours, separating the liquid (now containing
        hydrolysed protein) from the resultant mixture, adding to this
        liquid an amount of separated protein substantially equal to the
        hydrolysed protein it contains, and then blending the resultant
        suspension with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat.<br>
        <br>
        The invention relates to a vegetable based milk substitute and
        to a process for its production.<br>
        <br>
        The process of the present invnetion for the production of the
        vegetable based milk, hereinafter referred to as "milk",
        comprises macerating non-woody plant material, filtering the
        resultant pulp, treating the filtrate to cause the protein
        therein to separate out, if necessary removing and supernatant
        mother liquor from the separated protein and converting the
        protein into a colloidal suspension, or alternatively heating
        the fitlrate to cause the protein to separate directly as a
        colloidal suspension in the mother liquor, and blending the
        protein with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat, if
        necessary adding natural sugar.<br>
        <br>
        It is preferred to use as the non-woody plant material the green
        parts of the plants, particularly the waste outside leaves of,
        for example, cabbage and brussel sprouts.<br>
        <br>
        After the plant material has been macerated with or without
        water, it is preferred to agitate the resulting pulp with a
        decolorizing agent, for example decolorizing carbon, before
        filtration in order to obtain a pale colored filtrate.<br>
        <br>
        Various methods can be used for causing the protein in the
        filtrate to separate out, the simplest method being to heat the
        filtrate up to a temperature of from 55 to 90 C., generally 75
        C, thereby causing the protein to floculate. The flocculated
        protein is then&nbsp; separated from the mother liquer by
        decantation or centrifuging and the resultant slurry is treated
        in, say, a colloid mill to obtain a colloidal suspension. In
        some cases, depending on the raw material used, thin-film
        evaporation can be used in place of bulk heating. A preferred
        method of separating out the protein consists in controlled
        removal of liquid from the filtrate by vacuum evaporation at a
        temperature not exceeding 30 C, to the point where the protein
        separates out as a colloidal suspension. This last method
        obviated the need for converting the separated protein into a
        colloidal suspension in a separate step.<br>
        <br>
        The colloidal suspension of plant protein produced is in a final
        stage blended with an aqueous emulsion of a vegetable fat, for
        example maize oil preferably containing from 2 to 5%
        advantageously 3% by weight of fat and a small amount of added
        unrefined sugar, for example 3 to 5% by weight. In addition
        there may be incorporated in the milk mineral and/or vitamin
        supplements. The milk produced in this way can then be
        pasteurized and bottled.<br>
        <br>
        The vegetable based milk substitute provided by the invnetion is
        also novel and is defined as a stable, completely homogeneous
        double emulsion of fine droplet size of (1) and assimilable
        aqueous colloidal suspension of plant protein in water and (2)
        an aqueous emulsion of vegetable fat with or without added
        unrefined sugar.<br>
        <br>
        The droplet size is preferably within the range of 5 to 20
        microns, conveniently 15 microns.<br>
        <br>
        The milk may also contain added vitamin and/or mineral
        supplements.<br>
        <br>
        The product of the invention is substantially identical in both
        taste and appearance to cows milk, being of good "palate" and
        creamy consistency.<br>
        <br>
        Using the methods conventionally employed in the dairy industry
        the milk provided by the invention can be converted into dried
        or condensed milk or cheese or yogurt.<br>
        <br>
        The invention is further illustrated by the following examples:<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"> EXAMPLE 1</span><br>
        <br>
        1 kg of brussels trimmings were macerated in a high-speed mincer
        together with 100 ml water to form a fine pulp.<br>
        <br>
        The pulp was agitated by recycling through a centrifugal pump
        for 45 minutes with 10 grams decolorizing carbon. Temperature 25
        C.<br>
        <br>
        The mass was then filtered through a leaf-filter, and the
        residue washed with 100 ml warm water ( 30 C ).<br>
        <br>
        The clear liquor, which was quite light in color ( not
        necessarily colorless) was then heated to a temperature of about
        65 C and the temperature very slowly raised from this point.
        Precipitation soon commenced and was complete within 5 minutes,
        the final temperature was in the region of 70 C.<br>
        <br>
        The precipitated curd quickly settled and the top liquor was
        separated by decantation. The top liquor ( usually treated with
        a further 0.2% of its volume of decolorizing carbon to remove
        any residual odors) was vacuum concentrated to reclaim the
        carbohydrate of the leaf and contained a small proportion of
        sugars. Part of this was used in the final milk for the
        carbohydrate portion, usually about one-third.<br>
        <br>
        The settled curd was washed twice with hot water ( 70 C) and
        after settling the second time was put through a wet colloid
        mill fitted with fine-grained stones whereby the particle size
        of the curd suspension reached the order of 5 microns. 110 grams
        were obtained in this way.<br>
        <br>
        Meantime 10 gr maize oil ( or a 50:50 mixture of maize and soya
        oils) was homogenized with 50 mol hot water at 60 C) in a
        mechanical homogenizer. To the oil was added 2.5 gr soya
        lecithin as emulsifier, and to the water, 30 gr of a decolorized
        aqueous extraction of dates containing 5.3% of soluble solids.
        Commercially available date syrup was generally used. The final
        volume was 110 ml by topping up with water.<br>
        <br>
        The protein and oil fractions were finally mixed together
        without undue agitation (it is important not to whip a lot of
        air into the mixture) and the milk was ready for test. The milk
        may then be pasteurized at 75 C for 5 minutes followed by rapid
        chilling. The final quantity of milk os thus 220 ml.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 2</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Separated protein curd was formed as described in Example
        1.&nbsp; 100 parts of this protein are intimately mixed with 15
        parts of fresh pressed yeast together with sufficient water to
        produce a fluid mixture and the mixture autolyzed at 50 to 55 C
        for 24 hours. The autolysate is centrifuged and the clear liquor
        retained. This liquor now contains most of the original protein
        in the hydrolyzed form as solid amino acids. To this is now
        added an equal amount of pure unhydrolyzed plant protein, to
        produce a mixture containing both hydrolyzed and unhydrolyzed
        protein is finally emulsified with the requisite fat proportion
        as previously.<br>

        Clear leaf or plant juice is prepared as previously.
        Decolorization is made using an increase of 15% absorbent carbon
        to remove completely any residual vegetable flavors. The juice
        is filtered and the clear liquor evaporated under sufficient
        vacuum to a concentrate at a temperature not higher than 30 C.
        After evaporation to 5 or 6 % solids whereupon the liquid
        becomes opalescent (giving a good milk-like appearance) the
        resultant liquid then constitutes the protein base for the
        complete milk. Final additions are made as hitherto.<br>
