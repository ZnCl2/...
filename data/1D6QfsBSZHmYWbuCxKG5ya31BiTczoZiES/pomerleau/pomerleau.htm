        Hi, I have been in contact with Daniel Pomerleau twice and i
        have seen what he was doing (really amazing). The first time was
        in 1992 and during 3 hours i saw some unbeilievable things&nbsp;
        like open up a light bulb with only "one wire" and also running
        a 5 electric horse power motor connected only by 2 wires that he
        was holding in his hand. <br>
        I had a long talk with him and he was telling me that he does
        not know where his power come from. He told me that he stort to
        do that when he was a child. <br>
        He does demonstrations once in a while in the Montreal area. </p>

        Stefan, <br>
        The pictures that Bruce Perrault posted about Daniel Pomerleau's
        devices are real. It is not a "scam" because as i said in my
        last post, i was there in 1992 and i was there at is last
        demonstration 4 weeks ago. That guy is from Montreal area and is
        doing this since he is a child. He told me that what he is doing
        come "naturally". He also showed me how to build one of his
        device but i can't make it work. He did build a device with only
        a few wires in front of many people in about 5 minutes that can
        run a 5 horse power motor. And also like i said in my previous
        post he can power a 100 watts bulb with only "1 wire" (really
        amazing). <br>
        This is it.&nbsp;&nbsp; An again it is not a scam. <br>
        Regards,&nbsp; Joe </p>

        Hi Stefan and all, <br>
        I will go a little further with his history. Daniel,&nbsp;
        because of his unusual talent working with energy were
        asked&nbsp; for a demonstration of his power by "some people of
        the goverment" he has been kept in captivity for (i am not sure)
        over 2 months. They have conducted tests on him (really scarring
        things i have been told) and after that nobody heard of him for
        a long while. That was in the years 70's or 80's . Like i said
        he stort to do demonstration by 1992 and at every demonstration
        he was protected by people he could trust. Now today, when he
        decided to do a demo, nobody knows a week before because even
        today "they are on his feet all the time and they don't want him
        to show his devices and especially to show people how to tap
        free energy. <br>
        As you all know " the black power" is still really present and
        they want us to use their oil instead of clean energy. <br>
        And yes he has filmed his devices in mouvement but he has not
        released it yet. <br>
        Stefan, about the diagrams, there are no diagrams. The only
        thing you can see on the plexiglass is a couple feet of wires
        may be 26 to 30 gauge rolled around a little clear plastic spool
        and a little switch and some others copper bolts to hold the
        spools. The plexiglass he is using for every demos are about 1
        foot square The beginning of the wires are left in air and the
        other and are attached to the bulb or the motor or the little
        race car toy that he use for his demos that is about it. That
        guy does&nbsp; i tell you again really unuseal things. I know it
        is hard to believe but for example when he is demontrate free
        energy on certains machine like bulbs, motors. ect. he always
        use plexiglass so you can not doubt it. And you can take the
        plexiglass and work with it. Last time they were electric
        engineers and electronic specialists at the demo and i can tell
        you they were pulling their hairs!!!! <br>
        Imagine open up a light bulb with only one wire! So, as he said
        to me if you want to built these devices you have to have
        "faith" and if you think to much with your head it will never
        work. He also said that you have to feel the energy deep inside.
        As soon as you know how to keep it inside then you are on the
        good track. One engineers try to start a motor by touching some
        wires on the plexiglass devices like Daniel is doing and could
        not do it&nbsp; and Daniel said&nbsp; if you could think with
        your heart then the motor would start. <br>
        So i don't know when the next demo will be hold. He does a few
        each year in the Montreal area. <br>
        Regards&nbsp; Joe </p>

        Hello All, This guy Daniel is for REAL. I have seen it with my
        own 2 eyes. <br>
        His feats were so amazing that someone asked him during question
        period weather or not he was an alien. <br>
        Also 1/2 the room was filled by people who worked with or had
        degrees in electricity so he chose the worst possible audience
        for trickery. Also he passed his modules around and everybody
        could test things with their own hands. The demonstration lasted
        over 4 hours and it was non stop amazement for all. <br>
        He asked people to bring in electrical appliances before the
        meeting. Some people brought it radios and other small
        appliances and he powered all of them with his module. Now
        before this part someone in class that was impressed went out
        next door and bought a brand new 120 volt electric saw. Daniel
        plugged it in to his module and boom
        rrrrrrrrzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. <br>
        At the end of the four hours the group was in a state of trance
        ... sort of like a religious experience and we literally broke
        out into the entire group singing. Daniel passed around his
        electric utility bill and it showed the minimum payment possible
        for the period. Believe it or not you are still charged monthly
        minimum connection fees. He used the device to power his entire
        apartment. During the famous winter ice storm everyone in his
        block apartment building was freezing and he was enjoying life
        as if nothing happened in his apartment. He also stated that he
        was working on an electric vehicle to be powered entirely by his
        device and he may demonstrate this at his next meeting. <br>
        Understandably Daniel is paranoic ... he was actually locked up
        for about 13 years in a mental institution where he was exposed
        to electric shock treatments and other cruel treatments to cure
        him of his " disease ". </p>

        Did the device still produce output, when you had it in your
        hands ? <br>
        yes <br>
        What did it power ? a lamp ? <br>
        we could turn the small light bulbs or propellers on and off ...
        he also showed normal boom box radios (not crystal radios)
        working without batteries he demonstrated a small electric car
        working with no batteries that he let roll across the room </p>

        @nikola_tesla <br>
        When did you see it ? During the last week ? <br>
        months ago ... I know someone with a electrical degree that saw
        him about 10 years ago and same amazement <br>
        Did he say, if these wires were normal copper wires ? <br>
        yes <br>
        Did it only work, when he was present ? <br>
        NO ... if anyone took the module it would work forever to power
        anything <br>
        Maybe some batteries were hidden in the small motors ? <br>
        the person I went with brought a volt meter and was in front of
        the class taking measurements as he saw fit to try to disprove
        what we were all seeing <br>
        Could you connect your own loads without his load ? <br>
        as this would be the only source, where he could have hidden his
        batteries, righ? ? ( if it would be&nbsp; scam...) <br>
        Forget scam ... I couldn't sleep well for weeks after I
        witnessed this ... this is how I explain it to myself <br>
        he is somehow able to see or feel electrical forces in the
        atmosphere and build his modules to tap into it ...&nbsp; it is
        probably like a dog can hear sounds humans can't that sort of
        thing ... the speaker who would&nbsp; speak for Daniel during
        the demonstration said that Daniel is constantly amazed that we
        can not duplicate what he can do without effort. The presenter
        mentioned that he believes that the government sets up fake
        institutions to help autistic or gifted people like Daniel only
        to make them disappear if they believe they can duplicate what
        Daniel can do. </p>

        Like the most famous person on earth once said " Blessed are
        those who believe without seeing ". <br>
        The presenter has said that if you have the plans to the device
        to " kick start it " you need to use your faith. <br>
        So Daniel seems to be able to feel or see the energy/electric
        fields and then to somehow use his will to unleash the power
        flow. Once it has been kick started it works forever after that.
        the device can power anything with 110 volts and 75
        amperes&nbsp; OR 220 volts and 75 amperes if I remember
        correctly. <br>
        In one demonstration he lit a 200 watt bulb with it and then
        asked if anyone was a smoker and to come up in front of the
        class with a cigarette ... he asked the smoker to lit up the
        cigarette by putting it between the end of the light bulb and
        his connector and it produced the fire for his cigarette. </p>

        The small wires shown in the uploaded pictures should glow if 8

        Hi guys, You have to understand that Daniel uses Wires for
        demonstrations but as he told us, he does not need any wires to
        conduct electricity to his devices. Simply by aiming his mind to
        whatever he wants to play with or to light a lamp or to run a
        motor he can do it. He can make a little car run just by his
        thought. I have seen it!&nbsp; Not bad for an autistic! <br>

        So can he just power a 200 Watts bulb just with his loose wired
        coils ? <br>
        if he really could get Kilowatts out, then the possibility of
        fraud is not very possible... </p>

        he used one of his modules to light a single 200 Watt bulb and
        then someone from the audience lit his cigarette by putting it
        between the wire and the end of the bulb...&nbsp; another minor
        note when he powered the bulbs using the Hydro Electric outlet
        it was dimmer&nbsp; and more yellow that when he powered it with

        Hi again, <br>
        I understand people who does not believe in that kind of
        demonstration and i agree it is unbelievable until you have it
        right in front of you and also when he (Danniel) want you to be
        part of the experience. What he is trying to do is to transmit a
        little bit of himself to people who wants to learn a totally new
        way of manifesting the pure energy. I was there in 1992 for his
        demo and&nbsp; i was there a few month ago and he does try to
        make understand how to do it. But we are somehow not ready for
        this and it makes him sad. <br>
        He is a hundred years ahead of our time. Just like Mr. Tesla
        was.&nbsp; But may be in a near future we will see some of his
        modules coming on a market (as a toy) so the black power will
        not be threatened. </p>

        He did run a 3 h.p. motor and a 500 watts street lamp. He also
        runned an electric drill. But i do remember that when he plugged
        the big 500 watts&nbsp; lamp to his module he could not let the
        lamp run to long because (may be 2 minutes) he said at that time
        that he could not control all the energy and his module was
        starting to heat. <br>
        And the module he had for that demos was made of couples little
        coils may be 2" high by 2" wide and the wire for the coil were
        around 28 or 30 gauge and may be higher. <br>
        Also he could control a toy helicopter without wire. He was
        using a little jar with (don't laugh to this one it is true)
        strawberry jam in it and a little crank on top of the lid to
        control the helicopter. Remember this guy is autistic and he
        still have a young kids heart.&nbsp; Anyway this it. <br>

        interesting ... in my conference he also did not let the fairly
        big electric saw run for too long ... he simply let it run maybe
        20-30 seconds put it off and waited for the applause to settle
        before continuing ... <br>
        humm this would explain why he actually used the grid socket to
        power the video camera ... <br>
        he filmed the whole thing for his entertainment ... he would get
        a laugh out of seeing everybody&nbsp; freak out at his
        demonstrations. </p>

        Could it be, that he has hidden batteries in his 3 HP motor and
        in his 500 Watts lamp and the external coils are just only the
        shortcuts to do the contacts from the <br>
        internal batteries to the load ? So that the external coils just
        only connect the internal hidden batteries to the other pole of
        the pole ? <br>
        Then it would look like the coils would power the loads. but
        actually they would only conduct the current from the internal
        hidden batteries to the pole <br>
        of the load... Could this be or were the lamp and the 3 HP motor
        so small,&nbsp; that bigger batteries could not have been hidden
        there ? <br>
        No because all the appliances were brought in by total strangers
        and they were all powered up. <br>
        Are these videos somewhere available to order ? <br>
        He claims he would be killed if he released any plans, photos
        and videos ... so not that I know of. <br>
        I find it very curious that photos are available ... I brought
        my digital camera and I personally asked him and he declined
        permission. <br>
        Stefan also it should be noted that the people present were all
        invited informally via friends who heard of his feats ... <br>
        he doesn't advertise anywhere except via word of mouth ... for
        example I would bring at least 2 - 3 friends <br>
        next time ... also after the 4 hour long demonstration we were
        invited to go have supper with him and ask&nbsp; him any
        questions or just talk about anything. </p>

        So many appliances were brought by the visitors ? Could it be,
        that these were his friends and were already modified to contain
        batteries ? <br>
        If not, did he himself only bring in his coil-setup in a
        plexiglas stand, so one could not hide any batteries? <br>
        Maybe he has himself a real powerful psychokinesis, so he can
        direct electrical energy via his mind into these <br>
        coil spools ? </p>

        IMPOSSIBLE ... I personally knew one of them. <br>
        If not, did he himself only bring in his coil-setup in a
        plexiglas stand, so one could not hide any batteries? <br>
        YES ... he used to put his coils on wood many years ago and
        people have accused him of hiding <br>
        batteries in the wood so he changed to plexiglass <br>
        Maybe he has himself a real powerful psychokinesis, so he can
        direct electrical energy via his mind into these coil spools ? <br>
        YES this is a possibility ... I could go on telling you all
        other things he claims to be able to do <br>
        but you would NEVER believe it unless you saw what I saw. </p>

        You are right Nikolas he is mistrustfull, he trusts women more
        than men. At one of his demo i was with my girl friend and after
        we gathered and he passed almost the rest of the afternoon
        talking with her. He feel confident with women cause he did not
        have a good&nbsp; experience with men since they locked him up
        and gave him bad treatments like electro-shocks, ect.&nbsp; He
        said that women would learn how to work with energy faster than
        men because they are more sensitive. <br>
        Now,&nbsp; again this guy does not cheat how can you hide a big
        battery under a vest to run a motor, lamp or little race car (i
        don't think AC battery does exist anyway). This guy is humble
        and he is still a kid in his heart and for him since he is young
        he would like to help this world. And i hope in a near future he
        will be able to walk into Montreal or any other places without
        having a gun pointing at him. Yes he has been shot at while he
        was in a car near Montreal but he was not hurt. Like Nikolas
        said: It not easy communicating with him cause he is autistic
        and also because he has to hide himself all the time. Dr Robert
        Adams from New Zealand who invented the free energy
        motor-generator also had his life Threatened because he wanted
        to helped this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad,sad,sad world... </p>

        Hi all,&nbsp; I did some research on psi phenomenons. What I
        have found is not directly related to free energy but is so
        amazing that I have to post it: <br>

        Hi Markus, <br>
        Thanks for you link. I looked at some videos very quickly and
        they look like cheap tricks to be honest with you. <br>
        Daniel is way above anything they had on video. <br>
        Daniel drew an an electric circuit in 5 seconds on a plain piece
        of paper using a simple pen and made it work in front of my eyes
        and ears. </p>

        sort of ... he demonstrated in front of the class that he could
        cause a radio to make distorting sounds when he rubbed the
        circuit drawn on a piece of paper ... he claimed that he is able
        to draw a cell phone&nbsp; on paper and use it to make REAL
        calls ... sounds crazy but after seeing his demonstrations live
        you would&nbsp; be its possible for him. </p>

        incredible stuff ... sounds crazy unless you witness such things
        there is no way people can believe it ... when he was making
        distortion sounds he was doing it 4 feet from my eyes and I was
        focusing on his fingers and they moved in PERFECT syncronization
        with the distortion made on the radio ... it was claimed that he
        can speak into the paper and make his voice come out of the
        radio speakers amongst other claims ... when asked why he didn't
        do it we were told that in the past he has been attacked by
        people who flipped out seeing such things believing he was using
        the devil or something to do it. </p>

        I have looked at various pictures of his wires stuff. <br>
        First question if there was a witness : <br>
        The easiest one has 1 wire connected between the batteriers to
        the motor, and the second wire has a spiral and is wireless :
        Did the motor run this way ? Or was it just to show it's not
        working with a battery ? <br>
        Quick guess, isn't it possible to transmitt electricity to the
        wires through induction ? Or through hertzian waves which
        transmit electricity too (like watching TV through antenna, not
        by cable) ? <br>
        May be the wires are tuned to receive hertzian waves and its
        electricity, or there is some kind of induction (maybe an
        inductive hoven) to transmit the electricity. <br>
        I'm not trying to debunk Daniel, but perhaps can he feel those
        waves and yet tune his wires accordingly. </p>

        Of course it would be possible. You could also use a
        Tesla-Transformer to do that. <br>
        But to get a 120V chainsaw to work as shown in one of his
        demonstrations you need a lot of power. The television tower
        next to me has an output power of 500kW! If I would tune to one
        of his frequencies it would only be able to power a small
        lightbulb or sth. like that. <br>
        And remember one of his demonstrations had an audience full of
        electrical engineers. They would have recognized the fraud
        immediately. <br>
        Hope this helps. </p>

        Hello,&nbsp; I live near St-Bruno and i have seen Daniel
        Pomerleau twice ( by the way his name is not Pomerlou but
        Pomerleau) <br>
        The only thing i can say is: This guy does amazing things and
        for the skeptic guys well you have to be there to see what he
        can do with a coil of wires that power bulbs or a drill or other
        utilities that require higher power. This guy has not limits
        concerning the power he can created. </p>

        I saw Daniel Pomerleau demonstrates about 3 times now and I know
        personaly his "legal guardian" and family for many years... even
        them they still don't know how he really makes thoses. <br>
        (please forgive my english) <br>
        What to say... <br>
        1. He is a young child mind in a old body. <br>
        2. He can put is "will" or what ever you call that in object...
        <br>
        3. He can do every thing... but he mainly do "toys" that
        demonstrate free-energy. <br>
        4. Yon can't really talk to him... (mental age of a child) <br>
        5. Him self don't know "How" he do those thing. <br>
        6. His child spirit is obsessed to convince the world he's right
        (with free-energy) <br>
        7. I have test is devices with friends on 3 occasions (we are
        Mechanical and Electric Engineer and Technician) nothing mush to
        say... It work but we can't tell how... What we can tell : <br>
        a) Electricity seem "appear" sometime in a midle of a wire or a
        switch or a coil. <br>
        b) "NO" logic there (no 3d logic) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - exemple: no battrey, no coil, one switch,
        one wire, one little flashlight light, on a plestiglass. (please
        see pictures... link at the bottom of the page). <br>
        One side of wire was welded to the switch (only one side of the
        switch was used) the other side of the wire was welded to "only"
        one side of the flashlight light. <br>
        When the switch is at "on" position the motor run... when the
        switch is at "off" position the motor stop. The wire was about
        6" long (no plastic over) copper. <br>
        the electricity simply seem "appear" in the switch. nothing mush
        to say. <br>
        8. is projects are made with all kind off stuff (even noodles !)
        but maindly hand made coils. <br>
        9. In all is project, electricity was turn off if we take out a
        part of the whole. like a noodles. <br>
        10. Many Watt of power... <br>
        11. I brought my personal drill... I plug it to one of his
        device (PS he make all is devices on a plestiglass... no place
        to hide battery).. with two 100 Watts light bulb... the lights
        was "wery bright" and my drill to max speed (with some load)...
        <br>
        12. "His Electricity" is safe for human body. He put he tongue
        many time between the terminals... nothing happen... my drill +
        200 watts light was still runing. <br>
        13. I hate this kind of presentation. <br>
        14. It simply impossible to reproduce it. <br>
        this kind of "mental power" cannot be reproduced… and I don't
        even know if it is possible for someone to learn it... <br>
        please look those images... (Pictures and video are usally
        prohibite) : <br>

        Hello to all. <br>
        As I indicated I would be at the April 1st 2007 demonstration
        given by Mr. Daniel Pomerleau, and so I was. And truly, nothing
        could have prepared me for what I witnessed during this
        magnificent 3 hour presentation on self running electric
        systems. <br>
        I went in with my DC ammeter and my trusty compass to detect the
        slightest magnetic field and with a rampant determination to
        find the source of his trickery. Someone else came in with his
        magnetic field meter which was a very sophisticated hand held
        device that gives out accurate readings. Someone else had a
        regular volt meter. We were about 50 people in all. <br>
        What I should have had was a whole arsenal of instruments in a
        sealed room with capabilities to do hyper magnetic sensing,
        Kirilian photography, body scan and an endless host of other
        devices, but for what. What can we really understand from this
        child minded adult of 51 years, that does not have a culpable
        bone in his body, that sees only the good in his fellow man,
        that can't even understand what a joke is or what sarcasm is,
        and who, since age 12 was marveled by his inborn power to
        control electricity and to put electrical power into unplugged,
        unconnected electrical objects. <br>
        There is nothing on this earth that can prepare you for such an
        event, as simple as it was, as non glamorous as it was, as low
        key on the intellectual end as it was, as crude as it was
        because of those around him not having the polished academic
        words or gestures. Beyond all this external criteria that one
        with ample knowledge of the world and of its workings would
        expect, there was such a simple, honest and direct exposure of a
        power in man that we all have, but have lost to our other senses
        and our mind. There was also the open obvious fact that his
        surrounding help could never accumulate individually or as a
        group, enough technical and instrumental expertise to cause all
        these phenomena to happen using trickery. This is not a David
        Copperfield. This is straight forward, open, no tricks, amazing
        and worth seeing once in your life. <br>
        Mr. Pomerleau is an example of how humans could have evolved.
        But the way we live and think, it would be like if all humans
        weighed 1000 pounds each and he would be trying to show us how
        to high jump. We are so far into our minds, craving the
        concrete, looking for the obvious, that we will never be able to
        use his power for human kind. But that's OK. <br>
        Now don't get me wrong. He is not God, he is not a Messiah, he
        is not Allah or Jesus returned. He is just an autistic 51 year
        old adult with 40 years experience in child mind control over
        electric power. If we were in 1000 BC, we would probably make a
        huge statute of him and call him Daniel, the God of Electricity.
        One of his lines was, Man has discovered his science, but has
        neglected his conscience. <br>
        So what did I see, I'll save this for tomorrows post since I
        think until now, I still have to digest what I have witnessed.
        Now I'll go back to my mad scientists laboratory and continue
        tinkering with my next invention. Something we humans can use
        now, while I dream of the Pomerleau world of tomorrow were all
        will have enough, all the time. Oh yeh. <br>
        @NerzhDishual <br>
        No way. There is nothing under neath, over neath or even inside

        Hi Wattsup, many thanks for the first new report. <br>
        If he really puts his tongue between the the hot poles, then it
        is no DC but very high frequency AC = Radio Frequency&nbsp;
        power . <br>
        This should be able to being detected with small neon bulbs. <br>
        Did anybody take new pictures or videos at this event ? <br>
        How does he look alike ? <br>
        What age does he seem to be, if you say, he&nbsp; is still a
        child at 54 ? Is he like 10 years old or younger or older ? <br>
        Many thanks. <br>

        @all <br>
        Stefan asked me to make a review of my visit to Daniels'
        demonstration to follow-up on my first post of my visit there. <br>
        Well, you have seen all the photos of open coils,
        half-hazardously wound and connected with so many others, all
        mounted on Plexiglass to show there was&nbsp; nothing else
        connected, showing small dc motors turning small propellers. All
        in all the demonstration went through a myriad of these devices,
        all made in the same general method, no batteries, no exterior
        connections, no visible or measurable source of constant energy,
        but regardless, these devices turned on and off seemingly at the
        will of Daniel. <br>
        I was called to the front of the hall several times to measure
        amperage. Some readings were as follows; <br>
        Module #3: 8.6 vdc 2.3 amps <br>
        Module #6: 7.7 vdc 4.2 amps <br>
        Module #7: Started with mind control. I held the circuit in my
        hands while he turned it on and the although the on/off switch
        did not move. He did it from about 3 feet away with his hand
        held above our heads as if he was reaching into another
        dimension in space to control the switch. Very weird. <br>
        Module #9: 17 vdc 14.5 amps <br>
        Also, I held a small dc motor in my hand with just a small 3
        inch length of twisted wire leading from each motor terminal to
        nowhere. Just open circuit. He turned the motor on while it was
        in my hands. The motor had no obvious manipulation marks such as
        unbent and re bent end pins, etc. Right out of my hand. <br>
        I could go on and on since the demo lasted three hours. But in
        general, this is it. <br>
        He also powered a hand drill, radio and some other devices. <br>
        Module #10 was one of his larger devices in the same set-up was
        producing 185 volts and lit a 100 watt bulb. He also put his
        tongue on the leads and did not get a shock, plus he lit a
        cigarette with the leads sparking when held together like a
        spark gap. Amazing. <br>
        So that's it. I do not want to get more heavily involved in
        Daniels' feats of amazement since that is what they are and
        there is no point to pursue this since you or I will NEVER be
        able to take advantage of his gift. <br>
        One last thing. The whole event was video taped by a woman who
        was centrally installed on a higher table located in the back of
        the room. Her camera was pointed to Daniel filming the whole
        demo. I did not think to ask to view the video or inspect the
        video camera at the end of the demo and this, in my view, is the
        only piece left unturned. <br>
        The only possibility of trickery could be the video camera was
        not really a video camera but a static gun or beam of some type
        that is concentrated and always aimed at or around Daniel. Is it
        possible that a video camera could be faked to emit some type of
        beam that hits the Plexiglass and that induces an electrical
        current therein. This is the only question I have unanswered.
        Maybe a microwave gun. I am saying this because they said they
        always video tape the events but they offer no video for sale.
        So what's the point. <br>
        Anyways, I would forget this as there is no OU answer for
        humanity here. Only a quagmire and potential waste of time and
        energy although a very deep curiosity indeed. Something like
        seeing the Elastic Man or the Hairy Woman at any good circus. </p>

        I&nbsp; would love to see&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; in one of his&nbsp;
        demos. <br>
        It seems&nbsp;&nbsp; that this&nbsp; group has&nbsp; written him
        off as a waste of time , as a&nbsp;&nbsp;
        entertaining&nbsp;&nbsp; side show . <br>
        There is no&nbsp; OU here?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is

        The&nbsp; fact that you&nbsp; can't reproduce&nbsp; it&nbsp;
        means nothing. <br>
        What&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; shows people is&nbsp; simply another way
        of&nbsp; doing things. <br>
        I have&nbsp; read posts here that&nbsp; imply that&nbsp;&nbsp;
        EE&nbsp; education is&nbsp; a kind of brainwashing . I have to
        agree . <br>
        Daniel is&nbsp;&nbsp; simply a person that has not&nbsp;
        been&nbsp; brainwashed&nbsp; AT ALL. At least not as far as
        energy&nbsp; goes. <br>
        He&nbsp; tried to explain how it works <br>
        Do you know&nbsp; how to have faith ? <br>
        Do you know how observe&nbsp; something without&nbsp; using
        your&nbsp; head? <br>
        We are taught that intelectual&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking is the&nbsp;
        holy&nbsp; grail , the way to solve all problems . <br>
        It is not . <br>
        Tesla&nbsp;&nbsp; could&nbsp; see how&nbsp; things were going to
        work before he&nbsp; built them. <br>
        The man that Built&nbsp; Coral Castle; moved those&nbsp; huge
        stones with his mind. <br>
        Daniel&nbsp; can make&nbsp; things run . . <br>
        None of&nbsp; us&nbsp; have it all . <br>
        We all have our own limitations. <br>
        Daniels&nbsp; limitations are as clear as his&nbsp; powers;. <br>
        The&nbsp; question is what&nbsp; do we learn from him? <br>
        Personally&nbsp; I&nbsp; don't&nbsp; see humanity&nbsp; ever
        catching&nbsp; up with&nbsp; people like Tesla&nbsp; , as&nbsp;
        long&nbsp; as&nbsp; we stick mostly&nbsp; to the EE mentality. <br>
        Newton&nbsp; among&nbsp; others&nbsp;&nbsp; changed the&nbsp;
        world&nbsp;&nbsp; . <br>
        His&nbsp; findings&nbsp; have been taught&nbsp; as&nbsp;
        absolute&nbsp; fact&nbsp; for&nbsp; many years. <br>
        The&nbsp; universe that Newton&nbsp; showed us&nbsp; is a
        dead&nbsp; universe. <br>
        In Newtons&nbsp; universe even life itself&nbsp; is&nbsp;&nbsp;
        just&nbsp; a sting of mindless events&nbsp; unwinding. <br>
        The&nbsp; universe it NOT&nbsp; dead . <br>
        There is a non physical&nbsp; consciousness that is the basis
        for ALL physical things. <br>
        This consciousness in motion&nbsp; is&nbsp; the basis for&nbsp;
        what we call energy. <br>
        All&nbsp; physical matter is&nbsp; then&nbsp; created from this
        energy. <br>
        Another&nbsp;&nbsp; way to say this is&nbsp; ......&nbsp; there
        is nothing in&nbsp; the universe that is not&nbsp; God. <br>
        The&nbsp; way&nbsp; to&nbsp; get closer to&nbsp;
        understanding&nbsp; how Daniel does what he does is by&nbsp;
        accepting that&nbsp; life is more than we&nbsp; have been
        taught. <br>
        Much of what we have been taught&nbsp;&nbsp; in effect&nbsp;
        keeps us&nbsp; focused on our&nbsp; current limitations and the
        limitations of those&nbsp;&nbsp; that taught&nbsp; us. <br>
        People like&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; could be showing us&nbsp;&nbsp;
        how&nbsp; we ALL could live someday . <br>
        If&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; can&nbsp;&nbsp; manipulate energy&nbsp;
        ,&nbsp; others can learn to&nbsp; do it too. <br>
        Can I&nbsp; manipulate energy like&nbsp; Daniel ? <br>
        No <br>
        Like&nbsp; everyone&nbsp; else here I have&nbsp; to many
        limatations&nbsp;&nbsp; in that area . <br>
        I&nbsp; do understand&nbsp; what we&nbsp; said about
        needing&nbsp; faith. <br>
        I also understand&nbsp;&nbsp; what me meant&nbsp; when he said
        it wouldn't work if you think about it to much. <br>
        Would it&nbsp; help&nbsp; people&nbsp; understand&nbsp;
        what&nbsp; Daniel&nbsp; does by&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to&nbsp;
        replicate what he makes ? <br>
        No.&nbsp; His&nbsp; devices work because he&nbsp; chooses&nbsp;
        for them to work. <br>
        He&nbsp; could just as easly&nbsp; make&nbsp; things run with
        NO&nbsp; wires at all . <br>
        You&nbsp; could say&nbsp; that there is no&nbsp; possable&nbsp;
        OU to be found here. <br>
        You&nbsp; could also say that there is NOTHING&nbsp; but OU . <br>
        Tesla&nbsp;&nbsp; saw that&nbsp; we are living in an endless see
        of energy. He was&nbsp; blacklisted&nbsp;&nbsp; for trying
        to&nbsp; bring that&nbsp; reality to humanity . <br>
        The&nbsp; groups that&nbsp; blacklisted Tesla&nbsp;&nbsp;
        made&nbsp; a point&nbsp; to influence&nbsp;&nbsp; the
        academic&nbsp; world. OU concepts have been&nbsp; treated like
        a&nbsp; disease&nbsp; ever sense. <br>

        @one <br>
        I understand completely what you are saying. I had one of his DC
        motors in my hand connected to nothing and it was turning full
        speed. Daniel even shut it off from a distance of about 4 feet
        away from me, then turned it on again. <br>
        The guy is a charm of a nice young minded man. I cannot answer
        as to how he does it. I only know he is not allowed to divulge
        how he is doing it. It could be faith. <br>
        But my aim was to witness and report an event in the manner that
        we at OU would expect one to do so under given circumstances. No
        recorder, no video, no photo. Just meters and sketch pad. The
        bottom line is yes it is something remarkable, but so are many
        other guys doing tricks. It's always remarkable until you know
        how it works. At OU we "try" to keep a clear head and
        concentrate on the value this has for humanity. Him trying to
        show us or explain to us how it works, if it is in the realm of
        the supernatural phenomena, would be like trying to show an
        elephant how to fly. Pointless. So the value for OU in the world
        as far as I can ascertain at this stage is nil, zero. <br>
        With over 5 billion people on this rock, there is bound be be
        many aberrations and in my view Daniel is one of the top on the
        list. <br>
        If you are ever in the Montreal area, find out when the next
        demo is by contacting Mr. Pierre Fecteau at; <br>
        From: "Pierre Fecteau" &lt;pfecteau@sympatico.ca&gt; <br>
        I know there was one recently but I could not make it for that
        date. There will be others. </p>

        Does Daniel suffer any aftereffects from performing these demos,
        especially the higher-wattage ones?&nbsp; This might reveal
        whether he generates the energy (metabolism [1]) or channels or
        directs energy from the surroundings. If the energy is
        metabolic, it might make a really good way to burn off those
        excess calories.&nbsp; (1 kilowatt load = 0.239 large-calories
        per second)&nbsp; This would tend to make one really tired and
        hungry afterwards. If the energy is obtained from the thermal,
        zero-point, etc energy from the immediate surroundings, slight
        cooling of the demo area or other effects might show up.&nbsp;
        If the source is something non-local such as the power of
        Ulyaoth [2], heating of the demo area is likely. </p>
      <p>not_a_mib <br>
        I&nbsp; can only answer this&nbsp;&nbsp; from&nbsp; my
        understanding&nbsp; of&nbsp; what is&nbsp; going on. <br>
        The&nbsp; short&nbsp; answer is&nbsp; No&nbsp;&nbsp; he
        doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; have any&nbsp; afteraffects
        ......&nbsp;&nbsp; I am basing that on&nbsp; the fact that
        he&nbsp; has&nbsp; been able to do it&nbsp;&nbsp; sense he was a
        young child&nbsp; and&nbsp; still doesn't&nbsp; really&nbsp;
        understand&nbsp; HOW&nbsp; he does it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It is just&nbsp; something he can do .&nbsp; My&nbsp;
        closest&nbsp; experiences&nbsp; to what he&nbsp; does&nbsp;
        would&nbsp; be what I call lightwork .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Working&nbsp; directly&nbsp; with&nbsp; energy of the mind and
        higher mind. <br>
        When lightwork is done right&nbsp; , there is nothing&nbsp;
        physical about it at all . It is simply&nbsp;&nbsp; your
        physical mind&nbsp; interacting&nbsp; with&nbsp; what&nbsp;
        is&nbsp; sometimes called the aether. <br>
        Quote <br>
        1.&nbsp; Star Wars freaks will claim that mitochondrial activity
        generates the Force as well as converting ADP to ATP.&nbsp; (In
        best Yoda voice) "To the bulb light, you must feel the Force
        flowing through you!" <br>
        I&nbsp; think&nbsp; they used&nbsp; a&nbsp; similar name&nbsp;
        in starwars .......a mitocondrial is the actual&nbsp; part of
        the cell that&nbsp;&nbsp; stores&nbsp; energy . <br>
        The&nbsp; first&nbsp; 3 starwars movies&nbsp;&nbsp;
        were&nbsp;&nbsp; almost like a lightwork&nbsp; class
        .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much of what&nbsp; they&nbsp; said&nbsp;
        about the force is&nbsp; true for lightwork.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        last&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp; had almost nothing&nbsp; related to
        lightwork. <br>

        Regarding the 3 pdf files in French submitted by Scorpio. My
        understanding of french is poor, about 60%. These files seem to
        show an examination of the apparatus, but I don't See the name
        Pomerlou&nbsp; Actually mentioned. Also several of these
        circuits contain batteries, which is not in agreement with with
        witness accounts. The third file appears to reach the conclusion
        that the apparatus is a fraud, and contains hidden wires. Could
        someonewith good French confirm or deny what I have said. My
        knowledge of French is just what I picked up whilst working in
        Europe as a truck driver. </p>

        Hello, I have read these Article. <br>
        The first 2 documents, mean that 2 easiest devices were checked.
        <br>
        Have&nbsp; no Frauds to show, but that this does not correspond
        to the rules of physics, <br>
        a differently institute has probably looked so FRAUDS and claims
        to have <br>
        found concealed connections with MAGNIFYING GLASS (drawing! No
        photo!) <br>
        (I belive THIS PAPER IST THE onlyiest FRAUD!!) That people must
        not try longer <br>
        to experimenting , with this devices) <br>
        ONLY this is not right in my opinion, because Daniel used only
        single pol switch <br>
        &nbsp;and not like in the "proof" drawn 2 pol around switch </p>

        Hi all, I have one more old saved document about Daniel. Also in

        I read about Daniel some years ago. Did not realize he gave
        demonstrations. This shows me some credibility. I am showing my
        esoteric side but it would not be much of a supprise to me if it
        was his consciousness that energized his circuits. I suppose
        William Tiller would call it psychoenergetics:
        http://www.tillerfoundation.com <br>
        Princeton shows how consciousness effects their EGGs in a global
        way: http://noosphere.princeton.edu/ <br>
        Then you can take it a step further and take a look at the Isaac
        Drone information: http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/ There he
        gets into how they figured the alien antigravity devices worked
        by thought. The beings would merely focus their attention on the
        hieroglyphs on the machine and through some sort of exotic
        nanotech the machine would provide the correct response. <br>
        Although I would hate to see Daniel used as a lab rat but it
        would be interesting to know if he possess an advancement in his
        genes or perhaps he has a higher brain wave activity. Maybe a
        safer solution would be someone else using their own
        psychoenergetics to try to energise his circuits under a double
        blind system. <br>
        For someone to put together coils like that which respond to his
        thoughts perhaps it is like he is channeling with a higher
        entity or maybe a higher 'self' when he is building these
        circuits. <br>
        Anyway just some 'thoughts' as I find this stuff fascinating. I
        believe we may be heading down this path some day in the future.
        We are over due for a new paradym in my opinion. Smiley <br>
        Take care. <br>

        @hansvonliev. regarding your reference to the radionics box. As
        a kid I came from a poor family. I had a few books on radio from
        a junk shop. Buying components was beyond our means, and nobody
        had anything to throw away, so there was very little "Junk". I
        remember collecting a few bits and pieces and some wire, and
        connecting them in a sort of random circuit to see what would
        happen. Perhaps some of you did the same?&nbsp; If only we had
        had FAITH.. </p>

        <p><b>ANALYSIS OF DANIEL POMERLEAU DEVICES</b> </p>
        <p><b>Femi Fischer</b> <br>
          <b>( 2008 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This is a functional analysis of Daniel Pomerleau's devices.
        The author thinks that IF Pomerleau's devices work as stated,
        this could lead to new technologies. This document is public. </p>
      <p>The author thinks that substantially all the devices of Daniel
        Pomerleau can be understood in a more or less simple way. I will
        try to give answers to various question about Pomerleau's
        phenomenon. </p>
      <p>Q1) Where does the energy come from? <br>
        A1) The energy STARTS from Daniel himself. He produces
        biological Tesla coil effects. And, this is not the only case in
        the history: probably Testatika's Baumann too had some
        electrical powers (in a sense, EM experimentation for them could
        be easier). </p>
      <p>Q2) Why the energy remains in the system after Daniel energizes
        it? <br>
        A2) In nature exists an energy amplification mechanism that can
        'lock' the electromagnetic machine status after Pomerleau's
        'kickstart' (and it is an auto-igniting positive feedback, so it
        could be the cause of Daniel's powers too). More informations
        about this topic here. Baumann's Testatika used speculatively
        this mechanism to 'lock' the machine once started, and he found
        a way to 'kickstart' the RLC net when you turn the disks. </p>
      <p>Q3) How Daniel's devices work, then? <br>
        A3) We could see Daniel's devices as a random RLC topological
        net. In this random topological net, you can have energy
        reservoir effect and antenna effect. Where you have good antenna
        or cable impedance coupling you have good energy transfer to or
        from the system. </p>
      <p>Q4) What about the phsychic control? <br>
        A4) I can tell you that I have a tester and I can produce
        several millivolts simply moving about my tester. This is due to
        induction effects of the body which contains water and iron and
        more electromagnetic significant components. The body is
        constantly electromagnetically coupled to these devices (think
        about RF TX-RX) and every slight movement or electrical
        condition variation can influence the devices. </p>
      <p>Q5) How can I 'kickstart' those devices myself then? <br>
        A5) The system must be energized first to be locked after. The
        'kickstart' energy can be any energy that can properly stimulate
        the RLC circuit, like EM kicks or voltage contact kicks on
        nodes. </p>
      <p>Q6) Why doesn't Daniel suffer elecrical shock when he touches
        the terminals? <br>
        A6) It depends on ohm's law and on frequency. Especially, a
        simple thin cable works as a low-pass filter due to skin effect.
        Moreover, I suspect that most of the energy is produced directly
        INSIDE the electrical appliance, due to strong EM induction. The
        DC current flows when you create closed circuits with lowest
        resistance in an geometro-electromagnetical coupled polarized
        environment; AC current flows also on coupled open circuits, but
        with lowest resistance. </p>
      <p>Q7) How can we have DC from AC amplification component
        stimulation? <br>
        A7) Look here. </p>
      <p>Q8) How does that strange apparatus ELEMENT#5 work? <br>
        A8) It's a matter of selective antenna coupling. </p>
      <p>Q9) What can be the applications of this technology? <br>
        A9) Medicine, transportation, space propulsion and colonization,
        and more. It depends on the attitude of the people who uses it.

        <p><b><font size="+1">A Possible Explanation For The Operation
              Of Spooky Tech Devices Based As Far As Possible On
              Conventional Physical Theory</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By Mark A. Solis</b> </p>
        <p>( Shreveport, Louisiana )</p>
      </center>
      <p>The various devices pictured on the preceding page at
        http://www.geocities.com/masolis_52/weird.html all show clear
        evidence of "violating" known circuit laws, such as those <br>
        available from the link to
        http://www.geocities.com/masolis_52/circuits.html which list is
        representative of the considerations which must be applied <br>
        to any sort of conventional circuit analysis. </p>
      <p>Having established by observation that the devices are
        functioning in what may be termed an "impossible" mode (at least
        at first glance), we are now faced with a dilemma: either (1) we
        must accept that conventional theory is somehow wrong, despite
        massive experience to the contrary, or (2) we must uncover an
        explanation that is in accord with known theory, <br>
        although exactly what theory that is initially might be quite
        unclear. </p>
      <p>The only other alternative would be to accept the supernatural
        on its face, without further discussion.&nbsp; However, (1) that
        would not be acceptable to many people of science, and (2) it
        isn't necessarily the answer (although it could be, but we
        should investigate the matter first). </p>
      <p><b>The Available Facts</b> </p>
      <p>A list of the available facts is found on the following
        link:&nbsp; http://www.geocities.com/masolis_52/evidence.rtf </p>
      <p>From the point of view of the circuit laws as given above, the
        salient observations from the list of available facts are these:
      </p>
      <p>(1) the devices are of haphazard construction (but all have
        coils); </p>
      <p>(2) the devices have one or more significant open connections;
      </p>
      <p>(3) the devices have no hidden power sources or batteries (but
        note that one does use 2 "D" cells, which nonetheless are
        basically "connected to nothing," in conventional terms) </p>
      <p>(4) the devices are scaleable (more and bigger coils, more
        power); </p>
      <p>(5) the devices present no shock hazard; </p>
      <p>(6) the devices are "programmable" to quit working after a
        predetermined period of time; </p>
      <p>(7) the devices can respond to thought command of various users
        (though not all users, interestingly). </p>
      <p>The most relevant circuit laws being violated are those laws
        pertaining to a closed loop circuit: Ohm's Law, Joule's Law,
        Kirchoff's Mesh Law, etc.&nbsp; According to ordinary theory, a
        working circuit must be a complete loop of some sort.&nbsp; For
        steady-state or "DC" circuits, this means that there must be a
        complete circuit loop --- no exceptions. For "transient" or "AC"
        circuits, there must be a complete circuit loop through each of
        two or more magnetically-coupled inductors. Without a complete
        circuit loop, these laws presume that a circuit cannot function.
      </p>
      <p>Observations (1), (2) and (3) above clearly violate these laws.
      </p>
      <p>Before proceeding to the next consideration, however, we should
        note that Kirchoff's Nodal Law is not being violated, except in
        consideration of the Superposition Theorem, for which a complete
        circuit loop (or mesh) is again required. </p>
      <p>Next, the thermodynamical laws are being not just "violated,"
        but flatly thrown out the proverbial window.&nbsp; Even those
        devices having no batteries at all nonetheless appear to be
        producing significant power "from out of nowhere."&nbsp; Tests
        for microwave radiation or other "invisible" power sources were
        conducted, but to no avail. </p>
      <p>Observation (3) clearly violates the thermodynamical laws. </p>
      <p>Yet, we must realize something: proper statement of the first
        and second laws of thermodynamics begins with the prepositional
        conditional, "For a closed system, ...."&nbsp; What this means
        for us is that we are dealing with some kind of an open system,
        although we still have the circuit law violations to consider. </p>
      <p>Next, it is interesting to note that the devices are scaleable.
        Here, in the very midst of an apparent contravention of science,
        we encounter a perfectly normal expectation: namely, that bigger
        devices, with more and bigger coils, produce more power.&nbsp;
        This again suggests that we are dealing with some sort of [open]
        system that, despite its violation of the circuit laws, might be
        explainable in understandable terms. </p>
      <p>Observation (4) above states plainly that the devices are
        scaleable, just like any "normal" system. </p>
      <p>The absence of a shock hazard is remarkable, but not an utterly
        unknown phenomenon.&nbsp; Current research, notably by T. E.
        Bearden and others, has revealed that it is possible for
        electric circuits to somehow transfer energy (hence produce
        power) in a fashion that superficially does not appear to
        involve charge movement in the physical circuit as <br>
        we would normally think of it.&nbsp; This phenomenon can be
        attributed to a break in the charge-mass coupling, and is
        associated with certain <br>
        modes of circuit conduction that might allow the creation of
        "room temperature superconductors." </p>
      <p>Observation (5) above suggests that possibly these devices are
        behaving as room-temperature superconductors. </p>
      <p>The "programmability" of the devices has not been described in
        any detail, so a proper analysis is unlikely.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
        it would appear that this "programmability factor" is not
        readily visible in the circuits, and hence probably is some
        function of the inventor's own mind (see my subsequent
        speculations, below). </p>
      <p>The observed fact that the devices can respond to thought
        command by various users again indicates that something about
        the human mind is important. </p>
      <p>In summary, we have devices that (1) operate in violation of
        ciruit laws, (2) operate in violation of thermodynamical laws
        for closed systems, (3) operate in accord with Kirchoff's Nodal
        Law, <br>
        (4) are scaleable like normal systems, (5) behave as
        room-temperature superconductors, and (6) respond to mental
        "programming" and "thought commands." </p>
      <p>The circuit law violations are still a problem at this point,
        but other factors are beginning to come into focus: for example,
        the violation of the thermodynamical laws indicates we are
        dealing with <br>
        an open system; compliance with Kirchoff's Nodal Law while
        violating the Mesh Law indicates non-planar circuit couplings of
        unknown nature; scaleability suggests a consistent operational
        framework of unknown nature; room-temperature superconduction
        indicates some sort of interesting effect on particle spins; and
        "thought control" of the devices indicates a form of quantum
        entanglement with living systems (namely, the experimenters)
        that recently has been given a great deal of attention in
        experiments involving spin couplings at a distance, replicated
        in laboratories around the world. </p>
      <p><b>Preliminary Resolutions</b> </p>
      <p>With the information now in hand, we can begin to attempt to
        resolve the issues presented by these "Spooky Tech" devices. </p>
      <p>First of all, the circuit law violations might be addressed by
        a solution to the problem of the non-planar circuit couplings
        with which the devices obey Kirchoff's Nodal Law but not the
        Mesh Law. <br>
        Presumably, these couplings likely will prove to involve
        energies of a non-obvious nature, and might relate to the
        effects on the spins of the conductors and components that
        result in the behavior <br>
        of the devices as room-temperature superconductors. </p>
      <p>Secondly, the fact that we are dealing with an open (or
        non-thermodynamical) system&nbsp; means that we must look for a
        power source that is "off the board," as well as
        non-conventional (recall that <br>
        initial searches for such power sources revealed nothing). We
        will consider this point further, later on in the essay. </p>
      <p>Third, the fact that we are dealing with a non-planar circuit
        (in spite of the apparently planar physical construction) seems
        to indicate "off the board" couplings which may relate directly
        to the <br>
        source of power, which also is "off the board."&nbsp; (This is a
        case of a somewhat obtuse application of the old adage, "Birds
        of a feather flock together."&nbsp; We already know that the
        source of power is located somewhere off the board, so the
        non-planar couplings obviously might be "somewhere nearby" the
        source of power, so to speak.) </p>
      <p>Fourth, scaleability in and of itself is an indication that
        whatever allows these devices to operate is, in some sense, a
        consistent system.&nbsp; This is to say that whatever "it" is,
        it is <br>
        not chaotic.&nbsp; Some sort of orderly, usable, understandable
        framework is suggested by the property of scaleability.&nbsp;
        Moreover, linearity of some sort also is suggested, or at least
        possible. </p>
      <p>Fifth, room-temperature superconductivity is a clear and
        unequivocal indication of some sort of spin alignment taking
        place at the atomic level (i.e., interatomic spin couplings are
        being <br>
        affected), or even the particle level (i.e., individual particle
        spins are being affected without regard to atomic structure,
        etc.). This opens the door to so many possibilities for
        everything from <br>
        gravitational and inertial phenomena (think "the Overhauser
        Effect," especially as used by Dr. Frederick Alzofon, et al) and
        hence space-time phenomena, to couplings to the quantum vacuum
        (think "Zero Point Energy" here), that it seems we must be on
        the right track, at least in the investigative sense.&nbsp; (We
        find ourselves dealing with "possibilities", instead of
        impossibilities.) </p>
      <p>Finally, the thought-control factor goes back to the idea of
        quantum entaglement with living systems.&nbsp; One should note
        that in the laboratory experiments mentioned, the thoughts of
        the people <br>
        performing the experiments both determined the outcomes, and
        apparently provided the energy to produce those outcomes,
        whether acting as power sources, or merely as conduits for some
        other source of power. </p>
      <p>We are now ready to tackle the problem of explaining the
        operation of these "Spooky Tech" devices --- and may we all
        learn something in the process. </p>
      <p><b>Let The Speculation Begin</b> </p>
      <p>As for myself personally, it appears that the devices are not
        half as interesting as the inventor.&nbsp; This is not to say
        that there is nothing about the devices that is of interest,
        however.&nbsp; Even so, the available facts, and the subsequent
        observations just made, seem to me to suggest that it is the
        inventor who is far more interesting than anything that he has
        built. </p>
      <p>Just look at what we have: (1) non-planar circuit couplings of
        an unknown nature; (2) an unknown source of power; (3)
        scaleability (and hence order); (4) room-temperature
        superconduction (indicating spin alignment phenomena, space-time
        and zero-point phenomena, etc.); and (5) quantum entaglement
        with living systems.&nbsp; Items 2 and 5 (and hence 4) point
        directly to the inventor. </p>
      <p>But what about the devices?&nbsp; Well...they are clearly
        outputs. The thing is, it would appear that the inventor is the
        "input." </p>
      <p><b>A Trial Explanation -- Not Set In Stone</b> </p>
      <p>Allow me to begin by explaining my views of certain aspects of
        living systems (that is, us) that I think bear on the solution
        to this problem of the "Spooky Tech" devices. </p>
      <p>We have senses with which we interact with the physical world.
        This physical world, in turn, can be described as a sort of
        "mass-energy hologram."&nbsp; (See a book entitled, "The
        Holographic Universe" by Michael Talbot.)&nbsp; Our senses
        provide us with a map of the universe not only as it is, but how
        it unfolds: our sense of "time."&nbsp; This, in turn, provides
        us with "memory." </p>
      <p>I would note, however, that "memory" is not something we store
        in our brains, or our body cells, as many think.&nbsp; Rather,
        we are "storing" a space-time map of our sensory input, and the
        universe itself IS our memory, exactly as we experience
        it.&nbsp; Simply put, using the most dense possible method of
        data storage, namely binary, we do not have enough atoms in our
        brains to remember even a few days worth of experiences.&nbsp;
        Yet, laboratory studies confirm time and again that we remember
        everything we experience. </p>
      <p>Hence, we have a quantum-level space-time linkage in our brains
        and bodies.&nbsp; (Recent experiments have revealed that "memory
        phenomena" are associated with our individual organs and
        tissues.&nbsp; Specifically, this has been observed with
        transplant patients studied for the express purpose of
        determining how "cellular-level memory" works.) </p>
      <p>Now, the world as we experience it is this mass-energy hologram
        that we, through our genetically-designed construction, turn
        into the mental images we see, hear, smell, taste, etc.&nbsp;
        The world is, in that sense, exactly what we believe it is---at
        least "in our heads." </p>
      <p>But what if there were an "extra coupling" through our DNA,
        that did not rely on our thoughts driving our limbs, feet and
        hands to change the world around us?&nbsp; What if quantum
        entaglement gave us the proverbial "extra channel" to affect the
        world we see by the power of thought alone?&nbsp; (Imagine
        thought merely as the organizing principle, and the power source
        being the quantum vacuum, channeled somehow through scalar field
        couplings with our DNA, then coupled to the outside world
        through ordinary quantum entanglement.&nbsp; Be sure to see the
        relevant links in the bibliography at the bottom of this page.)
      </p>
      <p>This is what I think is happening with the inventor of these
        "Spooky Tech" devices.&nbsp; HE envisions the devices; HE builds
        them; HE knows what he wants them to do; and the devices respond
        not by the circuit laws or thermodynamics, but by the structure
        of the quantum entaglement by which the inventor causes the
        devices to work. </p>
      <p>This being the case, we would expect to see exactly what is
        being observed: an unknown power source, non-planar circuit
        operation in violation of the other circuit laws, compliance
        with Kirchoff's nodal law while violating the mesh law, and so
        forth.&nbsp; Even thought control would be in evidence. </p>
      <p>And so it is. </p>
      <p>One further point: I would predict that upon the inventor's
        death (someday, and hopefully not soon), all of his devices will
        cease to function, since it appears likely that he is an
        integral <br>
        part of their ability to function. </p>
      <p>May he live a long and happy life. </p>
      <p>So---What Now? </p>
      <p>A complete understanding of this phenomenon properly should
        come from a physiological study of the DNA, brain structure, and
        other such factors, of the inventor himself, rather than further
        study of his devices.&nbsp; In essence, the devices are for him
        no more than psionic icons through which power is flowing as
        directed by him, whether he does so consciously or
        otherwise.&nbsp; The devices, without their link to the inventor
        by conception, assembly, and the imagining by the inventor of
        their functioning, would simply be ordinary devices dependent on
        ordinary circuit laws, and hence would not work.&nbsp; But,
        because HE imagined them, HE built them, HE touched them, and HE
        pictured them in his mind as working devices, THEY WORK. </p>
      <p>A complete study of the inventor, medically speaking, would
        consist of nothing more than some DNA printing, standard blood
        tests, a few X-rays, and perhaps some PET/MRI scans conducted <br>
        while he is "inventing something." </p>
      <p>Specially designed tests utilizing orthogonal fields and scalar
        potentials should give especially interesting results. In
        particular, since the A-field is directly relevant to the
        Bergman charge-ring/pinch-force structure of atomic particles
        (since A = curl B, where B is the magnetic field), a study of
        that particular field with the inventor should be especially
        fruitful. </p>
      <p>The results should give some indication of useful data to find
        how he channels power from his mind to his devices. This
        discovery, however, should remind us of a certain movie named <br>
        "Forbidden Planet."&nbsp; The salient quote is:
        "...monsters...from the id...." </p>
      <p>Once we learn what DNA formation allows us to channel the power
        of space-time and the zero-point field in such a fashion,
        there's no turning back. </p>
      <p>Caution is advised. </p>
      <p><b>An Epilogue, Of Sorts</b> </p>
      <p>I am reminded of an old Star Trek episode, where a group of
        orphaned children took over the Enterprise.&nbsp; They were led
        by a "Gorgon," who would appear to them whenever they chanted
        the <br>
        following verse: </p>
      <p>Hail, hail, <br>
        Fire and snow, <br>
        Call the Angel, <br>
        We will go, <br>
        Far away, <br>
        For to see, <br>
        Friendly Angel <br>
        Come to me. </p>
      <p>And the Gorgon would appear, and tell them, "As you believe, so
        shall you do." </p>
      <p>This inventor's natural power is the key to exactly that.&nbsp;
        But don't forget the lesson of Morbius.... </p>

            The Curious Electrical Assemblies of Daniel X [ Pomerleau ].</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      In the space of one month, several readers have asked if we had
      more information about the curious small electrical assemblies of
      Daniel X.<br>
      <br>
      We are sorry but we have no news since that time (October 17,
      1999) where we have posted this information on our basic site (
      www.quanthomme.org) in "systems with no moving parts" we chose 4
      photos)<br>
      <br>
      It is likely that the small batch of photos in which we had drawn
      no longer circulating on the web now, so we publish all: it is a
      thin material but if it can satisfy our readers ...<br>
      <br>
      Since the publication of this page we have received 18 January
      2005, a letter from a witness.<br>
      <br>
      His story (that we can finally put online after the long
      interruption due to the prolonged maintenance of our host) is
      given later, after the photos.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One of our correspondents has been a demonstration and said there
      was no trick, but the results obtained with these few pieces of
      wire coils were very annoying for someone who has knowledge of
      electricity!<br>
      <br>
      Presumably, according to some witnesses, it would have occurred
      after certain treatments (probably wrong) that special services
      would have been subjected to. However, all those who met him agree
      that he communicates very well, and even likes a joke. Daniel X is
      under guardianship, but the role of guardian of this young man is
      apparently not easy in light of the threats against him.<br>

      The photos on the Internet appear to be a good reflection of the
      film as evidenced by those who saw the video and also people who
      attended the experiences we have encountered. The electrical and
      electronics engineers are particularly puzzled because, equipped
      with its mounting Summary yarn on bottle neck and twisted pasta,
      Daniel X. obtain sufficient energy to power engines<br>
      <br>
      He even managed to build aircraft (fifteen) giving several
      kilowatts and that special services would come to destroy.<br>
      <br>
      It could be that these devices are based on resonance frequency,
      according to Tesla. By manipulating and moving components summary,
      Daniel X signal to observers when the current goes through.<br>
      <br>
      (His son convolutions of the camera are reminiscent of Perrigo).<br>
      <br>
      We just informed us that the editions Felix does not answer the
      questions posed. Yet it was in their offices that several of our
      correspondents were able to view the video (which are certainly
      taken the pictures above).<br>
      <br>
      A witness said:<br>
      <br>
      "Hello,<br>
      I am a big fan of the free energy and I work very hard to make
      your site known to everyone around me ...<br>
      <br>
      About Daniel X, I know him pretty well and I watch his
      demonstrations frequently.<br>
      <br>
      I am a mechanic by trade and I am currently in auto mechanics
      teacher in my area. I am very comfortable with electricity, all
      this to tell you that<br>
      <br>
      - When you hold in your hands a little 12 volt motor and you have
      the chance to tear this little engine and find that this small
      engine is just like any other small motors 12 volt permanent
      magnet<br>
      <br>
      - And then you go up (assemble) the engine to operate with a 12
      volt battery without any problems<br>
      <br>
      - And a few minutes later Daniel tells you to keep the engine in
      your hands with any wire connected to a battery or power source<br>
      <br>
      - And then he took two little son of five centimeters
      (approximately) in length, one in the right hand and another in
      the left hand<br>
      <br>
      - And he said that when you link the two together son (both son
      Daniel is in his hands), your little engine that is connected to
      any power source will start to operate with the same rotational
      power.<br>
      <br>
      Daniel son has linked the two together and the engine that I held
      in my hands began to work alone and without any power.<br>
      <br>
      Daniel did not need all its fixtures which have no son twisted
      logic to operate our aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      I invited several scientists to come see his montages and also had
      the chance to take a small motor in their hands ...... and finally
      sit on their chairs and say that they have never seen it all their
      lives.<br>
      <br>
      If Daniel did not pose a threat to his life and if he did not have
      this handicap of being autistic (mild) but rather for not having
      reached Conversation "logic", perhaps we could pass this knowledge
      that seems so easy to him.<br>
      <br>
      Yes! it is unfair not to have the ability to transmit such
      knowledge as Daniel always says if you want you can do because
      everyone can do it like me.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes I wonder if Daniel really knows how it works .... Who
      knows for the moment I do that attending these demonstrations
      while hoping one day understand.<br>
      <br>
      For the protection of Daniel, I ask you not to disclose his
      identity because all it does is free and also wants the world to
      become autonomous and no oil or electricity to pay. "<br>
      <br>
      More information on May 18, 2006, according to information
      provided by one of our readers, Jacques B. whom we thank.<br>
      <br>
      "Daniel X * is called Daniel Pomerleau and actually lived in
      Canada especially Quebec, and he actually has autism light.<br>
      <br>
      And not that these arrangements will provide a few kilowatts are
      not destroyed and continues to walk across Quebec on request and
      no one can explain his montages are the least we can say very
      surprising.<br>
      <br>
      Congratulations on the production of photos ** of your site, keep
      your treasured because they are the only available because it does
      not allow anyone to take.<br>
      <br>
      It was ten years ago that I saw for the first time Daniel
      Pomerleau and I returned for the fifth time in bringing each time
      a PhD and every time without a shred of explanation.<br>
      <br>
      I feel the bitterness that one day it will disappear, I mean die a
      natural death after failing to disclose his secret he will take
      with him a legend and will be created.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime I continue to believe that it shows us that energy
      availability without limit. With basic theory which I think is
      based on the application of the theory of Professor Valley and the
      interaction of electric fields on the atoms of carbon.<br>
      <br>
      Good thinking. "Jacques B.<br>

      (Comments in red are by “Antonio.”)<br>
      <br>
      1. The device appears to be nothing more than a random, or even
      haphazard, assemblage of coils, with an open circuit to which a
      load can be connected, that nonetheless will operate.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, but all of them have coils.&nbsp; The one that powers his
      house had several. The size of his device was about 2 feet by 3
      feet.<br>
      <br>
      2. The inventor is an autistic savant, and claims to have no idea
      how the devices work.<br>
      <br>
      Correct, and he was very young when it was discovered that he had
      this gift. As a child he was able to make toys work with no
      batteries … his Catholic parents tried to have him exorcized by a
      priest 3 times.<br>
      <br>
      3. The devices will work in the absence of the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      Yes. They will work until the parts wear out.&nbsp; The latest
      demo models he claims were designed to stop working after 2 hours
      to discourage theft.<br>
      <br>
      4. The devices have no hidden sources of power.<br>
      <br>
      How else can you explain powering 3 industrial strength
      construction tools<br>
      like saws etc simultaneously … all tools were brought in by
      skeptics.<br>
      <br>
      5. There is no difference of potential between the devices and the
      inventor's tongue.<br>
      <br>
      Correct -- or anybody else … the electricity respects human
      beings.<br>
      <br>
      6. Some of the devices respond (on-off) to the thoughts of the
      persons holding them.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, but not everybody was able to make this work … only certain
      people were able to do this and I was one of them … not sure if
      belief plays a role here … And trust me it responded to my
      thoughts … only I knew WHEN I willed it to turn on or off.<br>
      <br>
      7. The devices are scaleable, and at least one such device
      provides power to the inventor's house.<br>
      <br>
      Completely scalable: more coils and more turns of wires for more
      powerful models.<br>
      <br>
      8. At least one device could light a cigarette merely by holding
      the cigarette in the proximity of a light bulb powered by the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      When put between the alligator pins the cigarette was lit with a
      beautiful<br>
      white light.<br>
      <br>
      9. Some of the smaller devices have been stolen.<br>
      <br>
      Yes, but he now “programs” them to shut off after 2 hours.<br>
