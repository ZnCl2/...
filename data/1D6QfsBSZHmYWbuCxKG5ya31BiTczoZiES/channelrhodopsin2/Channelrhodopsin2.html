            Protein That Could Cure Blindness</b><br>

      <br>
      It sounds completely crazy: as early as next year, using gene
      therapy scientists hope to restore sight in the blind by giving
      their eyes additional “light sensors.”<br>
      <br>
      We’re not talking about bionic eyes: instead of implantable
      electronics, scientists are turning to a protein called
      channelrhodopsin-2. You’ve probably heard of this protein before —
      it’s the same magical switch that, in response to light, can turn
      a gentle mouse aggressive, shut down obsessive grooming behavior,
      and implant false memories in unsuspecting mice.<br>
      <br>
      What does a mind-controlling protein have to do with restoring
      vision?<br>
      Meet the protein that sparked a neuroscience revolution<br>
      <br>
      The answer lies in how channelrhodopsin-2 works. The protein comes
      from the lowly green algae, which uses it to seek out sunlight for
      photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      At its core, channelrhodopsin-2 is a light-sensitive protein
      tunnel that sits on the surface of cells. Normally the tunnel is
      completely cinched up, which allows a cell to maintain a steady
      interior environment.<br>
      <br>
      However, when a certain wavelength of light hits the protein, the
      tunnel temporarily flashes open, much like a camera shutter. When
      open, the protein is like a highway, shuttling ions into the cell
      — the same biophysical process that makes a neuron burst with
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      About a decade ago, neuroscientists realized that they could stick
      the protein into mouse neurons that were previously impervious to
      light. By using sophisticated genetic tools, the protein could be
      restricted to certain types or populations of neurons, rather than
      huge chunks of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Then, by shining light through an implanted fiber optic laser,
      researchers can artificially activate select networks of neurons.
      The results are nothing short of science fiction: a flash of
      light, and a mouse — going about its business as usual — might,
      for example, suddenly freeze in place as if terrorized. Turn the
      light off, and it’ll revert back to its normal happy-go-lucky
      state, seemingly unaware that anything strange just happened.
      Hence, the “mind control” part.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists dubbed this powerful new technique optogenetics,
      and hundreds — if not thousands — of labs around the world are now
      using this technique to explore the intricate neural connections
      in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adding backup hardware to the human eye</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The brain-bending powers of channelrhodopsin-2 are so
      mind-boggling that it’s easy to forget the simple nature of the
      protein: it senses light, and transmits that information through
      electricity to higher processing centers.<br>
      <br>
      Broadly speaking, human eyes work similarly. Light passes through
      the length of our eyeballs and falls on the back of the retina,
      activating light-sensitive proteins called photoreceptors (these
      are shaped like rods and cones). The photoreceptors transmit light
      information through two filter layers — ganglion and bipolar cells
      — that process the electric signals and send them to visual areas
      of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      In many eye disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular
      degeneration, the rods and cones gradually die off. This leads to
      progressively failing vision, and — without a cure — eventually
      turns one out of four sufferers legally blind.<br>
      <br>
      These are cold, brutal diseases, but there is one silver lining:
      they leave ganglion and bipolar cells intact and still able to
      still communicate with the brain.<br>
      <br>
      The obvious treatment would be to introduce human hardware back
      into the human retina through gene therapy. Yet, human
      light-sensitive proteins are notoriously hard to engineer. To
      function normally, they have to be tightly coupled to many other
      supporting proteins. This means scientists would have to get
      multiple genes at the right ratio and levels into the retina — a
      feat that is currently impossible.<br>
      <br>
      Channelrhodopsin-2, on the other hand, works just by itself.<br>
      <br>
      In 2006, Dr. Zhou Hua Pan, a researcher at Wayne State University,
      decided to stick the protein into mice that were genetically
      engineered for photoreceptor degeneration. It worked on the first
      try; in less than three months after a single treatment, the mice
      passed every vision test the scientists could throw at them.<br>
      <br>
      “It worked perfectly, even in the very beginning,” Pan told Wired.
      “That was basically just really, really lucky.”<br>
      <br>
      Pan’s success did not escape the notice of the biotech industry.
      In 2009, RetroSense Therapeutics, a startup located a short drive
      away from Wayne State, leased the eye-wiring tech from Pan in a
      bid to bring it to human trials. Last month, the FDA gave its nod
      of approval: as early as this fall, the company will start
      installing channelrhodopsin-2 into the retinas of 15 patients
      blinded by retinitis pigmentosa through gene therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The company is aiming for retinal ganglion cells, which are spared
      by the disease even in advanced stages. In essence, by giving
      these “middle men” the ability to sense light, scientists hope to
      circumvent the need for rods and cones.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A long road ahead to color</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To be clear, as promising at it is, the algae protein can’t
      restore human vision to all its colorful vividness.<br>
      <br>
      The photoreceptors in our eyes, optimized by eons of evolution,
      operate over a wide range of light intensities and wavelengths —
      we get to see everything from pale starlight blinking in an indigo
      sky to glaring sunlight above white hot sand, and all the colors
      in between.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, channelrhodopsin-2 paints a dim monochromatic
      landscape. The protein is 2,000 times less sensitive to light than
      our retinal cones. It only responds to a very narrow set of
      wavelengths — and thus colors — of light, a far cry from our
      normal eyesight. In a way, going from rods and cones to
      channelrhodopsin-2 is like going from an expensive 20-gear road
      bike to a fixie. It works, but it’s not optimal.<br>
      <br>
      Ganglion cells also don’t normally deal with light — they
      generally process electrical signals that come from rods and
      cones. Whether raw light signals work as well as pre-processed
      electrical information from photoreceptors is still up in the air.
      If the gene therapy successfully delivers channelrhodopsin-2 to
      these cells, the brain will have some serious rewiring to do
      before it can interpret these strange new signals.<br>
      <br>
      Even with these caveats, the therapy may be a game changer. A
      decade ago, channelrhodopsin-2 dramatically changed the face of
      neuroscience — here’s to hoping it’ll spark another revolution
      soon.<br>

      When Wayne State University researcher Dr. Zhou-Hua Pan placed a
      light-sensitive green algae protein into blind mice in 2006, he
      was amazed to find that it restored the subjects' vision almost
      immediately. Fast forward to 2015, the year of many great things,
      and that protein is now the subject of a forthcoming set of human
      trials aimed at unveiling a potential cure for blindness in
      humans.<br>
      <br>
      RetroSense Therapeutics, the company who leased the research from
      Dr. Zhou-Hua Pan and recently received approval from the Food and
      Drug Administration to administer human trials, is expected to
      begin testing the protein on 15 patients by the end of the year.
      According to Singularity Hub, channelrhodopsin-2 is the same
      "magical switch" protein already famous for its ability to "turn a
      gentle mouse aggressive, shut down obsessive grooming behavior,
      and implant false memories in unsuspecting mice."<br>
      <br>
      The protein is placed directly into the retina using gene therapy,
      allowing the rod-and-cone system to be bypassed entirely and
      giving the eye's ganglion cells the ability to sense light on
      their own. Though some levels of colorblindness may persist even
      with successful implementation of the forthcoming human trials,
      some researchers speculate that the human brain could potentially
      make adjustments in order to counteract the color loss.<br>
      <br>
      Keep up the good work, science. We're all counting on you.<br>

        </b><b>IDENTIFICATION OF CHANNELRHODOPSIN-2 (CHOP2) MUTATIONS
          AND METHODS OF USE.</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      The invention provides compositions and kits including at least
      one nucleic acid or polypeptide molecule encoding for a mutant
      ChR2 protein. Methods of the invention include administering a
      composition comprising a mutant ChR2 to a subject to preserve,
      improve, or restore phototransduction. Preferably, the
      compositions and methods of the invention are provided to a
      subject having impaired vision, thereby restoring vision to normal
      levels. <br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] This invention relates generally to the field of molecular
      biology. Mutations in the Channelopsin-2 (Chop2) gene are
      identified. Compositions comprising a mutant Chop2 gene are used
      in therapeutic methods to improve and restore vision loss.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The retina is composed of photoreceptors (or photoreceptor
      cells, rods and cones). Photoreceptors are highly specialized
      neurons that are responsible for phototransduction, or the
      conversion of light (in the form of electromagnetic radiation)
      into electrical and chemical signals that propagate a cascade of
      events within the visual system, ultimately generating a
      representation of our world.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Photoreceptor loss or degeneration severely compromises, if
      not completely inhibits, phototransduction of visual information
      within the retina. Loss of photoreceptor cells and/or loss of a
      photoreceptor cell function are the primary causes of diminished
      visual acuity, diminished light sensitivity, and blindness. There
      is a long-felt need in the art for compositions and method that
      restore photosensitivity of the retina of a subject experiencing
      vision loss.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] The invention provides a solution for the long-felt need
      for a method of restoring and/or increasing the light sensitivity
      of photoreceptor cells by expression of advantageous mutations,
      and/or combinations thereof, of the Channelopsin-2 (Chop2) gene,
      and subsequently providing methods for Channelopsin-2
      (Chop2)-based gene therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Channelopsin-2 (Chop2)-based gene therapy offers a superior
      strategy for restoring retinal photosensitivity after
      photoreceptor degeneration. The protein product of the Chop2 gene,
      when bound to the light-isomerizable chromophore
      all-trans-retinal, forms a functional light-gated channel, called
      channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Native ChR2 shows low light
      sensitivity. Recently, two mutant ChR2s, L132C and T159C, were
      reported to markedly increase their light sensitivity (Kleinlogel
      et al. (2011) Nat. Neurosci. 14:513-8; Berndt et al. (2011) Proc
      Natl Acad Sci USA. 108:7595-600; Prigge et al. (2012) J Biol.
      Chem. 287(38)3104:12; the contents of each of which are
      incorporated herein in their entireties). The properties of these
      two ChR2 mutants (i.e., L132C and T159C) were examined and
      compared with a number of double mutants at these two sites to
      identify suitable candidates for therapeutic methods. Compositions
      comprising one or more of these mutations are provided to a
      subject in need thereof for the purpose of restoring vision.
      Specifically, desired mutations in the Chop2 gene are introduced
      to a cell and/or integrated into the genomic DNA of a cell to
      improve or restore vision. Desired mutations in the Chop2 gene
      that are introduced to a cell to improve or restore vision may
      also remain episomal, not having integrated into the genomic DNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Mutations at the L132 or T159 amino acid positions of Chop2
      (and therefore, the resulting ChR2) markedly lower the threshold
      light intensity that is required to elicit the ChR2-mediated
      photocurrent. Double mutants at the amino acid positions L132 and
      T159 further increase the photocurrent at low light intensities,
      exceeding that of either of the corresponding single mutations.
      Retinal ganglion cells expressing the double mutants at the L132
      and T159 positions can respond to light intensities that fall
      within the range of normal outdoor lighting conditions but should
      still maintain adequate, and high temporal resolution that are
      suitable for restoring useful vision. Thus, mutant Chop2 protein
      of the present invention that form mutant ChR2s having improved
      light sensitivity are used alone or in combination to restore or
      improve vision.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Visual System</b><br>
      <br>
      [0029] The central nervous system mediates vision (also referred
      to herein as sight) through specialized cells and unique methods
      of signal transduction present in the visual system. The principle
      responsibility of the visual system is to transform light, in the
      form of electromagnetic radiation, into a representation or image
      of the surrounding world. In addition to the “visual” function of
      this system, the visual system also regulates the pupillary light
      reflex (PLR), circadian photoentrainment to periodic light/dark
      cycles, and release of the hormone melatonin.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The cells of the retina are the first cells of the visual
      or nervous system to encounter light (electromagnetic radiation of
      varying wavelengths and intensities). Photons travel through the
      cornea, pupil, and lens before reaching the retina. The retina has
      a unique structure because the photoreceptor cells that directly
      absorb photons are located in the outer layer of the retina.
      Photons that traverse the lens first encounter an inner layer of
      retinal ganglion cells (a minority of which are photosensitive
      through the expression of the opsin, melanopsin) and an
      intermediate layer of bipolar cells before reaching the outer
      layer of photoreceptor cells (also known as rods and cones). Rod
      photoreceptors operate in dim illumination condition (scotopic
      vision) while cone photoreceptors operate in bright illumination
      conditions (photopic vision) responsible for color vision. Cone
      photoreceptors synapse directly onto ON- and OFF-type cone bipolar
      cells, which in turn, synapse directly onto ON- and OFF-type
      retinal ganglion cells. Rod photoreceptors synapse to rod bipolar
      cells (a unique type of bipolar cells, which is ON-type), which
      synapse to AII amacrine cells. The AII amacrine cells then relay
      the visual signals to ON-type cone bipolar cells through gap
      junction and to OFF-type cone bipolar cells as well as OFF
      ganglion cells through inhibitory glycinergic synapses. Retinal
      ganglion cells are responsible for relating visual information to
      neurons of the brain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Phototransduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] Within the retina, photoreceptor cells absorb photon
      particles and transform the raw data of light frequency and
      wavelength into chemical and subsequently electrical signals that
      propagate this initial information throughout the visual and
      nervous systems. Specifically, an opsin protein located on the
      surface of a photoreceptor (rod, cone, and/or photosensitive
      retinal ganglion cell) absorbs a photon and initiates an
      intracellular signaling cascade, which results in the
      hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. In the dark, the opsin
      proteins absorb no photons, the photoreceptors are depolarized.
      The visual signals of photoreceptors then relay through bipolar
      cells, amacrine cells, and ganglion cells to the high visual
      centers in the brain. Specifically, when rod and cone
      photoreceptors are depolarized (in the dark), they cause the
      depolarization of rod bipolar cells and ON-type cone bipolar
      cells, but the hyperpolarization of OFF-type cone bipolar cells,
      which in turn cause the depolarization of AII amacrine cells and
      the increase of the spiking of ON-type retinal ganglion cells and
      the decrease of the spiking of OFF-type retinal ganglion cells.
      The opposite happens (to rod, ON- and OFF-bipolar cells, AII
      amacrine and ON- and OFF-ganglion cells), when rod and cone
      photoreceptors are hyperpolarized (in response to light).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Light information is processed and refined significantly by
      the actions of photoreceptors, bipolar cells, horizontal cells,
      amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells. To add to the
      complexity of this system, photoreceptors are found in three main
      varieties, including rods, cones (of which three types respond
      most strongly to distinct wavelengths of light), and
      photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Thus, a first layer of
      information processing occurs at the level of the photoreceptors
      which respond differentially to certain wavelengths and
      intensities of light. Bipolar cells of the retina receive
      information from both photoreceptor cells and horizontal cells.
      Horizontal cells of the retina receive information from multiple
      photoreceptor cells, and, therefore, integrate information between
      cell types and across distances in the retina. Bipolar cells
      further integrate information directly from photoreceptor cells
      and horizontal cells by producing mainly graded potentials to
      retinal ganglion cells, although some recent studies indicate that
      some bipolar cells can generate action potentials. Cone bipolar
      cells synapse on retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells while
      rod bipolar cells synapse only to AII amacrine cells. Similar to
      horizontal cells, most amacrine cells integrate information
      laterally within the retina. Unlike horizontal cells, most
      amacrine cells are inhibitory (GABAergic) interneurons. Amacrine
      cells are also more specialized than horizontal cells, because
      each amacrine cell specifically synapses on a particular type of
      bipolar cell (one of the ten varieties of bipolar cell).
      Particularly, the AII amacrine cell is a critical relay neuron in
      the rod pathway (under scotopic vision when cone photoreceptors do
      not respond). The AII amacinre cells receive synaptic inputs from
      rod bipolar cells and then piggy-back the signals to cone pathway
      through ON- and OFF-cone bipolar cells to ON- and OFF-ganglion
      cells as described above. Therefore, expression of Chop2, and the
      resulting formation of ChR2, in rod bipolar cells or AII amacrine
      cells can create both ON and OFF responses in retinal ganglion
      cells. Furthermore, retinal ganglion cells integrate information
      from bipolar cells and from amacrine cells. Although retinal
      ganglion cells vary significantly with respect to size,
      connectivity, and responses to visual stimulation (e.g. visual
      fields), all retinal ganglion cells extend a long axon into the
      brain. Except for a minute portion of the retinal ganglion cells
      that transduce non-visual information regarding the pupillary
      light reflex and circadian entrainment, the totality of axons
      extending from the retinal ganglion cells form the optic nerve,
      optic chiasm, and optic tract of the central nervous system.
      Consequently, a significant amount of information processing
      occurs in the retina itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Photoreceptor cells express endogenous opsin proteins, such
      as rhodopsin. The mutant Chop2 proteins of the invention may be
      expressed in any cell type, and form functional ChR2 channels.
      Preferably, the cell is a retinal cell. Exemplary cells, include,
      but are not limited to, photoreceptor cells (e.g., rods, cones,
      and photosensitive retinal ganglion cells), horizontal cells,
      bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Channelopsin-2 (Chop2)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] Channelopsin-2 (Chop2) was first isolated from the green
      algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Channelopsin-2 is a seven
      transmembrane domain protein that becomes photo-switchable (light
      sensitive) when bound to the chromophore all-trans-retinal. Chop2,
      when linked to a retinal molecule via Schiff base linkage forms a
      light-gated, nonspecific, inwardly rectifying, cation channel,
      called Channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2 retinalidene, abbreviated ChR2).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As referred to herein, “channelopsin-2” or “Chop2” refers
      to the gene that encodes channelopsin-2, which then forms
      Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) once bound to retinal. Gene constructs
      of the present invention refer primarily to channelopsin-2 (i.e.,
      without the retinal), and all Chop2 variants disclosed herein form
      functional channelrhodopsin-2 variants. The methods disclosed
      herein may include delivering Chop2 to cells without exogenous
      retinal. It is understood that upon expression of Chop2 in cells
      (i.e., retinal neurons), endogenously available retinal binds to
      the wild-type Chop2 or the Chop2 mutants of the present invention
      to form functional light-gated channels, WT ChR2 or mutant ChR2.
      As such, Chop2 proteins, as referred to herein, can also be
      synonymous with ChR2.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As used herein, “channelrhodopsin-2” or “ChR2” refers to
      the retinal-bound functional light-sensitive channel. In one
      embodiment, the bound retinal may be provided exogenously. In a
      preferred embodiment, the bound retinal is provided from
      endogenous levels available in the cell. The present invention
      also encompasses the functional channelrhodopsin-2 channels formed
      by the polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding the Chop2 mutants
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Upon illumination by the preferred dose of light radiation,
      ChR2 opens the pore of the channel, through which H&lt;+&gt;,
      Na&lt;+&gt;, K&lt;+&gt;, and/or Ca&lt;2+&gt; ions flow into the
      cell from the extracellular space. Activation of the ChR2 channel
      typically causes a depolarization of the cell expressing the
      channel. Depolarized cells produce graded potentials and or action
      potentials to carry information from the Chop2/ChR2-expressing
      cell to other cells of the retina or brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The wild type form of ChR2 or mutant ChR2s with high
      temporal resolution have become a central focus of neuroscience
      research. When expressed in a mammalian neuron, ChR2 mediates
      light-controlled depolarization of in vitro or ex vivo cultures.
      Wild type ChR2s or mutant ChR2s with high temporal resolution (the
      latter usually display low light sensitivity) presents several
      challenges that must be addressed to enable their use for the
      purpose of vision restoration. For the purpose of vision
      restoration, the ChR2 with high light sensitivity rather than high
      temporal resolution is desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Wild type ChR2 proteins require illumination from high blue
      light intensities for full activation (i.e. 10&lt;18&gt;-10&lt;19
      &gt;photons s&lt;-1 &gt;cm&lt;-2 &gt;at a wavelength of 480 nm).
      Continuous illumination of this type can damage cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The kinetics of the wild type ChR2 protein is suboptimal
      for maximizing channel efficacy. Efficacy can be increased by
      modifying one or more amino acids of the wild type ChR2 protein
      either to prolong the open state of the channel or increase the
      unit conductance of the channel, or both. The single-channel
      conductance of wild-type ChR2 is small. Thus, neuronal activation
      in vivo would either require high expression of the wild type
      channel or very intense activation with the preferred wavelength
      of blue-light. A simpler solution may be found by altering the
      channel conductance or to prolong the channel open time. Either
      one of these mechanisms and, in particular, the combination of
      these mechanisms, enable lower and safer light intensities to be
      used to achieve the same level of cellular depolarization.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] For example, mutant ChR2 proteins of the invention achieve
      greater light sensitivity through the prolongation of the channel
      open state. Consequently, each mutant ChR2 channel conducts a
      greater photocurrent than a wild type ChR2 channel when activated
      by the same light intensities. Therefore, the mutant channels are
      activated by light intensities that are lower than those required
      for activation of the wild type ChR2 channels. Quantitatively,
      detectable spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells expressing
      mutant ChR2 proteins can be elicited by a light intensity that is
      1.5-2 log units lower than the light intensity required to elicit
      spiking activity from retinal ganglion cells expressing wild type
      ChR2. Thus, the light intensities required to activate the mutant
      ChR2 proteins are close to or fall within the range of normal
      outdoor lighting conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The following sequences provide non-limiting examples of
      wild type and mutant Chop2 proteins, and polynucleotides encoding
      said WT and mutant Chop2 proteins of the invention, and forming WT
      and mutant ChR2s of the invention.<br>

      ChR2 Mutants<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The present invention provides Chop2 mutants wherein one or
      more amino acids are mutated. In some embodiments, the Chop2 is
      the full-length polypeptide, such as SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 6, and 8,
      with at least one amino acid mutation. In some embodiments, the
      mutation is at amino acid 132 and/or amino acid 159. In some
      preferred embodiments, the amino acid at position 132 is mutated
      from a leucine to a cysteine or an alanine. In some preferred
      embodiments, the amino acid at position 159 is mutated from a
      threonine to an alanine, a cysteine, or a serine. In all
      embodiments, the Chop2 mutants form a functional ChR2 channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The present invention also encompasses Chop2 proteins and
      nucleic acids that encode a biologically active fragment or a
      conservative amino acid substitution or other mutation variant of
      Chop2. Non-limiting examples of useful fragments include
      polypeptides encoding amino acids 1-315 of the wild-type Chop2,
      i.e., SEQ ID NO: 26, wherein at least one amino acid is mutated or
      conservatively substituted, for example at amino acid positions
      132 and/or 159. Smaller fragments of wild-type Chop2, wherein at
      least one amino acid is mutated or conservatively substituted
      (i.e., at amino acid positions 132 and/or 159) may also be useful
      in the present invention. Accordingly, Chop2 polypeptides and
      nucleic acids of the present invention further include, but are
      not limited to, biologically active fragments encoding amino acids
      1-315, 1-310, 1-300, 1-275, 1-250, 1-225, 1-200, 1-175, or 1-160
      of the wild-type Chop2, wherein at least one amino acid is mutated
      or conservatively substituted, for example at amino acid positions
      132 and/or 159. In other embodiments, the Chop2 polypeptides and
      nucleic acids of the present invention can be up to, or about, 315
      amino acids long, 310 amino acids long, 300 amino acids long, 275
      amino acids long, 250 amino acids long, 225 amino acids long, 200
      amino acids long, 175 amino acids long, or 160 amino acids long.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A single mutant Chop2 of the invention may be encoded by
      the following Synthetic construct hVChR1-mKate-betahChR2(L132C)
      gene sequence (GenBank Accession No. JN836746, and SEQ ID NO: 9)
      with the following annotations, GFP sequence is in bold, L132C
      Chop2 sequence is underlined::<br>

      [0071] Mutant ChR2 proteins of the invention also demonstrate
      slower channel kinetics. Higher light sensitivity was found to
      correlate with slower channel kinetics, indicating a trade-off
      between light sensitivity and channel kinetics. Chop2 proteins
      that form the ChR2 proteins of the present invention may also
      comprise additional mutations or modifications that may improve
      channel kinetics, or increase the deactivation rate, of the ChR2.
      Particularly preferred ChR2 mutants balance the threshold of light
      sensitivity with channel kinetics.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions and Kits<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Compositions and kits of the invention comprise at least
      one nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide molecule that encodes a
      mutant Chop2 protein, and the resulting ChR2, of the invention.
      The at least one nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide molecule
      that encodes a mutant Chop2 protein of the invention may further
      include a pharmaceutically-acceptible carrier. Kits of the
      invention further include instructions for administering a
      composition of the invention to a subject.<br>
      <br>
      Therapeutic Uses<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Mutations were made on a codon optimized Chop2-GFP fusion
      protein to create single and double mutations at the L132 (Leucine
      132) and T159 (threonine 159) sites. The functional properties of
      each mutant ChR2, or a combination thereof, were first examined in
      HEK cells. AAV2 virus vectors carrying mutant Chop2-GFP constructs
      driven by CAG promoter were made and injected intravitreally into
      the eyes of adult mice. Mutant Chop2-mediated light responses were
      examined by using multi-electrode array recordings from
      whole-mount retinas.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Single mutant ChR2, i.e., L132 and T159C, markedly lower
      the threshold light intensity that is required to evoke a
      ChR2-mediated photocurrent. Moreover, several double mutant ChR2
      variants, including L132C/T159C, L132A/T159C, and L132C/T159S,
      were found to further increase the photocurrent above the results
      of any single mutant ChR2 at low light intensities. The double
      mutants exhibited a slower off-rate, which is likely to contribute
      to the increased photocurrent at the low light intensities.
      Spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells mediated by the
      L132C/T159C double mutant was observed at the light intensity of
      10&lt;13 &gt;photon/cm&lt;2&gt;/s and at the wavelength of 473 nm.
      This light level is about 1.5 to 2 log units lower than the light
      level that is required to elicit the spiking activity with
      wild-type ChR2. The spike firing of retinal ganglion cells
      expressing L132C/T159C could follow a light flicker frequency of
      up to 15 Hz. Ongoing studies are evaluating the long-term
      expression and safety of mutant ChR2s of the invention in retinal
      neurons.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Furthermore, expression of the mutant Chop2 proteins, and
      the resulting ChR2 proteins, of the present invention was not
      found to cause neurotoxicity of up to two months after viral
      injection in mice, demonstrating the safety of the present
      invention for therapeutic use.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Vectors for use in the present invention can include
      various viral vectors, such as plasmids and recombinant viruses,
      i.e., recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV), recombinant
      adenoviruses, recombinant retroviruses, recombinant lentiviruses,
      and other viruses known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In some embodiments, the expression of the Chop2 proteins
      of the present invention is driven by a constitutive promoter,
      i.e., CAG promoter, CMV promoter, LTR. In other embodiments, the
      promoter is an inducible or a cell-specific promoter. Cell
      type-specific promoters that enable Chop2 protein expression in
      specific subpopulations of cells, i.e., retinal neuron cells or
      degenerating cells, may be preferred. These cells may include, but
      are not limited to, a retinal ganglion cell, a photoreceptor cell,
      a bipolar cell, a rod bipolar cell, an ON-type cone bipolar cell,
      a retinal ganglion cell, a photosensitive retinal ganglion cell, a
      horizontal cell, an amacrine cell, or an AII amacrine cell. Cell
      type-specific promoters are well known in the art. Particularly
      preferred cell type-specific promoters include, but are not
      limited to mGluR6, NK-3, and Pcp2(L7).<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In some embodiments, use of different opsin genes in
      addition to the mutant Chop2 proteins of the present invention and
      targeted gene expression may further increase light sensitivity or
      improve vision. Visual information is processed through the retina
      through two pathways: an ON pathway which signals the light ON,
      and an OFF pathway which signals the light OFF. The existence of
      the ON and OFF pathway is important for the enhancement of
      contrast sensitivity. The visual signal in the ON pathway is relay
      from ON-cone bipolar cells to ON ganglion cells. Both ON-cone
      bipolar cells and ON-ganglion cells are depolarized in response to
      light. On the other hand, the visual signal in the OFF pathway is
      carried from OFF-cone bipolar cells to OFF ganglion cells. Both
      OFF-cone bipolar cells and OFF-ganglion cells are hypopolarized in
      response to light. Rod bipolar cells, which are responsible for
      the ability to see in dim light (scotopic vision), are ON bipolar
      cells (depolarized in response to light). Rod bipolar cells relay
      the vision signal through AII amacrine cells (an ON type retinal
      cells) to ON an OFF cone bipolar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Accordingly, a dual rhodopsin system can be used to
      recapitulate the ON and OFF pathways integral to visual processing
      and acuity. Briefly, a Chop2 protein of the present invention can
      be specifically targeted to ON type retinal neurons (i.e., ON type
      ganglion cells and/or ON type bipolar cells), while a
      hypopolarizing light sensor (i.e., halorhodopsin or other chloride
      pump known in the art) can be targeted to OFF type retinal neurons
      (i.e. OFF type ganglion cells and/or OFF type bipolar cells) to
      create ON and OFF pathways. The specific targeting to preferred
      cell subpopulations can be achieved through the use of different
      cell type-specific promoters. For example, Chop2 expression may be
      driven by the mGluR6 promoter for targeted expression in ON-type
      retinal neurons (i.e., ON type ganglion cells and/or ON type
      bipolar cells) while a hypopolarizing channel, such as
      halorhodopsin, expression is driven by the NK-3 promoter for
      targeted expression in OFF-type retinal neurons (i.e., OFF type
      ganglion cells and/or OFF type bipolar cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] An alternative approach to restore ON and OFF pathways in
      the retina is achieved by, expressing a depolarizing light sensor,
      such as ChR2, to rod bipolar cells or AII amacrine. In this
      approach, the depolarization of rod bipolar cells or AII amacrine
      cells can lead to the ON and OFF responses at the levels of cone
      bipolar cells and the downstream retinal ganglion cells. Thus, the
      ON and OFF pathways that are inherent in the retina are
      maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The present invention can be formulated to a pharmaceutical
      composition or medicament suitable for administration into a
      subject or patient. Suitable routes of administration include, for
      example, intravitreal, intraocular, or subretinal injection.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Such formulations comprise a pharmaceutically and/or
      physiologically acceptable vehicle, diluent, carrier or excipient,
      such as buffered saline or other buffers, e.g., HEPES, to maintain
      physiologic pH. For a discussion of such components and their
      formulation, see, generally, Gennaro, A E., Remington: The Science
      and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins
      Publishers; 2003 or latest edition). See also, WO00/15822. If the
      preparation is to be stored for long periods, it may be frozen,
      for example, in the presence of glycerol.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The pharmaceutical composition described above is
      administered to a subject having a visual or blinding disease by
      any appropriate route, preferably by intravitreal or subretinal
      injection, depending on the retinal layer being targeted.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Disclosures from Bennett and colleagues (cited herein)
      concern targeting of retinal pigment epithelium—the most distal
      layer from the vitreal space. According to the present invention,
      the Chop2 construct or polypeptide is targeted to retinal cells,
      i.e., retinal ganglion cells or bipolar cells. Such cells are
      known to be reasonably well-accessible to intravitreal injection
      as disclosed herein. Intravitreal and/or subretinal injection can
      provide the necessary access to the bipolar cells, especially in
      circumstances in which the photoreceptor cell layer is absent due
      to degeneration—which is the case in certain forms of degeneration
      that the present invention is intended to overcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] To test for the vector's ability to express the Chop2
      mutants of the present invention, specifically in mammalian
      retinal neurons, by AAV-mediated delivery, a combination of a
      preferred promoter sequence linked to a reporter gene such as LacZ
      or GFP linked to a SV40 poly A sequence can be inserted into a
      plasmid and packaged into rAAV virus particles, concentrated,
      tested for contaminating adenovirus and titered for rAAV using an
      infectious center assay. The right eyes of a number of test
      subjects, preferably inbred mice, can be injected sub-retinally
      with about 1 µl of the rAAV preparation (e.g., greater than about
      10&lt;10 &gt;infectious units ml). Two weeks later, the right
      (test) and left (control) eyes of half the animals may be removed,
      fixed and stained with an appropriate substrate or antibody or
      other substance to reveal the presence of the reporter gene. A
      majority of the test retinas in injected eyes will exhibited a
      focal stained region, e.g., blue for LacZ/Xgal, or green for GFP
      consistent with a subretinal bleb of the injected virus creating a
      localized retinal detachment. All control eyes may be negative for
      the reporter gene product. Reporter gene expression examined in
      mice sacrificed at later periods is detected for at least 10 weeks
      post-injection, which suggests persistent expression of the
      reporter transgene.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In one embodiment, the Chop2 constructs are packaged in
      adenoviral vectors for transgene delivery. An effective amount of
      rAAV virions carrying a nucleic acid sequence encoding the Chop2
      DNA under the control of the promoter of choice, preferably a
      constitutive CMV promoter or a cell-specific promoter such as
      mGluR6, is preferably in the range of between about 10&lt;10
      &gt;to about 10&lt;13 &gt;rAAV infectious units in a volume of
      between about 150 and about 800 µl per injection. The rAAV
      infectious units can be measured according to McLaughlin, S K et
      al., 1988, J Virol 62:1963. More preferably, the effective amount
      is between about 10&lt;10 &gt;and about 10&lt;12 &gt;rAAV
      infectious units and the injection volume is preferably between
      about 250 and about 500 µl. Other dosages and volumes, preferably
      within these ranges but possibly outside them, may be selected by
      the treating professional, taking into account the physical state
      of the subject (preferably a human), who is being treated,
      including, age, weight, general health, and the nature and
      severity of the particular ocular disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] It may also be desirable to administer additional doses
      (“boosters”) of the present nucleic acid(s) or rAAV compositions.
      For example, depending upon the duration of the transgene
      expression within the ocular target cell, a second treatment may
      be administered after 6 months or yearly, and may be similarly
      repeated. Neutralizing antibodies to AAV are not expected to be
      generated in view of the routes and doses used, thereby permitting
      repeat treatment rounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] The need for such additional doses can be monitored by the
      treating professional using, for example, well-known
      electrophysiological and other retinal and visual function tests
      and visual behavior tests. The treating professional will be able
      to select the appropriate tests applying routine skill in the art.
      It may be desirable to inject larger volumes of the composition in
      either single or multiple doses to further improve the relevant
      outcome parameters.<br>
      <br>
      Ocular Disorders<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The ocular disorders for which the present Chop2 proteins,
      and the resulting ChR2 proteins, are intended and may be used to
      improve one or more parameters of vision include, but are not
      limited to, developmental abnormalities that affect both anterior
      and posterior segments of the eye. Anterior segment disorders
      include glaucoma, cataracts, corneal dystrophy, keratoconus.
      Posterior segment disorders include blinding disorders caused by
      photoreceptor malfunction and/or death caused by retinal
      dystrophies and degenerations. Retinal disorders include
      congenital stationary night blindness, age-related macular
      degeneration, congenital cone dystrophies, and a large group of
      retinitis-pigmentosa (RP)-related disorders. These disorders
      include genetically pre-disposed death of photoreceptor cells,
      rods and cones in the retina, occurring at various ages. Among
      those are severe retinopathies, such as subtypes of RP itself that
      progresses with age and causes blindness in childhood and early
      adulthood and RP-associated diseases, such as genetic subtypes of
      LCA, which frequently results in loss of vision during childhood,
      as early as the first year of life. The latter disorders are
      generally characterized by severe reduction, and often complete
      loss of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones. (Trabulsi, E I, ed.,
      Genetic Diseases of the Eye, Oxford University Press, NY, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In particular, the Chop2 and ChR2 proteins of the present
      invention useful for the treatment and/or restoration of at least
      partial vision to subjects that have lost vision due to ocular
      disorders, such as RPE-associated retinopathies, which are
      characterized by a long-term preservation of ocular tissue
      structure despite loss of function and by the association between
      function loss and the defect or absence of a normal gene in the
      ocular cells of the subject. A variety of such ocular disorders
      are known, such as childhood onset blinding diseases, retinitis
      pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, as
      well as ocular blinding diseases known in the art. It is
      anticipated that these other disorders, as well as blinding
      disorders of presently unknown causation which later are
      characterized by the same description as above, may also be
      successfully treated by the Chop2 and ChR2 proteins of the present
      invention. Thus, the particular ocular disorder treated by the
      present invention may include the above-mentioned disorders and a
      number of diseases which have yet to be so characterized.<br>
      <br>
      Optogenetics<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The emerging field of optogenetics involves the combination
      of genetic and optical methods to control specific events in
      targeted cells of a living tissue. Optogeneics may be used within
      freely moving mammals and other animals. Moreover, the temporal
      precision (millisecond-timescale) of optogeneic methods are
      sufficient to function within intact biological systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The instant invention provides Chop2-gene therapy to
      retinal tissues of the eye, by introducing into retinal cells a
      nucleic acid or polypeptide encoding for at least one mutant form
      of Chop2. Mutant Chop2/ChR2 proteins of the invention are
      specifically adapted to be light-activated at lower thresholds of
      light intensities than their wild type counterparts. Accordingly,
      the mutant Chop2/ChR2 proteins of the invention can be used to
      activate cells of the retina and visual system using less damaging
      sources of illumination. The mutant Chop2/ChR2 proteins also
      conduct larger photocurrents upon activation, resulting in a more
      robust or efficacious response from the mutant
      Chop2/ChR2-expressing cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] For example, mutant Chop2 proteins of the invention are
      administered to a subject through local, intravitreous or
      subretinal, injection of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a mutant
      Chop2, a mutant Chop2 polypeptide molecule, or a cell expressing a
      mutant Chop2/ChR2. Retinal cells of the subject express the mutant
      Chop2 proteins within the plasma membrane. When the transfected or
      transformed retinal cells encounter light radiation, the
      transfected or transformed retinal cells transduce an improved or
      restored signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] These methods may be used in subjects of normal and/or
      impaired vision. Chop2/ChR2 mutants of the invention may preserve,
      improve, or restore vision. Moreover, Chop2/ChR2 mutants of the
      invention are used to preserve, improve, or restore the
      transduction of non-visual information from photosensitive retinal
      ganglion cells to the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The term “vision” as used herein is defined as the ability
      of an organism to usefully detect light as a stimulus for
      differentiation or action. Vision is intended to encompass the
      following:<br>
      1. Light detection or perception—the ability to discern whether or
      not light is present;<br>
      2. Light projection—the ability to discern the direction from
      which a light stimulus is coming;<br>
      3. Resolution—the ability to detect differing brightness levels
      (i.e., contrast) in a grating or letter target; and<br>
      4. Recognition—the ability to recognize the shape of a visual
      target by reference to the differing contrast levels within the
      target.<br>
      Thus, “vision” includes the ability to simply detect the presence
      of light. The polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding mutant
      Chop2 of the present invention can be used to improve or restore
      vision, wherein the improvement or restoration in vision includes,
      for example, increases in light detection or perception, increase
      in light sensitivity or photosensitivity in response to a light
      stimulus, increase in the ability to discern the direction from
      which a light stimulus is coming, increase in the ability to
      detect differing brightness levels, increase in the ability to
      recognize the shape of a visual target, and increases in visual
      evoked potential or transmission from the retina to the cortex. As
      such, improvement or restoration of vision may or may not include
      full restoration of sight, i.e., wherein the vision of the patient
      treated with the present invention is restored to the degree to
      the vision of a non-affected individual. The visual recovery
      described in the animal studies described below may, in human
      terms, place the person on the low end of vision function by
      increasing one aspect of vision (i.e., light sensitivity, or
      visual evoked potential) without restoring full sight.
      Nevertheless, placement at such a level would be a significant
      benefit because these individuals could be trained in mobility and
      potentially in low order resolution tasks which would provide them
      with a greatly improved level of visual independence compared to
      total blindness. Even basic light perception can be used by
      visually impaired individuals, whose vision is improved using the
      present compositions and methods, to accomplish specific daily
      tasks and improve general mobility, capability, and quality of
      life.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The degree of restoration of vision can be determined
      through the measurement of vision before, and preferably after,
      administering a vector comprising, for example, DNA encoding
      Chop2. Vision can be measured using any of a number of methods
      well-known in the art or methods not yet established. Vision, as
      improved or restored by the present invention, can be measured by
      any of the following visual responses:<br>
      1. a light detection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus—in which evidence is sought for a reliable response
      of an indication or movement in the general direction of the light
      by the subject individual when the light it is turned on;<br>
      2. a light projection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus in which evidence is sought for a reliable response
      of indication or movement in the specific direction of the light
      by the individual when the light is turned on;<br>
      3. light resolution by the subject of a light vs. dark patterned
      visual stimulus, which measures the subject's capability of
      resolving light vs dark patterned visual stimuli as evidenced by:<br>
      a. the presence of demonstrable reliable optokinetically produced
      nystagmoid eye movements and/or related head or body movements
      that demonstrate tracking of the target (see above) and/or<br>
      b. the presence of a reliable ability to discriminate a pattern
      visual stimulus and to indicate such discrimination by verbal or
      non-verbal means, including, for example pointing, or pressing a
      bar or a button; or<br>
      4. electrical recording of a visual cortex response to a light
      flash stimulus or a pattern visual stimulus, which is an endpoint
      of electrical transmission from a restored retina to the visual
      cortex, also referred to as the visual evoked potential (VEP).
      Measurement may be by electrical recording on the scalp surface at
      the region of the visual cortex, on the cortical surface, and/or
      recording within cells of the visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Thus, improvement or restoration of vision, according to
      the present invention, can include, but is not limited to:
      increases in amplitude or kinetics of photocurents or electrical
      response in response to light stimulus in the retinal cells,
      increases in light sensitivity (i.e., lowering the threshold light
      intensity required for initiating a photocurrent or electrical
      response in response to light stimulus, thereby requiring less or
      lower light to evoke a photocurrent) of the retinal cells,
      increases in number or amplitude of light-evoked spiking or spike
      firings, increases in light responses to the visual cortex, which
      includes increasing in visual evoked potential transmitted from
      the retina or retinal cells to the visual cortex or the brain.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Both in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the various
      parameters of the present invention may be used, including
      recognized animal models of blinding human ocular disorders. Large
      animal models of human retinopathy, e.g., childhood blindness, are
      useful. The examples provided herein allow one of skill in the art
      to readily anticipate that this method may be similarly used in
      treating a range of retinal diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] While earlier studies by others have demonstrated that
      retinal degeneration can be retarded by gene therapy techniques,
      the present invention demonstrates a definite physiological
      recovery of function, which is expected to generate or improve
      various parameters of vision, including behavioral parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Behavioral measures can be obtained using known animal
      models and tests, for example performance in a water maze, wherein
      a subject in whom vision has been preserved or restored to varying
      extents will swim toward light (Hayes, J M et al., 1993, Behav
      Genet. 23:395-403).<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In models in which blindness is induced during adult life
      or congenital blindness develops slowly enough that the individual
      experiences vision before losing it, training of the subject in
      various tests may be done. In this way, when these tests are
      re-administered after visual loss to test the efficacy of the
      present compositions and methods for their vision-restorative
      effects, animals do not have to learn the tasks de novo while in a
      blind state. Other behavioral tests do not require learning and
      rely on the instinctiveness of certain behaviors. An example is
      the optokinetic nystagmus test (Balkema G W et al., 1984, Invest
      Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 25:795-800; Mitchiner J C et al., 1976, Vision
      Res. 16:1169-71).<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The present invention may also be used in combination with
      other forms of vision therapy known in the art to improve or
      restore vision. For example, the use of visual prostheses, which
      include retinal implants, cortical implants, lateral geniculate
      nucleus implants, or optic nerve implants. Thus, in addition to
      genetic modification of surviving retinal neurons using the
      present methods, the subject being treated may be provided with a
      visual prosthesis before, at the same time as, or after the
      molecular method is employed. The effectiveness of visual
      prosthetics can be improved with training of the individual, thus
      enhancing the potential impact of the Chop2 transformation of
      patient cells as contemplated herein. Training methods, such as
      habituation training characterized by training the subject to
      recognize recognize (i) varying levels of light and/or pattern
      stimulation, and/or (ii) environmental stimulation from a common
      light source or object as would be understood by one skilled in
      the art; and orientation and mobility training characterized by
      training the subject to detect visually local objects and move
      among said objects more effectively than without the training. In
      fact, any visual stimulation techniques that are typically used in
      the field of low vision rehabilitation are applicable here.<br>

      EXAMPLES<br>
      <br>
      Example 1<br>
      <br>
      Generation of Labeled Mutant Chop2 Constructs<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Mutations were made on a codon optimized Chop2-GFP fusion
      protein to create single and double mutations at the L132 (Leucine
      132) and T159 (Threonine 159) sites. Several mutants were
      generated, for example, single mutants such as L132A, L132C,
      T159A, T159C, and T 159S, and double mutants such as L132C/T159C,
      L132C/T159S, L132A/T159C, and L132C/T159A. Chop2-GFP transgenes
      were cloned into a rAAV vector under the control of a CAG promoter
      using methods known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      In Vitro Analysis of Mutant Chop2 Constructs<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The functional properties of each mutant Chop2, or a
      combination thereof, were first examined in HEK cells. Chop2
      constructs were delivered to HEK cells by adenoviral infection,
      for example. Upon expression of the WT or mutant Chop2, functional
      WT and mutant ChR2 channels were formed. Measurements of the light
      sensitivity and other properties of the ChR2 channels were
      assessed as described herein. The light stimuli
      (photons/cm&lt;2&gt;.s at 460 nm) were generated by a xenon arc
      lamp and attenuated by neutral density filters: ND4.0
      (2.8×10&lt;14&gt;), ND3.0 (1.4×10&lt;15&gt;), ND2.5
      (4.8×10&lt;15&gt;); ND2.0 (1.6×10&lt;16&gt;), ND1.0
      (1.3×10&lt;17&gt;), ND0 (1.2×10&lt;18&gt;). Light evoked currents
      were measured from wild-type ChR2, T159C, L132C, L132C/T159C, and
      L132C/T159S. Patch clamp recordings were performed using methods
      known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Representative recordings from this experiment comparing
      light sensitivity between the Chop2 constructs demonstrated that
      mutations at L132 alone or in combination with mutation at T159
      show increased photocurrent in comparison to WT (FIGS. 1A and 1B).
      FIG. 1B shows the same current traces at a different scale to
      illustrate the difference in amplitude of the photocurrents
      between WT ChR2 and ChR2 mutants more clearly. FIG. 1B
      specifically compares the current traces resulting from light
      stimulation using the neutral density filter (ND 2.5), equivalent
      to 4.8×10&lt;15 &gt;photos/cm&lt;2&gt;/s; the traces are
      designated by the arrows. The amplitude of the photocurrent of the
      L132C mutant is larger than that of WT; the amplitude of the
      photocurrent of double mutant L132C/T159C is larger than that of
      L132C; and the amplitude of the photocurrent of the L132C/T159S
      mutant larger than L132/T159C. The current traces of the ChR2
      mutants, particularly double mutants L132C/T159C and L132C/T159S,
      also show slower deactivation kinetics when compared to WT and
      L132C.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] FIG. 2 shows the representative recordings of light-evoked
      currents from WT ChR2, L132C, L132C/T159C, and L132C/T159S after
      stimulation by a 10 ms light pulse (1.2×10&lt;18
      &gt;photons/cm&lt;2&gt;/s at 460 nm wavelength) to compare the
      deactivation time course, or decay time course after the light is
      off. Mutant ChR2 show longer deactivation time courses, with the
      double mutant L132C/T159S having the longest. Higher light
      sensitivity, as demonstrated by L132C/T159C and L132C/T159S, may
      be correlated with slower channel kinetics.<br>

      In Vivo Ocular Administration and Analysis of Mutant Chop2
      Constructs<br>
      <br>
      [0117] AAV2 virus vectors carrying mutant Chop2-GFP constructs
      driven by CAG promoter were made and injected intravitreally into
      the eyes of C57BL/6J adult mice. Adult mice were anesthetized by
      IP injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg).
      Under a dissecting microscope, an incision was made by scissors
      through the eyelid to expose the sclera. A small perforation was
      made in the sclera region posterior to the lens with a needle and
      viral vector suspension of 0.8-1.5 µl at the concentration of
      approximately 10&lt;11 &gt;genomic particles/ml was injected into
      intravitreal space through the hole with a Hamilton syringe with a
      32-gauge blunt-ended needle. For each animal, usually only one eye
      was injected with viral vectors carrying a Chop2 construct, and
      the other eye was uninjected or injected with control viral
      vectors carrying GFP alone. Upon expression of the WT or mutant
      Chop2 of the present invention, functional WT or mutant ChR2
      channels were formed utilizing endogenous retinal, and the
      properties of these ChR2 proteins were assessed as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] ChR2-mediated light responses were examined by using
      multi-electrode array recordings from whole-mount retinas. Light
      stimuli (photons/cm&lt;2&gt;/s) was generated by a 473 nm blue
      laser and attenuated by neutral density filters: ND0
      (6.3×10&lt;16&gt;), ND1.0 (7.4×10&lt;15&gt;), ND1.5
      (2.7×10&lt;15&gt;), ND2.0 (7.3×10&lt;14&gt;), ND2.5
      (3.2×10&lt;14&gt;), ND3.0 (8.5×10&lt;13&gt;), ND3.5
      (3.8×10&lt;13&gt;), and ND4.0 (9.5×10&lt;12&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The multielectrode array recordings were based on the
      procedures reported by Tian and Copenhagen (2003). Briefly, the
      retina was dissected and placed photoreceptor side down on a
      nitrocellulose filter paper strip (Millipore Corp., Bedford,
      Mass.). The mounted retina was placed in the MEA-60 multielectrode
      array recording chamber of 30 µm diameter electrodes spaced 200 µm
      apart (Multi Channel System MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), with
      the ganglion cell layer facing the recording electrodes. The
      retina was continuously perfused in oxygenated extracellular
      solution at 34° C. during all experiments. The extracellular
      solution contained (in mM): NaCl, 124; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2,
      2; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; and glucose, 22 (pH 7.35 with 95% O2
      and 5% CO2). Recordings were usually started 60 min after the
      retina was positioned in the recording chamber. The interval
      between onsets of each light stimulus was 10-15 s. The signals
      were filtered between 200 Hz (low cut off) and 20 kHz (high cut
      off). The responses from individual neurons were analyzed using
      Offline Sorter software (Plexon, Inc., Dallas, Tex.).<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Single mutant Chop2/ChR2 mutants, i.e., L132 and T159C,
      markedly lower the threshold light intensity that is required to
      evoke a ChR2-mediated photocurrent. Moreover, several double
      mutants, including L132C/T159C, L132A/T159C, and L132C/T159S, were
      found to further increase the photocurrent at low light
      intensities. Different neutral density filters were used to
      attenuate the light stimuli to differentiate the light-evoked
      responses of the Chop2 constructs in low light. Spiking activity
      of retinal ganglion cells mediated by the mutants of the present
      invention was observed at the light intensities about 1.5 to 2 log
      units lower than the light level that is required to elicit the
      spiking activity with wild-type ChR2 (FIG. 3). Specifically, WT
      ChR2 exhibited did not exhibit any spiking activity in response to
      light stimuli with neutral density filter 2.5 (3.2×10&lt;14
      &gt;photons/cm&lt;2&gt;/s) while ChR2 mutants (L132C, L132C/T159C,
      and L132C/T159S) demonstrate spiking activity. In fact, the ChR2
      mutants still exhibited spiking activity in response to light with
      neutral density filters 3.0 and 3.5. Therefore, ChR2 mutants of
      the present invention possess higher light sensitivity and, thus,
      a markedly lower threshold light intensity that is required to
      elicit a ChR2-mediated photocurrent. Moreover, ChR2 double mutants
      possess a higher light sensitivity than single mutants, i.e.
      L132C. In addition, the spike firing of retinal ganglion cells
      expressing L132C/T159C and L132/T159S could follow a light flicker
      frequency of up to 15 Hz and 5 Hz, respectively (FIG. 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The L132C/T159A mutant shows high light sensitivity,
      probably the most light sensitive among these mutants, but it also
      shows extremely slow off-rate (the channel continue open for many
      sends after light off). Interestingly, it can be turned off more
      quickly using a light with long-wavelengths, such as yellow light.
      The L132C/T159A mutant (encoded by SEQ ID NOs: 24 and 25)
      demonstrates significant potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Given the trade-off between light sensitivity and channel
      kinetics, Chop2/ChR2 mutants that demonstrate a balance between
      light sensitivity and channel kinetics, such as L132C/T159C or
      L132C/T159S, may be suitable for the application of vision
      restoration.<br>

      Analysis of Mutant Chop2 Constructs in Mouse Models of Disease<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Mouse models of degenerative ocular diseases are known in
      the art. For example, homozygous rd1 (rd1/rd1) mice are a commonly
      used photoreceptor degeneration model. Rd1 mice carry a null
      mutation in a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, PDE6, similar to some
      forms of retinitis pigmentosa in humans. Other well-established
      mouse models of ocular disease that may be of particular interest
      to demonstrate ChR2 mutant safety and efficacy include rds (also
      known as Prph&lt;Rd2&gt;), rd3, rd4, rd5, rd6, rd7, rd8, rd9,
      Pde6b&lt;rd10&gt;, or cpfl1 mice.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The Chop2-GFP constructs of the present invention can be
      injected intravitreally into the eyes of newborn (P1) or adult
      mice at 2-12 months of age. GFP signal can be observed in the
      Chop2-GFP-injected retinas, to determine the levels of ChR2
      expression or expression in particular populations of cells, such
      as the retinal ganglion cells. Mutant Chop2-GFP expression can be
      monitored for a predetermined amount of time, i.e. 3-6 months, or
      1 year after viral injection. Patch-clamp and multichannel array
      recordings can be performed using the methods known in the art and
      described herein to measure the light-evoked responses of mutant
      Chop2-GFP-expressing cells in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Additional techniques and tests are well-established in the
      art to test for the restoration of light sensitivity or vision.
      Visual evoked potentials from the Chop2-GFP expressing cells or
      visual cortex can be examined, as described in PCT publication WO
      2007/131180. Other tests include behavioral assessments of the
      visual acuity in the mice, i.e., virtual optomotor test and visual
      water maze.<br>

        <b>Restoration of Visual Responses by In Vivo Delivery of
          Rhodopsin Nucleic Acids</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Nucleic acid vectors encoding light-gated cation-selective
      membrane channels, in particular channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2),
      converted inner retinal neurons to photosensitive cells in
      photoreceptor-degenerated retina in an animal model. Such
      treatment restored visual perception and various aspects of
      vision. A method of restoring light sensitivity to a retina of a
      subject suffering from vision loss due to photoreceptor
      degeneration, as in retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration,
      is provided. The method comprises delivering to the subject by
      intravitreal or subretinal injection, the above nucleic acid
      vector which comprises an open reading frame encoding a rhodopsin,
      to which is operatively linked a promoter and transcriptional
      regulatory sequences, so that the nucleic acid is expressed in
      inner retinal neurons. These cells, normally light-insensitive,
      are converted to a light-sensitive state and transmit visual
      information to the brain, compensating for the loss, and leading
      to restoration of various visual capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention in the field of molecular biology and
      medicine relates to the use of microbial-type rhodopsins, such as
      the light-gated cation-selective membrane channel,
      channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2) to convert inner retinal neurons to
      photosensitive cells in photoreceptor-degenerated retina, thereby
      restoring visual perception and various aspects of vision.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Background Art</b><br>
      <br>
      Vision normally begins when rods and cones, also called
      photoreceptors, convert light signals to electrical signals that
      are then relayed through second- and third-order retinal neurons
      and the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus and, then to
      the visual cortex where visual images are formed (Baylor, D, 1996,
      Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:560-565; Wassle, H, 2004, Nat. Rev.
      Neurosci. 5:747-57). For a patient who is vision-impaired due to
      the loss of photoreceptors, visual perception may be induced by
      providing electrical stimulation at one of these downstream
      neuronal locations, depending on the nature of the particular
      impairment.<br>
      <br>
      The severe loss of photoreceptor cells can be caused by congenital
      retinal degenerative diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP)
      (Sung, C H et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 :6481-85;
      Humphries, P et al., 1992, Science 256:804-8; Weleber, R G et al.,
      in: S J Ryan, Ed, Retina, Mosby, St. Louis (1994), pp. 335-466),
      and can result in complete blindness. Age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD) is also a result of the degeneration and death
      of photoreceptor cells, which can cause severe visual impairment
      within the centrally located best visual area of the visual field.<br>
      <br>
      Both rodents and humans go progressively blind because, as rods
      and cones are lost, there is little or no signal sent to the
      brain. Inherited retinal degenerations that cause partial or total
      blindness affect one in 3000 people worldwide. Patients afflicted
      with Usher's Syndrome develop progressive deafness in addition to
      retinal degeneration. There are currently no effective treatments
      or cures for these conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Basic research on approaches for retinal degeneration has long
      been classified into two approaches: (1) treatments to preserve
      remaining photoreceptors in patients with retinal degenerative
      disease, and (2) methods to replace photoreceptors lost to retinal
      degeneration. Patients afflicted with retinal disease often group
      themselves into those seeking ways to slow the loss of their
      diminishing vision and those who are already legally blind (“no
      light perception”), having lost their photoreceptors because of an
      inherited eye disease or trauma.<br>
      <br>
      For the first approach, neuroprotection with neurotrophic factors
      (LaVail, M M et al., 1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:11249-53)
      and virus-vector-based delivery of wild-type genes for recessive
      null mutations (Acland, G M et al., 2001, Nat. Genet. 28:92-95)
      have come the furthest—to the point of a Phase I/II clinical trial
      (Hauswirth, W W, 2005, Retina 25, S60; Jacobson, S, Protocol
      #0410-677, World Wide Web URL:
      webconferences.com/nihoba/16_jun—2005.html) gaining approval in
      the U.S. for adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated gene
      replacement therapy for Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), a
      specific form of retinal degeneration. Unfortunately, for patients
      in advanced stages of retinal degeneration, this approach is not
      applicable, and the photoreceptor cells must be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      For replacement, one approach involves transplantation
      (replacement) of normal tissues or cells to the diseased retina.
      Another involves electrical-stimulation of remaining non-visual
      neurons via retinal implants in lieu of the lost photoreceptive
      cells (prosthetic substitution). However, both methods face many
      fundamental obstacles. For example, for successful
      transplantation, the implanted tissue or cells must integrate
      functionally within the host retina. The electrical-stimulation
      approaches are burdened with mechanistic and technical
      difficulties as well as problems related to lack of long-term
      biocompatibility of the implanted bionic devices. In summary,
      there exist no effective vision-restoring therapies for inherited
      blinding disease.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors' strategy as disclosed herein, requires a
      suitable molecular “light-sensor.” Previous studies reported the
      heterologous expression of Drosophila rhodopsin (Zemelman, B V et
      al., 2002, Neuron 33:15-22) and, more recently, melanopsin, the
      putative photopigment of the intrinsic photosensitive retinal
      ganglion cells (Melyan, Z. et al., 2005, Nature 433:741-5; Panda,
      S. et al., 2005, Science 307:600-604; Qiu, X. et al., 2005, Nature
      433:745-9). These photopigments, however, are coupled to membrane
      channels via a G protein signaling cascade and use cis-isoforms of
      retinaldehyde as their chromophore. As a result, expression of
      multiple genes would be required to render photosensitivity. In
      addition, their light response kinetics is rather slow. Recent
      studies aimed to improve the temporal resolution described the
      engineering of a light-sensitive K&lt;-&gt; channel (Banghart et
      al., 2004, Nat. Neurosci. 7:1381-6), though this required
      introduction of an exogenous “molecular tether” and use of UV
      light to unblock the channel. This engineered channel was proposed
      to be potentially useful for restoring light sensitivity in
      degenerate retinas, but its expression and function in retinal
      neurons remain unknown.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention makes use of microbial-type rhodopsins
      similar to bacteriorhodopsin (Oesterhelt, D et al., 1973, Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 70:2853-7), whose conformation change is
      caused by reversible photoisomerization of their chromophore
      group, the all-trans isoform of retinaldehyde, and is directly
      coupled to ion movement through the membrane (Oesterhelt, D.,
      1998, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 8:489-500). Two microbial-type
      opsins, channelopsin-1 and -2 (Chop1 and Chop2), have recently
      been cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Nagel, G. et al.,
      2002, Science 296:2395-8; Sineshchekov, O A et al., 2002, Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:8689-94; Nagel, G. et al., 2003, Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 13940-45) and shown to form directly
      light-gated membrane channels when expressed in Xenopus laevis
      oocytes or HEK293 cells in the presence of all-trans retinal.
      Chop2, a seven transmembrane domain protein, becomes
      photo-switchable when bound to the chromophore all-trans retinal.
      Chop2 is particularly attractive because its functional
      light-sensitive channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2 retinalidene
      abbreviated ChR2) with the attached chromophore is permeable to
      physiological cations. Unlike animal rhodopsins, which only bind
      the 11-cis conformation, Chop2 binds all-trans retinal isomers,
      obviating the need for the all-trans to 11-cis isomerization
      reaction supplied by the vertebrate visual cycle. However, the
      long-term compatibility of expressing ChR2 in native neurons in
      vivo in general and the properties of ChR2-mediated light
      responses in retinal neurons in particular remained unknown until
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The present strategy is feasible because histological studies,
      both in animal models of photoreceptor degeneration (Chang, B. et
      al., 2002, Vision Res. 42:517-25; Olshevskaya, E V et al., 2004,
      J. Neurosci. 24:6078-85) and in postmortem patient eyes with
      almost complete photoreceptor loss due to RP (Santos, A H et al.,
      1997, Arch. Ophthalmol 115:511-15; Milam, A H et al., 1998, Prog.
      Retin. Eye Res. 1 7:175-205), reported the preservation of a
      significant number of inner retinal neurons.<br>
      <br>
      Retinal gene therapy has been considered a possible therapeutic
      option for man. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,702 refers to
      methods for generating a genetically engineered ocular cell by
      contacting the cell with an exogenous nucleic acid under
      conditions in which the exogenous nucleic acid is taken up by the
      cell for expression. The exogenous nucleic acid is described as a
      retrovirus, an adenovirus, an adeno-associated virus or a plasmid.
      See, also, WO 00/15822 (Mar. 23, 2000) and WO 98/48097 (Oct. 29,
      1998)<br>
      <br>
      Efforts in such gene therapy have focused mainly on slowing down
      retinal degeneration in rodent models of primary photoreceptor
      diseases. Normal genes and mutation-specific ribozymes delivered
      to photoreceptors have prolonged the lifetime of these cells
      otherwise doomed for apoptotic cell death (Bennett, J., et al.
      1996 Nat. Med. 2, 649-54; Bennett, J., et al. 1998, Gene Therapy
      5, 1156-64; Kumar-Singh, R et al., 1998 Hum. Mol. Genet. 7,
      1893-900; Lewin, A S et al. 1998, Nat. Med. 4, 967-71; Ali, R et
      al. 2000, Nat. Genet. 25, 306-10; Takahashi, M. et al., 1999, J
      Virol. 73, 7812-6; Lau, D., et al., 2000, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.
      Sci. 41, 3622-33; and LaVail, M M, et al. 2000, Proc Natl Acad Sci
      USA 97, 11488-93).<br>
      <br>
      Retinal gene transfer of a reporter gene, green fluorescent
      protein (GFP), using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)
      was demonstrated in normal primates (Bennett, J et al. 1999 Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96, 9920-25). However, the restoration of
      vision in a blinding disease of animals, particularly in humans
      and other mammals, caused by genetic defects in retinal pigment
      epithelium (RPE) and/or photoreceptor cells has not been achieved.
      Jean Bennett and colleagues have described the rescue of
      photoreceptors using gene therapy in a model of rapid degeneration
      of photoreceptors using mutations of the RP65 gene and replacement
      therapy with the normal gene to replace or supplant the mutant
      gene. See, for example, US Patent Publication 2004/0022766 of
      Acland, Bennett and colleagues. This therapy showed some success
      in a naturally-occurring dog model of severe disease of retinal
      degenerations—the RPE65 mutant dog, which is analogous to human
      LCA.<br>
      <br>
      Advantages of the present approach include the fact that it does
      not require introducing exogenous cells and tissues or physical
      devices, thus avoiding many obstacles encountered by existing
      approaches; the present invention is applicable for the reversal
      of vision loss or blindness caused by many retinal degenerative
      diseases. By expressing photosensitive membrane-channels or
      molecules in surviving retinal neurons of the diseased retina by
      viral based gene therapy method, the present invention can produce
      permanent treatment of the vision loss or blindness with high
      spatial and temporal resolution for the restored vision.<br>

      present invention should be understood to include a proviso or
      provisos that exclude of disclaim any such species that were
      previously disclosed. The aspects of the present invention which
      are not anticipated by the disclosure of such publications are
      also unobvious from the disclosure of these publications, due at
      least in part to the unexpectedly superior results disclosed or
      alleged herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is directed to the genetic conversion of
      surviving light-insensitive inner retinal neurons in a retina in
      which photoreceptors are degenerating or have already died, into
      directly photosensitive neuronal cells, thereby imparting light
      sensitivity to such retinas and restoring one or more aspects of
      visual responses and functional vision to a subject suffering from
      such degeneration. By restoring light sensitivity to a retina
      lacking this capacity, due to disease, the invention provides a
      mechanism for the most basic light-responses that are required for
      vision. Said another way, the present invention introduces a
      “light sensors” into retinal neurons that normally do not have
      them, to compensate for loss of retinal photoreceptor cells.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors and colleagues investigated the feasibility
      of using Chop2/ChR2 to restore light sensitivity to the retinas
      that have undergone rod and cone degeneration. The results
      presented herein show long-term expression of Chop2/ChR2 in rodent
      inner retinal neurons in vivo. The results also show that these
      inner retinal neurons can express a sufficient number of
      functional ChR2 channels to produce robust membrane depolarization
      or action potential firing without an exogenous supply of
      all-trans retinal. Furthermore, the present inventors demonstrated
      that the expression of ChR2 in a photoreceptor-deficient mouse
      model not only enables retinal ganglion cells to encode light
      signals but also restores visually evoked responses in the visual
      cortex.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to the restoration of vision
      loss to individuals that have lost vision or are blind as a result
      of retinal photoreceptor degeneration. The invention enables
      retinal neurons in such a diseased retina to respond to light by
      expressing photosensitive membrane-channels or molecules in these
      retinal neurons. Preferred the light-sensitive channels or
      molecules are microbial type light-gate channel rhodopsins, such
      as ChR2, ChR1, light-driven ion pump, such as bacteriorhodopsins
      (Lanyi, J K, 2004, Annu Rev Physiol. 66:665-88), halorhodopsins
      (Lanyi, J K, 1990, Physiol Rev. 70:319-30), and their derivatives<br>
      <br>
      As discovered by the present inventors, retinal neurons that are
      normally not light sensitive (directly) in the retinas of blind
      mice, such as retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and bipolar cells, can
      respond to light when a green algae protein called
      channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or a biologically active fragment or a
      conservative amino acid substitution variant thereof, is inserted
      into the neuronal cell membranes. The study was conducted with
      mice that had been genetically bred to lose rods and cones, the
      light-sensitive cells in the retina, a condition that models RP in
      humans. In addition to RP, there are many forms of retinal
      degenerative eye diseases that possibly could be treated by the
      present approach.<br>
      <br>
      As disclosed herein, visual function can be restored by conveying
      light-sensitive properties to other surviving cells in the retina
      after the rods and cones have died. Using a DNA transfer approach,
      the present inventors introduced the light-absorbing protein ChR2
      into the mouse retinal neurons that survived after the rods and
      cones had died. These cells became light sensitive and sent
      signals via the optic nerve and higher order visual pathways to
      the visual cortex where visual perception occurs. Using
      electrophysiologic means, it was shown that the signals reached
      the visual cortex in a majority of the ChR2-treated mice. The
      light sensitivity persisted for at least six months, suggesting
      that the subject might regain usable vision with additional
      maneuvers disclosed herein, such as expressing ChR2 in other types
      of retinal cells or modifying the light sensitivity and/or
      wavelength selectivity of ChR2, or using similar microbial
      proteins, to produce diverse light-sensitive channels to improve
      outcomes for the restoration of normal vision.<br>
      <br>
      As noted by persons of skill in this art, this strategy represents
      a “paradigm shift in the field” referring to a “new field of
      re-engineering retinal interneurons as genetically modified
      ‘prosthetic’ cells,” The present invention “opened the possibility
      of genetically modifying the surviving retinal interneurons to
      function as a replacement light-sensing receptor,” (Flannery, J
      and Greenberg, K., 2006, Neuron. 50:1-3; written as a preview to a
      publication in the same issue of the present inventors and
      colleagues, Bi J. et al., Neuron 50, 23-33, 2006).<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors capitalized upon advancements in the field
      by using viral vectors to transfer genes to retinal photoreceptor
      cells (Flannery J G et al., 1997, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
      94:6916-21). The conversion of light-insensitive retinal
      interneurons into photosensitive cells introduces an entirely new
      direction for treatments of blinding retinal degeneration.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, retinal bipolar cells,
      certain amacrine cells and ganglion cells are targeted for
      transduction of the Chop2 DNA, to convert them functionally into
      photosensitive cells that subsume the function of rods and cones.
      The layering of cells in the retina is such that photoreceptor
      cells excite bipolar cells which excite ganglion cells to transmit
      signals to the visual cortex. It is preferred to express the
      channel opsin of the present invention in bipolar ON-type cells.
      Intravitreal and/or subretinal injections are used to deliver DNA
      molecules and virus vectors to reach the cells being targeted.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the promoter is from a mGluR6 promoter-region
      of the Grm6 gene (GenBank accession number BC041684), a gene that
      controls expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 ((Ueda Y
      et al., 1997, J Neurosc 17:3014-23). The genomic sequence is shown
      in GenBank accession number—AL627215. A preferred example of this
      promoter region sequence from the above GenBank record is SEQ ID
      NO:9 consisting of 11023 nucleotides—as shown in FIG. 8. The
      original Umeda et al., study employed a 10 kb promoter, but the
      actual length of the promoter and the sequence that comprises
      control elements of Grm6 can be adjusted by increasing or
      decreasing the fragment length. It is a matter of routine testing
      to select and verify the action of the optimally sized fragment
      from the Grm6 gene that drives transgenic expression of a selected
      coding sequence, preferably Chop2, in the desired target cells,
      preferably in bipolar cells which are rich in glutamate receptors,
      particularly the “on” type bipolar cells, which are the most
      bipolar cells in the retina (Nakajima, Y., et al., 1993, J Biol
      Chem 268:11868-73).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to a method of restoring light
      sensitivity to a retina, comprising:<br>
      (a) delivering to retinal neurons a nucleic acid expression vector
      that encodes a light-gated channel rhodopsin or a light-driven ion
      pump rhodopsin expressible in the neurons, which vector comprises
      an open reading frame encoding the rhodopsin, and operatively
      linked thereto, a promoter sequence, and optionally,
      transcriptional regulatory sequences; and<br>
      (b) expressing the vector in the neurons, thereby restoring light
      sensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      The rhodopsin is preferably channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2) or a
      biologically active fragment or conservative amino acid
      substitution variant thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The vector is preferably a rAAV viral vector.<br>
      <br>
      The promoter may be a constitutive promoter such as a hybrid CMV
      enhancer/chicken ß-actin promoter (CAG) (as indicated below as
      part of SEQ ID NO:1), or a CMV promoter. The promoter may also be
      (i) an inducible or (ii) a cell type-specific promoter, preferred
      examples of the latter being the mGluR6 promoter (e.g., part of a
      promoter sequence SEQ ID NO:9), a Pcp2 (L7) promoter or a
      neurokinin-3 (NK-3) promoter.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred vector in the above method comprises the CAG promoter,
      a woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and a
      bovine or human growth hormone polyadenylation sequence.<br>
      <br>
      In the present method, the retinal neurons are selected from ON-
      and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells, retinal rod bipolar cells,
      All amacrine cells and ON and OFF retinal cone bipolar cells.
      Preferably, the vector is targeted to and expressed in ON type
      ganglion cells and/or ON type bipolar cells If the vector
      comprises the NK-3 promoter, the vector is preferably targeted to
      OFF cone bipolar cells.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is also directed to method of restoring
      photosensitivity to retinal neurons of a subject suffering from
      vision loss or blindness in whom retinal photoreceptor cells are
      degenerating or have degenerated and died, which method comprises:<br>
      (a) delivering to the retina of the subject a nucleic acid vector
      that encodes a light-gated channel rhodopsin or a light-driven ion
      pump rhodopsin expressible in the neurons, which vector comprises
      an open reading frame encoding the rhodopsin, and operatively
      linked thereto, a promoter sequence, and optionally,
      transcriptional regulatory sequences;<br>
      (b) expressing the vector in the neurons, wherein the expression
      of the rhodopsin renders the neurons photosensitive, thereby
      restoring of photosensitivity to the retina.<br>
      <br>
      In this method the rhodopsin is preferably Chop2 or a biologically
      active fragment or conservative amino acid substitution variant
      thereof. The vector is preferably a rAAV viral vector. Preferred
      promoters are as described above for the above-presented
      embodiment. Preferred target cells for the vector are as described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      The restoration of photosensitivity using the above method
      preferably results in restoration of vision in the subject. The
      vision is preferably measured by one or more of the following
      methods:<br>
      (i) a light detection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus<br>
      (ii) a light projection response by the subject after exposure to
      a light stimulus;<br>
      (iii) light resolution by the subject of a light versus a dark
      patterned visual stimulus;<br>
      (iv) electrical recording of a response in the visual cortex to a
      light flash stimulus or a pattern visual stimulus<br>
      <br>
      In this foregoing method, the vision loss or blindness may be a
      result of a degenerative disease, preferably, retinitis pigmentosa
      or age-related macular degeneration.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the subject is also provided with a visual
      prosthesis before, at the same time as, or after delivery of the
      vector. Preferred visual prostheses comprise retinal implants,
      cortical implants, lateral geniculate nucleus implants, or optic
      nerve implants.<br>
      <br>
      When employing the foregoing method, the subject's visual response
      may be subjected to training using one or more visual stimuli. The
      training is preferably achieved by one or more of the following
      methods:<br>
      (a) habituation training characterized by training the subject to
      recognize (i) varying levels of light and/or pattern stimulation,
      and/or (ii) environmental stimulation from a common light source
      or object; and<br>
      (b) orientation and mobility training characterized by training
      the subject to detect visually local objects and move among the
      objects more effectively than without the training.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention provides a method for treating an ocular disorder in
      a human, other mammalian or other animal subject. In particular,
      the ocular disorder is one which involves a mutated or absent gene
      in a retinal pigment epithelial cell or a photoreceptor cell. The
      method of this invention comprises the step of administering to
      the subject by intravitreal or subretinal injection of an
      effective amount of a recombinant virus carrying a nucleic acid
      sequence encoding an ocular cell-specific normal gene operably
      linked to, or under the control of, a promoter sequence which
      directs the expression of the product of the gene in the ocular
      cells and replaces the lack of expression or incorrect expression
      of the mutated or absent gene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ocular Disorders</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ocular disorders for which the present methods are intended
      and may be used to improve one or more parameters of vision
      include, but are not limited to, developmental abnormalities that
      affect both anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Anterior
      segment disorders include glaucoma, cataracts, corneal dystrophy,
      keratoconus. Posterior segment disorders include blinding
      disorders caused by photoreceptor malfunction and/or death caused
      by retinal dystrophies and degenerations. Retinal disorders
      include congenital stationary night blindness, age-related macular
      degeneration, congenital cone dystrophies, and a large group of
      retinitis-pigmentosa (RP)-related disorders. These disorders
      include genetically pre-disposed death of photoreceptor cells,
      rods and cones in the retina, occurring at various ages. Among
      those are severe retinopathies, such as subtypes of RP itself that
      progresses with age and causes blindness in childhood and early
      adulthood and RP-associated diseases, such as genetic subtypes of
      LCA, which frequently results in loss of vision during childhood,
      as early as the first year of life. The latter disorders are
      generally characterized by severe reduction, and often complete
      loss of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones. (Trabulsi, E I, ed.,
      Genetic Diseases of the Eye, Oxford University Press, NY, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      In particular, this method is useful for the treatment and/or
      restoration of at least partial vision to subjects that have lost
      vision due to ocular disorders, such as RPE-associated
      retinopathies, which are characterized by a long-term preservation
      of ocular tissue structure despite loss of function and by the
      association between function loss and the defect or absence of a
      normal gene in the ocular cells of the subject. A variety of such
      ocular disorders are known, such as childhood onset blinding
      diseases, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and diabetic
      retinopathy, as well as ocular blinding diseases known in the art.
      It is anticipated that these other disorders, as well as blinding
      disorders of presently unknown causation which later are
      characterized by the same description as above, may also be
      successfully treated by this method. Thus, the particular ocular
      disorder treated by this method may include the above-mentioned
      disorders and a number of diseases which have yet to be so
      characterized.<br>
      <br>
      Visual information is processed through the retina through two
      pathways: an ON pathway which signals the light ON, and an OFF
      pathway which signals the light OFF (Wassle, supra). It is
      generally believed that the existence of the ON and OFF pathway is
      important for the enhancement of contrast sensitivity. The visual
      signal in the ON pathway is relay from ON-cone bipolar cells to ON
      ganglion cells. Both ON-cone bipolar cells and ON-ganglion cells
      are depolarized in response to light. On the other hand, the
      visual signal in the OFF pathway is carried from OFF-cone bipolar
      cells to OFF ganglion cells. Both OFF-cone bipolar cells and
      OFF-ganglion cells are hypopolarized in response to light. Rod
      bipolar cells, which are responsible for the ability to see in dim
      light (scotopic vision), are ON bipolar cells (depolarized in
      response to light). Rod bipolar cells relay the vision signal
      through AII amacrine cells (an ON type retinal cells) to ON an OFF
      cone bipolar cells.<br>
      <br>
      The present Examples show functional consequence of expressing
      ubiquitously expressing light sensitive channels, namely ChR2, in
      retinal ganglion cells by CAG promoter, and suggest that this
      sufficient for restoring useful vision. However, targeting of
      depolarizing membrane channels, such as ChR2, to the ON-type
      retinal neurons might result in better useful vision. In addition,
      expression of light sensors in more distal retinal neurons, such
      as bipolar cells, would utilize the remaining signal processing
      functions of the degenerate retina. Furthermore, by expressing a
      depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, in ON type retinal
      neurons (ON type ganglion cells and/or ON type bipolar cells) and
      expressing a hypopolarizing light sensor, such as halorhodopsin (a
      chloride pump) (Han, X et al., 2007, PLoS ONE, March 21;2:e299;
      Zhang, F et al., 2007; Nature 446:633-9; present inventors'
      results) in OFF type retinal neurons (OFF type ganglion cells
      and/or OFF type bipolar cells) could create ON and OFF pathways in
      photoreceptor degenerated retinas.<br>
      <br>
      An alternative approach to restore ON and OFF pathways in the
      retina is achieved by, expressing a depolarizing light sensor,
      such as ChR2, to rod bipolar cells or AII amacrine. This is
      because the depolarization of rod bipolar cells or AII amacrine
      cells can lead to the ON and OFF responses at the levels of cone
      bipolar cells and the downstream retinal ganglion cells and, thus,
      the ON and OFF pathways that are inherent in the retina could be
      maintained (Wässle, 2004).<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, the followings approaches are
      used to restore the light sensitivity of inner retinal neurons:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Ubiquitously expressing light sensitive channels, such as
      ChR2, are employed to produced membrane depolarization in all
      types of ganglion cells (both ON and OFF ganglion cells), or all
      types of bipolar cells (rod bipolar cells, and ON and OFF cone
      bipolar cells). The AAV vector with CAG promoter has already
      partially achieved this approach in rodent retinas, as exemplified
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      (2) A depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, is targeted to ON
      type retinal neurons such as ON type ganglion cells or ON type
      bipolar cells. A study from Dr. J. G. Flannery's group has
      identified the fragments of a human gap junctional protein
      (connexin-36) promoter to target GFP in ON-type retinal ganglion
      cells by using AAV-2 virus vector (Greenberg K P et al., 2007, In
      vivo Transgene Expression in ON-Type Retinal Ganglion Cells:
      Applications to Retinal Disease. ARVO abstract, 2007). A readily
      packable shorter version of mGluR6 promoter of (&lt;2.5 kb) would
      allow targeting of ChR2 to ON type bipolar cells (both rod bipolar
      cells and ON type cone bipolar cells).<br>
      <br>
      (3) Cell specific promoters are used to target the specific types
      of retinal neurons. A promoter that could target rod bipolar cells
      is Pep2 (L7) promoter (Tomomura, M et al., 2001, Eur J Neurosci.
      14:57-63). The length of the active promoter is preferably less
      that 2.5 Kb so it can be packaged into the AAV viral cassette.<br>
      <br>
      (4) A depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, is targeted to ON
      type ganglion cells or ON type cone bipolar cells and a
      hypopolarizing light sensor, such as halorhodopsin, to OFF type
      ganglion cells or OFF type cone bipolar cells to create ON and OFF
      pathways. As described above, an adequately short (packable)
      version of mGluR6 promoter (&lt;2.5 kb) would allow targeting of
      ChR2 to ON type bipolar cells. The Neurokinin-3 (NK-3) promoter
      would be used to target halorhodopsin to OFF cone bipolar cells
      (Haverkamp, S et al., 2002, J Comparative Neurology, 455:463-76.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vectors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to the various embodiments of the present invention, a
      variety of known nucleic acid vectors may be used in these
      methods, e.g., recombinant viruses, such as recombinant
      adeno-associated virus (rAAV), recombinant adenoviruses,
      recombinant retroviruses, recombinant poxviruses, and other known
      viruses in the art, as well as plasmids, cosmids and phages, etc.
      Many publications well-known in the art discuss the use of a
      variety of such vectors for delivery of genes. See, e.g., Ausubel
      et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp;
      Sons, New York, latest edition; Kay, M A. et al., 2001, Nat. Med.,
      7:33-40; and Walther W et al., 2000, Drugs 60:249-71).<br>
      <br>
      Methods for assembly of the recombinant vectors are well-known.
      See, for example, WO 00/15822 and other references cited therein,
      all of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      There are advantages and disadvantages to the various viral vector
      systems. The limits of how much DNA can be packaged is one
      determinant in choosing which system to employ. rAAV tend to be
      limited to about 4.5 kb of DNA, whereas lentivirus (e.g.,
      retrovirus) system can accommodate 4-5 kb.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AAV Vectors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Adeno-associated viruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses
      which require a helper virus for efficient replication (Berns, K
      I, Parvoviridae: the viruses and their replication, p. 1007-1041
      (vol. 2), in Fields, B N et al., Fundamental Virology, 3rd Ed.,
      (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia (1995)). The 4.7 kb
      genome of AAV has two inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and two open
      reading frames (ORFs) which encode the Rep proteins and Cap
      proteins, respectively. The Rep reading frame encodes four
      proteins of molecular weights 78, 68, 52 and 40 kDa. These
      proteins primarily function in regulating AAV replication and
      rescue and integration of the AAV into the host cell chromosomes.
      The Cap reading frame encodes three structural proteins of
      molecular weights 85 (VP 1), 72 (VP2) and 61 (VP3) kDa which form
      the virion capsid (Berns, supra). VP3 comprises &gt;80% of total
      AAV virion proteins.<br>
      <br>
      Flanking the rep and cap ORFs at the 5' and 3' ends are 145 bp
      ITRs, the first 125 bp's of which can form Y- or T-shaped duplex
      structures. The two ITRs are the only cis elements essential for
      AAV replication, rescue, packaging and integration of the genome.
      Two conformations of AAV ITRs called “flip” and “flop” exist
      (Snyder, R O et al., 1993, J Virol., 67:6096-6104; Berns, K I,
      1990 Microbiol Rev, 54:316-29). The entire rep and cap domains can
      be excised and replaced with a transgene such as a reporter or
      therapeutic transgene (Carter, B J, in Handbook of Parvoviruses,
      P. Tijsser, ed., CRC Press, pp. 155-168 (1990)).<br>
      <br>
      AAVs have been found in many animal species, including primates,
      canine, fowl and human (Murphy, F A et al., The Classification and
      Nomenclature of Viruses: Sixth Rept of the Int'l Comme on Taxonomy
      of Viruses, Arch Virol, Springer-Verlag, 1995). Six primate
      serotypes are known (AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5 and AAV6).<br>
      <br>
      The AAV ITR sequences and other AAV sequences employed in
      generating the minigenes, vectors, and capsids, and other
      constructs used in the present invention may be obtained from a
      variety of sources. For example, the sequences may be provided by
      any of the above 6 AAV serotypes or other AAV serotypes or other
      densoviruses, including both presently known human AAV and yet to
      yet-to-be-identified serotypes. Similarly, AAVs known to infect
      other animal species may be the source of ITRs used in the present
      molecules and constructs. Capsids from a variety of serotypes of
      AAV may be combined in various mixtures with the other vector
      components (e.g., WO01/83692 (Nov. 8, 2001) incorporated by
      reference). Many of these viral strains or serotypes are available
      from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Va.,
      or are available from a variety of other sources (academic or
      commercial).<br>
      <br>
      It may be desirable to synthesize sequences used in preparing the
      vectors and viruses of the invention using known techniques, based
      on published AAV sequences, e.g. available from a variety of
      databases. The source of the sequences utilized to prepare the
      present constructs is not considered to be limiting. Similarly,
      the selection of the AAV serotype and species (of origin) is
      within the skill of the art and is not considered limiting<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Minigene</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As used herein, the AAV sequences are typically in the form of a
      rAAV construct (e.g., a minigene or cassette) which is packaged
      into a rAAV virion. At minimum, the rAAV minigene is formed by AAV
      ITRs and a heterologous nucleic acid molecule for delivery to a
      host cell. Most suitably, the minigene comprises ITRs located 5'
      and 3' to the heterologous sequence. However, minigene comprising
      5' ITR and 3' ITR sequences arranged in tandem, e.g. 5' to 3' or a
      head-to-tail, or in another configuration may also be desirable.
      Other embodiments include a minigene with multiple copies of the
      ITRs, or one in which 5' ITRs (or conversely, 3' ITRs) are located
      both 5' and 3' to the heterologous sequence. The ITRs sequences
      may be located immediately upstream and/or downstream of the
      heterologous sequence; intervening sequences may be present. The
      ITRs may be from AAV5, or from any other AAV serotype. A minigene
      may include 5' ITRs from one serotype and 3' ITRs from another.<br>
      <br>
      The AAV sequences used are preferably the 145 bp cis-acting 5' and
      3' ITR sequences (e.g., Carter, B J, supra). Preferably, the
      entire ITR sequence is used, although minor modifications are
      permissible. Methods for modifying these ITR sequences are
      well-known (e.g., Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A
      Laboratory Manual, 3&lt;rd &gt;Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press,
      Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001; Brent, R et al., eds., Current
      Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2003;
      Ausubel, F M et al., eds., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology,
      5thedition, Current Protocols, 2002; Carter et al., supra; and
      Fisher, K et al., 1996 J Virol. 70:520-32). It is conventional to
      engineer the rAAV virus using known methods (e.g., Bennett, J et
      al. 1999, supra). An example of such a molecule employed in the
      present invention is a “cis-acting” plasmid containing the
      heterologous sequence, preferably the Chop2 sequence, flanked by
      the 5' and 3' AAV ITR sequences.<br>
      <br>
      The heterologous sequence encodes a protein or polypeptide which
      is desired to be delivered to and expressed in a cell. The present
      invention is directed to Chop2 sequences under the control of a
      selected promoter and other conventional vector regulatory
      components.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Transgene Being Targeted and Expressed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In a most preferred embodiment, the heterologous sequence is a
      nucleic acid molecule that functions as a transgene. The term
      “transgene” as used herein refers to a nucleic acid sequence
      heterologous to the AAV sequence, and encoding a desired product,
      preferably Chop2 and the regulatory sequences which direct or
      modulate transcription and/or translation of this nucleic acid in
      a host cell, enabling expression in such cells of the encoded
      product. Preferred polypeptide products are those that can be
      delivered to the eye, particularly to retinal neurons.<br>
      <br>
      The transgene is delivered and expressed in order to treat or
      otherwise improve the vision status of a subject with an ocular
      disorder that may result from any of a number of causes, including
      mutations in a normal photoreceptor-specific gene. The targeted
      ocular cells may be photoreceptor cells (if not totally
      degenerated) or, more preferably, other retinal neurons, namely,
      bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells.<br>
      <br>
      Using an mGluR6 promoter operatively linked to a Chop2 opsin
      coding sequence and a reporter gene, e.g. GFP or another
      fluorescent protein, an insert of about 4.5 kb is preferred—1 kb
      for the opsin, 0.7 kb for the reporter, 10 kb—for the mGluR6
      promoter region and about 0.4 kb for conventional transcriptional
      regulatory factors.<br>
      <br>
      Use of different opsin genes allows selection of desired
      wavelengths as the absorption maxima of different channel proteins
      differ. In one embodiment, the reported gene is moved to the red
      part of the visual spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, based on the studies reported herein, the brightness of
      the light needed to stimulate evoked potential in transduced mouse
      retinas, indicates that a channel opsin with increased light
      sensitivity may be more desirable. This can be achieved by
      selection of a suitable naturally occurring opsin, for example
      other microbial-type rhodopsins, or by modifying the light
      sensitivity of Chop2 as well as its other properties, such as ion
      selectivity and spectral sensitivity, to produce diversified
      light-sensitive channels to better fit the need for vision
      restoration.<br>
      <br>
      Different transgenes may be used to encode separate subunits of a
      protein being delivered, or to encode different polypeptides the
      co-expression of which is desired. If a single transgene includes
      DNA encoding each of several subunits, the DNA encoding each
      subunit may be separated by an internal ribozyme entry site
      (IRES), which is preferred for short subunit-encoding DNA
      sequences (e.g., total DNA, including IRES is &lt;5 kB). Other
      methods which do not employ an IRES may be used for co-expression,
      e.g. the use of a second internal promoter, an alternative splice
      signal, a co- or post-translational proteolytic cleavage strategy,
      etc., all of which are known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      The coding sequence or non-coding sequence of the nucleic acids
      useful herein preferably are codon-optimized for the species in
      which they are to be expressed. Such codon-optimization is routine
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      While a preferred transgene encodes a full length polypeptide,
      preferably Chop2 (SEQ ID NO:6, the present invention is also
      directed to vectors that encode a biologically active fragment or
      a conservative amino acid substitution variant of Chop2 (or of any
      aother polypeptide of the invention to be expressed in retinal
      neurons). Non-limiting examples of useful fragments are the
      polypeptide with the sequence SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:8. The
      fragment or variant is expressed by the targets cells being
      transformed and is able to endow such cells with light sensitivity
      that is functionally equivalent to that of the full length or
      substantially full length polypeptide having a native, rather than
      variant, amino acid sequence. A biologically active fragment or
      variant is a “functional equivalent”—a term that is well
      understood in the art and is further defined in detail herein. The
      requisite biological activity of the fragment or variant, using
      any method disclosed herein or known in the art to establish
      activity of a channel opsin, has the following activity relative
      to the wild-type native polypeptide: about 50%, about 55%, about
      60 %, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about
      90%, about 95%, about 99%, and any range derivable therein, such
      as, for example, from about 70% to about 80%, and more preferably
      from about 81% to about 90%; or even more preferably, from about
      91% to about 99%.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that any variations in the coding
      sequences of the present nucleic acids and vectors that, as a
      result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, express a
      polypeptide of the same sequence, are included within the scope of
      this invention.<br>
      <br>
      The amino acid sequence identity of the variants of the present
      invention are determined using standard methods, typically based
      on certain mathematical algorithms. In a preferred embodiment, the
      percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined
      using the Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48:444-453 (1970)
      algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the
      GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using
      either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of
      16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
      or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity
      between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP
      program in the GCG software package (available at
      http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight
      of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or
      6. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino
      acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of
      Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which has been
      incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120
      weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty
      of 4. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the present
      invention can further be used as a “query sequence” to perform a
      search against public databases, for example, to identify other
      family members or related sequences. Such searches can be
      performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (Altschul et al.
      (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10). BLAST nucleotide searches can be
      performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to
      obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to, e.g. DAN encoding Chop2
      of C. reinhardtii. BLAST protein searches can be performed with
      the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid
      sequences homologous to the appropriate reference protein such as
      Chop2. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped
      BLAST can be utilized (Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res.
      25:3389-3402). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the
      default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and
      NBLAST) can be used. See World Wide Web URL ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred amino acid sequence variant has the following
      degrees of sequence identity with the native, full length channel
      opsin polypeptide, preferably Chop2 from C. reinhardtii (SEQ ID
      NO:6) or with a fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:3 or 8): about
      50%, about 55%, abou 60 %, about 65%, about 70%, about 71%, about
      72%, about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about
      78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about
      84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, about
      90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about
      96%, about 97%, about 98%, or about 99%, and any range derivable
      therein, such as, for example, from about 70% to about 80%, and
      more preferably from about 81% to about 90%; or even more
      preferably, from about 91% to about 99% identity. A preferred
      biologically active fragment comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO:3,
      which corresponds to residues 1-315 of SEQ ID NO:6, or comprises
      or consists of SEQ ID NO:8.<br>
      <br>
      Any of a number of known recombinant methods are used to produce a
      DNA molecule encoding the fragment or variant. For production of a
      variant, it is routine to introduce mutations into the coding
      sequence to generate desired amino acid sequence variants of the
      invention. Site-directed mutagenesis is a well-known technique for
      which protocols and reagents are commercially available (e.g.,
      Zoller, M J et al., 1982, Nucl Acids Res 10:6487-6500; Adelman, J
      P et al., 1983, DNA 2:183-93). These mutations include simple
      deletions or insertions, systematic deletions, insertions or
      substitutions of clusters of bases or substitutions of single
      bases.<br>
      <br>
      In terms of functional equivalents, it is well understood by those
      skilled in the art that, inherent in the definition of a
      “biologically functional equivalent” protein, polypeptide, gene or
      nucleic acid, is the concept that there is a limit to the number
      of changes that may be made within a defined portion of the
      molecule and still result in a molecule with an acceptable level
      of equivalent biological activity. Biologically functional
      equivalent peptides are thus defined herein as those peptides in
      which certain, not most or all, of the amino acids may be
      substituted.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the shorter the length of the polypeptide, the
      fewer amino acids changes should be made. Longer fragments may
      have an intermediate number of changes. The full length
      polypeptide protein will have the most tolerance for a larger
      number of changes. It is also well understood that where certain
      residues are shown to be particularly important to the biological
      or structural properties of a polypeptide residues in a binding
      regions or an active site, such residues may not generally be
      exchanged. In this manner, functional equivalents are defined
      herein as those poly peptides which maintain a substantial amount
      of their native biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      For a detailed description of protein chemistry and structure, see
      Schulz, G E et al., Principles of Protein Structure,
      Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978, and Creighton, T. E., Proteins:
      Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., San
      Francisco, 1983, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The
      types of substitutions that may be made in the protein molecule
      may be based on analysis of the frequencies of amino acid changes
      between a homologous protein of different species, such as those
      presented in Table 1-2 of Schulz et al. (supra) and FIG. 3-9 of
      Creighton (supra). Based on such an analysis, conservative
      substitutions are defined herein as exchanges within one of the
      following five groups:<br>
      <br>
      1&nbsp; Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly&nbsp; Ala, Ser, Thr
      (Pro, Gly);<br>
      &nbsp; polar residues<br>
      2&nbsp; Polar, negatively charged residues and&nbsp; Asp, Asn,
      Glu, Gln;&nbsp; their amides<br>
      3&nbsp; Polar, positively charged residues&nbsp; His, Arg, Lys;<br>
      4&nbsp; Large aliphatic, nonpolar residues&nbsp; Met, Leu, Ile,
      Val (Cys)<br>
      5&nbsp; Large aromatic residues&nbsp; Phe, Tyr, Trp.<br>
      <br>
      The three amino acid residues in parentheses above have special
      roles in protein architecture. Gly is the only residue lacking a
      side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain. Pro, because
      of its unusual geometry, tightly constrains the chain. Cys can
      participate in disulfide bond formation, which is important in
      protein folding.<br>
      <br>
      The hydropathy index of amino acids may also be considered in
      selecting variants. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathy
      index on the basis of their hydrophobicity and charge
      characteristics, these are: Ile (+4.5); Val (+4.2); Leu (+3.8);
      Phe (+2.8); Cys (+2.5); Met (+1.9); Ala (+1.8); Glycine (-0.4);
      Thr (-0.7); Ser (-0.8); Trp (-0.9); Tyr (-1.3); Pro (-1.6); His
      (-3.2); Glu (-3.5); Gln (-3.5); Asp (-3.5); Asn (-3.5); Lys
      (-3.9); and Arg (-4.5). The importance of the hydropathy index in
      conferring interactive biological function on a proteinaceous
      molecule is generally understood in the art (Kyte and Doolittle,
      1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-32). It is known that certain amino
      acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar
      hydropathy index or score and still retain a similar biological
      activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathy index, the
      substitution of amino acids whose hydropathy indices are within ±2
      is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly
      preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly
      preferred. It is also understood in the art that the substitution
      of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of
      hydrophilicity, particularly where the biological functional
      equivalent polypeptide thereby created is intended for use in
      certain of the present embodiments. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101,
      discloses that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a
      proteinaceous molecule, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its
      adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the
      molecule. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101 for a hydrophilicity values.
      In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, the
      substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within
      ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly
      preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly
      preferred.<br>

      <b>Regulatory Sequences</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The minigene or transgene of the present invention includes
      appropriate sequences operably linked to the coding sequence or
      ORF to promote its expression in a targeted host cell. “Operably
      linked” sequences include both expression control sequences such
      as. promoters that are contiguous with the coding sequences and
      expression control sequences that act in trans or distally to
      control the expression of the polypeptide product.<br>
      <br>
      Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription
      initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences;
      efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and
      polyadenylation signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic
      mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (e.g., Kozak
      consensus sequence); sequences that enhance nucleic acid or
      protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance
      protein processing and/or secretion. Many varied expression
      control sequences, including native and non-native, constitutive,
      inducible and/or tissue-specific, are known in the art and may be
      utilized herein. depending upon the type of expression desired.<br>
      <br>
      Expression control sequences for eukaryotic cells typically
      include a promoter, an enhancer, such as one derived from an
      immunoglobulin gene, SV40, CMV, etc., and a polyadenylation
      sequence which may include splice donor and acceptor sites. The
      polyadenylation sequence generally is inserted 3' to the coding
      sequence and 5' to the 3' ITR sequence. PolyA from bovine growth
      hormone is a suitable sequence.<br>
      <br>
      The regulatory sequences useful herein may also contain an intron,
      such as one located between the promoter/enhancer sequence and the
      coding sequence. One useful intron sequence is derived from SV40,
      and is referred to as the SV40 T intron sequence. Another includes
      the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional element. (See,
      for example, Wang L and Verma, I, 1999, Proc Nat'l Acad Sci USA,
      96:3906-10).<br>
      <br>
      An IRES sequence, or other suitable system as discussed above, may
      be used to produce more than one polypeptide from a single
      transcript. n exemplary IRES is the poliovirus IRES which supports
      transgene expression in photoreceptors, RPE and ganglion cells.
      Preferably, the IRES is located 3' to the coding sequence in the
      rAAV vector.<br>
      <br>
      The promoter may be selected from a number of constitutive or
      inducible promoters that can drive expression of the selected
      transgene in an ocular setting, preferably in retinal neurons. A
      preferred promoter is “cell-specific”, meaning that it is selected
      to direct expression of the selected transgene in a particular
      ocular cell type, such as photoreceptor cells.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of useful constitutive promoters include the
      exemplified??? CMV immediate early enhancer/chicken ß-actin (CßA)
      promoter-exon 1-intron 1 element, the RSV LTR promoter/enhancer,
      the SV40 promoter, the CMV promoter, the dihydrofolate reductase
      (DHFR) promoter, and the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter.<br>
      <br>
      Additional useful promoters are disclosed in W. W. Hauswirth et
      al., 1998, W098/48027 and A. M. Timmers et al., 2000, WO00/15822.
      Promoters that were found to drive RPE cell-specific gene
      expression in vivo include (1) a 528-bp promoter region (bases
      1-528 of a murine 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) gene
      (Driessen, C A et al., 1995, Invest. Ophthalmo!. Vis. Sci.
      36:1988-96; Simon, A. et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem 270:1107-12,
      1995; Simon, A. et al., 1996, Genomics 36:424-3) Genbank Accession
      Number X97752); (2) a 2274-bp promoter region) from a human
      cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) gene (Intres, R et
      al., 1994, J. Bio!. Chem. 269:25411-18; Kennedy, B N et al., 1998,
      J. Bio!. Chem. 273:5591-8, 1998), Genbank Accession Number
      L34219); and (3) a 1485-bp promoter region from human RPE65
      (Nicoletti, A et al., 1998, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.
      39:637-44, Genbank Accession Number U20510). These three promoters
      (labeled with the following SEQ ID numbers in WO00/15822? 2.3 amd
      3) promoted RPE-cell specific expression of GFP. It is envisioned
      that minor sequence variations in the various promoters and
      promoter regions discussed herein—whether additions, deletions or
      mutations, whether naturally occurring or introduced in vitro,
      will not affect their ability to drive expression in the cellular
      targets of the present invention. Furthermore, the use of other
      promoters, even if not yet discovered, that are characterized by
      abundant and/or specific expression in retinal cells, particularly
      in bipolar or ganglion cells, is specifically included within the
      scope of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      An inducible promoter is used to control the amount and timing of
      production of the transgene product in an ocular cell. Such
      promoters can be useful if the gene product has some undesired,
      e.g. toxic, effects in the cell if it accumulates excessively.
      Inducible promoters include those known in the art, such as the
      Zn-inducible sheep metallothionine (MT) promoter, the
      dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (M MTV)
      promoter; the T7 promoter; the ecdysone insect promoter; the
      tetracycline-repressible system; the tetracycline-inducible
      system; the RU486-inducible system; and the rapamycin-inducible
      system. Any inducible promoter the action of which is tightly
      regulated and is specific for the particular target ocular cell
      type, may be used. Other useful types of inducible promoters are
      ones regulated by a specific physiological state, e.g.
      temperature, acute phase, a cell's replicating or differentiation
      state.<br>
      <br>
      Selection of the various vector and regulatory elements for use
      herein are conventional, well-described, and readily available.
      See, e.g. Sambrook et al., supra; and Ausubel et al., supra. It
      will be readily appreciated that not all vectors and expression
      control sequences will function equally well to express the
      present transgene, preferably Chop2. Clearly, the skilled artisan
      may apply routine selection among the known expression control
      sequences without departing from the scope of this invention and
      based upon general knowledge as well as the guidance provided
      herein. One skilled in the art can select one or more expression
      control sequences, operably link them to the coding sequence being
      expressed to make a minigene, insert the minigene or vector into
      an AAV vector, and cause packaging of the vector into infectious
      particles or virions following one of the known packaging methods
      for rAAV.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Production of the rAAV</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The rAAV used in the present invention may be constructed and
      produced using the materials and methods described herein and
      those well-known in the art. The methods that are preferred for
      producing any construct of this invention are conventional and
      include genetic engineering, recombinant engineering, and
      synthetic techniques, such as those set forth in reference cited
      above.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly, to package an rAAV construct into an rAAV virion, a
      sequences necessary to express AAV rep and AAV cap or functional
      fragments thereof as well as helper genes essential for AAV
      production must be present in the host cells. See, for example
      U.S. Patent Pub. 2007/0015238, which describes production of
      pseudotyped rAAV virion vectors encoding AAV Rep and Cap proteins
      of different serotypes and AdV transcription products that provide
      helper functions For example, AAV rep and cap sequences may be
      introduced into the host cell in any known manner including,
      without limitation, transfection, electroporation, liposome
      delivery, membrane fusion, biolistic deliver of DNA-coated
      pellets, viral infection and protoplast fusion. Devices
      specifically adapted for delivering DNA to specific regions within
      and around the eye for the purpose of gene therapy have been
      described recently (for example, U.S. Patent Pub. 2005/0277868,
      incorporated by reference) are used within the scope of this
      invention. Such devices utilize electroporation and
      electromigration, providing, e.g. two electrodes on a flexible
      support that can be placed behind the retina. A third electrode is
      part of a hollow support, which can also be used to inject the
      molecule to the desired area. The electrodes can be positioned
      around the eye, including behind the retina or within the
      vitreous.<br>
      <br>
      These sequences may exist stably in the cell as an episome or be
      stably integrated into the cell's genome. They may also be
      expressed more transiently in the host cell. As an example, a
      useful nucleic acid molecule comprises, from 5' to 3', a promoter,
      an optional spacer between the promoter and the start site of the
      rep sequence, an AAV rep sequence, and an AAV cap sequence.<br>
      <br>
      The rep and cap sequences, along with their expression control
      sequences, are preferably provided in a single vector, though they
      may be provided separately in individual vectors. The promoter may
      be any suitable constitutive, inducible or native promoter. The
      delivery molecule that provides the Rep and Cap proteins may be in
      any form., preferably a plasmid which may contain other non-viral
      sequences, such as those to be employed as markers. This molecule
      typically excludes the AAV ITRs and packaging sequences. To avoid
      the occurrence of homologous recombination, other viral sequences,
      particularly adenoviral sequences, are avoided. This plasmid is
      preferably one that is stably expressed.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional genetic engineering or recombinant DNA techniques
      described in the cited references are used. The rAAV may be
      produced using a triple transfection method with either the
      calcium phosphate (Clontech) or Effectene™ reagent (Qiagen)
      according to manufacturer's instructions. See, also, Herzog et
      al., 1999, Nat. Med. 5:56-63.<br>
      <br>
      The rAAV virions are produced by culturing host cells comprising a
      rAAV as described herein which includes a rAAV construct to be
      packaged into a rAAV virion, an AAV rep sequence and an AAV cap
      sequence, all under control of regulatory sequences directing
      expression.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable viral helper genes, such as adenovirus E2A, E4Orf6 and
      VA, may be added to the culture preferably on separate plasmids.
      Thereafter, the rAAV virion which directs expression of the
      transgene is isolated in the absence of contaminating helper virus
      or wildtype AAV.<br>
      <br>
      It is conventional to assess whether a particular expression
      control sequence is suitable for a given transgene, and choose the
      one most appropriate for expressing the transgene. For example, a
      target cell may be infected in vitro, and the number of copies of
      the transgene in the cell monitored by Southern blots or
      quantitative PCR. The level of RNA expression may be monitored by
      Northern blots quantitative RT-PCR. The level of protein
      expression may be monitored by Western blot, immunohistochemistry,
      immunoassay including enzyme immunoassay (EIA) such as
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays
      (RIA) or by other methods. Specific embodiments are described in
      the Examples below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The rAAV that comprises the Chop2 transgene and cell-specific
      promoter for use in the target ocular cell as described above
      should be assessed for contamination using conventional methods
      and formulated into a sterile or aseptic pharmaceutical
      composition for administration by, for example, subretinal
      injection.<br>
      <br>
      Such formulations comprise a pharmaceutically and/or
      physiologically acceptable vehicle, diluent, carrier or excipient,
      such as buffered saline or other buffers, e.g. HEPES, to maintain
      physiologic pH. For a discussion of such components and their
      formulation, see, generally, Gennaro, A E., Remington: The Science
      and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins
      Publishers; 2003 or latest edition). See also, WO00/15822. If the
      preparation is to be stored for long periods, it may be frozen,
      for example, in the presence of glycerol.<br>
      <br>
      The pharmaceutical composition described above is administered to
      a subject having a visual or blinding disease by any appropriate
      route, preferably by intravitreal or subretinal injection,
      depending on the retinal layer being targeted.<br>
      <br>
      Disclosures from Bennett and colleagues (cited herein) concern
      targeting of retinal pigment epithelium—the most distal layer from
      the vitreal space. According to the present invention, the DNA
      construct is targeted to either retinal ganglion cells or bipolar
      cells. The ganglion cells are reasonably well-accessible to
      intravitreal injection as disclosed herein. Intravitreal and/or
      subretinal injection can provide the necessary access to the
      bipolar cells, especially in circumstances in which the
      photoreceptor cell layer is absent due to degeneration—which is
      the case in certain forms of degeneration that the present
      invention is intended to overcome.<br>
      <br>
      To test for the vector's ability to express the transgene,
      specifically in mammalian retinal neurons, by AAV-mediated
      delivery, a combination of a preferred promoter sequence linked to
      a reporter gene such as LacZ or GFP linked to a SV40 poly A
      sequence can be inserted into a plasmid and packaged into rAAV
      virus particles, concentrated, tested for contaminating adenovirus
      and titered for rAAV using an infectious center assay. The right
      eyes of a number of test subjects, preferably inbred mice, are
      injected sub-retinally with about 1 µl of the rAAV preparation
      (e.g., greater than about 10&lt;10 &gt;infectious units ml). Two
      weeks later, the right (test) and left (control) eyes of half the
      animals are removed, fixed and stained with an appropriate
      substrate or antibody or other substance to reveal the presence of
      the reporter gene. A majority of the test retinas in injected eyes
      will exhibited a focal stained region, e.g. blue for LacZ/Xgal, or
      green for GFP consistent with a subretinal bleb of the injected
      virus creating a localized retinal detachment. All control eyes
      are negative for the reporter gene product. Reporter gene
      expression examined in mice sacrificed at later periods is
      detected for at least 10 weeks post-injection, which suggests
      persistent expression of the reporter transgene.<br>
      <br>
      An effective amount of rAAV virions carrying a nucleic acid
      sequence encoding the Chop2 DNA under the control of the promoter
      of choice, preferably a constitutive CMV promoter or a
      cell-specific promoter such as mGluR6, is preferably in the range
      of between about 10&lt;10 &gt;to about 10&lt;13 &gt;rAAV
      infectious units in a volume of between about 150 and about 800 µl
      per injection. The rAAV infectious units can be measured according
      to McLaughlin, S K et al., 1988, J Virol 62:1963. More preferably,
      the effective amount is between about 10&lt;10 &gt;and about
      10&lt;12 &gt;rAAV infectious units and the injection volume is
      preferably between about 250 and about 500 µl. Other dosages and
      volumes, preferably within these ranges but possibly outside them,
      may be selected by the treating professional, taking into account
      the physical state of the subject (preferably a human), who is
      being treated, including, age, weight, general health, and the
      nature and severity of the particular ocular disorder.<br>
      <br>
      It may also be desirable to administer additional doses
      (“boosters”) of the present nucleic acid or rAAV compositions. For
      example, depending upon the duration of the transgene expression
      within the ocular target cell, a second treatment may be
      administered after 6 months or yearly, and may be similarly
      repeated. Neutralizing antibodies to AAV are not expected to be
      generated in view of the routes and doses used, thereby permitting
      repeat treatment rounds.<br>
      <br>
      The need for such additional doses can be monitored by the
      treating professional using, for example, well-known
      electrophysiological and other retinal and visual function tests
      and visual behavior tests. The treating professional will be able
      to select the appropriate tests applying routine skill in the art.
      It may be desirable to inject larger volumes of the composition in
      either single or multiple doses to further improve the relevant
      outcome parameters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Restoration or Improvement of Light Sensitivity and Vision</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Both in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the various parameters
      of the present invention may be used, including recognized animal
      models of blinding human ocular disorders. Large animal models of
      human retinopathy, e.g. childhood blindness, are useful. The
      examples provided herein allow one of skill in the art to readily
      anticipate that this method may be similarly used in treating a
      range of retinal diseases.<br>
      <br>
      While earlier studies by others have demonstrated that retinal
      degeneration can be retarded by gene therapy techniques, the
      present invention demonstrates a definite physiological recovery
      of function, which is expected to generate or improve various
      parameters of vision, including behavioral parameters.<br>
      <br>
      Behavioral measures can be obtained using known animal models and
      tests, for example performance in a water maze, wherein a subject
      in whom vision has been preserved or restored to varying extents
      will swim toward light (Hayes, J M et al., 1993, Behav Genet
      23:395-403).<br>
      <br>
      In models in which blindness is induced during adult life or
      congenital blindness develops slowly enough that the individual
      experiences vision before losing it, training of the subject in
      various tests may be done. In this way, when these tests are
      re-administered after visual loss to test the efficacy of the
      present compositions and methods for their vision-restorative
      effects, animals do not have to learn the tasks de novo while in a
      blind state. Other behavioral tests do not require learning and
      rely on the instinctiveness of certain behaviors. An example is
      the optokinetic nystagmus test (Balkema G W et al., 1984, Invest
      Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 25:795-800; Mitchiner J C et al., 1976, Vision
      Res. 16:1169-71).<br>
      <br>
      As is exemplified herein, the transfection of retinal neurons with
      DNA encoding Chop2 provides residual retinal neurons, principally
      bipolar cells and ganglion cells, with photosensitive membrane
      channels. Thus, it was possible to measure, with a strong light
      stimulus, the transmission of a visual stimulus to the animal's
      visual cortex, the area of the brain responsible for processing
      visual signals; this therefore constitutes a form of vision, as
      intended herein. Such vision may differ from forms of normal human
      vision and may be referred to as a sensation of light, also termed
      “light detection” or “light perception.”<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the term “vision” as used herein is defined as the ability
      of an organism to usefully detect light as a stimulus for
      differentiation or action. Vision is intended to encompass the
      following:<br>
      1. Light detection or perception—the ability to discern whether or
      not light is present<br>
      2. Light projection—the ability to discern the direction from
      which a light stimulus is coming;<br>
      3. Resolution—the ability to detect differing brightness levels
      (i.e., contrast) in a grating or letter target; and<br>
      4. Recognition—the ability to recognize the shape of a visual
      target by reference to the differing contrast levels within the
      target.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, “vision” includes the ability to simply detect the presence
      of light. This opens the possibility to train an affected subject
      who has been treated according to this invention to detect light,
      enabling the individual to respond remotely to his environment
      however crude that interaction might be. In one example, a signal
      array is produced to which a low vision person can respond to that
      would enhance the person's ability to communicate by electronic
      means remotely or to perform everyday tasks. In addition such a
      person's mobility would be dramatically enhanced if trained to use
      such a renewed sense of light resulting from “light detection.”
      The complete absence of light perception leaves a person with no
      means (aside from hearing and smell) to discern anything about
      objects remote to himself.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the present invention that result in light
      perception, even without full normal vision, also improve or
      permit normally regulated circadian rhythms which control many
      physiological processes including sleep-wake cycles and associated
      hormones. Although some blind individuals with residual retinal
      ganglion cells (RGCs) can mediate their rhythms using RGC
      melanopsin, it is rare for them to do so. Thus, most blind persons
      have free-running circadian rhythms. Even when such individuals do
      utilize the melanopsin pathway, the effect is very weak effect.
      The methods of the present invention are thus expected to improve
      health status of blind individuals by enabling absent light
      entrainment or improving weakened (melanopsin-mediated) light
      entrainment of their circadian rhythms. This leads to better
      health and well-being of these subjects.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to circadian rhythms, the present invention provides a
      basis to improve deficits in other light-induced physiological
      phenomena. Photoreceptor degeneration may result in varying
      degrees of negative masking, or suppression, of locomotor activity
      during the intervals in the circadian cycle in which the
      individual should be sleeping. Another result is suppression of
      pineal melatonin. Both of these contribute to the entrainment
      process. Thus, improvement in these responses or activities in a
      subject in whom photoreceptors are degenerating or have
      degenerated contributes, independently of vision per se, to
      appropriate sleep/wake cycles that correspond with the subject's
      environment in the real world.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another benefit of the present invention is normalization of
      pupillary light reflexes because regulation of pupil size helps
      modulate the effectiveness of light stimuli in a natural feed back
      loop. Thus, the present invention promotes re-establishment of
      this natural feedback loop, making vision more effective in
      subject treated as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      In certain embodiments, the present methods include the
      measurement of vision before, and preferably after, administering
      a vector comprising, for example, DNA encoding Chop2. Vision is
      measured using any of a number of methods well-known in the art or
      ones not yet establshed. Most preferred herein are the following
      visual responses:<br>
      (1) A light detection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus—in which evdence is sought for a reliable response
      of an indication or movement in the general direction of the light
      by the subject individual when the light it is turned on is .<br>
      (2) a light projection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus in which evidence is sought for a reliable response
      of indication or movement in the specific direction of the light
      by the individual when the light is turned on.<br>
      (3) light resolution by the subject of a light vs. dark patterned
      visual stimulus, which measures the subject's capability of
      resolving light vs dark patterned visual stimuli as evidenced by:<br>
      (a) the presence of demonstrable reliable optokinetically produced
      nystagmoid eye movements and/or related head or body movements
      that demonstrate tracking of the target (see above) and/or<br>
      (b). the presence of a reliable ability to discriminate a pattern
      visual stimulus and to indicate such discrimination by verbal or
      non-verbal means, including, for example pointing, or pressing a
      bar or a button; or<br>
      (4) electrical recording of a visual cortex response to a light
      flash stimulus or a pattern visual stimulus, which is an endpoint
      of electrical transmission from a restored retina to the visual
      cortex. Measurement may be by electrical recording on the scalp
      surface at the region of the visual cortex, on the cortical
      surface, and/or recording within cells of the visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      It is known in the art that it is often difficult to make children
      who have only light perception appreciate that they have this
      vision. Training is required to get such children to react to
      their visual sensations. Such a situation is mimicked in the
      animal studies exemplified below. Promoting or enhancing light
      perception, which the compositions and methods of the present
      invention will accomplish, is valuable because patients with light
      perception not only are trainable to see light, but they can
      usually be trained to detect the visual direction of the light,
      thus enabling them to be trained in mobility in their environment.
      In addition, even basic light perception can be used by visually
      impaired individuals, including those whose vision is improved
      using the present compositions and methods, along with specially
      engineered electronic and mechanical devices to enable these
      individuals to accomplish specific daily tasks. Beyond this and
      depending on their condition, they may even be able to be trained
      in resolution tasks such as character recognition and even reading
      if their impairment permits. Thus it is expected that the present
      invention enhances the vision of impaired subjects to such a level
      that by applying additional training methods, these individuals
      will achieve the above objectives.<br>
      <br>
      Low sensitivity vision may emulate the condition of a person with
      a night blinding disorder, an example of which is Retinitis
      Pigmentosa (RP), who has difficulty adapting to light levels in
      his environment and who might use light amplification devices such
      as supplemental lighting and/or night vision devices.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the visual recovery that has been described in the animal
      studies described below would, in human terms, place the person on
      the low end of vision function. Nevertheless, placement at such a
      level would be a significant benefit because these individuals
      could be trained in mobility and potentially in low order
      resolution tasks which would provide them with a greatly improved
      level of visual independence compared to total blindness.<br>
      <br>
      The mice studied in the present Examples were rendered completely
      devoid of photoreceptors; this is quite rare, even in the worst
      human diseases. The most similar human state is RP. In most cases
      of RP, central vision is retained till the very end. In contrast,
      in the studied mouse model, the mouse becomes completely blind
      shortly after birth.<br>
      <br>
      Common disorders encountered in low vision are described by J.
      Tasca and E. A. Deglin in Chap. 6 of Essentials of Low Vision
      Practice, R. L. Brilliant, ed., Butterworth Heinemann Publ., 1999,
      which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. There is
      reference to similar degenerative conditions, but these references
      show form vision that is measurable as visual acuity. Ganglion
      cell layers are not retained in all forms of RP, so the present
      approach will not work for such a disorder.<br>
      <br>
      When applying the present methods to humans with severe cases of
      RP, it is expected that central vision would be maintained for a
      time at some low level while the peripheral retina degenerated
      first. It is this degenerating retina that is the target for
      re-activation using the present invention. In essence, these
      individuals would be able to retain mobility vision as they
      approached blindness gradually.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects with macular degeneration, characterized by photoreceptor
      loss within the central “sweet spot” of vision (Macula Lutea), are
      expected to benefit by treatment in accordance with the present
      invention, in which case the resolution capability of the
      recovered vision would be expected to be higher due to the much
      higher neuronal density within the human macula.<br>
      <br>
      While it is expected that bright illumination of daylight and
      artificial lighting that may be used by a visually impaired
      individual will suffice for many visual activities that are
      performed with vision that has recovered as a result of the
      present treatments. It is also possible that light amplification
      devices may be used, as needed, to further enhance the affected
      person's visual sensitivity. The human vision system can operate
      over a 10 log unit range of luminance. On the other hand,
      microbial type rhodopsins, such as ChR2, operate over up to a 3
      log unit range of luminance. In addition, the light conditions the
      patient encounters could fall outside of the operating range of
      the light sensor. To compensate for the various light conditions,
      a light pre-amplification or attenuation device could be used to
      expand the operation range of the light conditions. Such device
      would contain a camera, imaging processing system, and
      microdisplays, which can ne assembled from currently available
      technologies, such as night vision goggles and/or 3D adventure and
      entertainment system. (See, for example the following URL on the
      Worldwide web—emagin.com/.)<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may be used in combination with other forms
      of vision therapy known in the art. Chief among these is the use
      of visual prostheses, which include retinal implants, cortical
      implants, lateral geniculate nucleus implants, or optic nerve
      implants. Thus, in addition to genetic modification of surviving
      retinal neurons using the present methods, the subject being
      treated may be provided with a visual prosthesis before, at the
      same time as, or after the molecular method is employed.<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of visual prosthetics can be improved with
      training of the individual, thus enhancing the potential impact of
      the Chop2 transformation of patient cells as contemplated herein.
      An example of an approach to training is found in US 2004/0236389
      (Fink et al.), incorporated by reference. The training method may
      include providing a non-visual reference stimulus to a patient
      having a visual prosthesis based on a reference image. The
      non-visual reference stimulus is intended to provide the patient
      with an expectation of the visual image that the prosthesis will
      induce. Examples of non-visual reference stimuli are a pinboard,
      Braille text, or a verbal communication. The visual prosthesis
      stimulates the patient's nerve cells, including those cells whose
      responsiveness has been improved by expressing Chop2 as disclosed
      herein, with a series of stimulus patterns attempting to induce a
      visual perception that matches the patient's expected perception
      derived from the non-visual reference stimulus. The patient
      provides feedback to indicate which of the series of stimulus
      patterns induces a perception that most closely resembles the
      expected perception. The patient feedback is used as a “fitness
      function” (also referred to as a cost function or an energy
      function). Subsequent stimuli provided to the patient through the
      visual prosthesis are based, at least in part, on the previous
      feedback of the patient as to which stimulus pattern(s) induce the
      perception that best matches the expected perception. The
      subsequent stimulus patterns may also be based, at least in part,
      on a fitness function optimization algorithm, such as a simulated
      annealing algorithm or a genetic algorithm.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in certain embodiments of this invention, the method of
      improving or restoring vision in a subject further comprises
      training of that subject, as discussed above. Preferred examples
      of training methods are:<br>
      <br>
      (a) habituation training characterized by training the subject to
      recognize (i) varying levels of light and/or pattern stimulation,
      and/or (ii) environmental stimulation from a common light source
      or object as would be understood by one skilled in the art; and<br>
      (b) orientation and mobility training characterized by training
      the subject to detect visually local objects and move among said
      objects more effectively than without the training.<br>
      In fact, any visual stimulation techniques that are typically used
      in the field of low vision rehabilitation are applicable here.<br>
      <br>
      The remodeling of inner retinal neurons triggered by photoreceptor
      degeneration has raised a concerns about retinal-based rescue
      strategies after the death of photoreceptors (Strettoi and
      Pignatelli 2000, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 97:11020-5; Jones, B W et
      al., 2003, J Comp Neurol 464:1-16; Jones, B W and Marc, R E, 2005,
      Exp Eye Res. 81:123-37; Jones, B W et al., 2005, Clin Exp Optom.
      88:282-91). Retinal remodeling is believed to result from
      deafferentation, the loss of afferent inputs from
      photoreceptors—in other words, the loss of light induced
      activities So after death of rods and coned, there is no light
      evoked input to retinal bipolar cells and ganglion cells, and
      through them to higher visual centers. In response to the loss of
      such input, the retina and higher visual network are triggered to
      undergo remodeling, in a way seeking other forms of inputs. Said
      otherwise, the retina needs to be used to sense light in order to
      maintain its normal network, and with the loss of light sensing,
      the network will deteriorate via a remodeling process. This
      process is not an immediate consequence of photoreceptor death;
      rather it is a slow process, providing a reasonably long window
      for intervention.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, an additional utility of restoring light sensitivity to
      inner retinal neurons in accordance with the present invention is
      the prevention or delay in the remodeling processes in the retina,
      and, possibly, in the higher centers. Such retinal remodeling may
      have undesired consequences such as corruption of inner retinal
      network, primarily the connection between bipolar and retinal
      ganglion cells. By introducing the light-evoked activities in
      bipolar cells or ganglion cells, the present methods would prevent
      or diminish the remodeling due to the lack of input; the present
      methods introduce this missing input (either starting from bipolar
      cells or ganglion cells), and thereby stabilize the retinal and
      higher visual center network. Thus, independently of its direct
      effects on vision, the present invention would benefit other
      therapeutic approaches such as photoreceptor transplantation or
      device implants,.<br>
      <br>
      Having now generally described the invention, the same will be
      more readily understood through reference to the following
      examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not
      intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless
      specified.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SYNOPSIS OF EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      (references cited in the following sections may appear in a list
      at the end).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A Chop2-GFP chimera was made by linking a nucleic acid encoding
      green fluorescent protein (GFP) (part of SEQ ID NO: 1 as shown
      below) to a nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO:2) encoding an active fragment
      (SEQ ID NO:3) of channelopsin-2 (Chop2) such that an expressed
      protein has the GFP linked to the C-terminus of the Chop2 region.
      Both these sequences constitute the “transgene” as discussed
      above. The Chop2-GFP DNA was transfected into HEK293 cells under
      control of a CMV promoter.<br>
      <br>
      A viral construct (SEQ ID NO: 1) was made by subcloning the
      Chop2-GFP into an AAV-2 viral cassette containing a CAG promoter.
      A map of this construct is shown in FIG. 7. The viral vectors were
      injected into the eye of newborn rats. The expression of Chop2-GFP
      was examined by GFP fluorescence in retinal whole-mounts or slice
      sections. The function of the Chop2-GFP was assessed by whole-cell
      patch clamp recordings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bright GFP fluorescence was detected within 18-24 hrs in HEK cells
      after the transfection. The fluorescence was localized
      predominantly to the plasma membrane. The preserve of the function
      of the Chop2-GFP chimera was confirmed by patch-clamp recordings.
      Substantial light-gated currents were also observed in the
      Chop2-GFP-expressing HEK cells without adding the exogenous
      all-trans retinal, indicating that a significant number of
      functional Chop2-GFP channels were formed in HEK cells using only
      endogenous precursor for the chromophore group. Three to four
      weeks after the injection, GFP fluorescence was observed in the
      retinal neurons of the injected eyes. Bright GFP-fluorescence was
      observed in many ganglion cells and horizontal cells, some
      amacrine cells, and, occasionally, bipolar cells for at least 10
      weeks following injection. The Chop2-GFP-expressing retinal
      neurons exhibited robust membrane depolarization in response to
      light stimulation and did not require an exogenous source of
      all-trans retinal.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the inventors demonstrated that the selected AAV vector
      construct efficiently targeted retinal ganglion cells and
      effectively delivered the Chop2-GFP cDNA and expressed protein at
      high levels after intravitreal injection in both normal and
      diseased retinas. When endogenous retinal was bound to the Chop2,
      it could be photoswitched, and neural activity could be evoked in
      retinas and at cortical levels. This was shown by several
      techniques-initially by in vitro patch-clamp recordings of
      individual dissociated RGCs, followed by multielectrode array
      recordings of whole-mount retina preparations representative of a
      large population of RGCs. Finally, in vivo cortical recordings
      from live blind mice demonstrated that critical connections were
      functionally maintained to higher visual centers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The progressive in vitro and in vivo results show that ectopic
      expression of Chop2 is a therapeutic strategy for restoring light
      sensitivity to a “blind” retina. Functional expression of a
      directly light-gated membrane channel, Chop2, was demonstrated in
      rat retinal neurons in vivo. Thus, expression of light-gated
      membrane channels in second- or third-order retinal neurons is a
      useful strategy for restoration of light perception after
      photoreceptor degeneration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example I</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DNA and Viral Vector Constructions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal fragment
      (Met&lt;1&gt;-Lys&lt;315&gt;) of Chop2 (Nagel et al., 2003) was
      cloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) containing the last
      exon of a mouse protamine 1 gene containing polyadenylation signal
      (mP1) and GFP cDNA inserted in frame at the 3' end of the Chop2
      coding fragment to produce a Chop2-GFP fusion protein. The
      function of Chop2-GFP chimera was verified in transfected HEK293
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      The viral expression construct rAAV2-C AG-Chop2-GFP-WPR E was made
      by subcloning the Chop2-GFP fragment into an adeno-associated
      (serotype-2) viral expression cassette. The viral cassette
      comprised a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken ß-actin promoter (CAG), a
      woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), and a
      bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation sequence. Viral
      vectors were packaged and affinity purified (GeneDetect).<br>
      <br>
      The vector map is shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      The nucleic acid sequence of this vector (SEQ ID NO: 1) is shown
      below in annotated form (with the annotations as described):<br>
      <br>
      ITR's (at both ends) (UPPER CASE underscore)<br>
      CAG promoter sequence (Lower case, bold, italic)<br>
      Kozak sequence (lower case double underscore)<br>
      Chop2 coding sequence (lower case, bold)<br>
      Green fluorescent protein coding sequence (lower case, bold
      underscored)<br>
      WPRE (regulatory element): (UPPER CASE)<br>
      The BGH Poly A sequence is not marked.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining sequence (all lower case), including between Chop2
      and GFP, is vector sequence<br>
      <br>
      The Chop2 coding sequence from the above vector is shown below as
      SEQ ID NO:2. Numbering indicates both nucleotide number and codon
      number. The encoded polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:3) is also shown.
      Again, this is the N-terminal 315 residues of Chop2 polypeptide
      (SEQ ID NO:6).<br>

      Another useful Chop2 sequence useful for the present invention is
      a nucleic acid of 933 nt's (including the stop codon) encoding a
      310 aa polypeptide (a biologically active fragment of the full
      length native Chop2) is a synthetic construct derived from
      Chlamydomonas reinhardtii? (See EF474017 and Zhang et al., 2007,
      Nature in press). This sequence is codon-optimized for human
      expression. The nt sequence shown below is SEQ ID NO:7, and the
      encoded a.a. sequence shown is SEQ ID NO:8. The polypeptide with
      the a.a. sequence SEQ ID NO:8 is a fragment of SEQ ID NO:6
      truncated at the C-terminus and with Pro replacing Asn at 310.<br>

      AAV Vector Injection<br>
      <br>
      All of the animal experiments were at the institutional level and
      were in accord with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
      Laboratory Animals.<br>
      <br>
      Newborn (PI) rat pups (Sprague-Dawley and Long-Evans) and mouse
      pups (C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ or rd1/rd1) were anesthetized by
      chilling on ice. Adult mice (rd1/rd1) were anesthetized by IP
      injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Under a
      dissecting microscope, an incision was made by scissors through
      the eyelid to expose the sclera. A small perforation was made in
      the sclera region posterior to the lens with a needle and viral
      vector suspension of 0.8-1.5 µl at the concentration of
      approximately 10&lt;11 &gt;genomic particles/ml was injected into
      intravitreal space through the hole with a Hamilton syringe with a
      32-gauge blunt-ended needle. For each animal, usually only one eye
      was injected with viral vectors carrying Chop2-GFP and the other
      eye was uninjected or injected with control viral vectors carrying
      GFP alone. After the injection, animals were kept on a 12/12 hr
      light/dark cycle. The light illumination of the room housing the
      animals measured at the wavelength of 500 nm was 6.0×10&lt;14
      &gt;photons cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      Histology<br>
      <br>
      Animals were sacrificed at various time points after the vector
      injection. The expression of Chop2-GFP fluorescence was examined
      in flat whole-mount retinas, vertical retinal, and coronal brain
      sections. The dissected retinas and brains were fixed with 4%
      paraformaldehyde in PBS for 0.5-2 hr at room temperature and 24 hr
      at 4° C., respectively. The fixed retinas (embedded in 3% agarose)
      and brains were cut by using a vibratome. The retinal and brain
      sections or the retinal whole mounts were mounted on slides and
      covered with Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories). GFP
      fluorescence was visualized under a fluorescence microscope
      equipped with exciter, dichroic, and emission filters of 465-495
      nm, 505 nm, and 515-555 nm, respectively, and most images were
      obtained with a digital camera (Axiocam, Zeiss). Some images were
      obtained with a confocal microscope (TCS SP2, Leica). For light
      microscopy of semithin vertical retinal section, eyes were
      enucleated, rinsed in PBS, and fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 2.5%
      glutaraldehyde, and 0.2 M Sorenson's phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at
      4° C. for 3 hr. The eyes were then dehydrated in graded ethanols
      and embedded in plastic and cut into 1 µm sections and stained
      with a methylene blue/azure mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Patch-Clamp Recordings<br>
      <br>
      Dissociated retinal cells and retinal slice were prepared as
      previously described (Pan, 2000 and Cui et al., 2003). Recordings
      with patch electrodes in the whole-cell configuration were made by
      an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software (Heka Electronik, Lambrecht,
      Germany). Recordings were made in Hanks' solution containing (in
      mM): NaCl, 138; NaHCO3, 1; Na2HPO4, 0.3; KCl, 5; KH2PO4, 0.3;
      CaCl2, 1.25; MgSO4, 0.5; MgCl2, 0.5; HEPES-NaOH, 5; glucose, 22.2;
      with phenol red, 0.001% v/v; adjusted to pH 7.2 with 0.3 N NaOH.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode solution contained (in mM): K-gluconate, 133; KCl,
      7; MgCl2, 4; EGTA, 0.1; HEPES, 10; Na-GTP, 0.5; and Na-ATP, 2; pH
      adjusted with KOH to 7.4. The resistance of the electrode was 13
      to 15 MO. The recordings were performed at room temperature ( ~22°
      C.).<br>
      <br>
      Multielectrode Array Recordings<br>
      <br>
      The multielectrode array recordings were based on the procedures
      reported by Tian and Copenhagen (2003). Briefly, the retina was
      dissected and placed photoreceptor side down on a nitrocellulose
      filter paper strip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). The mounted
      retina was placed in the MEA-60 multielectrode array recording
      chamber of 30 µm diameter electrodes spaced 200 µm apart (Multi
      Channel System MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), with the ganglion
      cell layer facing the recording electrodes. The retina was
      continuously perfused in oxygenated extracellular solution at 34°
      C. during all experiments. The extracellular solution contained
      (in mM): NaCl, 124; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 2; NaH2PO4, 1.25;
      NaHCO3, 26; and glucose, 22 (pH 7.35 with 95% O2 and 5% CO2).
      Recordings were usually started 60 min after the retina was
      positioned in the recording chamber. The interval between onsets
      of each light stimulus was 10-15 s. The signals were filtered
      between 200 Hz (low cut off) and 20 kHz (high cut off). The
      responses from individual neurons were analyzed using Offline
      Sorter software (Plexon, Inc., Dallas, Tex.).<br>
      <br>
      Visual-Evoked Potential Recordings<br>
      <br>
      Visual-evoked potential recordings were carried out in wild-type
      mice of the C57BL/6 and 129/Sv strains aged 4-6 months and in the
      rd1/rd1 mice aged 6-11 months. Recordings were performed 2-6
      months after viral vector injection.<br>
      <br>
      After general anesthesia (i.p. injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg)
      and acepromazine (0.8 mg/kg), animals were mounted in a
      stereotaxic apparatus. Body temperature was either unregulated or
      maintained at 34° C. with a heating pad and a rectal probe. Pupils
      were dilated with 1% atropine and 2.5% accu-phenylephrine. A small
      portion of the skull ( ~1.5×1.5 mm) centered about 2.5 mm from the
      midline and 1 mm rostral to the lambdoid suture was drilled and
      removed. Recordings were made from visual cortex (area V1) by a
      glass micropipette (resistance ~0.5 M after filling with 4 M NaCl)
      advanced 0.4 mm beneath the surface of the cortex at the
      contralateral side of the stimulated eye. The stimuli were 20 ms
      pluses at 0.5 Hz. Responses were amplified (1,000 to 10,000),
      band-pass filtered (0.3-100 Hz), digitized (1 kHz), and averaged
      over 30-250 trials.<br>
      <br>
      Light Stimulation<br>
      <br>
      For dissociated cell and retinal slice recordings, light stimuli
      were generated by a 150 W xenon lamp-based scanning monochromator
      with bandwidth of 10 nm (TILL Photonics, Germany) and coupled to
      the microscope with an optical fiber. For multielectrode array
      recordings, light responses were evoked by the monochromator or a
      175 W xenon lamp-based illuminator (Lambda LS, Sutter Instrument)
      with a band-pass filter of 400-580 nm and projected to the bottom
      of the recording chamber through a liquid light guider. For visual
      evoked potential, light stimuli were generated by the
      monochromator and projected to the eyes through the optical fiber.
      The light intensity was attenuated by neutral density filters. The
      light energy was measured by a thin-type sensor (TQ82017) and an
      optical power meter (Model: TQ8210) (Advantest, Tokyo, Japan).<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      Expression of Chop2 in Retinal Neurons In Vivo<br>
      <br>
      To directly visualize the expression and localization of Chop2
      proteins, the C-terminal portion of the Chop2 channel was replaced
      with GFP, to make a Chop2-GFP chimera. The adeno-associated virus
      (AAV) vectors was selected to target the expression of Chop2-GFP
      fusion protein into retinal neurons because the capability of AAV
      vectors to deliver transgenes into nondividing cells, including
      inner retinal neurons (Harvey et al., 2002 and Martin et al.,
      2003), and to integrate the transgenes into the host genome
      (Flotte, 2004).<br>
      <br>
      A viral expression cassette, rAAV2-C AG-Chop2-GFP-WPRE, was made
      by subcloning the Chop2-GFP chimera into an AAV serotype-2
      expression cassette containing a hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken
      ß-actin (CAG) promoter (FIG. 1A). To establish the expression and
      function of Chop2 channels in retinal neurons in general, we first
      examined the expression of Chop2 in nondystrophic retinas. The
      viral vector was injected into the intravitreal space in the eyes
      of postnatal day 1 rats and mice. Three to four weeks after the
      injection, bright GFP fluorescence was observed in retinal neurons
      of all injected eyes (FIGS. 1B-1H), confirming that Chop2-GFP was
      expressed. The expression was usually confluent throughout the
      retina (FIG. 1B).<br>
      <br>
      The Chop2-GFP-fluorescence was predominantly observed in retinal
      ganglion cells (FIGS. 1C and 1D; also see FIG. 1H). The
      fluorescence signal was observed throughout the inner plexiform
      layer (IPL) (FIG. 1H), indicating that the viral vector targeted
      the expression of Chop2-GFP both in ON and OFF ganglion cells. The
      expressing of Chop2-GFP was also frequently observed in horizontal
      cells (FIG. 1E), amacrine cells (FIG. 1F), and, occasionally, in
      bipolar cells (FIG. 1G).<br>
      <br>
      The GFP signal was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane
      (FIG. 1D), consistent with the GFP tag being anchored to the
      membrane by a seven-transmembrane portion of the Chop2 channel.
      Once expressed in a cell, the GFP signal was extended over the
      entire cell including distal processes and axon terminals (see
      FIGS. 1C and 1E). Bright GFP fluorescence was found to be stable
      for 12 months or more after the injection (FIG. 1H), whereas no
      gross changes in retinal morphology were noticed (FIG. 1I). These
      results indicated that long-term stable expression of Chop2-GFP
      was achieved in inner retinal neurons in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      Example 3<br>
      <br>
      Properties of Light-Evoked Currents of ChR2-Expressing Inner
      Retinal Neurons<br>
      <br>
      Functional properties of the Chop2 channels were examined in inner
      retinal neurons by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. The
      recordings were performed in acutely dissociated cells so that
      photoreceptor-mediated light responses were confidently excluded.
      Chop2-GFP-positive cells were identified by their GFP fluorescence
      (FIG. 2A). The precursor for the Chop2 chromophore group,
      all-trans retinal, was not added because it might be ubiquitously
      present in cells (Kim et al, 1992 and Thompson and Gal, 2003).
      Light-evoked responses were observed in all recorded GFP
      fluorescent cells (n=34), indicating that functional ChR2 (Chop2
      with the chromophore attached) can be formed in retinal neurons
      with the retinal chromophore groups already present in the cells.
      Consistently, the expression of functional ChR2 channels has also
      been recently reported in cultured hippocampal neurons without the
      supply of exogenous retinal chromophore groups (Boyden et al,
      2005; but see Li et al, 2005).<br>
      <br>
      The properties of the ChR2-mediated light responses were first
      examined in voltage clamp. Light-evoked currents were observed in
      Chop2-GFP-expressing inner retinal neurons by light stimuli up to
      the wavelength of 580 nm with the most sensitive wavelength around
      460 nm (FIG. 2B), consistent with the reported peak spectrum
      sensitivity of ChR2 (Nagel et al, 2003). The amplitude and the
      kinetics of the currents were dependent on the light intensity
      (FIG. 2C). FIGS. 2D and 2E show in the expanded time scale the
      current traces right after the onset and the termination of the
      light stimulation, respectively. Detectable currents were observed
      in most recorded cells at a light intensity of 2.2×10&lt;15
      &gt;photons cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1&gt;. In some cells, currents were
      observed at a light intensity of 2×10&lt;14 &gt;photons
      cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1 &gt;(not shown). At higher light intensities,
      the currents displayed both transient and sustained components,
      similar to the properties of the nonfusion ChR2 (Nagel et al.,
      2003). The relationship between the light intensity and peak
      current is shown in FIG. 2F (n=7). The activation and inactivation
      kinetics of the currents were also dependent on the light
      intensity (FIG. 2D). The initial phase of the current could be
      well fitted by an exponential function with a single activation
      and inactivation constant, as illustrated in FIG. 2D (red trace).
      The activation and inactivation time constants versus light
      intensity are plotted in FIGS. 2G and 2H, respectively. On the
      other hand, the deactivation kinetics of the currents after the
      light off was not light-intensity dependent. The current decay
      trace could be well fitted by a single exponential function as
      shown in FIG. 2E (red trace). The time constant was 17.1±6.5 ms
      (mean±SD, n=7).<br>
      <br>
      The next experiment examined whether the ChR2-mediated currents
      were sufficient to drive membrane depolarization. FIG. 3A shows
      the representative responses from a nonspiking neuron in response
      to four incremental light intensities at the wavelength of 460 nm.
      Detectable responses were observed in most recorded cells at a
      light intensity of 2.2×10&lt;15 &gt;photons
      cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1&gt;. At higher light intensities, the membrane
      depolarization approached a saturated level. The ChR2-mediated
      light responses to repeated light stimulations were further
      examined. The transient component of the currents diminished to
      repeated stimulations whereas the sustained component of the
      currents was stable (top traces in FIG. 3B). This was clearly seen
      in the expanded time scale in the right panel of FIG. 3B by
      comparing the superimposed first (red trace) and the second (black
      trace) light-evoked currents. For the same cell, in current clamp,
      the stimulations evoked robust membrane depolarizations (bottom
      traces in FIG. 3B). The membrane depolarizations reached an almost
      identical level, except for the initial portion of the response.
      This was also shown in the expanded time scale (right panel),
      which superimposed the first (red trace) and the second (black
      trace) light-evoked responses. FIG. 3C shows a representative
      recording of spiking neurons to repeated light stimulations.
      Again, the stimulations elicited almost identical membrane
      depolarizations accompanied by multiple spikes. Taken together,
      these results demonstrated that the ChR2-mediated currents in
      second- and third-order retinal neurons are sufficient to drive
      membrane depolarization and/or spike firing.<br>
      <br>
      Example 4<br>
      <br>
      Expression of Chop2 in Photoreceptor-Deficient rd1/rd1 Mice<br>
      <br>
      Having established the expression and function of ChR2 in
      wild-type retinas, we went on to address whether the expression of
      ChR2 could restore light responses in retinas after photoreceptor
      degeneration. To this end, the experiments were carried out in
      homozygous rd1 (rd1/rd1) mice (Bowes et al., 1990), a
      photoreceptor degeneration model with a null mutation in a cyclic
      GMP phosphodiesterase, PDE6, similar to some forms of retinitis
      pigmentosa in humans (McLaughlin et al., 1993). The Chop2-GFP
      viral vector was injected intravitreally into the eyes of newborn
      (P1) or adult mice at 2-12 months of age. Similar to the results
      observed in wild-type animals, bright GFP signal was observed in
      Chop2-GFP-injected retinas, predominately in retinal ganglion
      cells (FIGS. 4A and 4B). At the time of the recording experiments
      (?4 months of age unless otherwise indicated), photoreceptor cells
      were absent (FIG. 4C). The expression of Chop2-GFP was observed in
      the rd1/rd1 mice up to 16 months of age (3-6 months after the
      viral injection) as the case shown in FIG. 4A from a 15 month old
      rd1/rd1 mouse. These results indicate that inner retinal neurons
      in this photoreceptor-deficient model not only survive long after
      the complete death of photoreceptors but also retain the
      capability of stable expression of Chop2-GFP.<br>

      Light-Evoked Responses of ChR2-Expressing Surviving Inner Retinal
      Neurons of rd1/rd1 Mice<br>
      <br>
      The light response properties of the ChR2-expressing retinal
      neurons in rd1/rd1 mice were examined by whole-cell patch-clamp
      recording in retinal slices. The recordings were made from the
      GFP-positive cells located in the ganglion cell layer.
      Light-evoked currents were observed in GFP-positive cells. The
      magnitude of the current was again dependent on the light
      intensity (top traces in FIGS. 4D and 4E; also see light intensity
      and current relationships shown in FIG. 4F). Two groups of
      ChR2-expressing retinal neurons were observed based on their
      response properties: a group of transient spiking neurons (FIG.
      4D) and a group of sustained spiking neurons (FIG. 4E). The
      membrane depolarization and/or spike rates were also dependent on
      the light intensity (bottom traces in FIGS. 4D and 4E).
      Furthermore, light at higher intensities markedly accelerated the
      kinetics of the voltage responses as illustrated in the right
      panels of FIGS. 4D and 4E by superimposing the second traces
      (black) and the fourth traces (red) in an expanded time scale. The
      relationships of light intensity to the membrane depolarization,
      the spike firing rate, and the time to the first spike peak are
      shown in FIGS. 4G, 4H, and 4I, respectively. These results
      demonstrate that the surviving retinal third-order neurons with
      the expression of ChR2 are capable of encoding light intensity
      with membrane depolarization and/or action potential firing and
      response kinetics.<br>

      <br>
      Multielectrode Array Recordings of ChR2-Mediated Retinal
      Activities<br>
      <br>
      The spike coding capability of the photoreceptor-deficient retina
      of rd1/rd1 mice were examined after the expression of ChR2 by use
      of multielectrode array recordings from whole-mount retinas. As
      shown from a sample recording in FIG. 5A, spike firings with fast
      kinetics in response to light on and off were observed in
      Chop2-GFP-expressing retinas (n=11 retinas). The light-evoked
      spike firings were not affected by the application of CNQX (25-50
      µM) plus APV (25-50 µM) (n=3), indicating that the responses are
      originated from the ChR2 of the recorded cells. No such
      light-evoked spike firings were observed in retinas that were
      either injected with viral vectors carrying GFP alone (n=2
      retinas) or left uninjected (n=3). The latter confirmed the
      absence of photoreceptor-originated light responses. The
      light-evoked spike firings were not affected by suramine (100 µM)
      (n=2), which has been reported to be able to block melanopsin
      receptor-mediated photocurrent (Melyan et al., 2005 and Qiu et
      al., 2005).<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the response kinetics to both light on and off (see
      FIG. 5B) were much faster than those generated by the
      intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (Tu et al.,
      2005). These results indicated that a significant contribution to
      the observed light responses from the intrinsically photosensitive
      ganglion cells under our recording conditions is unlikely. The
      light-evoked responses were often found to be picked up by the
      majority of the electrodes (see FIG. 5A), consistent with the
      observation that Chop2-GFP was extensively expressed in the
      retinas. The vast majority of the responses were sustained during
      light stimulation. FIG. 5B illustrates the raw traces recorded by
      a single electrode in response to three incremental light stimuli.
      The raster plots of the spike activity sorted from a single neuron
      of the recording were shown in FIG. 5C. The firing frequency was
      remarkably stable during the course of the recording. The averaged
      spike rate histograms are shown in FIG. 5D. Again, the spike
      frequency was increased to the higher light intensity. The light
      responses could be recorded for up to 5 hr. These results
      demonstrate further that the ChR2-expressing retinal ganglion
      cells can reliably encode light intensity with spike firing rate.<br>
      <br>
      Example 7<br>
      <br>
      Visual-Evoked Potentials<br>
      <br>
      A study was conducted to test whether the ChR2-mediated light
      responses in the retinas of rd1/rd1 mice were transmitted to the
      visual cortex. The expression of transgenes, such as GFP, in
      retinal ganglion cells as achieved by AAV infection was reported
      to be able to extend to their terminations in higher visual
      centers in the brain (Harvey et al., 2002). Therefore the
      anatomical projections of the axon terminals of
      Chop2-GFP-expressing retinal ganglion cells were first examined.
      Consistently, Chop2-GFP labeled axon terminals of retinal ganglion
      cells were observed in several regions of the brain, including
      ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and dorsal lateral geniculate
      nucleus (FIG. 6A), as well as superior colliculus (FIG. 6B). These
      results indicate that the central projections of retinal ganglion
      cells in the degenerate retinas are maintained.<br>
      <br>
      Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from visual cortex were then
      examined. First, as illustrated in FIG. 6C, VEPs were observed in
      all tested wild-type mice (4-6 months of age) in response to light
      stimuli at the wavelengths of both 460 and 580 nm (n=6 eyes). When
      tested in Chop2-GFP-injected eyes of rd1/rd1 mice (6-11 months of
      age), VEPs were observed in the majority of the eyes (nine out of
      13) in response to light stimulus at the wavelength of 460 nm but
      not to light stimulus at the wavelength of 580 nm (FIG. 6D),
      consistent with the light sensitivity of ChR2 channels (see FIG.
      2B). The average amplitude of the VEPs in the Chop2-GFP-injected
      eyes in response to the light stimulus at the wavelength of 460 nm
      was 110±34 µV (mean±SE; n=10), which is smaller than that observed
      in wild-type mice (274±113 µV; n=6), although these two values are
      not significantly different (one-way ANOVA test, p&lt;0.1). The
      lower amplitudes of the VEPs in the Chop2-transfected mice
      compared to the wild-type mice are not surprising because the
      expression of ChR2 was probably only achieved in a small portion
      of the retinal ganglion cells. The average latency to the peak of
      the VEPs in the Chop2-GFP-injected eyes was 45±1.7 ms (n=10),
      which is shorter than that observed in wild-type mice (62±2.8 ms;
      n=6). These two values were significantly different (p&lt;0.01).
      The latter would be predicted because the light response mediated
      by ChR2 in retinal ganglion cells originates two synapses
      downstream of the photoreceptors. As a control, no detectable VEPs
      were observed to light stimulus at the wavelength of 460 nm in the
      eyes of the age-matched rd1/rd1 mice that were injected with viral
      vectors carrying GFP alone (n=5) (FIG. 6E). In addition, no
      detectable VEPs were observed in uninjected rd1/rd1 mice (n=3; 5
      months of age) to the wavelengths ranging from 420 to 620 nm (not
      shown), confirming that rd1/rd1 mice at ?5 months of age are
      completely blind based on VEPs.<br>
      <br>
      To further ensure that the VEPs in the blind rd1/rd1 mice
      originate from ChR2 expressed in their retinas, the action
      spectrum of the VEP were measured by plotting their normalized
      amplitudes in response to varying light wavelengths and
      intensities to obtain the relative sensitivity of the response
      (FIG. 6F) (n=3). The data points were well fitted by a
      vitamin-A1-based visual pigment template (Partridge and De Grip,
      1991) with a peak wavelength at 461 nm (FIG. 6G), a good match to
      the reported peak action spectrum of ChR2 at ~460 nm (Nagel et
      al., 2003). Taken together, these results demonstrated that
      expression of ChR2 in the photoreceptor-deficient retinas can
      restore visually evoked responses in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8<br>
      <br>
      Discussion of Examples 1-7<br>
      <br>
      The results presented herein demonstrated that the strategy of
      restoration of light responses in photoreceptor-deficient rodent
      retinas based on the expression of ChR2 is mechanistically and
      technically feasible. Most importantly, the results showed that
      ChR2 satisfies several major criteria for its use as a light
      sensor in retinal neurons. First, by delivery of an AAV vector
      carrying fused Chop2-GFP, the inventors showed the ability of
      retinal neurons to tolerate the prolonged expression of Chop2. To
      date, the expression of Chop2-GFP proteins had been achieved in
      nondystrophic rat retinal neurons for 12 months and in
      photoreceptor deficient rd1/rd1 mice for 6 months in vivo after
      the viral injection. The present results therefore indicate that
      the expression of ChR2 in retinal neurons is biocompatible under
      normal light cycle conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Second, these results showed that a sufficient number of ChR2 can
      be formed in retinal neurons, with only endogenous chromophore
      groups as supplied by regular diet, to produce robust membrane
      depolarizations and/or action potential firings in the retina and
      VEPs in visual cortex. It is worth emphasizing here that, unlike
      animal visual pigments that rapidly lose their chromophore after
      its photoisomerization from 11-cis to all-trans retinal (Wald,
      1968), for microbial-type rhodopsins, photoisomerization from
      all-trans to 11-cis retinal is reversible and both isomers remain
      attached to the protein (Oesterhelt, 1998). Once the ChR2 complex
      is formed, the light-sensitive channel can sustain multiple cycles
      of photoisomerization with the same chromophore moiety. Although
      the efficacy of the de novo ChR2 formation might be expected to
      depend on the availability of the chromophore group, the need for
      constant resupply of the chromophore to form new ChR2 does not
      appear to impose a limitation on overall ChR2 function. As
      observed in the multielectrode array recordings, ChR2 respond
      repeatedly to light stimulation for several hours in vitro without
      loss of activity. These results thus indicate that the turn-over
      rate for ChR2 is fairly slow, an additional advantage for use as
      an artificially produced light sensor.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, as reported originally in cell expression systems
      (Nagel et al., 2003), later in hippocampal neurons (Boyden et al.,
      2005, Ishizuka et al., 2006 and Li et al., 2005), and now shown in
      retinal neurons, a number of properties of the ChR2 channel are
      highly advantageous for its use as a light sensor.<br>
      <br>
      First, the ChR2 channel is permeable to the cations that underlie
      neuronal membrane excitability. Thus, activation of ChR2 channels
      by light can directly produce membrane depolarizations to mimic
      the ON-responses of inner retinal neurons. Indeed, as shown
      herein, the light-evoked responses mediated by ChR2 in nonspiking
      and spiking retinal neurons remarkably resemble the light
      responses of ON-bipolar cells and sustained ON-ganglion cells
      (Werblin and Dowling, 1969 and Kaneko, 1970).<br>
      <br>
      Second, the activation kinetics of the current in response to
      light are extremely fast, whereas the sustained components of the
      currents do not show apparent inactivation to continuous or
      repeated light illuminations. Thus, the ChR2-expressing neurons
      can signal with rapid kinetics but without pigment inactivation.
      Consistently, the expression of ChR2 has been shown to allow
      optical control of neural excitability with high temporal
      resolution (Boyden et al., 2005, Ishizuka et al., 2006 and Li et
      al., 2005). Furthermore, it is shown here that the magnitude and
      activation kinetics of the light-evoked current depend upon light
      irradiance over a 3-log-unit range. As demonstrated in the
      whole-cell and multielectrode array recordings, this would allow
      the encoding of various light intensities with graded membrane
      depolarizations and/or spike rates.<br>
      <br>
      Also of importance for the feasibility of the strategy of
      restoring light sensitivity in retinas after photoreceptor
      degeneration, results of this study show that many inner retinal
      neurons survive in aged rd1/rd1 mice (up to 16 months of age) and
      are capable of expressing ChR2 long after the death of all
      photoreceptors. This is consistent with histological studies
      showing that many inner retinal neurons survive, despite some
      remodeling, in this mouse model (Jimenez et al., 1996, Strettoi
      and Pignatelli, 2000 and Chang et al., 2002). Moreover, the
      present studies using ChR2 showed that the surviving inner retinal
      neurons retained their physiological capability to encode light
      signals with membrane depolarizations and/or action potential
      firings and to transmit visual signals to the visual cortex. Thus,
      the strategy based on the expression of ChR2 is suitable at least
      for certain retinal degenerative diseases at certain stages.<br>
      <br>
      The remodeling of inner retinal neurons triggered by photoreceptor
      degeneration raised some concerns for the retinal-based rescue
      strategy after the death of photoreceptors (Strettoi and
      Pignatelli, 2000, Jones et al., 2003 and Jones and Marc, 2005).
      However, retinal degenerative diseases are heterogeneous as to the
      time course of the degeneration, survival an d functional state of
      different cell types (Chang et al., 2002). The use of ChR2 is a
      powerful tool for undertaking such studies.<br>
      <br>
      Retinal remodeling is believed to be caused by deafferentation
      (Jones and Marc, 2005). Therefore, the restoration of the light
      sensitivity in inner retinal neurons may be able to prevent or
      delay the remodeling processes.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, according to the present invention, viral-based gene
      delivery systems, such as AAV vectors (Flannery et al., 1997,
      Bennett et al., 1999, Ali et al., 2000 and Acland et al., 2001),
      are tools for introducing Chop2 into retinal neurons as
      demonstrated herein.<br>
      <br>
      The present results showed that that viral construct with AAV
      serotype-2 and CAG promoter achieved robust expression of Chop2 in
      ganglion cells. However, because the expression of Chop2 with this
      construct appears to target both ON- and OFF-type ganglion cells,
      it remains to be determined how the conversion of both ON- and
      OFF-ganglion cells into ON-type affects the visual perception.<br>
      <br>
      Behavior studies in primates reported that pharmacological
      blockade of the ON channel in the retina did not severely impair
      such vision functions as the detection of light decrement and the
      perception of shape (Schiller et al., 1986). Therefore, targeting
      of ChR2 to the ON channel, for example to ON-type ganglion cells,
      is expected to result in useful vision.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated herein to express ChR2 in the more distal
      retinal neurons, such as bipolar cells; this approach would
      utilize the remaining signal processing functions of the
      degenerate retina. Targeting ChR2 to rod bipolar cells is
      particularly attractive because the depolarization of rod bipolar
      cells can lead to the ON and OFF responses at the levels of cone
      bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells (Wassle, 2004), thereby
      maintaining the ON and OFF channels that are inherent in the
      retina.<br>
      <br>
      The threshold light intensity required for producing responses in
      ChR2-expressing retinas appeared to be near 10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15
      &gt;photons cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1&gt;. For comparison, the
      thresholds for normal rod and cone photoreceptors are about
      10&lt;6 &gt;and 10&lt;10 &gt;photons cm&lt;-2&gt;s&lt;-1&gt;,
      respectively (Dacey et al., 2005). Therefore, the ChR2-expressing
      retinas would operate in substantially higher photonic range. The
      relatively low light sensitivity of the ChR2-expressing retinas
      compared to the normal retinas could be due to a number of
      factors. First, there may be a low cross-sectional density of ChR2
      molecules in the transfected retinal neurons compared with the
      visual pigments in rods and cones. Second, the ChR2-expressing
      inner retinal neurons lack the unique multilayer photoreceptor
      membrane organization, typical for the outer segments of rods and
      cones, which developed to achieve higher pigment density and thus
      increase the probability of catching photons (Steinberg, et al.,
      1980). Third, unlike visual pigments that propagate their signal
      through amplification cascade (Stryer, 1991), the directly
      light-gated ChR2 channels lack such amplification capabilities.
      Finally, in normal retinas, amplification of visual signals occurs
      as the signals converge from multiple photoreceptors to ganglion
      cells (Barlow et al., 1971). This process was not yet achieved in
      the ChR2-transfected retinas. It is not yet evident which of these
      factors contributes the most to the decreased light sensitivity of
      the ChR2-expressing retinas remains. Interestingly, ChR2 mediated
      phototaxis to low-intensity light in green algae (Sineshchekov et
      al., 2002; but see Kateriya et al. [2004]). Therefore, the light
      sensitivity of ChR2 in retinal neurons may have been altered by
      modifications introduced in the Chop2 molecule for the
      heterologous expression. Such a difference may also reflect
      different structural and functional organization of algae and
      mammalian cells.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, for clinical usage, light intensifying devices can
      be used to expand the light operation range.<br>
      <br>
      At present, no treatment is available for restoring vision once
      the photoreceptor cells have been lost. As noted above,
      transplantation of normal photoreceptor cells or progenitor cells
      (Bok, 1993 and Lund et al., 2001) or direct electrical stimulation
      of the surviving second- and third-order retinal neurons via
      retinal implants (Zrenner, 2002) have been proposed as possible
      strategies for restoration of light responses in the retina after
      rod and cone degeneration. An important advantage of the present
      invention is that it does not involve the introduction of tissues
      or devices into the retina and, therefore, may largely avoid the
      complications of immune reactions and bioincompatibilities. In
      addition, the present approach is expected to achieve high spatial
      resolution for the restored “vision” because the approach targets
      the cellular level. Thus, the expression of microbial-type channel
      rhodopsins, such as ChR2, in surviving retinal neurons is a
      strategy for the treatment of complete blindness caused by rod and
      cone degeneration.<br>

        <b>AAV-Mediated Subcellular Targeting of Heterologous Rhodopsins
          in Retinal Ganglion Cells</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Microbial type rhodopsins, such as the light-gated
      cation-selective membrane channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2/ChR2)
      or the ion pump halorhodopsin (HaloR) are expressed in retinal
      ganglion cells upon transduction using recombinant AAV vectors.
      Selective targeting of these transgenes for expression in discrete
      subcellular regions or sites is achieved by including a sorting
      motif in the vector that can target either the central area or
      surround (off-center) area of these cells. Nucleic acid molecules
      comprising nucleotide sequences encoding such rhodopsins and
      sorting motifs and their use in methods of differential expression
      of the transgene are disclosed. These compositions and methods
      provide significant improvements for restoring visual perception
      and various aspects of vision, particular in patients with retinal
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention in the field of molecular biology and
      medicine relates to the targeting of microbial-type rhodopsins,
      such as the light-gated cation-selective membrane channel,
      channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2 or ChR2) or the ion pump halorhodopsin
      (HaloR) in retinal ganglion cells as a basis for restoring visual
      perception and various aspects of vision.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Background Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Vision normally begins when rods and cones (photoreceptors)
      convert light signals to electrical signals that are then relayed
      through second- and third-order retinal neurons and the optic
      nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus and, then to the visual
      cortex where visual images are formed (Baylor, D, 1996, Proc.
      Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:560-565; Wassle, H, 2004, Nat. Rev.
      Neurosci. 5:747-57). The severe loss of photoreceptor cells can be
      caused by congenital retinal degenerative diseases, such as
      retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (Sung, C H et al., 1991, Proc. Natl.
      Acad. Sci. USA 88: 6481-85; Humphries, P et al., 1992, Science
      256:804-8; Weleber, R G et al., in: S J Ryan, Ed, Retina, Mosby,
      St. Louis (1994), pp. 335-466), and can result in complete
      blindness. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) also results
      from degeneration and death of photoreceptor cells, which can
      cause severe visual impairment within the centrally located best
      visual area of the visual field.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] As rods and cones are lost in humans as well as rodents and
      other animals, little or no signal is sent to the brain. There are
      currently no effective treatments or cures for inherited retinal
      degenerations that cause partial or total blindness.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Approaches to treatment of retinal degeneration include (1)
      preservation of remaining photoreceptors in patients with retinal
      degenerative disease, and (2) replacement of photoreceptors lost
      to retinal degeneration. For the first approach, neuroprotection
      with neurotrophic factors (LaVail, M M et al., 1992, Proc. Natl.
      Acad. Sci. USA 89:11249-53) and virus-vector-based delivery of
      wild-type genes for recessive null mutations (Acland, G M et al.,
      2001, Nat. Genet. 28:92-95) have come the furthest—to the point of
      clinical trials (Hauswirth, W W, 2005, Retina 25, S60; Jacobson,
      S. Protocol #0410-677, for adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated
      gene replacement therapy in Leber's Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), a
      specific form of retinal degeneration. This approach is not
      applicable in patients in advanced stages of retinal degeneration
      where photoreceptor cells must be replaced. One replacement
      approach involves transplantation of normal tissue or cells to the
      diseased retina. Another involves electrical-stimulation of
      remaining light-insensitive neurons via retinal implants in lieu
      of the lost cells (prosthetic substitution). Both methods face
      many obstacles. Hence, there is a continuing need for
      vision-restoring therapies for inherited blinding disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Histological studies in animal models of photoreceptor
      degeneration and in postmortem human eyes from patients with
      almost complete photoreceptor loss due to RP showed preservation
      of a significant number of inner retinal neurons, making retinal
      gene therapy a possible therapeutic option (e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
      5,827,702; WO 00/15822 (2000) and WO 98/48097 (1998)).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Retinal gene transfer of a reporter gene, green fluorescent
      protein (GFP), using a recombinant AAV (rAAV) was demonstrated in
      normal primates (Bennett, J et al. 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA
      96, 9920-25). However, the restoration of vision in a blinding
      disease of animals, particularly in humans and other mammals,
      caused by genetic defects in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
      and/or photoreceptor cells has not been achieved. Bennett and
      colleagues have described rescue of photoreceptors by gene therapy
      in a mutant RPE65 gene model of rapid degeneration of
      photoreceptors and replacement therapy with the normal gene to
      replace/supplant the mutant gene. (US Pat Publ 2004/0022766,
      Acland et al.). This therapy showed some success in a
      naturally-occurring dog model of human LCA—the RPE65 mutant dog.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Heterologous expression of Drosophila rhodopsin (Zemelman,
      B V et al., 2002, Neuron 33:15-22) and melanopsin, the putative
      photopigment of the intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion
      cells (“ROC”) has been reported (Melyan, Z. et al., 2005, Nature
      433:741-5; Panda, S. et al., 2005, Science 307:600-604; Qiu, X. et
      al., 2005, Nature 433:745-9). These photopigments, however, are
      coupled to membrane channels via a G protein signaling cascade and
      use cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde as their chromophore. Expression
      of multiple genes would be required to render photosensitivity and
      their light response kinetics is rather slow.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present inventor's work, including the present
      invention, utilizes microbial-type rhodopsins that are similar to
      bacteriorhodopsin (Oesterhelt, D et al., 1973, Proc. Natl. Acad.
      Sci. USA 70:2853-7), whose conformation change is caused by
      reversible photoisomerization of their chromophore group,
      all-trans retinaldehyde, and is directly coupled to ion movement
      through the membrane (Oesterhelt, D., 1998, Curr. Opin. Struct.
      Biol. 8:489-500). Two microbial-type opsins, channelopsin-1 and -2
      (Chop1 and Chop2), have been cloned from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
      (Nagel, G. et al., 2002, Science 296:2395-8; Sineshchekov, O A et
      al., 2002, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:8689-94; Nagel, G. et
      al., 2003, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 13940-45) and shown to
      form directly light-gated membrane channels when expressed in
      Xenopus laevis oocytes or HEK293 cells in the presence of
      all-trans retinal. Chop2, a seven transmembrane domain protein,
      becomes photo-switchable when bound to the chromophore all-trans
      retinal. Chop2 is particularly attractive because its functional
      light-sensitive channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (Chop2 retinalidene
      abbreviated ChR2) with the attached chromophore is permeable to
      physiological cations. Unlike animal rhodopsins, which only bind
      the 11-cis conformation, Chop2/ChR2 binds all-trans retinal
      isomers, obviating the need for all-trans to 13-cis isomerization
      supplied by the vertebrate visual cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] However, the long-term compatibility of expressing ChR2 in
      native neurons in vivo in general and the properties of
      ChR2-mediated light responses in retinal neurons in particular
      remained unknown until the work of the present inventor and
      colleagues. Indeed their work (and that of others) represent the
      pioneering demonstration of the (a) feasibility of restoring light
      sensitivity to a degenerate retina, (b) transmission of
      light-driven information to higher visual centers, and mediation
      of visually guided behaviors through such prosthetic
      interventions. This work proved that the insertion of such
      “optical neuromodulators” or “light sensors” as ChR2 into normally
      photo-insensitive retinal neurons is a promising approach for
      restoring sight to profoundly blind individuals. These strategies
      included the delivery of the directly photosensitive cation
      channel ChR2 and the photosensitive chloride pump halorhodopsin
      (abbreviated herein “HaloR” and elsewhere “NpHR” or “eNpHR”
      because of its origin from Natronobacterium pharaonis (Lanyi, J K
      et al. J. Biol. Chem. 265:1253-1260 (1990). Such work has been
      reported by the present inventor's group (Bi, A. et al., Neuron
      50:23-33 (2006), Ivanova, E et al., Mol. Vis. 15:1680-9 (2009),
      Zhang, Y. et al., J Neurosci. 29:9186-96 (2009), primarily with
      ChR2. Others have delivered and expressed ChR2 (Lagali et al.,
      Nat. Neurosci. 11:667-675 (2008); NpHR by (Busskamp V. et al.,
      Science 329, 413-417 (2010); synthetically engineered potassium

      [0013] The present inventor and colleagues (Bi, A. et al., Neuron
      50:23-33 (2006); WO2007/131180) disclosed adeno-associated virus
      (AAV2)-mediated expression of exogenously delivered light-gated
      membrane cation channel, ChR2, or light-driven chloride ion pump,
      HaloR, in inner retinal neurons and demonstrated that expression
      of ChR2 in surviving inner retinal neurons of a mouse with
      photoreceptor degeneration can restore the ability of the retina
      to encode light signals and transmit the light signals to the
      visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present inventor and colleagues (Zhang, Y. et al., J
      Neurosci. 29:9186-96 (2009 Jul. 22). reported that the expression
      HaloR can effectively restore OFF responses in inner retinal
      neurons of mice with retinal degeneration. HaloR-expressing RGCs
      respond to light with rapid hypopolarization and suppression of
      spike activity. After termination of the light stimulus, their
      membrane potential exhibited a rapid rebound overshoot with robust
      sustained or transient spike firing. Coexpression of ChR2/HaloR in
      RGCs produced ON, OFF, and even ON-OFF responses, depending on the
      wavelength of the light stimulus. Suggesting that the expression
      of multiple microbial rhodopsins such as ChR2 and HaloR is a
      possible strategy to restore both ON and OFF light responses in
      the retina after the death of rod and cone photoreceptors.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The present invention is a refinement and significant step
      forward of the inventor's prior work, being directed to
      differential, subcellular “site-selective expression” of these
      light-sensor-encoding nucleic acids by adding sorting or targeting
      motifs to the vectors that confer such selectivity. This adds to
      the “spatial resolution” of vision restoration achieved in this
      manner in those suffering vision loss or blindness caused, for
      example, by any of a number of retinal degenerative diseases. The
      present inventor's approach does not require, introducing
      exogenous cells and tissues or physical devices, thus avoiding
      obstacles encountered by existing approaches, though the combined
      use of the present approach with visual prostheses or devices is
      also envisioned.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] The present inventor has discovered that differentially
      targeted expression of ChR2 and HaloR to different subcellular
      regions in RGCs recreates the antagonistic center-surround
      receptive field in these cells that further permits improvement of
      the visual spatial processing for restored vision. The primary
      spatial distinction of expression is in center vs. peripheral
      regions of the cells. Peripheral is also referred to in the art as
      the “surround” or as “off center,” terms that are well understood.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] RGCs are rendered light sensitive by expression of ChR2
      and/or HaloR selectively in somatodendritic region while being
      kept to a minimum in the axonal region. This enables maintenance
      of visual spatial processing. This is based on the discovery that
      a number of “sorting motifs” also referred to here as “targeting
      motifs, “sorting sequences” or “targeting sequences” present in a
      vector that comprises the light sensor encoding nucleic acid. Such
      a motif mediates site- or region-selective expression of the ChR2
      or HaloR in subcellular regions of a retinal neuron, preferably an
      RGC. This targeting serves as a basis for enhanced spatial control
      and specificity, and results in transmission of appropriate
      signals, providing better contrast, which more closely resembling
      signals from a healthy, intact retina, to higher centers of the
      visual cortex to compensate for damage and degeneration in retinal
      photoreceptors.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The present invention is directed to a nucleic acid
      molecule encoding a rhodopsin for differential expression in

      rhodopsin or a light-driven ion pump rhodopsin;<br>
      (b) linked in frame to (a), a second nucleotide sequence encoding

      reporter polypeptide, preferably GFP; a preferred sequence is SEQ
      ID NO:25.<br>
      <br>

      sequences are a nucleotide sequence encoding (a) voltage-gated
      potassium channel 2.1 (Kv2.1), which is or comprises SEQ ID NO:1;
      or (b) the ankyrin binding domain of voltage-gated sodium channel

      molecule, the motif is one that targets the rhodopsin (±the
      reporter gene) to the surround or off-center part of the neuron's
      receptive field, for example, to the somatodendritic region of the

      <br>
      [0028] Also provided is a recombinant adeno-associated virus
      expression vector, preferably an AAV2 vector, comprising any of
      the above nucleic acid molecules. In the vector, the sequence of
      the nucleic acid molecule is flanked at its 5' end by a 5'

      <br>
      [0029] As above, in one embodiment of the expression vector, the

      motif is one that targets the surround or off-center of the
      neuron's receptive field. Here, the motif is selected from the

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0058] The present inventors discovered that certain protein
      sorting motifs used in AAV-mediated transduction direct targeted
      expression of Chop2 or HaloR or, for visualization, a test
      reporter gene (Green fluorescent protein, GFP) to RGCs results in
      differential expression of the targeted reporter gene in different
      compartments or subcellular sites of the RGCs.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The present Examples show differential expression of
      ubiquitously expressing light sensitive channels, namely ChR2
      driven by the CAG promoter and under the influence of various
      targeting motifs in distinct subcellular regions or sites of
      retinal ganglion cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] However, targeting of depolarizing membrane channels, such
      as ChR2, to the ON-type retinal neurons might result in better
      useful vision.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In addition, expression of light sensors in more distal
      retinal neurons, such as bipolar cells, would utilize the
      remaining signal processing functions of the degenerate retina.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] By expressing a depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, in
      ON type retinal neurons (ON type ganglion cells and/or ON type
      bipolar cells) and expressing a hypopolarizing light sensor, such
      as HaloR (a chloride pump) (Han, X et al., 2007, PLoS ONE, March
      21; 2:e299; Mang, F et al., 2007; Nature 446:633-9; present
      inventors' results) in OFF type retinal neurons (OFF type ganglion
      cells and/or OFF type bipolar cells) could create ON and OFF
      pathways in photoreceptor degenerated retinas.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] According to the present invention, the followings
      approaches used to restore the light sensitivity of inner retinal
      neurons are enhanced by the use, disclosed herein, of
      peptide/polypeptide sorting motifs expressed using recombinant
      vectors in selected subcellular sites/regions of retinal neurons,
      particularly RGC.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] (1) Ubiquitously expressing light sensitive channels, such
      as ChR2, are employed to produced membrane depolarization in all
      types of ganglion cells (both ON and OFF ganglion cells), or all
      types of bipolar cells (rod bipolar cells, and ON and OFF cone
      bipolar cells). The AAV vector with CAG promoter has already
      partially achieved this approach in rodent retinas, as exemplified
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] (2) A depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, is targeted
      to ON type retinal neurons such as ON type ganglion cells or ON
      type bipolar cells. Fragments of a human gap junctional protein
      (connexin-36) promoter were found to target GFP in ON-type retinal
      ganglion cells by using AAV-2 virus vector (Greenberg K P et al.,
      2007, ARVO abstract, 2007). A readily packable shorter version of
      mGluR6 promoter of (&lt;2.5 kb) would allow targeting of ChR2 to
      ON type bipolar cells (both rod bipolar cells and ON type cone
      bipolar cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] (3) Cell specific promoters are used to target the specific
      types of retinal neurons. A promoter that could target rod bipolar
      cells is Pcp2 (L7) promoter (Tomomura, M et al., 2001, Eur J.
      Neurosci. 14:57-63). The length of the active promoter is
      preferably less that 2.5 Kb so it can be packaged into the AAV
      viral cassette.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] (4) A depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2, is targeted
      to ON type ganglion cells or ON type cone bipolar cells and a
      hypopolarizing light sensor, such as halorhodopsin, to OFF type
      ganglion cells or OFF type cone bipolar cells to create ON and OFF
      pathways. As described above, an adequately short (packable)
      version of mGluR6 promoter (&lt;2.5 kb) would allow targeting of

      would be used to target halorhodopsin to OFF cone bipolar cells

      Name: Each sorting motif was named based on the protein from which
      it was derived.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The functional consequence of expressing ubiquitously
      expressing light sensitive channels, namely ChR2, in RGC by CAG
      promoter, coupled with the targeting to selected subcellular sites
      suggest that this will contribute to restoring useful vision.
      However, targeting of depolarizing membrane channels, such as
      ChR2, to ON-type retinal neurons might result in better useful
      vision. By expressing a depolarizing light sensor, such as ChR2,
      in the desired subcellular regions of ON type retinal neurons (ON
      type RGC and/or ON type bipolar cells) and expressing a
      hypopolarizing light sensor, such as HaloR in selected subcellular
      sites of OFF type retinal neurons (OFF type RGC and/or OFF type
      bipolar cells) could create even more useful ON and OFF pathways
      in photoreceptor degenerated retinas that is possible without the
      selective targeting mediated by the sorting motifs described here.
      A preferred embodiment would be:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] (1) By employing a “center-targeting” motif, such as Kv2.1
      or Nav1.6, target ChR2 to the center receptive field of ON RGC,
      while targeting HaloR to the surround (-Off-center) of such cells
      using motifs such as NLG-1 or MLPH. Activation by light of such
      cells would result in depolarization (stimulation) of the center
      and hypopolarization (inhibition) of the surround.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] (2) By employing a “center-targeting” motif, such as Kv2.1
      or Nav1.6, target HaloR to the center receptive field of OFF RGC,
      while targeting ChR2 to the surround of such cells using motifs
      such as NLG-1 or MLPH. Activation by light of such cells would
      result in inhibition of the center and stimulation of the
      surround.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Such combined treatment would enhance not only signal
      transmission but contrast and hence visual resolution in such
      molecularly enhanced or modified cells. This more closely
      resembles the physiological effects of signals transmitted to
      these cells by retinal photoreceptors in a normal vision state.
      Such specificity and selectivity would be aided by the use of ON
      cell-specific promoters and OFF cell-specific promoters compared
      to the ubiquitous promoters exemplified here. Once such promoters
      are identified, they would be inserted into the various vectors
      described here in place of CAG. Use of the present composition and
      methods<br>
      <br>
      Vectors<br>
      <br>
      [0075] According to the various embodiments of the present
      invention, a variety of known nucleic acid vectors may be used in
      these methods, e.g., recombinant viruses, such as recombinant
      adeno-associated virus (rAAV), recombinant adenoviruses,
      recombinant retroviruses, recombinant poxviruses, and other known
      viruses in the art, as well as plasmids, cosmids and phages, etc.
      Many publications well-known in the art discuss the use of a
      variety of such vectors for delivery of genes. See, e.g., Ausubel
      et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp;
      Sons, New York, latest edition; Kay, M A. et al., 2001, Nat. Med.,
      7:33-40; and Walther W et al., 2000, Drugs 60:249-71). Methods for
      assembly of the recombinant vectors are well-known. See, for
      example, WO00/15822 and other references cited therein, all of
      which are incorporated by reference. There are advantages and
      disadvantages to the various viral vector systems. The limits of
      how much DNA can be packaged is one determinant in choosing which
      system to employ. rAAV tend to be limited to about 4.5 kb of DNA,
      whereas lentivirus (e.g., retrovirus) system can accommodate 4-5
      kb.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] AAV Vectors<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Adeno-associated viruses are small, single-stranded DNA
      viruses which require a helper virus for efficient replication
      (Berns, K I, Parvoviridae: the viruses and their replication, p.
      1007-1041 (vol. 2), in Fields, B N et al., Fundamental Virology,
      3rd Ed., (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia (1995)). The
      4.7 kb genome of AAV has two inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and
      two open reading frames (ORFs) which encode the Rep proteins and
      Cap proteins, respectively. The Rep reading frame encodes four
      proteins of molecular weights 78, 68, 52 and 40 kDa. These
      proteins primarily function in regulating AAV replication and
      rescue and integration of the AAV into the host cell chromosomes.
      The Cap reading frame encodes three structural proteins of
      molecular weights 85 (VP 1), 72 (VP2) and 61 (VP3) kDa which form
      the virion capsid (Berns, supra). VP3 comprises &gt;80% of total
      AAV virion proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Flanking the rep and cap ORFs at the 5' and 3' ends are 145
      bp ITRs, the first 125 bp's of which can form Y- or T-shaped
      duplex structures. The two ITRs are the only cis elements
      essential for AAV replication, rescue, packaging and integration
      of the genome. Two conformations of AAV ITRs called “flip” and
      “flop” exist (Snyder, R O et al., 1993, J. Virol., 67:6096-6104;
      Berns, K I, 1990 Microbiol Rev, 54:316-29). The entire rep and cap
      domains can be excised and replaced with a transgene such as a
      reporter or therapeutic transgene (Carter, B J, in Handbook of
      Parvoviruses, P. Tijsser, ed., CRC Press, pp. 155-68 (1990)).<br>
      <br>
      [0079] AAVs have been found in many animal species, including
      primates, canine, fowl and human (Murphy, F A et al., The
      Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: Sixth Rept of the
      Int'l Comm on Taxonomy of Viruses, Arch Virol, Springer-Verlag,
      1995). Six primate serotypes are known (AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4,
      AAV5 and AAV6) (and more are known that infect other classes of
      mammals)<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The AAV ITR sequences and other AAV sequences employed in
      generating the minigenes, vectors, and capsids, and other
      constructs used in the present invention may be obtained from a
      variety of sources. For example, the sequences may be provided by
      any of the above 6 AAV serotypes or other AAV serotypes or other
      densoviruses, including both presently known human AAV and yet to
      yet-to-be-identified serotypes. Similarly, AAVs known to infect
      other animal species may be the source of ITRs used in the present
      molecules and constructs. Capsids from a variety of serotypes of
      AAV may be combined in various mixtures with the other vector
      components (e.g., WO01/83692 (Hildiger et al.; U.S. Pat. No.
      7,056,502; US Pat Pub. 2003/0013189 (Wilson et al.,), Indeed there
      are advantages to various virion types related to their
      vulnerability to pre-existing immunity in humans, the efficiency
      of transduction, and/or duration of expression. Thus it may be
      preferable to use pseudotyped, rAAV virions wherein the rAAV2 ITRs
      described herein are combined with AAV5 capsid proteins. Such
      constructs may be advantageous because humans are less likely to
      have been pre-exposed to AAV5 vs. AAV2, and therefore are less
      likely to have immunological memory (e.g., circulating antibodies
      or capsid-specific T lymphocytes). For other descriptions of the
      use of various of these rAAV virions, see, for example,
      WO2005/021768 (Tak et al.); Adriaansen, J et al., Ann Rheum Dis
      2005, 64:1677-1684; US Pat. Pub. 2004-072351 (Womer et al.); U.S
      Pat. Pub. 2005/0255089 (Chiorini et al.), Adriaansen, J et al.,
      Ann Rheum Dis 2005, 64:1677-1684, all of these references
      concerning rAAV are incorporated by reference in their entirety.
      In general, while rAAV vectors have been exemplified herein, the
      present invention includes AAV2 ITR's combined with capsid
      proteins of any of 6 known primate AAV serotypes. It is also known
      in the art that certain mutations in capsid proteins can enhance
      transfection efficiency, and it would within the ordinary skill of
      the art to test and select appropriate mutations for use in the
      present invention. Many of these viral strains or serotypes are
      available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC),
      Manassas, Va., or are available from a variety of other sources
      (academic or commercial).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] It may be desirable to synthesize sequences used in
      preparing the vectors and viruses of the invention using known
      techniques, based on published AAV sequences, e.g., available from
      a variety of databases. The source of the sequences utilized to
      prepare the present constructs is not considered to be limiting.
      Similarly, the selection of the AAV serotype and species (of
      origin) is within the skill of the art and is not considered
      limiting<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The rAAV Minigene or Cassette<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As used herein, the rAAV construct (e.g., a minigene or
      cassette) is packaged into a rAAV virion. At minimum, the rAAV
      minigene is formed by AAV ITRs and a heterologous nucleic acid
      molecule for delivery to a host cell. Most suitably, the minigene
      comprises ITRs, most preferably AAV2 ITRs, located 5' and 3' to
      the heterologous sequence (rhodopsin protein and targeting
      sequence) being expressed. Vectors comprising 5' ITR and 3' ITR
      sequences arranged in tandem, e.g., 5' to 3' or a head-to-tail, or
      in another configuration may also be useful. Other embodiments
      include a minigene with multiple copies of the ITRs, or one in
      which 5' ITRs (or conversely, 3' ITRs) are located both 5' and 3'
      to the heterologous sequence. The ITRs sequences may be located
      immediately upstream and/or downstream of the heterologous
      sequence; intervening sequences may be present. As noted, the
      preferred ITRs are from AAV2, but they may also originate from
      AAV5 or from any other AAV serotype. Moreover, the present
      construct or minigene may include 5' ITRs from one serotype and 3'
      ITRs from another.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The AAV sequences used are preferably the 140145 bp
      cis-acting 5' and 3' ITR sequences (e.g., Carter, B J, supra).
      Preferably, the entire ITR sequence is used, although minor
      modifications are permissible. The most ITR's used in the present
      examples are<br>

      <br>
      [0085] Methods for modifying these ITR sequences are well-known
      (e.g., Sambrook, J. et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory
      Manual, 3&lt;rd &gt;Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring
      Harbor, N.Y., 2001; Brent, R et al., eds., Current Protocols in
      Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2003; Ausubel, F M
      et al., eds., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 5thedition,
      Current Protocols, 2002; Carter et al., supra; and Fisher, K et
      al., 1996 J. Virol. 70:520-32). It is conventional to engineer the
      rAAV virus using known methods (e.g., Bennett, J et al. 1999,
      supra).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] An example of such a molecule employed in the present
      invention is a “cis-acting” plasmid containing the heterologous
      sequence, preferably the ChR2 (any of SEQ ID NO:30-39) or HaloR
      sequence (any of SEQ ID NO:40-47, with or without an in-frame GFP
      sequence, with an in-frame sorting motif, promoter/regulatory
      sequences, all flanked by the 5' and 3' AAV ITR sequences.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The heterologous sequence encodes a protein or polypeptide
      which is desired to be delivered to and expressed in a cell and a
      targeting motif that differentially targets the polypeptide to
      particular subcellular regions of the cell, preferably an RGC.<br>

      <br>
      [0089] In a most preferred embodiment, the heterologous sequence
      is a nucleic acid molecule that functions as a transgene. The term
      “transgene” as used herein refers to a nucleic acid sequence
      heterologous to the AAV sequence, and encoding a desired product,
      preferably ChR2 or HaloR plus the sorting motif, and the
      regulatory sequences which direct or modulate transcription and/or
      translation of this nucleic acid in a host cell, enabling
      expression in such cells of the encoded product. Preferred
      polypeptide products are those that can be delivered to the eye,
      particularly to retinal neurons, most preferably to RGC.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The transgene/targeting sequence is delivered and
      differentially expressed in selected subcellular sites as directed
      by the sorting motif, in order to treat or otherwise improve the
      vision status of a subject with an ocular disorder. The targeted
      ocular cells are preferably retinal neurons, namely, bipolar cells
      and most preferably, RGC.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Based on the studies reported in WO2007/131180, the
      brightness of the light needed to stimulate evoked potential in
      transduced mouse retinas, indicates that a channel opsin with
      increased light sensitivity may be more desirable. This can be
      achieved by selection of a suitable naturally occurring opsin, for
      example other microbial-type rhodopsins, or by modifying the light
      sensitivity of ChR2 as well as its other properties, such as ion
      selectivity and spectral sensitivity, to produce diversified
      light-sensitive channels to better fit the need for vision
      restoration.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Different transgenes may be used to encode separate
      subunits of a protein being delivered, or to encode different
      polypeptides the co-expression of which is desired. If a single
      transgene includes DNA encoding each of several subunits, the DNA
      encoding each subunit may be separated by an internal ribozyme
      entry site (IRES), which is preferred for short subunit-encoding
      DNA sequences (e.g., total DNA, including IRES is &lt;5 kB). Other
      methods which do not employ an IRES may be used for co-expression,
      e.g., the use of a second internal promoter, an alternative splice
      signal, a co- or post-translational proteolytic cleavage strategy,
      etc., all of which are known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The coding sequence or non-coding sequence of the present
      nucleic acids, including all domains to be expressed preferably
      are codon-optimized for the species in which they are to be
      expressed, particularly mammals and humans. Such
      codon-optimization is routine in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] While a preferred transgene encodes a full length
      polypeptide, preferably ChR2, the present invention is also
      directed to vectors that encode a biologically active fragment of
      ChR2 (nucleotides: SEQ ID NO:19; amino acids: SEQ ID NO:20) or a
      (preferably conservative) amino acid substitution variant or
      mutant of ChR2, or a full length HaloR (nucleotide SEQ ID NO:23;
      amino acid SEQ ID NO:24) or a biologically active fragment,
      variant, mutant, or fusion/chimeric nucleic acid encoding a fusion
      protein. A preferred point mutation named CatCh (calcium
      translocating channelrhodopsin (mutation at L132C) mediates an
      accelerated response time and a voltage response that is ~70-fold
      more light sensitive than that of wild-type ChR2; these properties
      stem from enhanced Ca2+ permeability. (Kleinlogel, S et al.,
      Nature Neuroscience 14:513-518 (2011)). Such variants, mutants and
      fragments of any other polypeptide of the invention to be
      expressed in retinal neurons are within the scope of this
      invention. When a fragment or variant of the full length and
      native coding sequence is expressed by the targets cells being
      transformed and is able to endow such cells with light sensitivity
      that is functionally equivalent to that of the full length or
      substantially full length polypeptide having a native, rather than
      variant, amino acid sequence. A biologically active fragment or
      variant is a “functional equivalent”—a term that is well
      understood in the art and is further defiled in detail herein. The
      requisite biological activity of the encoded fragment or variant,
      using any method disclosed herein or known in the art to establish
      activity of a channel opsin, has the following activity relative
      to the wild-type native polypeptide: about 50%, about 55%, about
      60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about
      90%, about 95%, about 99%, and any range derivable therein, such
      as, for example, from about 70% to about 80%, and more preferably
      from about 81% to about 90%; or even more preferably, from about
      91% to about 99%.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] It should be appreciated that any variations in the coding
      sequences of the present nucleic acids and vectors that, as a
      result of the degeneracy of the genetic code, express a
      polypeptide of the same sequence, are included within the scope of
      this invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The amino acid sequence identity of the encoded polypeptide
      variants of the present invention are determined using standard
      methods, typically based on certain mathematical algorithms. In a
      preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid
      sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol.
      Biol. 48:444-453 (1970) algorithm which has been incorporated into
      the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at
      http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossom 62 matrix or a PAM250
      matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a
      length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred
      embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences
      is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package
      (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix
      and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In another embodiment, the percent identity
      between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using
      the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (CABIOS, 4:11-17 (1989)) which
      has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using
      a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a
      gap penalty of 4. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the
      present invention can further be used as a “query sequence” to
      perform a search against public databases, for example, to
      identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches
      can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (Altschul et
      al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10). BLAST nucleotide searches
      can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12
      to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to, e.g., DAN encoding
      Chop2 of C. reinhardtii. BLAST protein searches can be performed
      with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino
      acid sequences homologous to the appropriate reference protein
      such as Chop2. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison
      purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized (Altschul et al. (1997)
      Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped
      BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs
      (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See World Wide Web URL
      ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The preferred amino acid sequence variant has the following
      degrees of sequence identity with the native, full length channel
      opsin polypeptide, preferably Chop2 from C. reinhardtii (SEQ ID
      NO:_) or with a fragment thereof (e.g., SEQ ID NO:_): about 50%,
      about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 71%, about 72%,
      about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%,
      about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about 84%,
      about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, about 90%,
      about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%,
      about 97%, about 98%, or about 99%, and any range derivable
      therein, such as, for example, from about 70% to about 80%, and
      more preferably from about 81% to about 90%; or even more
      preferably, from about 91% to about 99% identity. A preferred
      biologically active fragment comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO:3,
      which corresponds to residues 1-315 of the full length SEQ ID
      NO:6, or comprises or consists of SEQ ID NO:8.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Any of a number of known recombinant methods are used to
      produce a DNA molecule encoding the fragment or variant. For
      production of a variant, it is routine to introduce mutations into
      the coding sequence to generate desired amino acid sequence
      variants of the invention. Site-directed mutagenesis is a
      well-known technique for which protocols and reagents are
      commercially available (e.g., Zoller, M J et al., 1982, Nucl Acids
      Res 10:6487-6500; Adelman, J P et al., 1983, DNA 2:183-93). These
      mutations include simple deletions or insertions, systematic
      deletions, insertions or substitutions of clusters of bases or
      substitutions of single bases.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In terms of functional equivalents, it is well understood
      by those skilled in the art that, inherent in the definition of a
      “biologically functional equivalent” protein, polypeptide, gene or
      nucleic acid, is the concept that there is a limit to the number
      of changes that may be made within a defined portion of the
      molecule and still result in a molecule with an acceptable level
      of equivalent biological activity. Biologically functional
      equivalent peptides are thus defined herein as those peptides in
      which certain, not most or all, of the amino acids may be
      substituted.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In particular, the shorter the length of the polypeptide,
      the fewer amino acids changes should be made. Longer fragments may
      have an intermediate number of changes. The full length
      polypeptide protein will have the most tolerance for a larger
      number of changes. It is also well understood that where certain
      residues are shown to be particularly important to the biological
      or structural properties of a polypeptide residues in a binding
      regions or an active site, such residues may not generally be
      exchanged. In this manner, functional equivalents are defined
      herein as those poly peptides which maintain a substantial amount
      of their native biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] For a detailed description of protein chemistry and
      structure, see Schulz, G E et al., Principles of Protein
      Structure, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978, and Creighton, T. E.,
      Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman &amp;
      Co., San Francisco, 1983, which are hereby incorporated by
      reference. The types of substitutions that may be made in the
      protein molecule may be based on analysis of the frequencies of
      amino acid changes between a homologous protein of different
      species, such as those presented in Table 1-2 of Schulz et al.
      (supra) and FIG. 3-9 of Creighton (supra). Based on such an
      analysis, conservative substitutions are defined herein as
      exchanges within one of the following five groups:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      1&nbsp; Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar&nbsp; Ala,
      Ser, Thr (Pro, Gly);<br>
      &nbsp; residues<br>
      2&nbsp; Polar, negatively charged residues and&nbsp; Asp, Asn,
      Glu, Gln;<br>
      &nbsp; their amides<br>
      3&nbsp; Polar, positively charged residues&nbsp; His, Arg, Lys;<br>
      4&nbsp; Large aliphatic, nonpolar residues&nbsp; Met, Leu, Ile,
      Val (Cys)<br>
      5&nbsp; Large aromatic residues&nbsp; Phe, Tyr, Trp.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The three amino acid residues in parentheses above have
      special roles in protein architecture. Gly is the only residue
      lacking a side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain.
      Pro, because of its unusual geometry, tightly constrains the
      chain. Cys can participate in disulfide bond formation, which is
      important in protein folding.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The hydropathy index of amino acids may also be considered
      in selecting variants. Each amino acid has been assigned a
      hydropathy index on the basis of their hydrophobicity and charge
      characteristics, these are: Ile (+4.5); Val (+4.2); Leu (+3.8);
      Phe (+2.8); Cys (+2.5); Met (+1.9); Ala (+1.8); Glycine (-0.4);
      Thr (-0.7); Ser (-0.8); Trp (-0.9); Tyr (-1.3); Pro (-1.6); His
      (-3.2); Glu (-3.5); Gln (-3.5); Asp (-3.5); Asn (-3.5); Lys
      (-3.9); and Arg (-4.5). The importance of the hydropathy index in
      conferring interactive biological function on a proteinaceous
      molecule is generally understood in the art (Kyte and Doolittle,
      1982, J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-32). It is known that certain amino
      acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar
      hydropathy index or score and still retain a similar biological
      activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathy index, the
      substitution of amino acids whose hydropathy indices are within ±2
      is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly
      preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly
      preferred. It is also understood in the art that the substitution
      of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of
      hydrophilicity, particularly where the biological functional
      equivalent polypeptide thereby created is intended for use in
      certain of the present embodiments. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101,
      discloses that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a
      proteinaceous molecule, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its
      adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the
      molecule. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101 for a hydrophilicity values.
      In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, the
      substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within
      ±2 is preferred, those which are within ±1 are particularly
      preferred, and those within ±0.5 are even more particularly
      preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Vector Components and their Sequences.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Promoters/Regulatory Sequences<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The expression vector of the present invention includes
      appropriate sequences operably linked to the coding sequence(s) or
      ORF(s) to promote its expression in a targeted host cell.
      “Operably linked” sequences include both expression control
      sequences such as. promoters that are contiguous with the coding
      sequences and expression control sequences that act in trans or
      distally to control the expression of the polypeptide product.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Expression control sequences include appropriate
      transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer
      sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and
      polyadenylation signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic
      mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (e.g., Kozak
      consensus sequence); sequences that enhance nucleic acid or
      protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance
      protein processing and/or secretion. Many varied expression
      control sequences, including native and non-native, constitutive,
      inducible and/or tissue-specific, are known in the art and may be
      utilized herein. depending upon the type of expression desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Expression control sequences for eukaryotic cells typically
      include a promoter, an enhancer, such as one derived from an
      immunoglobulin gene, SV40, CMV, etc., and a polyadenylation
      sequence which may include splice donor and acceptor sites. The
      polyadenylation (polyA) sequence generally is inserted 3' to the
      coding sequence and 5' to the 3' ITR sequence. The polyA from
      bovine growth hormone (bGH) is a suitable sequence and is
      abbreviated “bGHpolyA” (SEQ ID NO:28).<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The regulatory sequences useful herein may also contain an
      intron, such as one located between the promoter/enhancer sequence
      and the coding sequence. One useful intron sequence is derived
      from SV40, and is referred to as the SV40 T intron sequence.
      Another includes the woodchuck hepatitis virus
      post-transcriptional element. (See, for example, Wang L and Verma,
      I, 1999, Proc Nat'l Acad Sci USA, 96:3906-10).<br>
      <br>
      [0109] An IRES sequence, or other suitable system as discussed
      above, may be used to produce more than one polypeptide from a
      single transcript. An exemplary IRES is the poliovirus IRES which
      supports transgene expression in photoreceptors, RPE and ganglion
      cells. Preferably, the IRES is located 3' to the coding sequence
      in the present vector, preferably an rAAV vector.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The promoter may be selected from a number of constitutive
      or inducible promoters that can drive expression of the selected
      transgene in an ocular setting, preferably in retinal neurons. A
      preferred promoter is “cell-specific”, meaning that it is selected
      to direct expression of the selected transgene in a particular
      ocular cell type, such as photoreceptor cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] A preferred constitutive promoters include the exemplified
      hybrid cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early enhancer/chicken
      ß-actin promoter-exon 1-intron 1 element (together abbreviated as
      “CAG”; SEQ ID NO:26, herein) used along with woodchuck hepatitis
      virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (abbreviated herein
      as “WPRE”; SEQ ID NO:27 herein). However, for human safety, other
      posttranscriptional regulatory elements known in the art can
      readily be substituted for WPRE.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Other useful promoters include RSV LTR promoter/enhancer,
      the SV40 promoter, the CMV promoter, the dihydrofolate reductase
      (DHFR) promoter, and the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter.
      Additional useful promoters are disclosed in W. W. Hauswirth et
      al., 1998, WO98/48027 and A. M. Timmers et al., 2000, WO00/15822.
      Promoters that were found to drive RPE cell-specific gene
      expression in vivo include (1) a 528-bp promoter region (bases
      1-528 of a murine 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) gene
      (Driessen, C A et al., 1995, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.
      36:1988-96; Simon, A. et al., 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270:1107-12,
      1995; Simon, A. et al., 1996, Genomics 36:424-3) Genbank Accession
      Number X97752); (2) a 2274-bp promoter region) from a human
      cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) gene (Intres, R et
      al., 1994, J. Bio!. Chem. 269:25411-18; Kennedy, B N et al., 1998,
      J. Bio!. Chem. 273:5591-8, 1998), Genbank Accession Number
      L34219); and (3) a 1485-bp promoter region from human RPE65
      (Nicoletti, A et al., 1998, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci.
      39:637-44, Genbank Accession Number U20510). These three promoters
      in WO00/15822 promoted RPE-cell-specific expression of GFP. It is
      envisioned that minor sequence variations in the various promoters
      and promoter regions discussed herein—whether additions, deletions
      or mutations, whether naturally occurring or introduced in vitro,
      will not affect their ability to drive expression in the cellular
      targets of the coding sequences of the present invention.
      Furthermore, the use of other promoters, even if not yet
      discovered, that are characterized by abundant and/or specific
      expression in retinal cells, particularly in bipolar or ganglion
      cells, is specifically included within the scope of this
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Another useful promoter is from a mGluR6 promoter-region of
      the Grm6 gene (GenBank accession number BC041684), a gene that
      controls expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 ((Ueda Y
      et al., 1997, J Neurosc17:3014-23). The genomic sequence is shown
      in GenBank accession number—AL627215. A preferred example of this
      promoter region sequence from the above GenBank record consists of
      11023 nucleotides. The original Umeda et al., study employed a 10
      kb promoter, but the actual length of the promoter and the
      sequence that comprises control elements of Grm6 can be adjusted
      by increasing or decreasing the fragment length. It is a matter of
      routine testing to select and verify the action of the optimally
      sized fragment from the Grm6 gene that drives transgenic
      expression of a selected coding sequence, preferably ChR2 or
      HaloR, in the desired target cells, preferably in bipolar cells
      which are rich in glutamate receptors, particularly the “on” type
      bipolar cells, which are the most bipolar cells in the retina
      (Nakajima, Y., et al., 1993, J Biol Chem 268:11868-73). Use of
      such a large promoter is not compatible with the packaging
      capabilities of rAAV virions, so would require a different
      delivery vector system known in the art, or identification of a
      shorter sequence (&lt;2.5 kb) that could e packaged in a rAAV
      vector of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Another promoter is the Pcp2 (L7) promoter (Tomomura, M et
      al., 2001, Eur J. Neurosci. 14:57-63). Again, the length of the
      active promoter is preferably less that 2.5 Kb so it can be
      packaged into the rAAV viral cassette.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The neurokinin-3 (NK-3) promoter. could be used to target
      Halor R to OFF cells (Haverkamp, S et al., 2002, J Comparative
      Neurology, 455:463-76.)<br>
      <br>
      [0116] An inducible promoter is used to control the amount and
      timing of production of the transgene product in an ocular cell.
      Such promoters can be useful if the gene product has some
      undesired, e.g., toxic, effects in the cell if it accumulates
      excessively. Inducible promoters include those known in the art,
      such as the Zn-inducible sheep metallothionine (MT) promoter, the
      dexamethasone (Dex)-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)
      promoter; the T7 promoter; the ecdysone insect promoter; the
      tetracycline-repressible system; the tetracycline-inducible
      system; the RU486-inducible system; and the rapamycin-inducible
      system. Any inducible promoter the action of which is tightly
      regulated and is specific for the particular target ocular cell
      type, may be used. Other useful types of inducible promoters are
      ones regulated by a specific physiological state, e.g.,
      temperature, acute phase, a cell's replicating or differentiation
      state.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] Selection of the various vector and regulatory elements for
      use herein are conventional, well-described, and readily
      available. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra; and Ausubel et al.,
      supra. It will be readily appreciated that not all vectors and
      expression control sequences will function equally well to express
      the present transgenes Chop2 or HaloR. Clearly, the skilled
      artisan may apply routine selection among the known expression
      control sequences without departing from the scope of this
      invention and based upon general knowledge as well as the guidance
      provided herein. One skilled in the art can select one or more
      expression control sequences, operably link them to the coding
      sequence being expressed to make a minigene, insert the minigene
      or vector into an AAV vector, preferably rAAV2, and cause
      packaging of the vector into infectious particles or virions
      following one of the known packaging methods for rAAV.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Production of the rAAV<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The rAAV2 used in the present invention may be constructed
      and produced using the materials and methods described herein and
      those well-known in the art. The methods that are preferred for
      producing any construct of this invention are conventional and
      include genetic engineering, recombinant engineering, and
      synthetic techniques, such as those set forth in reference cited
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Briefly, to package an rAAV construct into an rAAV virion,
      a sequences necessary to express AAV rep and AAV cap or functional
      fragments thereof as well as helper genes essential for AAV
      production must be present in the host cells. See, for example
      U.S. Pat. Pub. 2007/0015238, which describes production of
      pseudotyped rAAV virion vectors encoding AAV Rep and Cap proteins
      of different serotypes and AdV transcription products that provide
      helper functions For example, AAV rep and cap sequences may be
      introduced into the host cell in any known manner including,
      without limitation, transfection, electroporation, liposome
      delivery, membrane fusion, biolistic deliver of DNA-coated
      pellets, viral infection and protoplast fusion. Devices
      specifically adapted for delivering DNA to specific regions within
      and around the eye for the purpose of gene therapy have been
      described (for example, U.S. Pat. Pub. 2005/0277868, incorporated
      by reference) are used within the scope of this invention. Such
      devices utilize electroporation and electromigration, providing,
      e.g., two electrodes on a flexible support that can be placed
      behind the retina. A third electrode is part of a hollow support,
      which can also be used to inject the molecule to the desired area.
      The electrodes can be positioned around the eye, including behind
      the retina or within the vitreous.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] These sequences may exist stably in the cell as an episome
      or be stably integrated into the cell's genome. They may also be
      expressed more transiently in the host cell. As an example, a
      useful nucleic acid molecule comprises, from 5' to 3', a promoter,
      an optional spacer between the promoter and the start site of the
      rep sequence, an AAV rep sequence, and an AAV cap sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The rep and cap sequences, along with their expression
      control sequences, are preferably provided in a single vector,
      though they may be provided separately in individual vectors. The
      promoter may be any suitable constitutive, inducible or native
      promoter. The delivery molecule that provides the Rep and Cap
      proteins may be in any form, preferably a plasmid which may
      contain other non-viral sequences, such as those to be employed as
      markers. This molecule typically excludes the AAV ITRs and
      packaging sequences. To avoid the occurrence of homologous
      recombination, other viral sequences, particularly adenoviral
      sequences, are avoided. This plasmid is preferably one that is
      stably expressed.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Conventional genetic engineering or recombinant DNA
      techniques described in the cited references are used. The rAAV
      may be produced using a triple transfection method with either the
      calcium phosphate (Clontech) or Effectene™ reagent (Qiagen)
      according to manufacturer's instructions. See, also, Herzog et
      al., Nat. Med. 5:56-63 (1999).<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The rAAV virions are produced by culturing host cells
      comprising a rAAV as described in Bi et al., supra, and
      WO2007/131180, which includes a rAAV construct to be packaged into
      a rAAV virion, an AAV rep sequence and an AAV cap sequence, all
      under control of regulatory sequences directing expression.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Suitable viral helper genes, such as adenovirus E2A, E40rf6
      and VA, may be added to the culture preferably on separate
      plasmids. Thereafter, the rAAV virion which directs expression of
      the transgene is isolated in the absence of contaminating helper
      virus or wildtype AAV.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] It is conventional to assess whether a particular
      expression control sequence is suitable for a given transgene, and
      choose the one most appropriate for expressing the transgene. For
      example, a target cell may be infected in vitro, and the number of
      copies of the transgene in the cell monitored by Southern blots or
      quantitative PCR. The level of RNA expression may be monitored by
      Northern blots quantitative RT-PCR. The level of protein
      expression may be monitored by Western blot, immunohistochemistry,
      immunoassay including enzyme immunoassay (EIA) such as
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays
      (RIA) or by other methods. Specific embodiments are described
      below.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The vectors that comprises the ChR2 or HaloR transgene and
      the targeting motifs disclosed herein for use to target retinal
      neurons as described above should be assessed for contamination
      using conventional methods and formulated into a sterile or
      aseptic pharmaceutical composition for administration by, for
      example, subretinal injection.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Such formulations comprise a pharmaceutically and/or
      physiologically acceptable vehicle, diluent, carrier or excipient,
      such as buffered saline or other buffers, e.g., HEPES, to maintain
      physiologic pH. For a discussion of such components and their
      formulation, see, generally, Gennaro, A E., Remington: The Science
      and Practice of Pharmacy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins
      Publishers; 2003 or latest edition). See also, WO00/15822. For
      prolonged storage, the preparation may be frozen, for example, in
      glycerol.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The pharmaceutical composition described above is
      administered to a subject having a visual or blinding disease by
      any appropriate route, preferably by intravitreal or subretinal
      injection, depending on the retinal layer being targeted.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Disclosures from Bennett and colleagues (cited herein)
      concern targeting of retinal pigment epithelium—the most distal
      layer from the vitreal space. According to the present invention,
      the DNA construct is targeted to either retinal ganglion cells or
      bipolar cells. The ganglion cells are reasonably well-accessible
      to intravitreal injection. Intravitreal and/or subretinal
      injection can provide the necessary access to the bipolar cells,
      especially in circumstances in which the photoreceptor cell layer
      is absent due to degeneration—which is the case in certain forms
      of degeneration that the present invention is intended to
      overcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] To test for the vector's ability to express the transgene,
      specifically in mammalian retinal neurons, preferably RGC, by
      AAV-mediated delivery, a combination of a preferred promoter
      sequence linked to a reporter gene such as GFP or LacZ can be
      packaged into rAAV virus particles, concentrated, tested for
      contaminating adenovirus and titered for rAAV. The right eyes of a
      number of test subjects, preferably inbred mice, are injected
      sub-retinally with about 1 µl of the rAAV preparation (e.g.,
      greater than about 10&lt;10 &gt;infectious units ml). Two weeks
      later, the right (test) and left (control) eyes of half the
      animals are removed, fixed and stained with an appropriate
      substrate or antibody or other substance to reveal the presence of
      the reporter gene. A majority of the test retinas in injected eyes
      will exhibited a focal stained region, e.g., blue for LacZ/Xgal,
      or green for GFP consistent with a subretinal bleb of the injected
      virus creating a localized retinal detachment. All control eyes
      are negative for the reporter gene product. Reporter gene
      expression examined in mice sacrificed at later periods is
      detected for at least 10 weeks post-injection, which suggests
      persistent expression of the reporter transgene.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] An effective amount of rAAV virions carrying a nucleic acid
      sequence according to this invention encoding the ChR2 or HaloR
      and targeting motif under the control of the promoter of choice,
      preferably CAG or a cell-specific promoter such as mGluR6, is
      preferably in the range of between about 10&lt;10 &gt;to about
      10&lt;13 &gt;rAAV infectious units in a volume of between about
      150 and about 800 µl per injection. The rAAV infectious units can
      be measured according to McLaughlin, S K et al., 1988, J Virol
      62:1963. More preferably, the effective amount is between about
      10&lt;10 &gt;and about 10&lt;12 &gt;rAAV infectious units and the
      injection volume is preferably between about 250 and about 500 µl.
      Other dosages and volumes, preferably within these ranges but
      possibly outside them, may be selected by the treating
      professional, taking into account the physical state of the
      subject (preferably a human), who is being treated, including,
      age, weight, general health, and the nature and severity of the
      particular ocular disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] It may also be desirable to administer additional doses
      (“boosters”) of the present nucleic acid or rAAV compositions. For
      example, depending upon the duration of the transgene expression
      within the ocular target cell, a second treatment may be
      administered after 6 months or yearly, and may be similarly
      repeated. Neutralizing antibodies to AAV are not expected to be
      generated in view of the routes and doses used, thereby permitting
      repeat treatment rounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The need for such additional doses can be monitored by the
      treating professional using, for example, well-known
      electrophysiological and other retinal and visual function tests
      and visual behavior tests. The treating professional will be able
      to select the appropriate tests applying routine skill in the art.
      It may be desirable to inject larger volumes of the composition in
      either single or multiple doses to further improve the relevant
      outcome parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Ocular Disorders<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The ocular disorders for which the present methods are
      intended and may be used to improve one or more parameters of
      vision include, but are not limited to, developmental
      abnormalities that affect both anterior and posterior segments of
      the eye. Anterior segment disorders include glaucoma, cataracts,
      corneal dystrophy, keratoconus. Posterior segment disorders
      include blinding disorders caused by photoreceptor malfunction
      and/or death caused by retinal dystrophies and degenerations.
      Retinal disorders include congenital stationary night blindness,
      age-related macular degeneration, congenital cone dystrophies, and
      a large group of retinitis-pigmentosa (RP)-related disorders.
      These disorders include genetically pre-disposed death of
      photoreceptor cells, rods and cones in the retina, occurring at
      various ages. Among those are severe retinopathies, such as
      subtypes of RP itself that progresses with age and causes
      blindness in childhood and early adulthood and RP-associated
      diseases, such as genetic subtypes of LCA, which frequently
      results in loss of vision during childhood, as early as the first
      year of life. The latter disorders are generally characterized by
      severe reduction, and often complete loss of photoreceptor cells,
      rods and cones. (Trabulsi, E I, ed., Genetic Diseases of the Eye,
      Oxford University Press, NY, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      [0146] In particular, this method is useful for the treatment
      and/or restoration of at least partial vision to subjects that
      have lost vision due to ocular disorders, such as RPE-associated
      retinopathies, which are characterized by a long-term preservation
      of ocular tissue structure despite loss of function and by the
      association between function loss and the defect or absence of a
      normal gene in the ocular cells of the subject. A variety of such
      ocular disorders are known, such as childhood onset blinding
      diseases, retinitis pigmentosa, macular degeneration, and diabetic
      retinopathy, as well as ocular blinding diseases known in the art.
      It is anticipated that these other disorders, as well as blinding
      disorders of presently unknown causation which later are
      characterized by the same description as above, may also be
      successfully treated by this method. Thus, the particular ocular
      disorder treated by this method may include the above-mentioned
      disorders and a number of diseases which have yet to be so
      characterized.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] Visual information is processed through the retina through
      two pathways: an ON pathway which signals the light ON, and an OFF
      pathway which signals the light OFF (Wassle, supra). It is
      generally believed that the existence of the ON and OFF pathway is
      important for the enhancement of contrast sensitivity. The visual
      signal in the ON pathway is relay from ON-cone bipolar cells to ON
      ganglion cells. Both ON-cone bipolar cells and ON-ganglion cells
      are depolarized in response to light. On the other hand, the
      visual signal in the OFF pathway is carried from OFF-cone bipolar
      cells to OFF ganglion cells. Both OFF-cone bipolar cells and
      OFF-ganglion cells are hypopolarized in response to light. Rod
      bipolar cells, which are responsible for the ability to see in dim
      light (scotopic vision), are ON bipolar cells (depolarized in
      response to light). Rod bipolar cells relay the vision signal
      through All amacrine cells (an ON type retinal cell) to ON an OFF
      cone bipolar cell.<br>

      [0000] Electrical/Visual activity Recording and Measurement<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Patch-Clamp Recordings<br>
      <br>
      [0149] Dissociated retinal cells and retinal slice are prepared,
      e.g., as described by Pan, Z.-H. J. Neurophysiol. 83 513-527
      (2000); J. Cui, Y P et al., J. Physiol. 553:895-909 (2003)).
      Recordings with patch electrodes in the whole-cell configuration
      can be made by an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software (Heka
      Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany) Recordings are preferably made in
      Hanks' solution containing (in mM): NaCl, 138; NaHCO3, 1; Na2HPO4,
      0.3; KCl, 5; KH2PO4, 0.3; CaCl2, 1.25; MgSO4, 0.5; MgCl2, 0.5;
      HEPES-NaOH, 5; glucose, 22.2; with phenol red, 0.001% v/v;
      adjusted to pH 7.2 with 0.3 N NaOH. The electrode solution
      contains (in mM): K-gluconate, 133; KCl, 7; MgCl2, 4; EGTA, 0.1;
      HEPES, 10; Na-GTP, 0.5; and Na-ATP, 2; pH adjusted with KOH to
      7.4. The resistance of the electrode is about 13 to 15 MO. The
      recordings are performed at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] Multielectrode Array Recordings<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The multielectrode array recordings were are on the
      procedures reported by Tian, N. et al., Neuron 39:85-96 (2003).
      Briefly, retinas are dissected and placed photoreceptor side down
      on a nitrocellulose filter paper strip. The mounted retina is
      placed in the MEA-60 multielectrode array recording chamber of 30
      µm diameter electrodes spaced 200 µm apart (Multi Channel System
      MCS GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), with the ganglion cell layer
      facing the recording electrodes. The retina is continuously
      perfused in oxygenated extracellular solution at 34° C. The
      extracellular solution preferably contains (in mM): NaCl, 124;
      KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 2; NaH2PO4, 1.25; NaHCO3, 26; and
      glucose, 22 (pH 7.35 with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Recordings are
      usually started 60 min after the retina is positioned in the
      recording chamber. The interval between onsets of each light
      stimulus is generally 10-15 s. The signals are filtered between
      200 Hz (low cut off) and 20 kHz (high cut off). The responses from
      individual neurons are analyzed using, e.g., Offline Sorter
      software (Plexon, Inc., Dallas, Tex.).<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Visual-Evoked Potential Recordings<br>
      <br>
      [0153] Visual-evoked potential recordings are carried out, for
      example, in wild-type mice of the C57BL/6 and 129/Sv strains aged
      4-6 months and in rdl/rdl mice aged 6-11 months. Recordings are
      performed 2-6 months after viral vector injection. After general
      anesthesia, animals are mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus. Body
      temperature may be unregulated or maintained at 34° C. with a
      heating pad and a rectal probe. Pupils are dilated with 1%
      atropine and 2.5% accu-phenylephrine. A small portion of the skull
      ( ~1.5×1.5 mm) centered about 2.5 mm from the midline and 1 mm
      rostral to the lambdoid suture is drilled and removed. Recordings
      are made from visual cortex (area V1) by a glass micropipette
      (resistance ~0.5 M after filling with 4 M NaCl) advanced 0.4 mm
      beneath the surface of the cortex at the contralateral side of the
      stimulated eye. The stimuli are 20 ms pluses at 0.5 Hz. Responses
      are amplified (1,000 to 10,000), band-pass filtered (0.3-100 Hz),
      digitized (1 kHz), and averaged over 30-250 trials.<br>
      <br>
      Light Stimulation<br>
      <br>
      [0154] For dissociated cell and retinal slice recordings, light
      stimuli are generated by a 150 W xenon lamp-based scanning
      monochromator with bandwidth of 10 nm (TILL Photonics, Germany)
      and coupled to the microscope with an optical fiber. For
      multielectrode array recordings, light responses are evoked by the
      monochromator or a 175 W xenon lamp-based illuminator (Lambda L S,
      Sutter Instrument) with a band-pass filter of 400-580 nm and
      projected to the bottom of the recording chamber through a liquid
      light guider. For visual evoked potential, light stimuli are
      generated by the monochromator and projected to the eyes through
      the optical fiber. The light intensity is attenuated by neutral
      density filters. The light energy is measured by a thin-type
      sensor (TQ82017) and an optical power meter (e.g., Model: TQ8210,
      Advantest, Tokyo, Japan).<br>
      <br>
      Restoration or Improvement of Light Sensitivity and Vision<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Both in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the various
      parameters of the present invention may be used, along with any
      recognized animal model of a blinding human ocular disorder. Large
      animal models of human retinopathy, e.g., childhood blindness, are
      useful. The examples provided herein allow one of skill in the art
      to readily appreciate that this method may be used similarly to
      treat a range of retinal diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] While earlier studies by others have demonstrated that
      retinal degeneration can be retarded by gene therapy techniques,
      the present invention demonstrates a definite physiological
      recovery of function, which is expected to generate or improve
      various parameters of vision, including behavioral parameters.
      Behavioral measures can be obtained using known animal models and
      tests, for example performance in a water maze, wherein a subject
      in whom vision has been preserved or restored to varying extents
      will swim toward light (Hayes, J M et al., 1993, Behav Genet
      23:395-403).<br>
      <br>
      [0157] In models in which blindness is induced during adult life
      or in congenital blindness that develops slowly enough for the
      individual to experience vision before its loss, training in
      various tests may be done. When these tests are re-administered
      after visual loss to test the efficacy of the present compositions
      and methods for their vision-restorative effects, animals do not
      have to learn the tasks de novo while in a blind state. Other
      behavioral tests do not require learning and rely on
      instinctiveness of certain behaviors. An example is the
      optokinetic nystagmus test (Balkema G W et al., 1984, Invest
      Ophthal V is Sci. 25:795-800; Mitchiner J C et al., 1976, Vision
      Res. 16:1169-71).<br>
      <br>
      [0158] As is exemplified herein, the transfection of retinal
      neurons with DNA encoding Chop2 provides residual retinal neurons,
      principally bipolar cells and ganglion cells, with photosensitive
      membrane channels. Thus, it was possible to measure, with a strong
      light stimulus, the transmission of a visual stimulus to the
      animal's visual cortex, the area of the brain responsible for
      processing visual signals; this therefore constitutes a form of
      vision, as intended herein. Such vision may differ from forms of
      normal human vision and may be referred to as a sensation of
      light, also termed “light detection” or “light perception.”<br>
      <br>
      [0159] Thus, the term “vision” as used herein is defined as the
      ability of an organism to usefully detect light as a stimulus for
      differentiation or action. Vision is intended to encompass:<br>
      <br>
      1. Light detection or perception—the ability to discern whether or
      not light is present<br>
      2. Light projection—the ability to discern the direction from
      which a light stimulus is coming;<br>
      3. Resolution—the ability to detect differing brightness levels
      (i.e., contrast) in a grating or letter target;<br>
      4. Recognition—the ability to recognize the shape of a visual
      target by reference to the differing contrast levels within the
      target.<br>
      Thus, “vision” includes the ability to simply detect the presence
      of light. This opens the possibility to train an affected subject
      who has been treated according to this invention to detect light,
      enabling the individual to respond remotely to his environment
      however crude that interaction might be. In one example, a signal
      array is produced to which a low vision person can respond to that
      would enhance the person's ability to communicate by electronic
      means remotely or to perform everyday tasks. In addition such a
      person's mobility would be dramatically enhanced if trained to use
      such a renewed sense of light resulting from “light detection.”
      The complete absence of light perception leaves a person with no
      means (aside from hearing and smell) to discern anything about
      objects remote to himself.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The methods of the present invention that result in light
      perception, even without full normal vision, also improve or
      support normally regulated circadian rhythms which control many
      physiological processes including sleep-wake cycles and associated
      hormones. Although some blind individuals with residual RGCs can
      mediate their rhythms using RGC melanopsin, it is rare for them to
      do so. Thus, most blind persons have free-running circadian
      rhythms. Even when they do utilize the melanopsin pathway, the
      effect is very weak. The methods of the present invention are thus
      expected to improve health status of blind individuals by enabling
      absent light entrainment or improving weakened
      (melanopsin-mediated) light entrainment of circadian rhythms which
      leads to better overall health and well-being.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] In addition to rhythms, the present invention provides a
      basis to improve deficits in other light-induced physiological
      phenomena. Photoreceptor degeneration may result in varying
      degrees of negative masking, or suppression, of locomotor activity
      during the intervals in the circadian cycle in which the
      individual should be sleeping. Suppression of pineal melatonin may
      occur. Both contribute to the entrainment process. Thus,
      improvement in these responses/activities in a subject in whom
      photoreceptors are or have degenerated contributes, independently
      of vision per se, to appropriate sleep/wake cycles that correspond
      with the subject's environment in the real world.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] Yet another benefit of the present invention is
      normalization of pupillary light reflexes because regulation of
      pupil size helps modulate the effectivenees of light stimuli in a
      natural feed back loop. Thus, the present invention promotes
      re-establishment of this natural feedback loop, making vision more
      effective in subject treated as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] In certain embodiments, the present methods include the
      measurement of vision before, and preferably after, administering
      the present vector. Vision is measured using any of a number of
      methods well-known in the art or ones not yet established. Most
      preferred are:<br>
      (1) A light detection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus—in which evidence is sought for a reliable response
      of an indication or movement in the general direction of the light
      by the subject individual when the light it is turned on is.<br>
      (2) a light projection response by the subject after exposure to a
      light stimulus in which evidence is sought for a reliable response
      of indication or movement in the specific direction of the light
      by the individual when the light is turned on.<br>
      (3) light resolution by the subject of a light vs. dark patterned
      visual stimulus, which measures the subject's capability of
      resolving light vs dark patterned visual stimuli as evidenced by:<br>
      (a) the presence of demonstrable reliable optokinetically produced
      nystagmoid eye movements and/or related head or body movements
      that demonstrate tracking of the target (see above) and/or<br>
      (b). the presence of a reliable ability to discriminate a pattern
      visual stimulus and to indicate such discrimination by verbal or
      non-verbal means, including, for example pointing, or pressing a
      bar or a button; or<br>
      (4) electrical recording of a visual cortex response to a light
      flash stimulus or a pattern visual stimulus, which is an endpoint
      of electrical transmission from a restored retina to the visual
      cortex. Measurement may be by electrical recording on the scalp
      surface at the region of the visual cortex, on the cortical
      surface, and/or recording within cells of the visual cortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] It is known in the art that it is often difficult to make
      children who have only light perception appreciate that they have
      this vision. Training is required to get such children to react to
      their visual sensations. Such a situation is mimicked in the
      animal studies exemplified below. Promoting or enhancing light
      perception, which the compositions and methods of the present
      invention will accomplish, is valuable because patients with light
      perception not only are trainable to see light, but they can
      usually be trained to detect the visual direction of the light,
      thus enabling them to be trained in mobility in their environment.
      In addition, even basic light perception can be used by visually
      impaired individuals, including those whose vision is improved
      using the present compositions and methods, along with specially
      engineered electronic and mechanical devices to enable these
      individuals to accomplish specific daily tasks. Beyond this and
      depending on their condition, they may even be able to be trained
      in resolution tasks such as character recognition and even reading
      if their impairment permits. Thus it is expected that the present
      invention enhances the vision of impaired subjects to such a level
      that by applying additional training methods, these individuals
      will achieve the above objectives.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Low sensitivity vision may emulate the condition of a
      person with a night blinding disorder, an example of which is
      Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), who has difficulty adapting to light
      levels in his environment and who might use light amplification
      devices such as supplemental lighting and/or night vision devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] Thus, the visual recovery that has been described in the
      animal studies described below would, in human terms, place the
      person on the low end of vision function. Nevertheless, placement
      at such a level would be a significant benefit because these
      individuals could be trained in mobility and potentially in low
      order resolution tasks which would provide them with a greatly
      improved level of visual independence compared to total blindness.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] The mice studied in the present Examples were rendered
      completely devoid of photoreceptors; this is quite rare, even in
      the worst human diseases. The most similar human state is RP. In
      most cases of RP, central vision is retained till the very end. In
      contrast, in the studied mouse model, the mouse becomes completely
      blind shortly after birth.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Common disorders encountered in low vision are described by
      J. Tasca and E. A. Deglin in Chap. 6 of Essentials of Low Vision
      Practice, R. L. Brilliant, ed., Butterworth Heinemann Publ., 1999,
      which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. There is
      reference to similar degenerative conditions, but these references
      show form vision that is measurable as visual acuity. Ganglion
      cell layers are not retained in all forms of RP, so the present
      approach will not work for such a disorder.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] When applying the present methods to humans with severe
      cases of RP, it is expected that central vision would be
      maintained for a time at some low level while the peripheral
      retina degenerated first. It is this degenerating retina that is
      the target for re-activation using the present invention. In
      essence, these individuals would be able to retain mobility vision
      as they approached blindness gradually.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] Subjects with macular degeneration, characterized by
      photoreceptor loss within the central “sweet spot” of vision
      (Macula Lutea), are expected to benefit by treatment in accordance
      with the present invention, in which case the resolution
      capability of the recovered vision would be expected to be higher
      due to the much higher neuronal density within the human macula.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] While it is expected that bright illumination of daylight
      and artificial lighting that may be used by a visually impaired
      individual will suffice for many visual activities that are
      performed with vision that has recovered as a result of the
      present treatments. It is also possible that light amplification
      devices may be used, as needed, to further enhance the affected
      person's visual sensitivity. The human vision system can operate
      over a 10 log unit range of luminance. On the other hand,
      microbial type rhodopsins, such as ChR2, operate over up to a 3
      log unit range of luminance. In addition, the light conditions the
      patient encounters could fall outside of the operating range of
      the light sensor. To compensate for the various light conditions,
      a light pre-amplification or attenuation device could be used to
      expand the operation range of the light conditions. Such device
      would contain a camera, imaging processing system, and
      microdisplays, which can ne assembled from currently available
      technologies, such as night vision goggles and/or 3D adventure and
      entertainment system. (See, for example the following URL on the
      Worldwide web—emagin.com/.)<br>
      <br>
      [0182] The present invention may be used in combination with other
      forms of vision therapy known in the art. Chief among these is the
      use of visual prostheses, which include retinal implants, cortical
      implants, lateral geniculate nucleus implants, or optic nerve
      implants. Thus, in addition to genetic modification of surviving
      retinal neurons using the present methods, the subject being
      treated may be provided with a visual prosthesis before, at the
      same time as, or after the molecular method is employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The effectiveness of visual prosthetics can be improved
      with training of the individual, thus enhancing the potential
      impact of the ChR2 or HaloR transformation of patient cells as
      discussed herein. An example of an approach to training is found
      in US 2004/0236389 (Fink et al.), incorporated by reference. The
      training method may include providing a non-visual reference
      stimulus to a patient having a visual prosthesis based on a
      reference image. The non-visual reference stimulus is intended to
      provide the patient with an expectation of the visual image that
      the prosthesis will induce. Examples of non-visual reference
      stimuli are a pinboard, Braille text, or a verbal communication.
      The visual prosthesis stimulates the patient's nerve cells,
      including those cells whose responsiveness has been improved by
      expressing ChR2 and/or HaloR as disclosed herein, with a series of
      stimulus patterns attempting to induce a visual perception that
      matches the patient's expected perception derived from the
      non-visual reference stimulus. The patient provides feedback to
      indicate which of the series of stimulus patterns induces a
      perception that most closely resembles the expected perception.
      The patient feedback is used as a “fitness function” (also
      referred to as a cost function or an energy function). Subsequent
      stimuli provided to the patient through the visual prosthesis are
      based, at least in part, on the previous feedback of the patient
      as to which stimulus pattern(s) induce the perception that best
      matches the expected perception. The subsequent stimulus patterns
      may also be based, at least in part, on a fitness function
      optimization algorithm, such as a simulated annealing algorithm or
      a genetic algorithm.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] Thus, in certain embodiments of this invention, the method
      of improving or restoring vision in a subject further comprises
      training of that subject, as discussed above. Preferred examples
      of training methods are:<br>
      <br>
      (a) habituation training characterized by training the subject to
      recognize (i) varying levels of light and/or pattern stimulation,
      and/or (ii) environmental stimulation from a common light source
      or object as would be understood by one skilled in the art; and<br>
      (b) orientation and mobility training characterized by training
      the subject to detect visually local objects and move among said
      objects more effectively than without the training.<br>
      In fact, any visual stimulation techniques that are typically used
      in the field of low vision rehabilitation are applicable here.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] The remodeling of inner retinal neurons triggered by
      photoreceptor degeneration has raised a concerns about
      retinal-based rescue strategies after the death of photoreceptors
      (Strettoi and Pignatelli 2000, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 97:11020-5;
      Jones, B W et al., 2003, J Comp Neurol 464:1-16; Jones, B W and
      Marc, R E, 2005, Exp Eye Res. 81:123-37; Jones, B W et al., 2005,
      Clin Exp Optom. 88:282-91). Retinal remodeling is believed to
      result from deafferentation, the loss of afferent inputs from
      photoreceptors—in other words, the loss of light induced
      activities So after death of rods and coned, there is no light
      evoked input to retinal bipolar cells and ganglion cells, and
      through them to higher visual centers. In response to the loss of
      such input, the retina and higher visual network are triggered to
      undergo remodeling, in a way seeking other forms of inputs. Said
      otherwise, the retina needs to be used to sense light in order to
      maintain its normal network, and with the loss of light sensing,
      the network will deteriorate via a remodeling process. This
      process is not an immediate consequence of photoreceptor death;
      rather it is a slow process, providing a reasonably long window
      for intervention.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Thus, an additional utility of restoring light sensitivity
      to inner retinal neurons in accordance with the present invention
      is the prevention or delay in the remodeling processes in the
      retina, and, possibly, in the higher centers. Such retinal
      remodeling may have undesired consequences such as corruption of
      inner retinal network, primarily the connection between bipolar
      and RGCs. By introducing the light-evoked activities in bipolar
      cells or RGCs, the present methods would prevent or diminish the
      remodeling due to the lack of input; the present methods introduce
      this missing input (either starting from bipolar cells or ganglion
      cells), and thereby stabilize the retinal and higher visual center
      network. Thus, independently of its direct effects on vision, the
      present invention would benefit other therapeutic approaches such
      as photoreceptor transplantation or device implants.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Having now generally described the invention, the same will
      be more readily understood through reference to the following
      examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not
      intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless
      specified.<br>

      Viral Vectors:<br>
      <br>
      [0190] Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) cassette carrying
      a channelopsin-2 and GFP (Chop2-GFP) fusion construct (Bi, A. et
      al. Neuron 50:23-33 (2006); WO2007/131180. were modified by
      inserting subcellular sorting motifs at the 3' end of GFP (or, if
      no reporter is present, at the 3' end of ChR2 or HaloR. As
      described above. viral vectors carrying the transgene of
      ChR2-GFP-(motif) with a hybrid CMV early enhancer/chicken ß-actin)
      promoter (CAG) were packaged and affinity purified at the Gene
      Transfer Vector Core of the University of Iowa. Design of the
      vectors was is described above.<br>
      <br>
      Animal and Viral Vector Injection:<br>
      <br>
      [0191] 3-4 adult C57BL/6J mice aged 1-2 months per construct were
      used for the study. The mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
      injection of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg). Under a
      dissecting microscope, a small perforation was made with a needle
      in the sclera region posterior to the limbus, and 1.0 µl of viral
      vector suspension at a concentration of &gt;1×10&lt;12 &gt;gv/ml
      was injected into the intravitreal space of each eye. Four weeks
      after viral vector injection, animals were sacrificed by CO2
      asphyxiation followed by decapitation and enucleation.<br>
      <br>
      Histology:<br>
      <br>
      [0192] Enucleated eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
      phosphate buffer (PB) for 20 minutes and the dissected retina flat
      mounted onto a microscope slide for histological studies. The flat
      mounts were examined under a Zeiss Apotome microscope and Zstack
      images were taken at ~562 ms exposure time at optical sections of
      1 µm apart in order to capture the axon, soma, and entire depth of
      the dendritic tree of each RGC.<br>
      <br>
      Image Analysis and Fluorescence Intensity Ratio Calculations:<br>
      <br>
      [0193] Intensity profiles of axon, soma, and dendrites for each
      RGC were measured in ImageJ (obtained from NIH) by applying lines
      of width of 5 pixels. For each RGC, axon intensity profile was
      obtained by averaging 3 measurements, somatic intensity profile
      was obtained by averaging 3 measurements, and dendritic intensity
      profile was obtained by averaging 9 measurements (3 proximal, 3
      intermediate, and 3 distal). Dendrite/axon (D/A) and soma/axon
      (S/A) intensity ratios were then calculated from the average
      values for each RGC.<br>
      <br>
      Statistical Analysis of Fluorescence Intensity Ratios:<br>
      <br>
      [0194] A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with
      Bonferroni correction. P&lt;0.05 is considered significantly
      different for somatic fluorescence intensity (Soma F.I.)
      measurements, dendrite to axon (D/A) ratios and soma to axon (S/A)
      ratios between groups.<br>

      [0196] Use of the Kv2.1 motif and targeted ChR2, and would
      similarly target HaloR, to soma and proximal dendritic regions
      (the center of receptive field) of RGCs. Use of Nav1.6 motif
      targets to soma and axon initial segments (the center of the
      receptive field). Kv2.1 appears to achieve such targeting more
      effectively than does Nav1.6.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Use of NLG and MLPH sorting motifs targeted ChR2 (and would
      target HaloR) to distal dendritic regions (the surround of the
      receptive field) because, compared to control, they are more
      biased to distal dendritic regions. NLG appears to do this better.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] Use of Kv2.1, Nav1.6, NLG and MLPH reduces expression of
      the ChR2 or HaloR in the axons of retinal ganglion cells. Although
      not shown directly in FIG. 1 or Table 2, The ankyrin binding
      domain of Nav1.6 preferentially targeted Chop2-GFP to the axon
      initial segments as well as decreased expression in the dendrites
      of RGCs with D/A ratio 4.5 fold less than control. However the
      overall fluorescence intensity was lower for Nav1.6 compared to
      the control which contributed to the lack of significant
      difference in the S/A ratio compared to control. A previous
      (preliminary) study reported use of Anbthe ankyrin binding domain
      to target Chop2 to the somata of rabbit retinal ganglion cells via
      biolistic gene transfer (Greenberg, K. P. et al. Invest. Ophthal.
      V is Sci 2009 (abstract) 2009)<br>
      <br>
      [0199] Motifs from nAchR, KV4.2, TLCN, and AMPAR did not show
      statistically significant differences from the control group in
      somatic fluorescence, D/A ratio, and S/A ratio in this study.
      However, it is believed that with varying conditions, further
      modified vectors, etc., these too are useful as sorting motifs for
      targeting of, and spatially selective expression of tranduced ChR2
      or HaloR in RGC.<br>

      Physiological Responses of Cells Expressing ChR2 and<br>
      <br>
      [0200] Studies were conducted (data not shown) in which the RGCs
      transduced by vectors comprising ChR2 and the Kv2.1 motif
      (center-targeting) which indeed showed enhanced expression in the
      center (Soma, proximal dendritic, were tested for electrical
      responses to light stimuli. A light slit was used to move a light
      along the cell, and recordings were made where the cell responded
      by depolarization. The responsiveness of such cells were enhanced
      compared to those of controls (transduced with vector not
      containing the sorting motif) indicating a close correlation
      between the histological evidence for site-specific expression of
      a transgene (GFP) and spatial organization of a transgene
      similarly introduced (ChR2). These results confirm the utility of
      this approach to evoking improved light responsiveness with
      organization reflective of normal retinal function (spatial
      specificity) in cells treated using the present methods.<br>
