      <p>Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA </p>
      <p>Aerodynamic drag can be reduced by may small longitudinal
        grooves machined in the aircraft skin. Experiments show that
        grooves parallel to the airflow reduce drag by 4 to 7 percent.
        The reduced drag translates into reduced engine power required
        to overcome the drag and ultimately to lower fuel consumption. </p>
      <p>The grooves confine incipient bursts of turbulence so that they
        cannot expand and disrupt the boundary layer surrounding a
        moving craft. Most are V-shaped, but they may take a variety of
        dimensions (see figure). For example, they may have rounded or
        sharp peaks and symmetrical or asymmetrical cross sections.
        Asymmetrical grooves of various cross-sectional geometries may
        be arranged in some regular sequences to optimize the
        aerodynamic performance. </p>
      <p>The most effective dimensions for reducing drag are indicated
        in the figure. The dimensions for reducing drag are indicated in
        the figure. The dimsnetions are small in comparison with those
        tested in previous experiments. In terms of law-of-the-wall
        (turbulent flow) coordinates, the heights are less than 30 and
        the spacings are less than 40. </p>

        Abstract --- The invention is a system of flow control devices
        which result in reduced skin friction on aerodynamic and
        hydrodynamic surfaces. The devices cause a breakup of
        large-scale disturbances in the boundary layer of the flow
        field. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the riblet device 10 acts to
        reduce disturbances near the boundary layer wall by the use of
        longitudinal striations forming vee-shaped grooves. These
        grooves are dimensional on the order of the wall vortices and
        turbulent burst dimensions 31 depicted in FIG. 3. The large-eddy
        breakup device 41, depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, is a small strip
        or airfoil which is suspended in the upper region of the
        boundary layer. Various physical mechanisms cause a disruption
        of the large-scale vortices. The combination of the devices of
        this invention result in a substantial reduction in skin
        friction drag. </p>

              Not?</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>There is no doubt that the bird is a better machine than any
        that man has made for the purpose of flying, at least so far.
        The moment a bird lands its wings are contracted, thereby
        enabling the bird to settle quietly on land or sea. It would be
        impossible for the bird to shoot straight down and alight on the
        chosen spot, were it compelled to do so with its wings fully
        extended. Yet it is for that very reason that our powerful
        flying amchines so often meet with accidents when landing. In
        addition to this, the present ever-rigid wing causes great
        inconvenience in connection with the housing with the housing
        problem and makes transportation very difficult. </p>
      <p>If a gull should attempt to remain floating with wings
        stretched out on the sea, it would soon lose its balance and
        share the fate of the hydroplanes which in the recent attempt to
        cross the ocean had their wings badly battered when compelled to
        descend and alight on the rough sea. </p>
      <p>We know that wings swinging back on hinges will reduce the
        original span of the plane to some extent, and partially solve
        this problem. It has remained for someone to design a practical
        and properly constructed practical wing for present-day types of
        airplanes. </p>
      <p>A New York inventor, John&nbsp; Arthur Weis, has recently come
        forward with an ingenious contractable airplane wing, for which
        he claims ample strength, reliability and convenience. In fact,
        a British manufacturer has begun construction on a machine with
        this type of contractable wing. In order to produce a wing that
        may be folded automatically and almost instantaneously, this
        inventor has replaced the usual rigid spars with a collapsible
        construction, similar to the well-known lazy tong telephone
        holer but provided with suitable stop locks. In extending the
        wing fully the links of the lazy tong construction lie parallel
        to each other and are prevented from moving in the opposite
        direction by the aforementioned stop locks. At this point the
        lazy tong action ceases, and the construction becomes rigid.
        Since there are no folds or pockets in the airfoil or wing
        surfaces, each section of the wing can be covered independently
        with fabric or sheet aluminum. Provisions are made for having
        the airfoils airtight, despite the many sectons. </p>
      <p>All important and vital members, such as distance bars, ribs,
        struts, stabilizers, and so on, remain intact and undisturbed.
        When the spars are brought into a straight line, the ailerons
        are in position to work on hinges just like those of any present
        rigid standard types, according to the inventor. The pilot can
        expand or contract the wings by means of a crank or lever in the
        cockpit. If desirable, a very simple device in the form of a
        little ratchet drum, worm-driven, in conenction with a handwheel
        and dial, enables the pilot to apply the necessary tension to
        the interplane bracings as soon as the wings are fully extended
        and locked. </p>
      <p>According to the invnetor, the span of&nbsp; 60-foot machine
        can be reduced by the contraction of the wings to about 8 feet.
        The extra weight on a two-seater 110-horsepower biplane is about
        100 pounds, consequently the loss in velocity is hardly more
        than 2 or 3 percent. When the wings are fully contracted the
        outlines of the machine resemble somewhat those of a
        grasshopper. All in all, the construction is most ingenious, but
        one must hesitate to pass on the practicality of this
        construction until it has undergone actual application to
        full-sized planes. </p>

      <p>Successful in its first test flights, a glider with an
        unconventional stabilizing device has been introduced by a
        French inventor. The stabilizer, carried on a mast above the
        wing, is used to correct any tendency to pitch forward or
        sideslip in flight. Its two hinged vanes are so wired that they
        may be folded flat or spread sideways by a control in the hands
        of the pilot, and thus stabilize the plane. </p>
