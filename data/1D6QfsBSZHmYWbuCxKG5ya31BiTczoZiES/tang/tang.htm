        Technology<br>
      </span><br>
      Saltworks Technologies is positioned to commercialize a
      breakthrough desalination technology during a time of increasing
      freshwater scarcity, rising energy prices, and mounting concerns
      over carbon impacts.<br>
      <br>
      Saltworks' patent pending technology employs an innovative
      Thermo-Ionic™ energy conversion system that uses up to 80 per cent
      less electrical/mechanical energy relative to leading desalination
      technologies. The energy reduction is achieved by harnessing low
      temperature heat and atmospheric dryness to overcome the
      desalination energy barrier. Saltwater is evaporated to produce a
      concentrated solution. This solution, which has concentration
      gradient energy, is fed into Saltworks' proprietary desalting
      device to desalinate either seawater or brackish water. Some
      electrical energy is used to circulate fluids at a low pressure,
      yet the bulk of the energy input is obtained through the
      evaporation of saltwater.<br>
      <br>
      Perfomance of this novel process improves in arid regions, which
      happen to be the very regions that require freshwater. The
      technology also requires less pre-treatment and chemicals than
      traditional processes.<br>
      <br>
      Applications for Saltworks' technology include producing drinking
      water for communities and municipalities, irrigation water for
      agriculture, and process water for industry. It is especially
      well-suited for situations with low temperature thermal energy
      (30-40 degrees Celsius) such as simple solar thermal or waste
      heat.<br>
      <br>
      The technology has been proof-tested by the National Research
      Council of Canada and BC Hydro's Powertech Labs. An outfitted
      1,000 litre a-day seawater pilot plant complete with chemical free
      pre-treatment will soon be fully operational at a harbour location
      in Vancouver, British Columbia.<br>

Trick






          to Desalinate Water</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      Currently there are two major methods for seawater desalination,
      both of them requiring a lot of energy. One uses the evaporation
      and condensation cycle, the other one is based on reverse osmosis
      filtering. Canadian company <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saltworks






        Technologies</span> says its technology <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">will consume four times less energy
        per liter of fresh water produced</span>, reports <span
        style="font-style: italic;">Technology Review</span>. Their
      approach is based on manipulating the salt ions in water to trick
      them out of the stream. The most energy-consuming part is the
      preparation of water with increased salinity. From the normal 3.5%
      of the sea water, it is boosted to at least <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">18%</span> by evaporation. The
      prototype plant company operates by using sprayers and sunlight,
      but an industrial-scale version is expected to utilize waste heat
      from some facility. Then the concentrated solution is fed into a
      processing unit, where <span style="font-weight: bold;">ordinary
        seawater circulates through polystyrene tubes. The plastic is
        chemically treated to let either positive sodium or negative
        chloride ions to pass. The lower salinity of water in the tubes
        draws in corresponding ions. Then the two enriched streams are
        connected to the third and final one, and draw salt ions out of
        it. The result is desalinated water</span>, which can be treated
      with UF for disinfection and delivered to consumers.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Energy-saving process uses free
        heat to desalinate seawater.</span><br style="font-style:
        italic;">
      <br>
      A Canadian startup has built a pilot desalination plant in
      Vancouver that uses a quarter of the energy of conventional plants
      to remove salt from seawater. The process relies on concentration
      gradients, and the natural tendency of sodium and chloride
      ions--the key components of salt--to flow from higher to lower
      salinity concentrations. If the system can be scaled up it could
      offer a cheaper way to bring drinking water to the planet's most
      parched regions while leaving behind a much lower carbon footprint
      than other desalination methods.<br>
      <br>
      "We've taken it from a benchtop prototype to a fully functional
      seawater pilot plant," says inventor Ben Sparrow, a mechanical
      engineer who established Saltworks Technologies in 2008 to
      commercialize the process. "The plant is currently running on real
      seawater, and we're in the final stage of expanding it to a
      capacity of 1,000 liters a day."<br>
      <br>
      Today most desalination plants are based on one of two approaches.
      One is distillation through an evaporation-condensation cycle, and
      the other is membrane filtration through reverse osmosis. But both
      options are energy-intensive and costly.<br>
      <br>
      Saltworks takes a completely different approach based on the
      principles of ionic exchange. The process begins with the creation
      of a reservoir of seawater that is evaporated until its salt
      concentration rises from 3.5 percent to 18 percent or higher.<br>
      <br>
      The evaporation is done in one of two ways: either the seawater is
      sprayed into a shallow pond exposed to sunlight and dry ambient
      air, or seawater is kept in a large tower that's exposed to waste
      heat from a neighboring industrial facility. The second approach
      is used in the commercial-scale plant. The concentrated water is
      then pumped at low pressure into the company's desalting unit
      along with three separated streams of regular seawater. At this
      point the most energy-intensive part of the process is already
      over.<br>
      <br>
      Inside the desalting unit, which in the pilot plant is about the
      size of a microwave oven, specially treated polystyrene bridges
      connect two of the regular seawater streams to the highly
      concentrated stream. Positive ions (largely sodium) and negative
      ions (largely chloride) are drawn by diffusion through the
      polystyrene, which has been chemically treated to manipulate
      specific ions, from the concentrated steam into the weaker ones.
      One bridge is treated to allow only positively charged ions to
      pass, while the other bridge only allows negatively charged ions
      to pass. But both allow other ions in salt water, including
      magnesium, calcium, sulfate, and bromine ions, to pass through.
      "The negatives all flow in one direction and the positives all
      flow in another direction," Sparrow says.<br>
      <br>
      The two regular streams--one now having a surplus of positive ions
      and the other having a surplus of negative ions--are also
      connected to the third saltwater stream, which is the target for
      final purification. The two out-of-balance streams want to become
      balanced again, so they essentially strip the third stream of all
      positive and negative ions. The end result is de-ionized water
      that only requires some basic chlorination or ultraviolet
      treatment before being piped into homes and businesses.<br>
      <br>
      Sparrow, who is also chief executive of Saltworks, says the
      process uses low-pressure pumps to circulate the water, meaning
      lightweight plastic pipes can be used instead of
      corrosion-resistant steel. Saltworks cofounder and president
      Joshua Zoshi says scaling up the system should be simple because
      the plastics and ion-selective chemicals used are plentiful and
      cheap. "Our next step is to engage with industry and work with
      potential customers to get the technology out into the field,"
      Zoshi says.<br>
      <br>
      Much of the research and pilot-plant funding to date has come from
      Canada's National Research Council, B.C. Hydro's Powertech Labs,
      and Sustainable Development Technology Canada, a federal agency
      that supports clean technology development through grants.<br>
      <br>
      Rick Whittaker, chief technology officer at SDTC, says the company
      has a reasonable chance of success because the science behind it
      is sound and the approach is based largely on the creative
      integration of existing technologies. "There's technical risk,"
      says Whittaker. "But we're quite confident they can scale it up."<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -- </span>A method and
      apparatus for desalinating saltwater using concentration
      difference energy is disclosed. In order to desalinate saltwater
      that is contained with in a product chamber, a drive cell is used
      to generate a drive voltage. The product chamber has a <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">desalination voltage</span> such that
      when a sufficient voltage is applied to the product chamber,
      anions and cations migrate out of the product chamber, thereby
      desalinating the water. The sufficient voltage, which includes the
      drive voltage and which is equal to or greater than the
      desalination voltage, is applied to the product chamber,
      consequently effecting desalination. Beneficially, <span

      can be generated using a concentrated solution, which can be
      generated using, for example, solar energy<br>

        INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Field of the Invention
      </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a method, apparatus and
      plant for desalinating saltwater. More particularly, the present
      invention relates to a method, apparatus and plant for
      desalinating saltwater by utilizing the energy difference that
      exists between two solutions of different solute concentrations
      that are separated by an ion exchange membrane. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Background of the
        Invention</span> <br>
      <br>
      [0005] Over one quarter of Earth's population does not have
      adequate access to freshwater. Inadequate access to freshwater is
      detrimental, as it can lead to disease and malnutrition, limit
      agricultural development, and inhibit economic growth. <br>
      <br>
      [0006] In contrast to freshwater, however, saltwater is readily
      available. Saltwater in the form of seawater constitutes about 97%
      of the water on Earth. Unless seawater is sufficiently
      desalinated, though, it is not only undrinkable, but unsuitable
      for agriculture. "Desalination" refers to the process of removing
      anions and cations from saltwater. Seawater typically has a salt
      concentration of about 3.5% by mass; that is, about 35 grams of
      dissolved salt per liter of water. In contrast, drinkable water
      typically has a salt concentration of, at most, about 0.04%. <br>
      <br>
      [0007] Several desalination methods are currently known in the
      art. One of the most popular methods at present is reverse osmosis
      ("RO"). RO involves mechanically forcing saltwater through
      spirally wound, semi-permeable membranes at high pressure. The
      membranes filter salt from the saltwater. Saltwater that is
      filtered using RO requires extensive pre-treatment, which
      increases RO's energy requirements. RO also suffers from
      performance issues when the temperature of the saltwater is over
      about 30.degree. C., which can be the case when the saltwater
      source is water from a warm ocean or powerplant outlet, for
      example. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] Additional methods of desalination are multiple effect
      distillation ("MED") or multi-stage flash ("MSF"). MED and MSF
      desalinate saltwater by repeatedly evaporating and condensing the
      saltwater over a series of multiple stages. The source of the
      energy for MED and MSF processes is usually low pressure steam.
      The primary drawback of MED and MSF processes is the large amount
      of thermal energy these processes consume, which is typically an
      order of magnitude higher than the electrical energy used by RO. <br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another method of desalination is electrodialysis ("ED").
      ED achieves desalination through a separation process whereby
      dissolved salt ions are transferred from a feed stream to a
      concentrate stream through ion exchange membranes under the
      influence of an externally applied electric potential. This ion
      transport is typically conducted using an ED stack, which is
      constructed using an alternating arrangement of ion exchange
      membranes, with feed and concentrate streams flowing between the
      membranes. One problem with ED is that it consumes more energy
      than RO for desalination of seawater, and that the source of such
      energy is entirely in the form of an externally applied electric
      potential. In addition to problems associated with energy
      consumption, electrical hardware in the form of a direct current
      power source or rectifiers to generate direct current from an
      alternating current power source is required. A second problem
      with ED is that often, as a result of the magnitude of the
      externally applied electric potential, voltage gradients cause
      salt ions to migrate not only through the ion exchange membranes
      as intended but also through the manifolding used in the ED stack.
      This results in circulating ionic current losses and reduces the
      efficiency of ED. <br>
      <br>
      [0010] Consequently, there is a need for a method and apparatus
      for desalinating saltwater that improves on the prior art. <br>

      <br>
      [0047] Additionally, the method can further include flowing
      concentrate through first and second electrolyte chambers, the
      first electrolyte chamber bounded on one side by and in ionic
      communication with a first ion exchange membrane and bounded on
      another side by and in ionic communication with a porous first end
      plate and the second electrolyte chamber bounded on a first side
      by and in ionic communication with a second ion exchange membrane
      and bounded on a second side by and in ionic communication with a
      porous second end plate, the first and second electrolyte chambers
      ionically communicative with the product chamber via the first and
      second ion exchange membranes, respectively; and submerging the
      porous first and second end plates within a conductive bath such
      that ionic current flows between the conductive bath and the
      porous first and second end plates. <br>
      <br>
      [0048] One advantage of the present invention is that by relying
      on a drive voltage generated by the difference in concentrations
      between diluent and concentrate to effect desalination, it is
      possible to use solar energy or another form of readily accessible
      low temperature energy (such as waste heat from a power plant) to
      generate the concentrated solution that is used to generate the
      drive voltage. Thus, energy that would otherwise be wasted can be
      used to generate the concentrate and to effect desalination,
      allowing for less electrically intensive desalination of saltwater
      relative to prior art methods of and means for desalination. This
      is especially beneficial as arid climates are those with abundant
      available solar energy and are also those that are likely to
      require desalination. <br>
      <br>
      [0049] A further advantage of the present invention is that as
      drive cells are used to generate the drive voltage, an external
      power supply is not required, which can reduce the capital costs
      associated with practicing the method and operating the apparatus
      and plant of the present invention. <br>
      <br>
      [0050] In contrast to ED, a further advantage of the present
      invention is that voltage gradients do not built up to the same
      extent as with an ED stack, and consequently less ion migration
      occurs through stack manifolds as can occur in an ED stack. This
      reduces circulated ionic current losses in the present invention
      relative to ED. <br>
      <br>
      [0051] In contrast to RO, a further advantage of the method of the
      present invention is that its performance is not substantially
      negatively affected when desalinating warm saltwater greater than
      about 30.degree. C. and requires less pre-treatment as water is
      not forced through a semi-permeable membrane that could foul. <br>
      <br>
      [0052] Advantages of the apparatus of the present invention
      include its ease of manufacturing, durability and robustness. <br>
      <br>
      [0053] An additional advantage of the apparatus of the present
      invention includes the ability to desalinate saltwater by
      operating the apparatus at a lower pressure than comparable RO
      systems, which lowers the cost of the components used to
      manufacture the apparatus of the present invention relative to the
      RO systems, which incorporate expensive allowed and stainless
      steels and other high pressure components. <br>

      <br>
      [0068] Two ionic solutions that differ only in the concentration
      of the solute dissolved therein have different amounts of chemical
      energy. This difference in chemical energy is hereinafter referred
      to as "concentration difference energy". For example, when equal
      volumes of solutions of saltwater and freshwater are placed in
      adjacent chambers and are separated from each other solely by a
      membrane that is water permeable, but not ion permeable, the
      concentration difference energy causes water from the freshwater
      container to flow into and develop pressure in the saltwater
      container. <br>
      <br>
      [0069] Similarly, when equal volumes of solutions of saltwater and
      freshwater are placed in adjacent chambers and are separated from
      each other solely by a membrane that is ion permeable, but not
      water permeable, the concentration difference energy results in a
      voltage difference between the two chambers. A membrane that is
      ion permeable, but not water permeable, is hereinafter referred to
      as an "ion exchange membrane". Monopolar ion exchange membranes
      include "cation exchange membranes" and "anion exchange
      membranes". Cation and anion exchange membranes are those
      membranes that allow only cations (positively charged ions) and
      anions (negatively charged ions) to pass through, respectively.
      Exemplary cation exchange membranes include Neosepta CMX, CM-1;
      Ralex CMH-PES; Fumasep FKE, FKD; and Selemion CMV membranes.
      Exemplary anion exchange membranes include Neosepta AM-1, AFN,
      AMX; Ralex AMH-PES; Fumasep FAD; and Selemion DVS, APS membranes.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0070] In order to desalinate saltwater, at least some of the
      cations (primarily Na.sup.+) and anions (primarily Cl.sup.-) in
      the saltwater need to be removed from the saltwater. Removing
      these ions requires energy. <br>
      <br>
      [0071] The embodiments described herein utilize concentration
      difference energy to aid in removal of cations and anions from
      saltwater, thereby desalinating the saltwater. <br>
      <br>
      [0072] Referring now to FIG. 1, there is depicted a schematic view
      of a dialytic stack 101 for desalinating saltwater. The dialytic
      stack 101 is composed of a series of alternating concentrate and
      diluent chambers 110 and 112, respectively. Flowing through each
      of the diluent chambers 112 is a solution of a first ionic
      concentration ("diluent") and flowing through each of the
      concentrate chambers 110 is a solution of a second ionic
      concentration ("concentrate"), with the second ionic concentration
      being greater than the first ionic concentration. Diluent may
      enter and exit the diluent chambers 112 via diluent supply and
      exit conduits 104 and 132, respectively. Concentrate may enter and
      exit the concentrate chambers 110 via concentrate supply and exit
      conduits 102 and 130, respectively. Adjacent diluent and
      concentrate chambers 112, 110 are separated from each other by one
      of the cation and anion exchange membranes 120 and 122,
      respectively. Located in the embodiment of FIG. 1 is a product
      chamber 118 through which flows the saltwater to be desalinated
      ("product feed"). Product feed that has passed through the product
      chamber 118 and has had at least some anions and cations removed
      therefrom is hereinafter referred to as "product". The product
      feed may enter the product chamber 118 via a product feed supply
      conduit 106, and the resulting product exits the product chamber
      118 via a product exit conduit 134. The product feed and the
      diluent may both be seawater having a salt concentration of about
      3.5% by mass, while the concentrate may be hyper-concentrated
      seawater having a salt concentration of about 15%-28% by mass.
      Alternatively, the diluent may be slightly concentrated saltwater
      having a salt concentration of about 3.5% to about 6% by mass. The
      salt concentration of the concentrate must be higher than the salt
      concentration of the diluent and can be as high as the solubility
      limit in water of whichever salts are present in the concentrate.
      The manner in which this hyper-concentrated seawater can be
      produced is discussed in more detail with respect to FIGS. 10-14,
      below. <br>
      <br>
      [0073] In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, each pair of chambers
      140, 142, 144, 146, 148 (each a "drive cell") is composed of one
      of the diluent chambers 112 and one of the concentrate chambers
      110, the diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110 separated from
      each other by and in ionic communication with one of the anion
      exchange membranes 122. As discussed above, the concentration
      difference energy that exists between the concentrate and diluent
      results in the drive cell generating a voltage ("drive voltage").
      In an embodiment wherein the concentrate is about 18% aqueous
      sodium chloride by mass and the diluent is about 3.5% aqueous
      sodium chloride by mass, the theoretical drive voltage for each
      drive cell is about 0.04 Volts. <br>
      <br>
      [0074] In FIG. 1, the anion exchange membrane 122 forms a shared
      boundary between and is in ionic communication with the diluent
      and concentrate chambers 112, 110 of any given drive cell, and the
      cation exchange membrane 120 forms a shared boundary between and
      is in ionic communication with any given drive cell and an
      adjacent drive cell (see, e.g. the drive cell 148 having the anion
      exchange membrane 122 between its diluent and concentrate chambers
      112, 110 and having the cation exchange membrane 120 between the
      concentrate chamber 110 of the drive cell 148 and the diluent
      chamber 112 of the adjacent drive cell 146). A cation or anion
      exchange membrane 120 or 122 that contacts the fluid contained
      within a chamber when the chamber is filled with fluid is said to
      "bound" that chamber and, consequently, also be in ionic
      communication with that chamber. <br>
      <br>
      [0075] Each of the drive cells is separated from an adjacent drive
      cell by one of the cation exchange membranes 120. As the ion
      exchange membranes 120, 122 allow ions to flow from the
      concentrate to the diluent chambers, the drive cells 140, 142,
      144, 146, 148 are in ionic communication with each other. The
      drive voltage generated by a group of drive cells in ionic
      communication with each other is equal to the sum of the voltages
      produced by each of the drive cells in the series. Consequently,
      the total drive voltage produced by the drive cells 140, 142, 144,
      146, 148 is about 0.20 Volts. <br>
      <br>
      [0076] The dialytic stack 101 also contains a desalination cell
      150, which is composed of one of the diluent chambers 112 and a
      product chamber 118. The product chamber 118 is bounded on one
      side by and is in ionic communication with one of the anion
      exchange membranes 122 ("product chamber anion exchange membrane"
      154) and is bounded on another side by and is in ionic
      communication with one of the cation exchange membranes 120
      ("product chamber cation exchange membrane" 152). The diluent
      chamber 112 that is separated from the product chamber 118 by and
      is in ionic communication with the product chamber anion exchange
      membrane 154 is hereinafter referred to as the "anion discharge
      chamber" 162. The diluent chamber 112 that is separated from the
      product chamber 118 by and is in ionic communication with the
      product chamber cation exchange membrane 152 is hereinafter
      referred to as the "cation discharge chamber" 160. The product
      chamber 118 is in ionic communication with the drive cells via the
      product chamber cation exchange membrane 152 on one side and via
      the product chamber anion exchange membrane 154 on the other.
      Flowing through the product chamber 118 is the saltwater to be
      desalinated. Typically, the salt concentration of the product feed
      as it enters the dialytic stack 101 is less than or equal to the
      concentrations of the solutions in the chambers adjacent to the
      product chamber 118. <br>
      <br>
      [0077] In order to desalinate the product feed, a certain voltage
      ("desalination voltage") has to be applied across the product
      chamber 118. In the illustrated embodiment, in order to desalinate
      the product feed to a resulting product concentration of about
      0.04% salt by mass such that anions and cations in the product
      feed are driven from the product chamber 118 into adjacent diluent
      chambers 112 containing diluent of about 3.5% salt by mass, the
      desalination voltage is about 0.088 Volts. <br>
      <br>
      [0078] When a sufficient voltage greater than the desalination
      voltage is applied across the product chamber 118, anions migrate
      towards one electrode, an anode 126, and cations migrate towards
      another electrode, a cathode 124. Anions migrate from the product
      chamber 118, through the product chamber anion exchange membrane
      154, and into the anion discharge chamber 162. Similarly, cations
      migrate from the product chamber 118, through the product chamber
      cation exchange membrane 152, and into the cation discharge
      chamber 160. In this way, saltwater can be desalinated by
      employing the drive cell to generate the drive voltage, and by
      applying the sufficient voltage, which includes the drive voltage,
      across the product chamber. As described above, flowing through
      the anion and cation discharge chambers can be a solution having
      an ionic concentration greater than or equal to that of the
      saltwater to be desalinated, such as the diluent. <br>
      <br>
      [0079] The movement of ions through the dialytic stack 101 that
      occurs when the sufficient voltage applied to the product chamber
      118 is greater than or exceeds the desalination voltage represents
      movement of ions through an ionic circuit. Various methods of
      completing this ionic circuit are possible. <br>
      <br>
      [0080] In FIG. 1, the ionic circuit is completed
      electrochemically. Electrochemical completion of the ionic circuit
      is achieved by disposing anode and cathode electrolyte chambers
      114 and 116 between the stack of diluent and concentrate chambers
      112, 110 and the anode 126 and cathode 124, respectively. A
      suitable electrolyte flows into and out of the electrolyte
      conduits via electrolyte supply conduits 108 and electrolyte exit
      conduits 136, respectively. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1,
      the electrolyte flows through the electrolyte chambers 114, 116 in
      parallel; i.e., the electrolyte that flows through one of the
      chambers 114, 116 is not used by the other chamber 114, 116.
      However, in alternative embodiments (not shown), the electrolyte
      may flow through the electrolyte chambers 114, 116 in series;
      i.e., the electrolyte may flow into one of the electrolyte
      chambers 114, 116 and, upon exiting this electrolyte chamber, be
      directed into the other of the electrolyte chambers 114, 116.
      Oxidation reactions (at the anode 126) and reduction reactions (at
      the cathode 124) convert the ionic current into electric current
      and complete the ionic circuit. The anode 126 and the cathode are
      electrically communicative 124 via an electrical conduit 156,
      thereby resulting in electrons flowing from the anode 126 to the
      cathode 124. <br>
      <br>
      [0081] Table 1, below, lists exemplary electrolytes that can be
      used in anode and cathode electrolyte chambers 114, 116, as well
      as the associated electrochemical reactions and reduction
      potentials that occur at the anode and cathode 126, 124: <br>

      [0082] Exemplary anode and cathode materials include substrate
      metals such as titanium, niobium, tantalum, iridium, palladium,
      stainless steel, steel, nickel and graphite; the substrate metals
      may be optionally coated with platinum, ruthenium, iridium, or a
      mixed metal oxide combination of any two or more of platinum,
      ruthenium, and iridium. <br>
      <br>
      [0083] Notably, the choice of which type of ion exchange membrane
      ("stack end membrane 158") is used to separate the diluent and
      concentrate chambers 112, 110 from the electrolyte chambers 114,
      116 is important. The stack end membrane 158 nearest to the anode
      126 is hereinafter referred to as the "anode stack end ion
      exchange membrane" and the stack end membrane 158 nearest to the
      cathode 124 is hereinafter referred to as the "cathode stack end
      ion exchange membrane". The anode electrolyte chamber 114 is
      bounded on one side by and is in ionic communication with the
      anode stack end ion exchange membrane, and the cathode electrolyte
      chamber 116 is also bounded on one side by and is in ionic
      communication with the cathode stack end ion exchange membrane. As
      electrochemical reactions occur at the anode 126 and the cathode
      124, the anode electrolyte chamber 114 is bounded on another side
      by and is in electrical communication with the anode 126, and
      similarly the cathode electrolyte chamber 116 is bounded on
      another side by and is in electrical communication with the
      cathode 124. In an embodiment that uses Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 as an
      electrolyte, for example, cation exchange membranes 122 are used
      as stack end membranes 158. This is because Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 is
      composed of Na.sup.+ cations and SO.sub.4.sup.2- anions. By using
      cation exchange membranes 122, only the Na.sup.+ cations can
      travel between the electrolyte chambers 114, 116 into the adjacent
      diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110. As the diluent and
      concentrate are both saltwater, none of the electrolyte, diluent,
      or concentrate becomes polluted with new types of ions. Similarly,
      if HCl were used as an electrolyte, anion exchange membranes would
      typically be used to separate the electrolyte chambers 114, 116
      and the diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110. <br>
      <br>
      [0084] In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the diluent and
      the concentrate can flow through the dialytic stack 101 in
      opposite, or countercurrent, directions. Doing so can help to
      maintain a more even concentration difference between the diluent
      and concentrate chambers 112, 110. <br>
      <br>
      [0085] Referring now to FIG. 2, there is depicted a second
      embodiment of a dialytic stack 201 that is configured to have a
      polarity opposite that of the first embodiment of the dialytic
      stack 101 depicted in FIG. 1. The dialytic stack 201 of FIG. 2 is
      similar to the dialytic stack 101 of FIG. 1, with the exceptions
      being that the product chamber 118 and anion and cation discharge
      chambers 162, 160 have been shifted one chamber to the right, the
      chamber that formerly served as the anion discharge chamber 162
      has been replaced with a concentrate chamber 110, and the
      remaining diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110 have been
      swapped. The result is a change of polarity of the drive voltage
      and, consequently, a change in direction of ion migration.
      Although FIG. 2 shows the product chamber 118 and anion and cation
      discharge chambers 162, 160 having been shifted only one chamber
      to the right relative to the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, these
      chambers could have been shifted any odd number of chambers to the
      right or left. <br>
      <br>
      [0086] Useful by-products may be created from the electrochemical
      reactions occurring at the anode and cathode 126, 124 depending on
      the electrolytes used in the dialytic stacks 101, 201 depicted in
      FIGS. 1 and 2. For example, when the electrolyte used is aqueous
      NaCl, Cl.sup.- anions are oxidized to Cl.sub.2 gas (see Table 1,
      row ii, above). Cl.sub.2 gas can, for example, be used to treat
      water via chlorination. Alternatively, if aqueous HCl were used as
      an electrolyte, H.sub.2 gas would be produced at the cathode 124
      (see Table 1, row v, above) and could be subsequently used to
      produce power in fuel cells, for example. Other potential useful
      by-products from the oxidation-reduction reactions occurring in
      the electrolyte chambers 114, 116 include oxygen gas when using an
      electrolyte of Na.sub.2SO.sub.4, NaOH or HCl; and sodium hydroxide
      when using NaCl as an electrolyte. <br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 3 depicts a third embodiment of a dialytic stack 301
      that pumps the electrolyte from one of the anode and cathode
      electrolyte chambers 114, 116 to the other of the anode and
      cathode electrolyte chambers 114, 116 such that electrochemical
      reaction by-products formed in one of the anode and cathode
      electrolyte chambers 114, 116 can be used as a reactant in the
      other of the electrolyte chambers 114, 116. The dialytic stack 301
      uses gas diffusion electrodes for the anode 126 and cathode 124
      and circulates via pumping the electrochemical reaction
      by-products from one of the anode 126 or cathode 124 to the other
      of the anode 126 or cathode 124 for use as a reactant in an
      electrochemical reaction and oxidation or reduction back to its
      original form. This theoretically reduces the net voltage required
      for the electrochemical reactions to zero. For example, in the
      dialytic stack 301 of FIG. 3, an aqueous mixture of HCl and NaCl
      can be used as the electrolyte in the electrolyte chambers 114,
      116, and the stack end membranes 158 are anion exchange membranes
      122. At the cathode 124, hydrogen ions are reduced to hydrogen
      gas, which is forced to flow to the anode 126 where the hydrogen
      gas is again oxidized to hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions can then
      be recirculated back to the cathode 124 via a pump (not shown)
      where they are again reduced to hydrogen gas. The gas diffusion
      electrodes that are used can be made using the same substrate and
      coating materials as described above, and are configured to
      provide sufficient resident time for the gas to be oxidized or
      reduced at the anode 126 or cathode 124, respectively. Notably,
      the by-products of the electrochemical reactions need not be
      gaseous. For example, an aqueous mixture of Na.sub.3Fe(CN).sub.6
      and Na.sub.4Fe(CN).sub.6 can be used as an electrolyte, which
      results in Fe(CN).sub.6.sup.4- being oxidized to
      Fe(CN).sub.6.sup.3- at the anode 126, which can then be circulated
      to the cathode 124 for reduction back to Fe(CN).sub.6.sup.4-. <br>
      <br>
      [0088] In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3, then, the five drive
      cells 140, 142, 144, 146, 148 generate a total of about 0.20
      Volts. Assuming that Na.sub.3Fe(CN).sub.6 and Na.sub.4Fe(CN).sub.6
      are used as electrolytes, the net electrode reduction potential
      that needs to be overcome for the oxidation-reduction reactions to
      occur is 0 Volts (see Table 2, row vi). The desalination voltage
      of the desalination cell 150 is about 0.088 Volts. For a dialytic
      stack that uses Neosepta AFN and CM-1 ion exchange membranes, has
      a product chamber 118 that is 0.02 cm thick and has diluent and
      concentrate chambers 112, 110 that are each 0.05 cm thick, the
      five drive cells 140, 142, 144, 146, 148 generate a net drive
      voltage of 0.20 Volts. The product chamber 118 has a desalination
      voltage of 0.088 Volts and the net electrode reduction potential
      is 0 Volts; consequently, the resulting stack open circuit voltage
      is 0.20 Volts-0.088 Volts=0.112 Volts. In this embodiment, the ion
      exchange membranes and the diluent, concentrate and product feed
      contribute stack resistive losses of 43.OMEGA./cm.sup.2, which
      results in an ionic current of 2.6 mA/cm.sup.2. Sufficient drive
      voltage exists to desalinate the product feed in the product
      chamber 118. The cations and anions in the product feed are driven
      out of the product chamber 118, through the product chamber cation
      and anion exchange membranes 152, 154, respectively, and into the
      anion and cation discharge chambers 162, 160. The product solution
      that exits the dialytic stack 101 has a salt concentration of
      about 0.04% salt by mass and is drinkable. If an external voltage
      is needed to effect desalination, it can be supplied by a voltage
      source 128, which is electrically coupled to the electrical
      conduit 156. <br>
      <br>
      [0089] Instead of utilizing the voltage source 128 to supply any
      additional voltage, additional drive cells may be added to the
      dialytic stack 101 until a sufficient cumulative drive voltage is
      achieved to effect desalination. If enough drive cells are added
      such that voltage in excess of that required for desalination is
      produced, the dialytic stack 101 may also act as a power source.
      In such a case, an electrical load can be powered by electrically
      coupling it between the anode 126 and cathode 124. <br>
      <br>
      [0090] Referring now to FIG. 4, there is depicted another
      embodiment of a dialytic stack 401 wherein the ionic circuit is
      completed via fluid circulation by submerging the dialytic stack
      401 in a conductive bath 404 that is contained within a storage
      vessel 406. The bath 404 may be, for example, composed of
      concentrate. Beneficially, and in contrast to completing the ionic
      circuit electrochemically as is done in the embodiments
      illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3, completing the ionic circuit via
      fluid circulation does not require an anode, cathode or power
      supplies. Additionally, no external power must be supplied to
      overcome the standard reduction potential of the electrochemical
      reactions that take place when the ionic circuit is completed
      electrochemically, thereby reducing the drive voltage that is
      required to desalinate the product. <br>
      <br>
      [0091] The dialytic stack 401 of FIG. 4 does not have an anode or
      a cathode. Instead, the diluent chambers 112 and concentrate
      chambers 110 of the dialytic stack 401 are sandwiched between
      porous first and second end plates 408, which can be made of
      non-conductive material such as polypropylene. Immediately
      adjacent to the end plates 408 are concentrate chambers 110, which
      act as first and second electrolyte chambers for containing an
      electrolyte which, in this particular embodiment, is concentrate.
      The first electrolyte chamber is bounded on one side by and is in
      ionic communication with the porous first end plate and is bounded
      on another side and is in ionic communication with a first ion
      exchange membrane (the leftmost cation exchange membrane 120 in
      FIG. 4); the second electrolyte chamber is bounded on one side by
      and is in ionic communication with the porous second end plate and
      is bounded on another side by and is in ionic communication with a
      second ion exchange membrane (the rightmost anion exchange
      membrane 122 in FIG. 4). These first and second electrolyte
      chambers ionically communicate with the remainder of the diluent
      and concentrate chambers 112, 110 via first and second ion
      exchange membranes, respectively (the leftmost cation exchange
      membrane 120 and rightmost anion exchange membrane 122 in FIG. 4).
      In the dialytic stack 401 as illustrated in FIG. 4, anions migrate
      from right to left and cations migrate from left to right.
      Consequently, cations are drawn into the dialytic stack from the
      conductive bath 404 near the porous end plate 408 on the left of
      the dialytic stack 401 and anions are drawn into the dialytic
      stack 401 from the conductive bath 404 near the porous end plate
      408 on the right side of the dialytic stack 401. The deeper and
      wider the conductive bath 404 and the higher its concentration,
      the lower the resistance encountered by the migrating ions. In
      practice, all of the diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110 in
      the dialytic stack 401 are sealed such that no fluid transfer
      occurs between the bath 404 and the chambers 112, 110. <br>
      <br>
      [0092] In an alternative embodiment (not shown), instead of
      submerging the dialytic stack 401 within the conductive bath 404,
      the first and second electrolyte chambers are filled with
      concentrate. These concentrate chambers are fluidly coupled to
      each other via an electrolyte chamber fluid conduit. In this
      alternative embodiment, the end plates 408 are not porous. Forced
      circulation can be provided via pumping to circulate concentrate
      from one of the concentrate chambers to the other, thereby
      completing the ionic circuit. <br>
      <br>
      [0093] Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a dialytic
      arrangement of cells in a ring configuration ("dialytic ring"
      501). The dialytic ring 501 in FIG. 5 includes a concentrate
      supply manifold 510 and a diluent supply manifold 512, which
      receive concentrate and diluent from concentrate and diluent
      supply conduits 104 and 102, respectively. Diluent and concentrate
      are then conveyed to diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110
      which are fluidly coupled to the diluent and concentrate supply
      manifolds 512, 510 and which, as in the aforedescribed
      embodiments, are separated from each other by a series of
      alternating cation and anion exchange membranes 120, 122. Product
      feed is delivered directly to product chamber 118 from the product
      feed supply conduit 106. Advantageously, cations and anions
      migrate in opposite directions around the dialytic ring 501,
      thereby achieving desalination of a given volume of product feed.
      Compared to a dialytic stack 401 having the same number and
      average thickness of chambers 110, 112, 118, the distance
      migrating anions and cations have to travel in the dialytic ring
      501 is less than the distance they have to travel in the dialytic
      stack 401, and therefore the ionic resistance of the dialytic ring
      501 is less than the ionic resistances of the dialytic stack 401.
      Consequently, if the dialytic ring 501 and the dialytic stack 101,
      201, 301 have the same number of chambers 110, 112, 118 of the
      same average thickness, resistive losses will be lower in the
      dialytic ring 501 than in the dialytic stacks 101, 201, 301. In
      addition, electrodes are not required in the dialytic ring 501. <br>
      <br>
      [0094] The dialytic ring 501 of FIG. 5 has seven drive cells and
      one desalination cell 150. As with the embodiment of the dialytic
      stack wherein the ionic circuit is completed using fluid
      circulation, no energy is needed to drive any electrochemical
      reactions. Consequently, assuming a concentrate concentration of
      about 18% and a diluent concentration of about 3.5%, the seven
      drive cells provide a cumulative drive voltage of 0.28 Volts,
      which is well in excess of the voltage needed to desalinate the
      product feed to about 0.04% salt by mass (approximately 0.088
      Volts plus the voltage drop due to parasitic resistive losses).
      Following desalination, the product exits the dialytic ring 501
      via a product exit manifold 508, the diluent exits the dialytic
      ring 501 via a diluent exit manifold 504, and the concentrate
      exits the dialytic ring 501 via a concentrate exit manifold 506. <br>
      <br>
      [0095] Referring now to FIG. 6, there is depicted a dialytic
      arrangement of cells in a spiral configuration ("dialytic spiral
      601"). As in previous embodiments, the dialytic spiral 601 is
      composed of an alternating arrangement of cation and anion
      exchange membranes 120, 122. Product feed, diluent and concentrate
      can be supplied to the gaps between the alternating ion exchange
      membranes 120, 122 through supply conduits 102, 104, 106. The
      dialytic spiral 601 can be created by, for example, arranging the
      ion exchange membranes 120, 122 along with chamber spacers and
      gaskets flat on a surface and then rolling them as depicted in
      FIG. 6. Beneficially, rolling the membranes 120, 122 aids in high
      volume manufacturing; and reduces exposure of sealing surfaces,
      which reduces the likelihood that the spiral 601 will leak.
      Production techniques are similar to those used in spirally wound
      reverse osmosis modules, such as the DOW.TM. 210 EDI module. <br>
      <br>
      [0096] Referring now to FIGS. 7(a) and (c), there are depicted
      sectional and exploded views of a unipolar dialytic stack 701 that
      can be used to desalinate saltwater. By "unipolar", it is meant
      that the direction of ionic movement in the dialytic stack 701 is
      not reversible during operation. FIG. 7(a) is a sectional view of
      the dialytic stack 701 having an alternating arrangement of
      diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110. The anion exchange
      membrane 122 forms a shared boundary and is in ionic communication
      with adjacent diluent and concentrate chambers 112, 110 of any
      given drive cell; the cation exchange membrane 120 forms a shared
      boundary between and is in ionic communication with any given
      drive cell and an adjacent drive cell. The product chamber 118 is
      disposed within the dialytic stack 701 and is bounded on one side
      by and is in ionic communication with the product chamber anion
      exchange membrane 154, and is bounded on another side by and is in
      ionic communication with the product chamber cation exchange
      membrane 152. The anode and cathode 126, 124 and anode and cathode
      electrolyte chambers 116, 114 are disposed on either end of the
      dialytic stack 701. Between the anode electrolyte chamber 116 and
      the drive cells and product chamber 118 are the stack end
      membranes 158 in the form of the anode and cathode stack end ion
      exchange membranes. The anode electrolyte chamber 116 is bounded
      on one side by and is in ionic communication with the anode stack
      end ion exchange membrane and is bounded on another side by and is
      in electrical communication with the anode 126. The anode
      electrolyte chamber 116 is ionic communication with the drive
      cells and the product chamber 118 via the anode stack end ion
      exchange membrane. Similarly, the cathode electrolyte chamber 114
      is bounded on one side by and is in ionic communication with the
      cathode stack end ion exchange membrane and is bounded on another
      side by and is in electrical communication with the cathode 124.
      The cathode electrolyte chamber is in ionic communication with the
      drive cells and product chamber 118 via the cathode stack end ion
      exchange membrane. The anode and cathode, ion exchange membranes
      and diluent, concentrate and product chambers are sandwiched
      between two end plates 714. <br>
      <br>
      [0097] Referring now also to FIG. 7(b), there is depicted a front
      elevation view of a gasket 708 having a spacer 710 that is used as
      part of a manifolding assembly that includes diluent manifolding
      configured to convey diluent to and away from the diluent chambers
      112, concentrate manifolding to convey concentrate to and away
      from the concentrate chambers 110, and product manifolding to
      deliver the saltwater to be desalinated to and desalinated
      saltwater away from the product chamber 118. It is advantageous
      for the chambers to be as thin as practically possible to limit
      ionic resistance while also promoting fluid flow without an
      excessive pressure drop. In FIG. 7(b), the spacer 710 is a mesh
      spacer that maintains separation of adjacent ion exchange
      membranes when the dialytic stack 701 is in operation by
      preventing adjacent ion exchange membranes from contacting each
      other as a result of fluid flow through the chambers 110, 112,
      118. The spacer 710 can be similar to Industrial Netting's XN-3234
      or ON-6200. The gasket 708 can be formed using materials such as
      ethylene propylene diene M-class rubber (EPDM), silicon, nitrile,
      santoprene, viton, neoprene, PTFE (Teflon), natural rubber, and
      PVC. As is evident from FIG. 7(c), the gaskets 708 and ion
      exchange membranes are layered in an alternating series to form
      the various diluent, concentrate, product, and electrolyte
      chambers. Each gasket 708 circumscribes a volume that acts as one
      of the diluent, concentrate or product chambers, and each such
      chamber is bounded on one side by and in ionic communication with
      one ion exchange membrane and bounded on another side by and in
      ionic communication with another ion exchange membrane. <br>
      <br>
      [0098] Each gasket 708 has punched through its perimeter a series
      of holes that make up part of the diluent, concentrate or product
      manifolding. In FIG. 7(b), one side of the gasket 708 has the
      diluent supply conduits 104 extending therethrough and the
      opposing side of the gasket 708 has the diluent exit conduits 132
      extending therethrough. Similarly, the product feed supply
      conduits 106 and the product exit conduits 134 extend through
      opposing sides of the gasket 708. The gasket 708 has a series of
      inlet notches 738(a) extending through one side of the gasket 708,
      with each inlet notch 738(a) being fluidly coupled to the
      concentrate supply conduit 102, and on an opposing side has a
      series of outlet notches 738(b) extending therethrough, with each
      outlet notch 738(b) being fluidly coupled to the concentrate exit
      conduit 130. The gasket 708 depicted in FIG. 7(b) is thus
      configured to be a concentrate chamber 110. Only the concentrate
      supply and exit conduits 102, 130 are fluidly coupled to the
      concentrate chamber 110 via the inlet and outlet notches 738(a),
      (b); consequently, any product (or product feed) and diluent
      passing through the product feed supply conduits 106, product exit
      conduits 134, diluent supply conduits 104 and diluent exit
      conduits 132 are sealed from the concentrate chamber 110, while
      concentrate will flow from the concentrate supply conduits 102,
      through the inlet notches 738(a), into and through the concentrate
      chamber 110, and then out through the outlet notches 738(b) on the
      opposite side of the gasket 708 and into the concentrate exit
      conduits 130. Similarly, for the gasket that circumscribes the
      product chamber 118, only notches that fluidly couple the product
      feed supply and exit conduits 106, 134 to the product chamber 118
      are present, and for the gaskets that circumscribe the diluent
      chambers 112, only notches that fluidly couple the diluent supply
      and exit conduits 104, 132 to the diluent chamber 112 are present.
      The gaskets 708 when pressed together to form the dialytic stack
      701 form a fluid tight seal, thus securely containing the contents
      of the diluent, concentrate and product chambers. Additionally,
      the concentrate supply and exit conduits 102, 130, diluent supply
      and exit conduits 104, 132 and product feed supply and product
      exit conduits 106, 134 from various gaskets 708 align together
      when the gaskets 708 are pressed to form the dialytic stack 701,
      thus forming the concentrate, diluent, and product manifolding,
      respectively. Concentrate, diluent and product feed can
      consequently flow through the concentrate, diluent and product
      manifolding and be delivered to the concentration, diluent and
      product chambers 110, 112, 118. <br>
      <br>
      [0099] In the depicted embodiment, electrolyte is pumped into and
      out of electrolyte chambers 114, 116 via conduits 108, 136,
      respectively. <br>
      <br>
      [0100] Referring now to FIG. 8, there are depicted schematic (FIG.
      8(a)), exploded (FIG. 8(b)) and perspective (FIG. 8(c)) views of a
      bipolar dialytic stack 801, in which assembly of the chambers with
      manifolding and valves is illustrated. By "bipolar", it is meant
      that the dialytic stack 801 is operable in forward and reverse
      polarities. In forward polarity, a schematic view of the dialytic
      stack 801 is the dialytic stack 101 of FIG. 1. In reverse
      polarity, a schematic view of the dialytic stack 801 is the
      dialytic stack 201 of FIG. 2. Visible in FIG. 8(a) are sixteen
      two-way valves, inlet valves 844(a)-(h) and outlet valves
      844(i)-(p) that can be configured for both forward polarity and
      reverse polarity operation. Table 2, below, specifies how these

      <br>
      [0101] Referring now to FIG. 8(b) and as with the embodiments of
      the dialytic stack depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, the dialytic stack
      801 is composed of an alternating series of cation and anion
      exchange membranes 120, 122. Between the cation and anion exchange
      membranes 120, 122 are a series of alternating diluent/concentrate
      chambers 812 and concentrate/diluent chambers 810. The anion
      exchange membrane 122 forms a shared boundary and is in ionic
      communication with adjacent diluent/concentrate and
      concentrate/diluent chambers 812, 810 of any given drive cell; the
      cation exchange membrane 120 forms a shared boundary between and
      is in ionic communication with any given drive cell and an
      adjacent drive cell. Also located within the dialytic stack 801
      are a product/diluent chamber 818 and diluent/product chamber 819,
      which in the depicted embodiment are adjacent to each other. The
      product/diluent chamber 818 is bounded on one side by and is in
      ionic communication with a product/diluent chamber anion exchange
      membrane 854 and bounded on another side by and is in ionic
      communication with a product/diluent chamber cation exchange
      membrane 852. Similarly, the diluent/product chamber is bounded on
      one side by and is in ionic communication with a diluent/product
      chamber anion exchange membrane 856 and bounded on another side by
      and is in ionic communication with a diluent/product chamber
      cation exchange membrane 852. In this particular embodiment, the
      diluent/product chamber cation exchange membrane 852 and the
      product/diluent chamber cation exchange membrane 852 are the same
      ion exchange membrane because the product/diluent and
      diluent/product chambers 818, 819 are adjacent to each other,
      although this is not the case when the chambers 818, 819 are not
      adjacent. <br>
      <br>
      [0102] As with the dialytic stack 701, the dialytic stack 801 has
      a manifolding assembly that includes diluent/concentrate,
      concentrate/diluent, product/diluent, and diluent/product
      manifolding respectively configured to convey diluent to and away
      from the diluent/concentrate chamber 812 and diluent/product
      chamber 819, concentrate to and away from the concentrate/diluent
      chamber 810, and the saltwater to be desalinated to and the
      desalinated saltwater away from the product/diluent chamber 818
      when the dialytic stack 801 is operating in forward polarity, and
      respectively configured to convey diluent to and away from the
      concentrate/diluent chamber 810 and product/diluent chamber 818,
      concentrate to and away from the diluent/concentrate chamber 812,
      and the saltwater to be desalinated to and the desalinated
      saltwater away from the diluent/product chamber 819 when the
      dialytic stack 801 is operating in reverse polarity. <br>
      <br>
      [0103] As with the dialytic stack 701, the dialytic stack 801
      includes gaskets (not labeled in FIG. 8) that each circumscribe a
      volume that acts as one of the diluent/concentrate,
      concentrate/diluent, diluent/product, or product/diluent chambers,
      and each such chamber is bounded on one side by and is in ionic
      communication with one ion exchange membrane and is bounded on
      another side by and is in ionic communication with another ion
      exchange membrane. Structurally, the manifolding assembly of the
      dialytic stack 801 is identical to that of the dialytic stack 701
      with the exception of the addition of an additional
      diluent/product manifolding to another side of the gaskets used in
      the dialytic stack 801. Structurally, the diluent/concentrate
      manifolding, concentrate/diluent manifolding, and product/diluent
      manifolding correspond to the diluent manifolding, concentrate
      manifolding, and product manifolding of the dialytic stack 701,
      respectively. For example, inlet notches fluidly couple
      diluent/concentrate supply conduits 804 in one of the gaskets of
      the dialytic stack 801 to the diluent/concentrate chamber 812,
      thereby allowing the solution flowing through the
      diluent/concentrate conduit (either diluent or concentrate) to
      enter the diluent/concentrate chamber 812. Outlet notches fluidly
      couple the diluent/concentrate chamber 812 to diluent/concentrate
      exit conduits 830, thereby allowing the solution in the
      diluent/concentrate chamber 812 to exit the stack 801. <br>
      <br>
      [0104] The first and second electrodes 824, 826 and first and
      second electrolyte chambers 814, 816 are disposed on either end of
      the dialytic stack 801. The electrodes 824, 826 are both operable
      as either anodes or cathodes, depending on whether the dialytic
      stack 801 is operating in forward or reverse polarity. The first
      electrolyte chamber 814 is bounded on one side by and is in ionic
      communication with a first stack end ion exchange membrane 858,
      and is bounded on another side by and is in electrical
      communication with the first electrode 824. Similarly, the second
      electrolyte chamber 816 is bounded on one side by and is in ionic
      communication with a second stack end ion exchange membrane 858,
      and is bounded on another side by and is in electrical
      communication with the second electrode 826. The electrodes, ion
      exchange membranes and various chambers are sandwiched between two
      end plates 714. <br>
      <br>
      [0105] The electrodes 824, 826 can be composed of a substrate and
      a coating applied thereon. The substrate can be, for example,
      titanium, niobium, tantalum, iridium, or palladium. The coating
      can be platinum, ruthenium, iridium, or a mixed metal oxide
      combination of the three. Alternatively, the electrodes 824, 826
      can be sacrificial and deteriorate over time. In such an
      embodiment, the electrodes 824, 826 can be formed from an uncoated
      substrate of stainless steel, steel, nickel, copper, or graphite.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0106] Operation of the dialytic stack 801 in forward polarity
      will now be described. Diluent, concentrate and product feed are
      supplied through the arrows labeled "D", "C" and "P" in FIG. 7(a).
      Diluent is pumped into the dialytic stack 801 through the valves
      844(a), 844(g) and the diluent/concentrate supply conduits 804 and
      diluent/product supply conduits 806. The diluent is pumped through
      the diluent/concentrate and diluent/product manifolding and is
      delivered to the diluent/concentrate chambers 812 and the
      diluent/product chamber 819 in the dialytic stack 801. Diluent
      exits the dialytic stack 801 through the diluent/concentrate exit
      conduits 830 and diluent/product exit conduits 832 and the valves
      844(i), 844(p). Concentrate is pumped into the dialytic stack 801
      through the valve 844(d) and concentrate/diluent supply conduit
      802. The concentrate is pumped through the concentrate/diluent
      manifolding and is delivered to the concentrate/diluent chambers
      810. The concentrate exits the dialytic stack 801 through
      concentrate/diluent exit conduit 828 and the valve 844(l). Product
      feed is pumped into the dialytic stack 801 through the valve
      844(f) and product/diluent supply conduit 805. The product feed is
      pumped through the product/diluent manifolding and is delivered to
      the product/diluent chamber 818. The product exits the dialytic
      stack 801 through product/diluent exit conduit 831 and the valve
      844(n). <br>
      <br>
      [0107] Following exiting the dialytic stack 801, diluent,
      concentrate and product are diverted through three-way valves
      846(a)-(c). Normally, the valves 846(a)-(c) are set such that the
      diluent, concentrate and product are directed along the conduits
      labeled "D", "C" and "P". The dialytic stack 801 can also be
      operated in purge mode, in which case the diluent, concentrate and
      product are all diverted to the "waste" conduit, labeled "W".
      While transitioning from operation in forward polarity mode to
      reverse polarity mode or vice versa, the dialytic stack 801 can be
      temporarily operated in purge mode so as to flush away any
      unwanted diluent, concentrate and product from the valves and
      conduits. <br>
      <br>
      [0108] When operating in reverse polarity, diluent is pumped into
      the dialytic stack through the valves 844(c), 844(e) and the
      concentrate/diluent supply conduit 802 and the product/diluent
      supply conduit 805. The diluent is pumped through the
      concentrate/diluent and product/diluent manifolding and delivered
      into the concentrate/diluent chambers 812 and the product/diluent
      chamber 818. The diluent exits the dialytic stack through the
      concentrate/diluent exit conduit 828, the product/diluent exit
      conduit 831 and the valves 844(k), 844(m). Concentrate is pumped
      into the dialytic stack 801 through the valve 844(b) and through
      the diluent/concentrate supply conduit 804. The concentrate is
      pumped through the diluent/concentrate manifolding and delivered
      to the diluent/concentrate chambers 812 and exits the dialytic
      stack through the diluent/concentrate exit conduit 830 and the
      valve 844(i). Product feed is pumped into the dialytic stack 801
      through the valve 844(h) and the diluent/product supply conduit
      806. The product feed is pumped through the diluent/product
      manifolding and delivered to the diluent/product chamber 819 and
      the product exits the dialytic stack through the diluent/product
      exit conduit 832 and the valve 844(o). In both forward and reverse
      polarities, electrolyte is pumped into and out of end chambers
      114, 116 via conduits 108, 136, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      [0109] In addition to pumping product feed, diluent and
      concentrate into the dialytic stack through the valves 844(a)-(h)
      and product, diluent and concentrate out of the dialytic stack
      through the valves 844(i)-(p) ("forward flow" mode), the flow of
      solutions within the dialytic stack can also be reversed such that
      product feed, diluent and concentrate are pumped into the dialytic
      stack through the valves 844(i)-(p) and product, diluent and
      concentrate are pumped out of the dialytic stack through the
      valves 844(a)-(h) ("reverse flow" mode). Reverse flow mode can be
      used to flush the dialytic stack 801. Furthermore, the dialytic
      stack 801 is able to operate in a mode wherein some of the
      solutions enter the dialytic stack 801 through the valves
      844(a)-(h) and other solutions enter the dialytic stack through
      the valves 844(i)-(p) ("countercurrent flow" mode). For example,
      when pumping the product feed and diluent into the dialytic stack
      801 through the valves 844(a), (f) and (h), concentrate can be fed
      into the dialytic stack 801 through valve 844(l). This allows the
      diluent and concentrate to flow through the dialytic stack 801 in
      countercurrent directions, which as mentioned above can help to
      maintain a more even concentration difference between the diluent
      and concentration chambers 812, 810. <br>
      <br>
      [0110] One benefit of being able to run the dialytic stack in both
      forward and reverse polarities is that periodic reversal of stack
      polarity can be used to prevent scaling and fouling of the
      membranes 120, 122 and electrodes 824, 826 and thereby extend the
      life of the ion exchange membranes 120, 122 and the electrodes
      824, 826. <br>
      <br>
      [0111] Referring now to FIGS. 9(a) and (b), there is depicted a
      multi-stage dialytic stack 901. The multi-stage stack 901 has four
      desalination stages 1-4. Input to the first stage are concentrate,
      diluent and product feed through the concentrate, diluent and
      product feed supply conduits 102, 104, 106. Each stage in the
      dialytic stack 901 purifies the product by a certain percentage
      such that the product that exits via the product exit conduit 134
      is desalinated. As is evident in FIG. 9(a), the product flows
      through adjacent desalination stages in the depicted dialytic
      stack 901 in opposing directions, although this is not required in
      all embodiments. <br>
      <br>
      [0112] Referring now to FIG. 9(b), there is depicted a detailed
      view of a portion of desalination stages 3 and 4 of the dialytic
      stack 901. The dialytic stack 901 includes a plurality of drive
      cells, each of which is composed of a diluent chamber 112 and a
      concentrate chamber 110 ionically communicative via an ion
      exchange membrane. Desalination stage 3 also has a plurality of
      initial stage product chambers 914, each of which is bounded on a
      first side by and in ionic communication with an initial stage
      product chamber anion exchange membrane and bounded on another
      side by and in ionic communication with an initial stage product
      chamber cation exchange membrane. The output of the initial stage
      product chambers 914 is directed into a plurality of product
      chambers in stage 4, subsequent stage product chambers 916, each
      of which is bounded on a first side by and in ionic communication
      with a subsequent stage product chamber anion exchange membrane
      and bounded on another side by and in ionic communication with a
      subsequent stage product chamber cation exchange membrane. The
      plurality of product chambers that make up the initial stage
      product chambers 914 and the plurality of product chambers that
      make up the subsequent stage product chambers 916 allow product to
      flow in parallel in any given stage. In any given stage, having
      multiple product chambers purify saltwater in parallel allows the
      total volume of product feed that can be handled by the dialytic
      stack 901 to be increased relative to a dialytic stack 901 that
      has only a single product chamber per stage. Additionally,
      incorporating multiple desalination stages into a single stack
      results in lower capital costs than having a separate stack for
      each desalination stage. The initial stage and subsequent stage
      product chambers 914, 916 each have a desalination voltage.
      Consequently, in order to effect desalination in both the initial
      stage and subsequent stage product chambers 914, 916
      simultaneously, the sufficient voltage that is applied across the
      product chambers 914, 916 must be greater than or equal to the sum
      of the desalination voltages of the product chambers 914, 916.
      This sufficient voltage includes the drive voltage generated by
      the drive cells and any external voltage applied to the dialytic
      stack 901. <br>
      <br>
      [0113] Although the initial and subsequent desalination stages of
      FIG. 9 are shown as being desalination stages 3 and 4, the terms
      "initial desalination stage" and "subsequent desalination stage"
      refer to any two desalination stages in a dialytic stack wherein
      the saltwater to be desalinated travels through the initial
      desalination stage prior to traveling through the subsequent
      desalination stage; i.e., to any two stages in series
      communication with each other. <br>
      <br>
      [0114] Referring now to FIG. 10, there is depicted a plant 1001
      that can be used to desalinate saltwater using a continuous flow
      process. The plant 1001 includes a water source 1004, which can be
      the ocean or a brackish water supply, for example. Saltwater from
      the water source 1004 is directed to a pre-treatment system 1006
      that treats the saltwater prior to desalination. The pre-treatment
      system 1006 is designed to remove debris, suspended solids and
      organic and inorganic matter that can foul, plug or damage the
      equipment used in the plant 1001. From the pre-treatment system
      1006, the treated saltwater is diverted to a saltwater reservoir
      1010, which holds product feed that is to be desalinated, and to a
      diluent reservoir 1026, which holds diluent. In the depicted
      embodiment, the diluent and the product feed to be desalinated are
      the same, although this is not a requirement for all embodiments.
      Also present in the plant 1001 is a concentrate reservoir 1020,
      for holding concentrate. Concentrate, diluent and product feed
      from reservoirs 1020, 1026 and 1010 are pumped through a series of
      three dialytic stacks 1002 in order to desalinate the product
      feed. Other embodiments could use more or less than three dialytic
      stacks with the desalination occurring in stages as the product
      feed passes through the dialytic stacks. The plant 1001 utilizes
      three dialytic stacks 1002, with product feed flowing through the
      dialytic stacks 1002 in series and concentrate and diluent flowing
      through the dialytic stacks 1002 in parallel. Following use in the
      dialytic stacks 1002, used diluent can be returned to the diluent
      reservoir 1026 via a valve 1040; back to the water source 1004 via
      a second valve 1042; and to a first reconcentrator 1032 for
      generating concentrate from the used diluent, as discussed in more
      detail below. Used concentrate is returned to a second
      reconcentrator 1034 for reconcentration prior to storage in the
      concentrate reservoir 1020, also discussed in more detail below.
      Product is stored in product reservoir 1018 for retrieval and use.
      In an alternative embodiment (not shown), used concentrate could
      be returned to the first reconcentrator 1032 and then to the
      second reconcentrator 1034, beneficially maintaining a higher
      concentration in the concentrate reservoir 1020. Also in
      alternative embodiments (not shown), output from the first
      reconcentrator 1032 could be conveyed directly into the
      concentrate reservoir 1020, or used concentrate could be returned
      directly to the concentrate reservoir 1020 instead of to the
      second reconcentrator 1034. <br>
      <br>
      [0115] Exemplary first and second reconcentrators 1032, 1034 are
      depicted in FIGS. 12-14, discussed below. The first reconcentrator
      1032 is used to increase the concentration of used diluent prior
      to transferring the used diluent to the second reconcentrator
      1034, which is used to further increase the concentration of the
      used diluent prior to transferring it into the concentrate
      reservoir 1020 and to increase the concentration of the solution
      stored in the concentrate reservoir, if necessary. Both the first
      and second reconcentrators 1032, 1034 utilize evaporation to the
      atmosphere for increasing the concentration of saltwater until the
      saltwater attains a salt concentration suitable for use as
      concentrate. In one embodiment, solar energy can be directly
      transferred to the reconcentrators 1032, 1034 (e.g. by having the
      sun shine on a spray pond 1201, as depicted in FIG. 12) to
      increase the concentration of saltwater. In alternative
      embodiments (not depicted), the first and second reconcentrators
      1032, 1034 can be fluidly coupled to a heat exchanger 1324
      (depicted in FIGS. 13 and 14) which, in turn, obtains heat from an
      external heat source such as a nearby power or process plant or a
      solar thermal collector. Low grade thermal energy from a power
      plant may be, for example, waste heat (such as from a power plant)
      that may range from about 30 to 150 degrees Celsius. Exemplary
      heat exchangers are shell and tube, plate, and phase change heat
      exchangers. The reconcentrators 1032, 1034 may use a combination
      of energy obtained via the heat exchanger 1324 or directly from
      the sun to aid in evaporation. <br>
      <br>
      [0116] In contrast to known means and methods for desalinating
      saltwater, the plant 1001 is essentially able to store low grade
      thermal energy, such as solar energy, in the form of concentrated
      saltwater; this stored chemical energy is transformed to
      desalinate the product feed in the dialytic stacks 1002. Notably,
      areas that are dry and arid and consequently likely to require
      desalination technology are also those areas that tend to have
      less humid atmospheres, receive a great deal of solar radiation
      and therefore have environments in which water readily evaporates.
      Beneficially, areas in which the plant 1001 is likely to function
      best are those areas in which the plant 1001 is needed most. <br>
      <br>
      [0117] Referring now to FIG. 11, there is depicted a second
      embodiment of a plant 1101 that can be used to desalinate
      saltwater in a batch flow process. As with the first embodiment of
      the plant 1001, saltwater is collected from the water source 1004,
      receives pre-treatment in the pre-treatment system 1006, and is
      then diverted to a combined saltwater and product reservoir 1110
      and the diluent reservoir 1026. Although the plant 1101 uses only
      one dialytic stack 1102, multiple dialytic stacks could be used as
      is done in the first embodiment of the plant 1001. In contrast to
      the first embodiment 1001 of the plant that pumps product feed in
      series through three dialytic stacks 1002, though, the second
      embodiment 1101 of the plant does not use the product feed
      reservoir 1018 of the first plant embodiment 1001 to receive
      desalinated product. Instead, desalinated product is returned back
      to the combined saltwater and product reservoir 1110. In this way,
      a discrete batch of saltwater to be desalinated can be transferred
      from the water source 1004 and stored in the combined saltwater
      and product reservoir 1110, which can then be pumped through the
      dialytic stack 1002 until the water in the combined saltwater and
      product reservoir 1110 has been sufficiently desalinated. As with
      the first embodiment of the plant 1001, the reconcentrators 1032,
      1034 increase the concentration of saltwater by evaporation to the
      atmosphere until the saltwater is ready to be used as concentrate.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0118] Referring now to FIGS. 12-14, there are depicted three
      examples of reconcentrators. FIG. 12 depicts an evaporative spray
      pond 1201; FIG. 13 depicts a natural draft evaporative tower 1301;
      and FIG. 14 depicts a forced draft evaporative tower 1401. <br>
      <br>
      [0119] The evaporative spray pond 1201 depicted in FIG. 12
      includes a pond surface 1214 in which is a shallow layer of pond
      catchment 1232. The pond catchment 1232 is fluidly coupled to a
      nozzle header 1206, nozzle riser 1204, and spray nozzle 1202.
      While only one spray nozzle 1202 is depicted in FIG. 12, the
      nozzle header 1206 may be coupled to a plurality of spray nozzles
      1202. Concentrated seawater can be pumped from the catchment 1232
      to the concentrate reservoir 1020 via fluid conduit 1236;
      similarly, fluid from the concentrate reservoir 1020 can be pumped
      to the nozzle header 1206 and sprayed through the spray nozzle
      1202 via fluid conduit 1238. Some of the water in the spray
      emanating from the spray nozzle 1202 will evaporate as the spray
      falls towards the catchment 1232, thereby increasing the salt
      concentration of the saltwater in the catchment 1232. A louvred
      fence 1212 may be used to prevent water droplets from diffusing
      away from the pond 1212. <br>
      <br>
      [0120] Labeled A, B, C and D in FIG. 12 are four different ways in
      which the pond surface 1214 may be constructed. Surface A is
      constructed of a layer of heat capacitive material 1218, such as
      sand, on which is a layer of a dark, highly conductive material
      1216 such as black steel. Surface B is similar to surface A except
      that a layer of insulation 1222 is laid under the heat capacitive
      material 1218 to better retain heat. Surface C is constructed of a
      layer of the heat capacitive material 1218 on which is a layer of
      a dark, sealing membrane surface 1226 such as PVC, polypropylene
      or EPDM. Surface D is similar to surface C except that a layer of
      the insulation 1222 is under the layer of heat capacitive material
      1218. <br>
      <br>
      [0121] In an alternative embodiment (not shown), the nozzle 1202,
      nozzle riser 1204 nozzle header 1206 and louvered fence 1212 can
      be removed from the evaporative spray pond 1212. The result is an
      evaporative pond, which can also be used as a reconcentrator. <br>
      <br>
      [0122] In a further alternative embodiment (not depicted), the
      heat exchanger 1324 may be fluidly coupled to the nozzle header
      1206 to provide additional energy that can be used in the
      evaporation process. The more heat is supplied via the heat
      exchanger 1324, the smaller the area of the pond catchment 1232
      needs to be. The heat exchanger 1324 can, for example, supply 60%
      of the energy used in the evaporation process, with the remaining
      40% coming from energy absorbed by the surface area of the pond
      catchment 1232. <br>
      <br>
      [0123] The natural draft evaporative tower 1301 is composed of a
      tower base 1314 inside of which lies a shallow layer of tower
      catchment 1316 and on which is supported a tower housing 1302. As
      with the spray pond 1201, the tower catchment 1316 can be pumped
      to the concentrate reservoir 1020 via the fluid conduit 1236, and
      fluid from the concentrate reservoir 1020 can be pumped to a
      dispersive nozzle 1304 via the fluid conduit 1238. The fluid first
      passes through the heat exchanger 1324 that is coupled to an
      external heat source as described above, which provides low grade
      heat to the fluid to replace heat lost during evaporation. Spray
      falling from the nozzle 1304 evaporates as it falls towards the
      catchment 1316, aided by an influx of air through air intakes
      1310, thereby increasing the salt concentration of the catchment
      1316. The spray also hits fill material 1312, which provides
      increased surface area for the saltwater to flow over and
      increases mass transfer between the saltwater and the air, thereby
      aiding in evaporation. <br>
      <br>
      [0124] The forced draft evaporative tower 1401 is similar to the
      natural draft evaporative tower 1301 as it is composed of a tower
      base 1418 inside of which lies a shallow layer of tower catchment
      1420 and on which is supported a tower housing 1402. The tower
      catchment 1420 can be pumped to the concentrate reservoir 1020 via
      the fluid conduit 1236, and fluid from the concentrate reservoir
      1020 can be pumped to a dispersive nozzle 1304 via the fluid
      conduit 1238. The fluid first passes through the heat exchanger
      1324 that is coupled to an external heat source as described
      above, which provides low grade heat to the fluid to replace heat
      lost during evaporation. Spray falling from the nozzle 1304
      evaporates as it falls towards the catchment 1420, aided by an
      influx of air through air intakes 1310 and by the draft provided
      by a fan 1412, thereby increasing the salt concentration of the
      catchment 1316. The spray also hits fill material 1312, which
      provides increased surface area for the saltwater to flow over and
      increases mass transfer between the saltwater and the air, thereby
      aiding in evaporation. Demister 1414 helps to prevent spray from
      damaging the fan 1412 and escaping from the top of the tower 1401.
      <br>

      [0125] Any of the reconcentrators depicted in FIGS. 12-14 can
      reside on land or float at sea. <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0126] An example of a plant 1001 composed of a four stage
      dialytic stack 901 coupled to a reconcentrator 1032 in the form of
      an evaporative spray pond 1201 will now be discussed. <br>
      <br>
      [0127] The dialytic stack has a total of 800 drive cells and 100
      desalination cells. The cation exchange membrane 120 used is a
      Neosepta AFN membrane. The anion exchange membrane 122 used is a
      Neosepta CM-1 membrane. Each membrane 120, 122 has a surface area
      of 1500 cm.sup.2 (each membrane 120, 122 has a height of 50 cm and
      a depth of 30 cm) that interfaces with the product, diluent, or
      concentrate. The thickness of each of the product, diluent and
      concentrate chambers is 0.02 cm. The anode and cathode 124, 126
      are made of platinised titanium. The gaskets between chambers are
      made of polypropylene. <br>
      <br>
      [0128] The plant 1001 generates 1 m.sup.3 of drinkable water per
      day at 0.04% salt concentration per day. The product feed has a
      salt concentration of 3.50% when it is input into the dialytic
      stack 901. The diluent also has a salt concentration of 3.50% and
      the concentrate has a salt concentration of 18.00% when they are
      input into the dialytic stack 901. As they leave the dialytic
      stack 901, the diluent and concentrate have salt concentrations of
      4.90% and 16.90%, respectively. Diluent, concentrate and product
      feed flow into the dialytic stack 901 at rates of 38.7
      m.sup.3/day, 36.4 m.sup.3/day and 1.01 m.sup.3/day, respectively.
      Diluent and concentrate flow out of the dialytic stack 901 at
      38.92 m.sup.3/day and 36.16 m.sup.3/day, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      [0129] The salt concentration of the water in the water source
      1004 is 3.50%. Water is drawn from the water source 1004 at a rate
      of 39.75 m.sup.3/day. Of this water, 1.01 m.sup.3/day is sent to
      the saltwater reservoir 1010, while 38.74 m.sup.3/day is sent to
      the diluent reservoir 1026. A portion of the used diluent is sent
      from the dialytic stacks 1002 to the concentrate reservoir 1020 at
      a rate of 10.9 m.sup.3/day. The remaining portion of the used
      diluent is discharged directly to the saltwater reservoir 1010 at
      a rate of 28.0 m.sup.3/day and is not sent to the diluent
      reservoir 1026. <br>
      <br>
      [0130] The evaporative spray pond 1201 has a pond surface 1214
      area of 75 m.sup.2. The pond 1201 uses three nozzles 1202. The
      percent of water that evaporates per nozzle spray cycle is 4.0%.
      The spray pond 1201 accepts fluid from the dialytic stacks 1002 at
      a concentration of 16.90%, and returns fluid to the concentrate
      reservoir 1020 at a concentration of 18.00%. <br>
      <br>
      [0131] While illustrative embodiments of the invention have been
      described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made
      therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the
      invention. The invention is therefore to be considered limited
      solely by the scope of the appended claims. <br>
