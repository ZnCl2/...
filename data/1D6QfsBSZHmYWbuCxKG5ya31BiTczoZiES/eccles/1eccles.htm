      <p>British researchers believe that they have made a
        groundbreaking scientific discovery after apparently managing to
        "create" energy from hydrogen atoms. </p>
      <p>In results independently verified at Bristol University, a team
        from Gardner Watts - an environmental technology company based
        in Dedham, Essex - show a "thermal energy cell" which appears to
        produce hundreds of times more energy than that put into it. If
        the findings are correct and can be reproduced on a commercial
        scale, the thermal energy cell could become a feature of every
        home, heating water for a fraction of the cost and cutting fuel
        bills by at least 90 per cent. </p>
      <p>The makers of the cell, which passes an electric current
        through a liquid between two electrodes, admit that they cannot
        explain precisely how the invention works. They insist, however,
        that their cell is not just a repeat of the notorious "cold
        fusion" debacle of the late 1980s. Then two scientists claimed
        to have found a way of generating nuclear energy from a
        similar-looking device at room temperature. The findings were
        widely challenged and the scientists, Martin Fleischmann and
        Stanley Pons, accused of incompetence, fled America to set up
        labs in France. </p>
      <p>"We are absolutely not saying this is cold fusion, or that we
        have found a way round the law of energy conservation," said
        Christopher Davies, the managing director of Gardner Watts. </p>
      <p>"What we are saying is that the device seems to tap into
        another, previously unrecognised source of energy." </p>
      <p>According to Mr Davies, the cell is the product of research
        into the fundamental properties of hydrogen, the most common
        element in the universe. He argues that calculations based on
        quantum theory, the laws of the sub-atomic world, suggest that
        hydrogen can exist in a so-called metastable state that harbours
        a potential source of extra energy. </p>
      <p>This theory suggests that if electricity were passed into a
        mixture of water and a chemical catalyst, the extra energy would
        be released in the form of heat. </p>
      <p>After some experimentation, the team found that a small amount
        of electricity passed through a mixture of water and potassium
        carbonate - potash - released an astonishing amount of energy. </p>
      <p>"It generates a lot of heat in a very small volume," said
        Christopher Eccles, the chief scientist at Gardner Watts. </p>
      <p>The findings of the Gardner Watts team were tested by Dr Jason
        Riley of Bristol University, who found energy gains of between
        three and 26 times what had been put in. </p>
      <p>In a written report, Dr Riley concluded: "Using the apparatus
        supplied by Gardner Watts and the procedure of analysis
        suggested by the company, there appears to be an energy gain in
        the system." </p>
      <p>In tests performed for The Telegraph, the cell heated water to
        near-boiling, apparently producing more than three times the
        amount of energy fed into it. </p>
      <p>Scientists admit to being astonished by the sheer size of the
        energy increase produced by the cell. "I've never seen a claim
        like this before," said Prof Stephen Smith of the physics
        department at Essex University. </p>
      <p>"In the case of cold fusion, people talked about getting a 10
        per cent energy gain or so, which could be explained away quite
        easily but this is much too big for that." </p>
      <p>Prof Smith said he was sceptical about the theory put forward
        by the company. He conceded, however, that scientists had also
        been baffled by the source of energy driving radioactivity, as
        the key equation involved - Einstein's famous E = MC<sup>2</sup>
        - had yet to be discovered. </p>
      <p>According to Prof Smith, if there is a flaw in the company's
        claims, it lies in the measurement of the amount of electrical
        energy pumped into the cell. It is possible that, as sparks pass
        between the electrodes, there is an energy surge which would not
        be picked up by the instruments measuring the electrical input.
      </p>
      <p>Prof Smith said: "This needs to be very carefully checked, as
        there could be far more energy going in than the makers think."
      </p>
      <p>Prof Smith's views were echoed by Dr Riley, who said: "There's
        no doubt that there was a heat rise but I'd like to see a more
        thorough investigation of the electrical energy supplied into
        the cell." </p>
      <p>While many scientists are trying to solve the mystery of the
        thermal energy cell, its huge commercial potential has already
        caused interest. </p>
      <p>Cambridge Consultants, one of Britain's most prestigious
        technology consultancies, has teamed up with Mr Davies and his
        colleagues to develop a working prototype. "We've had a
        multi-disciplinary team working on this, and we're perplexed,"
        said Duncan Bishop, head of process development at Cambridge
        Consultants. </p>
      <p>"We are offering to risk-share on it, as it will need about
        £200,000 to prove the principle behind it." </p>
      <p>According to the Gardner Watts team, it will take about six
        months to carry out tests putting the reality of the effect
        beyond all doubt. The company then plans to develop a prototype
        capable of turning less than one kilowatt of electrical power
        into 10 kilowatts of heat. </p>
      <p>Mr Davies said: "The technology could be licensed by a company
        making household boilers for the domestic market. " He added
        that the plan is to have the first thermal energy cell devices
        on the market within two years. </p>

        <p><b>How This 12-inch Miracle Tube Could Halve Heating Bills</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Amazing British invention creates MORE energy than you put into
        it - and could soon be warming your home </p>
      <p>It sounds too good to be true - not to mention the fact that it
        violates almost every known law of physics. </p>
      <p>But British scientists claim they have invented a revolutionary
        device that seems to 'create' energy from virtually nothing. </p>
      <p>Their so-called thermal energy cell could soon be fitted into
        ordinary homes, halving domestic heating bills and making a
        major contribution towards cutting carbon emissions. </p>
      <p>Even the makers of the device are at a loss to explain exactly
        how it works - but sceptical independent scientists carried out
        their own tests and discovered that the 12in x 2in tube really
        does produce far more heat energy than the electrical energy put
        in. </p>
      <p>The device seems to break the fundamental physical law that
        energy cannot be created from nothing - but researchers believe
        it taps into a previously unrecognised source of energy, stored
        at a sub-atomic level within the hydrogen atoms in water. </p>
      <p>The system - developed by scientists at a firm called Ecowatts
        in a nondescript laboratory on an industrial estate at Lancing,
        West Sussex - involves passing an electrical current through a
        mixture of water, potassium carbonate (otherwise known as
        potash) and a secret liquid catalyst, based on chrome. </p>
      <p>This creates a reaction that releases an incredible amount of
        energy compared to that put in. If the reaction takes place in a
        unit surrounded by water, the liquid heats up, which could form
        the basis for a household heating system. </p>
      <p>If the technology can be developed on a domestic scale, it
        means consumers will need much less energy for heating and hot
        water - creating smaller bills and fewer greenhouse gases. </p>
      <p>Jim Lyons, of the University of York, independently evaluated
        the system. He said: 'Let's be honest, people are generally
        pretty sceptical about this kind of thing. Our team was happy to
        take on the evaluation, even if to prove it didn't work. </p>
      <p>'But this is a very efficient replacement for the traditional
        immersion heater. We have examined this interesting technology
        and when we got the rig operating, we were getting 150 to 200
        per cent more energy out than we put in, without trying too
        hard. </p>
      <p>People are sceptical - but somehow it works </p>
      <p>'We are still not clear about the science involved here,
        because the physics and chemistry are very different-to
        everything that has gone before. Our challenge now is to study
        the science and how it works.' </p>
      <p>The device has taken ten years of painstaking work by a small
        team at Ecowatts' tiny red-brick laboratory, and bosses predict
        a household version of their device will be ready to go on sale
        within the next 18 months. </p>
      <p>The project, which has cost the company £1.4million, has the
        backing of the Department of Trade and Industry, which is keen
        to help poorer families without traditional central heating or
        who cannot afford rocketing fuel bills. </p>
      <p>Ecowatts says the device will cost between £1,500 and £2,000,
        in line with the price of traditional systems. </p>
      <p>The development of the groundbreaking technology results from a
        chance meeting between Ecowatts chairman Chris Davies, his wife
        Jane and an Irish inventor, Christopher Eccles, while the couple
        were on holiday near Shannon in 1998. </p>
      <p>After the inventor showed the couple his laboratory
        experiments, Mrs Davies, immediately signed a £20,000 cheque on
        the bonnet of her car and handed it over to Mr Eccles. </p>
      <p>He later became chief scientist of Ecowatts' parent company
        Gardner Watts, but has since left after 'falling out' with the
        company, according to insiders. Sadly, Mrs Davies died three
        years ago, so she will be unable to share in the success of her
        husband's development of the idea. </p>
      <p>Mr Davies, now 75, of Dedham, Essex, was unavailable for
        comment last night. </p>
      <p>But Ecowatts chief executive Paul Calver said: 'When Jane
        Davies whipped out her cheque book, it turned out to be a very
        good investment indeed. </p>
      <p>'She and Chris were always interested in ecology and now it
        looks as if our heat exchanger system is ready to go on sale
        soon. We're producing a device in the next nine months to heat
        radiators. </p>
      <p>'Most British homes rely on gas, and the Government has
        admitted there is a problem getting a substitute. Our device
        will help solve that.' </p>
      <p>Sustainable energy expert Professor Saffa Riffat, of Nottingham
        University, has also led a team investigating the system. </p>
      <p>He said: 'The concept is very interesting and it could be a
        major breakthrough, but more tests are required. We will be
        doing further checks.' </p>

        <p><b>EcoWatts "Free Energy" Device Rebuffed, BBC Falls For It.</b>
        </p>

      <p>EcoWatts and its fake free energy gadget is back in the
        limelight again, with the BBC Breakfast Show falling hook, line,
        and sinker in an interview with the company's "CEO" Paul Calver.
        Calver stated that "we're still getting to the question of why
        it works," explaining to a BBC presenter his bewilderment at his
        very own creation. The response from the interviewer? "The point
        is it does." Unfortunately, the point is that it almost
        certainly doesn't. Ben Goldacre used his excellent Bad Science
        Guardian column this week to dig up some dirt on the dodgy
        company, and managed to find a scientist who gave his stamp of
        approval to a similar free energy gadget four years back: "Using
        the apparatus provided, it's true, this scientist could get
        incredible results: the meters would read zero, and yet water
        would boil in around five minutes. Because the meters provided
        weren't working." The company that provided this former gadget
        along with the "broken" meters? EcoWatts. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Methods and apparatus are described for releasing energy from
        hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms. An electrolyte is provided
        which has a catalyst therein suitable for initiating transitions
        of hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms in the electrolyte to a
        sub-ground energy state. A plasma discharge is generated in the
        electrolyte to release energy by fusing the atoms together. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to the generation of electricity,
        and more particularly to the release of hydrogen and fusion of
        light atomic nuclei. </p>
      <p>Normally, fusion processes are able to be initiated only at
        extremely high temperatures, as found in the vicinity of a
        nuclear fusion (uranium or plutonium) detonation. This is the
        principle of most thermonuclear bombs. Such a release of energy
        is impractical as a means of providing the power to generate
        electricity and heat for distribution, as it occurs too rapidly
        with too high a magnitude for it to be manageable. </p>
      <p>In recent years, many attempts have been made to initiate
        controlled fusion processes at high temperatures by the
        enclosure of a region of plasma-discharge within a confined
        space, such as a toroidal chamber, using electromagnetic
        restraint. Such attempts have met with little commercial success
        to date as systems which employ such a technique have so far
        consumed more energy than they have produced and are not
        continuous processes. </p>
      <p>Another approach which has been attempted in order to achieve
        fusion of light nuclei has been the so-called "cold fusion"
        technique, in which deuterium atoms have been induced to tunnel
        into the crystal lattice of a metal such as palladium during
        electrolysis. It is claimed that the atoms are forced together
        in the lattice, overcoming the repulsive electrostatic force.
        However, no clear and unambiguous demonstration of successful
        cold fusion has yet been presented publicly. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a method of releasing energy
        comprising the steps of providing an electrolyte having a
        catalyst therein, the catalyst being suitable for initiating
        transitions of hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms in the
        electrolyte to a sub-ground energy state, and generating a
        plasma discharge in the electrolyte. The applicants have
        determined that this method generates substantially more energy
        than the power input used to generate the plasma, whilst doing
        so in a controllable manner. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the plasma discharge is generated by applying a
        voltage across electrodes in the electrolyte and an intermittent
        voltage has proved particularly useful in increasing the level
        of energy generation. It also provides a means of controlling
        the process to maintain a consistent level of energy production
        over a significant period of time. </p>
      <p>The application of a voltage higher than necessary to generate
        plasma also is beneficial to the process and will be typically
        in the range of 50 V to 20,000 V and preferably between 300 V
        and 2,000 V, but may be higher than 20,000 V, whereas in
        conventional electrolysis techniques low voltages of about 3
        volts are used and applied continuously across the electrodes. </p>
      <p>The applied voltage may be DC or provided at a switching
        frequency of up to 100 KHz. The duty cycle of the applied
        voltage is preferably in the range of 0.5 to 0.001, but may be
        even lower than 0.001. During the pulse period a monomolecular
        layer of metal hydride may be formed at the cathode-Helmholtz
        layer interface and subsequently decays to form gas in the
        nascent state comprising comprising monoatomic hydrogen and/or
        deuterium. The waveform of the applied voltage may be
        substantially square shaped. Whilst application of DC to the
        electrode does produce the metal hydride and monoatomic hydrogen
        and/or deuterium, the use of a pulsed voltage has been found to
        be more efficient as most dissociation of the hydride then
        occurs between the pulses. </p>
      <p>In applications where the electrolyte is flowed past the
        electrodes it may be preferable to use two separate cathodes,
        the first of which will be engineered to optimize production of
        H/D atoms and the second of which will provide the plasma
        discharge. In this instance the direction of flow of the
        electrolyte is from first to second cathode. The design of the
        apparatus seeks to direct the flow of electrolyte to maximize
        contact of monoatomic H or D atoms with the plasma. The
        characteristics and magnitude of the voltages applied to each
        cathode are preferably similar, but may have different duty
        periods. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the cathode design and applied
        voltage are such as to provide a current density of 400,000 amps
        per square meter or even greater. More preferably, the current
        density at the cathode is 50,000 amps per square meter or above.
      </p>
      <p>In carrying out a preferred method in accordance with the
        invention, it has been found that the process may be assisted by
        initial heating of the electrolyte, which may be water or a salt
        solution, prior to applying electrical input to the vessel. A
        temperature in the range of 40 to 100 C, or more preferably 40°
        to 80° C, has been found to be particularly beneficial. </p>
      <p>The ratio of water to deuterium oxide (D2)) in the electrolyte
        may be varied to control the energy generation. In some
        circumstances it may be preferable to use "light" water H<sub>2</sub>O
        alone and in others to use D<sub>2</sub>O alone. Additionally,
        the amount of catalyst added to the electrolyte may be varied as
        a controlling factor and preferably lies in the range of 1 to 20
        mMol. </p>
      <p>In preferred embodiments, the method includes the step of
        generating a magnetic field in the region of the electrodes. The
        intensity and/or frequency of the current used to generate the
        field may be adjusted to move the plasma discharge away from the
        electrode from which it is struck in order to minimize erosion
        and extend the operating life of the system. Only slight
        separation may be required to achieve this effect. </p>
      <p>In further preferred embodiments, the heat generated by the
        process may be removed and utilized by way of a number of known
        and proven technologies including the circulation of the
        electrolyte through a heat exchanger, or using heat pipes to
        produce heating, or alternatively to produce electricity using a
        pressurized steam cycle or a low-boiling-point fluid turbine
        cycle, or by other means. </p>
      <p>The present invention further provides apparatus for carrying
        out methods discloded herein comprising an anode, first and
        second cathodes, a reaction vessel having an inlet and an
        outlet, means for feeding an electrolyte through the vessel from
        its inlet to its outlet, the electrolyte having a catalyst
        therein suitable for initiating transitions of H and/or D atoms
        in the electrolyte to a sub-ground energy state, menas for
        applying a voltage across the anode and the first cathode to
        form H and/or D atoms, and means for applying a voltage across
        the anode and second cathode to generate a plasma discharge from
        the first cathode. </p>
      <p>During the methods described herein, atoms of H and/or D are
        believed to undergo a fundamental change in their structure by
        exchange of photons with salts in solution. The applicants
        believe that this change, and the observed phenomena, can be
        explained as set out below. </p>
      <p>It is well known that a system comprising a spherical shell of
        charge (the electron path) located around an atomic nucleus
        constitutes a resonant cavity. Resonant systems act as the
        repository of photon energy of discrete frequencies. The
        absorption of photon energy by a resonant system excites the
        system to a higher-energy state. For any spherical resonant
        cavity, the relationship between a permitted radius and the
        wavelength of the absorbed photon is: </p>
      <p>2 pi r = n lambda </p>
      <p>(pi = 3.14...) <br>
        where n is an integer <br>
        and lambda is the wavelength </p>
      <p>For non-radiating or stable states, the relationship between
        the electron wavelength and the allowed radii is: </p>
      <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 pi [nr<sub>1</sub>] = 2 pi r<sub>(n)</sub> =
        n lambda<sub>(1)</sub> = lambda<sub>(n)</sub> </p>
      <p>where n = 1 <br>
        or n = 2, 3, 4... <br>
        or n = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... </p>
      <p>and lambda<sub>(1)</sub> = the allowed wavelength for n = 1 <br>
        r<sub>(1)</sub> = the allowed radius for n = 1 </p>
      <p>In a hydrogen atom (and the following applies equally to a D
        atom), the ground state electron-path radius can be defined as
        r(0). There is normally no spontaneous photon emission from a
        ground state atom and thus there must be a balance between the
        centripetal and the electric forces present. Thus: </p>
      <p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; [ m<sub>(e)</sub> . v<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> ]
        / r<sub>(0)</sub>= Ze<sup>2</sup> / ( 4 pi . epsilon<sub>(0)</sub>
        . r<sub>(0)</sub><sup>2</sup> ) </p>
      <p>where m<sub>(e)</sub> = electron rest mass <br>
        v<sub>1</sub> = ground state electron velocity <br>
        e = elementary charge <br>
        epsilon<sub>(0)</sub> = electric constant (sometimes referred to
        as the permitivity of free space) <br>
        Z = atomic number (for H, 1) </p>
      <p>Looking first at the excited (higher energy) states, where the
        hydrogen atom has absorbed photons of discrete
        wavelength/frequency (and hence energy), the system is again
        stable and normally non-radiating, and to maintain force
        balance, the effective nuclear charge becomes Zeff = Z/n, and
        the balance equation becomes: </p>
      <p>(4)&nbsp; [ m<sub>(e)</sub> . v<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> ] / nr<sub>(0)</sub>
        = [ e<sup>2</sup> / n ] </p>
      <p>where n = integer value of excited state (1, 2, 3...) <br>
        v<sub>n</sub> = electron velocity in the nth excited state. </p>
      <p>He absorption of radiation by an atom thus results in an
        excited state which may decay to ground state, spontaneously, or
        be triggered to do so, resulting in the re-release of a quantum
        of energy in the form of a photon. In any system consisting of a
        large number of atoms, transitions between states are occurring
        continuously and randomly and this activity gives rise to the
        observable spectra of emitted radiation from H. </p>
      <p>Each value of n corresponds to a transition which is permitted
        to occur when a resonant photon is absorbed by the atom. Integer
        values of n represent the absorption of energy by the atom. </p>
      <p>Fractional values of are allowed by the relationship between
        the standing wavelength of the electron and the radius of the
        electron-path, given by (2), above. To maintain force balance,
        transitions involving fractional values for n must effectively
        increase the nuclear charge Z to a figure Z<sub>eff</sub>, and
        reduce the radius of the electron-path accordingly. This is
        equivalent to the atom emitting a photon of energy while in the
        accepted ground state, effecting a transition to a sub-ground
        state. Because the accepted ground state is a very stable one,
        such transitions are rarely encountered but the applicants have
        discovered that they can be induced if the atom is in close
        proximity to another system which acts as a "receptor-site" for
        the exact energy quantum required to effect the transition. </p>
      <p>The emission of energy by a hydrogen atom in this way is not
        limited to a single transition "down" from ground state, but can
        occur repetitively and, possibly, transitions from 1/3, 1/4,
        1/5, etc. states may occur as a single event if the energy
        balance of the atom and the catalytic system is favorable. Of
        course, the usual uncertainty principles forbid the
        determination of the behavior of any individual atom, but
        statistical rules govern the properties of any macroscopic
        (&gt;10<sup>9</sup>) quanta system. </p>
      <p>When a "ground-state" hydrogen atom emits a photon of around 27
        eV, the transition occurs to the ao/2state as demonstrated above
        and the effective nuclear charge increases to +2e. A new
        electron path radius is reduced. The potential energy of the
        atom in its reduced-radius state is given by </p>
      <p>V = -{ Z<sub>(eff)</sub>e<sup>2</sup> / [ 4 pi epsilon<sub>(o)</sub>
        (a<sub>(o)</sub> / 2)]} = - { 4 x 27.178} = -108.7 eV </p>
      <p>The kinetic energy, T, of the reduced electron path is given by
      </p>
      <p>T = - [ V / 2 ] = 54.35 eV </p>
      <p>Similarly, it can be seen that the kinetic energy of the ground
        sate electron path is about 13.6 eV. Thus there is a net change
        in energy of about 41 eV for the transition: </p>
      <p>H{ Z<sub>(eff)</sub> = 1 ; r = a<sub>(o)</sub> } to H{ Z<sub>(eff)</sub>
        = 2 ; r = a<sub>(o)</sub> / 2 ] </p>
      <p>That is to say, of this 41 eV, about 27 eV is emitted as the
        catalytic transfer of energy occurs, and the remaining 14 eV is
        emitted on restabilization to the force balance. </p>
      <p>The radial "ground-state" can be considered as a superposition
        of Fourier components. If integral Fourier components of energy
        equal to m x 27.2 eV are removed, the positive electric path
        inside the electron path radius increases by </p>
      <p>(m) x 1.602 x 10<sup>-19</sup>C </p>
      <p>The resultant electric field is a time-harmonic solution of the
        Laplace equations in spherical coordinates. In the case of the
        reduced-radius H atom, the radius at which force balance and the
        non-radiative condition are achieved is given by </p>
      <p>R<sub>(m)</sub> = a<sub>(o)</sub> / [m+1 ] </p>
      <p>Where m is an integer. </p>
      <p>From the energy change equations given above, it will be
        appreciated that, in decaying to this radius from the so-called
        "ground-state", the atom emits a total energy equal to </p>
      <p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; [ ( m + 1 )<sup>2</sup> - 1<sup>2</sup> ] x
        13.59 eV </p>
      <p>The applicants have found that such energy emissions as take
        place according to (5), above, only appear to occur when the H
        or D is found in the monoatomic (or so-called "nascent") state.
        Molecular H might be made to behave similarly, but the
        transition is more difficult to achieve owing to the higher
        energies involved. </p>
      <p>In order to achieve the transition in monoatomic H or D, it is
        necessary to accumulate the molecular form in the gas phase on a
        substrate such as nickel (Ni) or tungsten (W) which favors the
        dissociation of the molecule. As well as being dissociated into
        the monoatomic form, the H or D should be bound to the catalytic
        system to initiate the reaction. The preferred method of
        achieving this is by electrolysis using cathode material which
        favors dissociation. </p>
      <p>The applicants have discovered that the catalytic systems which
        encourage transitions to sub-ground-state energies are those
        which offer a near-perfect energy couple to the [ m x 27.2 ] eV
        needed to "flip" the atom of H or D. It appears from experiment
        that the effective sink of energy provided by the catalyst need
        not be precisely equal to that emitted by the atom. Successful
        transitions have been achieved when there is an error of a s
        much as +- 2% between the energy emitted by the atom and that
        absorbed by the catalytic system. One possible explanation for
        this is that, in a macroscopic sized system, although the
        transitions are initiated by a close match in energy level, such
        discrepancies as arise are manifested as an overall loss or gain
        in the kinetic energies of the recipient ionic systems. It is
        thought that spectroscopic analysis of active H or D catalytic
        systems may provide evidence of this. </p>
      <p>One catalyst that has been found to initiate the transition to
        the ao/n state is rubidium in the Rb+ ionic species. If a salt
        of Rb, such as the carbonate Rb<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is
        dissolved in either water or deuterium oxide (heavy water), a
        substantial dissociation into Rb+ and (CO<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2</sup>-
        ions takes place. If the Rb+ ions are bound closely to
        monoatomic H or D, the transition to the ao/n state is
        encouraged by the removal of a further electron from the Rb ion,
        by provision of its second ioization energy of about 27.28eV.
        Thus: </p>
      <p>Rb<sup>+</sup> +H { a<sub>(o)</sub> / p ] +27.28 eV&nbsp;
        --&gt; </p>
      <p>Rb<sup>2</sup>+ + e<sup>-</sup> +H { a<sub>(o)</sub> / [ p = 1]
        } + { [ ( p + 1 )<sup>2</sup> -p<sup>2</sup> ] x 13.59 } eV </p>
      <p>Where p represents an integral number of such transitions for
        any given H and D atom and by spontaneous re-association: </p>
      <p>Rb<sup>2</sup>+ + e<sup>-</sup> = Rb<sup>+</sup> +27.28 eV </p>
      <p>Thus, the Rb catalyst remains unchanged in the reaction and
        there is a net yield of energy per transition. </p>
      <p>Other catalytic systems can be used which have ionization
        energies approximating to [ m x 27.2 ] eV, such as titanium in
        the form of Ti<sup>2+</sup> ions&nbsp; and potassium in the form
        of K+ ions. </p>
      <p>The applicants believe that the above explanation is consistent
        with currently accepted quantum theory as discussed below. </p>
      <p>Commencing with the equations of Rydberg and Scroedinger it can
        be shown that fractional numbers for the quantum theory energy
        states in H yield possible transitions which result in emissions
        at frequencies which are in accord with observed UV and X-ray
        spectra. It is therefore possible that the conditions conducive
        to initiating such transitions may be artificially reproduced in
        the laboratory under certain circumstances. </p>
      <p>The Rydberg formula for the frequency of emitted radiation from
        a transition in monoatomic H is: </p>
      <p>V = R<sub>(h)</sub>c( 1 / n<sub>(2)</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1 / n<sub>(1)</sub><sup>2</sup>
        ) </p>
      <p>Where: </p>
      <p>V is the frequency of the emitted photon <br>
        R<sub>(h)</sub> is the Rydberg constant, 1.097373 c 10<sup>7</sup>
        m<sup>-1</sup> </p>
      <p>C is the speed of light in vacuo, 2.997 x 10<sup>3</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p>n<sub>(1)</sub>, n<sub>(2)</sub> are the transition states. </p>
      <p>It can be seen from the above that, if the resultant energy
        state of the H atom is that which requires n<sub>(2)</sub> to be
        equal to 1/2 , emissions will occur which are of higher
        frequency than the observed Lyman 2-1 transition in the
        ultra-violet at 2.467 x 1<sup>o15</sup> Hz (about 121 nm). There
        is, indeed, an observed emission at a wavelength of about 30.8
        nm, which appears to be confirmed by recent studies of galactic
        cluster emissions by Bohringer, <i>et al</i>. (<i>Scientific
          American</i>, January 1999) and it is difficult for the
        inventor to conceive of any other quantum-mechanical event which
        would give rise to such an emission, other than a transition, in
        accord with the above theory, from 1 to 1/2 in nascent H. </p>
      <p>As can be seen from the above use of the standard Rydbberg
        equation, such behavior of H in the monoatomic state views the
        conventional H "ground-state" as one of many stable
        electronically-preferred states for single H atoms. </p>
      <p>To summarize, a proliferation of H or D atoms is produced which
        may have had significantly diminished electron-path-radii by
        virtue of exchange of photons with their envronment. These atoms
        appear to be relatively unreactive chemically and appear not to
        readily take the molecular form H-H or D-D. This is a fortunate
        property which has significance and enables fusion pathways, as
        described below. </p>
      <p>The fusion of light nuclei, H and D, to form heavier elements
        such as He is one which has traditionally been encouraged by
        subjecting the reactants to extremes of temperature and
        pressure. This has been necessary because there is a large
        electric charge barrier to overcome in order to bring nuclei
        close enough for fusion to occur. </p>
      <p>Using atoms with a diminished electron path radius, adjacent
        nuclei may experience a corresponding reduction in electric
        barrier and internuclear separations may become smaller. With
        reductions in internuclear separation, fusion processes become
        more probable, and more easily occasioned. </p>
      <p>There are two principle fusion pathways for D atoms. The first
        is: </p>
      <p><sub>1</sub>D<sup>2</sup> + <sub>1</sub>D<sup>2</sup> = <sub>2</sub>He<sup>3</sup>
        + <sub>1</sub>n<sup>0</sup> </p>
      <p>where two D nuclei fuse to produce an isotope of He and a free
        neutron, which subsequently decays (half-life 6.48 x 10<sup>2</sup>
        S), with emission of a beta particle of medium energy (about 0.8
        MeV), and a type of neutrino, to become a stable proton. </p>
      <p>The second is: </p>
      <p><sub>1</sub>D<sup>2</sup> + <sub>1</sub>D<sup>2</sup> = <sub>1</sub>T<sup>3</sup>
        + <sub>1</sub>H<sup>1</sup> </p>
      <p>where the two D nuclei fuse to produce the isotope of H known
        as tritium (T) and a free stable proton. The tritium eventually
        decays (half-life 12.3 years), with emission of a beta particle
        of very low energy (about 0.018 MeV), to become <sub>2</sub>He<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Of the two, the second fusion path is preferred for the
        peaceful exploitation of its energy yield, because the fusion
        products are relatively harmless on production, and decay to
        completely innocuous species within a short time, emitting
        radiation which can be effectively shielded by a thin sheet of
        aluminum foil or by 10 mm of acrylic plastic, for example. </p>
      <p>When D nuclei are forced together under high temperature and
        pressure conditions (as in a thermonuclear bomb), there is a
        greater than 50% probability for the first pathway to be the
        dominant one. This is because the high temperature process takes
        no account of nuclear alignment at the point of fusion. It is
        actually a matter of focusing nuclei together indiscriminately
        and hoping that enough fuse to produce an explosion. The
        applicants believe, however, in accord with established theory,
        that it is the alignment of the nuclei with respect to the
        charges in each nucleus which ultimately determines the
        favorable fusion path. </p>
      <p>In order to achieve a higher probability for the second, less
        hazardous pathway, the approaching nuclei need to have time to
        align electrostatically such that the proton-proton separation
        is at a maximum. This can only be achieved at far lower energies
        than those found in a thermonuclear bomb. By the use of entities
        with diminished electron-path-radii, and correspondingly
        potentially smaller internuclear distances, fusion can be
        initiated at lower temperatures (and consequently lower
        energies), allowing for the charge-related alignment necessary
        to achieve a high probability for the second, tritium-forming,
        pathway. By introducing D of diminished electron-path-radius
        into the plasma discharge which is confined within the water in
        the vessel itself, fusion may be initiated. Temperatures of the
        order of 6000° K are obtained within certain plasma discharges
        and this, coupled with multiple quantum transitions to produce D
        of diminished electron-path-radius, produces a substantial yield
        of energy from the two-stage process. </p>
      <p>Another possible but less likely fusion pathway for hydrogen
        atoms is: </p>
      <p><sub>1</sub>H<sup>1</sup> + <sub>1</sub>H<sup>1</sup> = <sub>1</sub>D<sup>2</sup>
        + Beta<sup>+</sup> + tau </p>
      <p>whereby Beta<sup>+</sup> is produced as one of the products. </p>

      <p>The apparatus of Figure 1 enables the generation of energy
        according to the principles of the invention in the laboratory.
        Any risk of thermal runaway is minimized whilst demonstrating
        that the level of energy release from the two stages is far in
        excess of that which would result from any purely chemical or
        electrochemical activity. It also enables easy calorimetry, safe
        ducting away of off-gases, and of subsequent extraction of
        liquid for titration (to demonstrate that no chemical action
        takes place during the operation of the apparatus). </p>
      <p>A 250 ml beaker is provided with a glass quilt or expanded
        polystyrene surround 6 to act as insulation. This can include an
        inspection cut-out so that the area around the cathode 9 can be
        observed from outside. The beaker contains 200 ml of water, into
        which is dissolved a small quantity of potassium carbonate so as
        to give a solution of approximately 2 mMol strength. A platinum
        wire 1 is earthed to the laboratory reference ground plane. The
        anode 10, a sheet of platinum foil of approximately 10 mm2 in
        area, is attached to this wire by mechanical crimping. A digital
        thermometer 2 is inserted into the liquid in the vessel. A 0.25
        mm diameter tungsten wire cathode 9 is sheathed in borosilicate
        glass or ceramic tube 4 and sealed at the end immersed in the
        electrolyte so as to expose 10 mm to 20 mm of wire in contact
        with the liquid. The entire assembly of lead wires and the
        thermometer is carried by an acrylic plate 5 which enables of
        easy dismantling and inspection of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>A supply of up to 360 volts DC, capable of supplying up to 2
        amperes, is arranged external to the described apparatus. The
        positive terminal of this supply is connected to one pole of an
        isolated high-voltage switching unit. The other pole of the
        switch is connected to the tungsten wire cathode 9 externally of
        the apparatus. </p>
      <p>To operate the apparatus, the solution 8 is initially brought
        up to between 40° C and 80° C either by preheating outside the
        apparatus or by passing power through a heating element in the
        solution (not shown). When the solution is between these
        temperatures it is either transferred to the above apparatus or,
        if a heating element is used, this is turned off. </p>
      <p>With all connections made as described, the switch is set to
        operate at a duty cycle of 1% and a pulse repetition frequency
        of 100 Hz. It will be seen through the inspection cut-out that
        an intense plasma-arc is intermittently struck under the water
        at or near the cathode. If equipment is available to monitor the
        current drawn, it will be seen that the system consumes in the
        region of 1 watt when the switching circuit is operating. It
        will be seen by the rapid rise in temperature in the apparatus
        that far more energy is being released than can be accounted for
        by the electrical input. As a comparison, a heater element can
        be substituted for the electrodes and operated at 1 watt and the
        effects observed. There is really no need for sophisticated
        calorimetry to verify that large quantities of energy are being
        released close to the cathode of the equipment, such is the
        magnitude of the reaction for the process, as compared to a test
        with a resistive heating element of the same input power. </p>
      <p>The data obtained from a representative one-hour session with
        this apparatus is shown in Table 1, below: </p>

      <p>It can be seen from this table that the total energy input
        during this test was measured at 1820 J and, taking as a rough
        guideline that 200 ml of water requires the input of 838 J of
        energy to raise it by 1° C, then by direct heating the water
        would be expected to rise by some 2° C, bearing in mind
        radiative losses. In fact, during the experiment the water
        temperature was raised from 39.2° C to 93.6° C and considerable
        steam was also liberated. Furthermore, the calculated energy
        output of 134196 J does not take account of secondary effects
        such as light-energy output and Faradaic electrolysis </p>
      <p>A system suitable for operating the apparatus of Figure 1 is
        illustrated in block diagram in Figure 2. A pulse generator 20
        supplies a variable duty-cycle pulse waveform to to a
        high-voltage switch unit 22. The pulse waveform may be monitored
        on an oscilloscope 24 and its repetition frequency is displayed
        on a first frequency counter 26. A second frequency counter 28
        is provided to monitor the clock speed of the switch unit 22.
        Power supply 30 is operable to apply a voltage between 0 and 360
        V to an electrode of the apparatus 12, shown in Figure 1. The
        voltage level may be read from a digital multimeter 32. The RMS
        voltage across the electrodes 9 and 10 is indicated on a
        multimeter 34 and the RMS current passing between the electrodes
        is shown on another multimeter 36, by measuring the voltages
        developed across a 1 ohm resistor 37. The temperature in the
        apparatus 12 is indicated on a dip temperature probe 38. The
        switch unit 22 may be bypassed by a push button switch 39 to
        apply a constant voltage across the electrodes. </p>
      <p>A circuit diagram of the switch unit 22 is shown in Figure 3.
        In the system of Figure 2, input 40 is connected to the output
        of pulse generator 20. The output 42 of the switch unit is
        connected to the cathode of the apparatus 12. Two NAND gates 44
        and 46 are two fourths of a Schmitt-trigger 2 input NAND gate
        chip type 4093. NAND gate 44 operates as an astable
        multivibrator, with its repetition frequency set by a preset
        resistor 45. The output of gate 44 is fed to one in-out of NAND
        gate 46, the other input forming circuit input 40. The output of
        NAND gate 46 is connected to a three-transistor amplifier
        consisting of transistors 48, 50 and 52. The amplifier is in
        turn connected to one end of the primary of a transformer 54,
        the other end being connected to earth. The transformer output
        is fed to a bridge rectifier formed from diodes 56, 58, 60 and
        62. </p>
      <p>The rectifier output is fed via a resistor 64 to the gate of an
        insulated gate bipolar transistor 6 (IGBT). The load of the
        apparatus 12 is connected in the drain circuit of the IGBT. A 15
        kV diode 68 is connected between the drain and the source of the
        IGBT 66 to protect&nbsp; the IGBT from the sizeable EMI
        emissions from the plasma discharges in the apparatus 12 and
        avoids damage to this sensitive semiconductor. A further diode
        70 is provided between the drain of the IGBT and the circuit
        output 42 to act as an EMI blocker in a similar way. A standard
        20 mm 5 amp quick-blow fuse 69 is connected between the source
        of the IGBT and ground in order to protect the device against
        over-current. </p>
      <p>The operation of the circuit of Figure 3 is as follows. The
        repetition frequency in NAND gate 44 is preferably set to
        between 4 and 6 MHz. Pulse generator 20 is adjusted to set the
        duty of the switching. On receipt of an external pulse from the
        generator, NAND gate 46 passes a packet of 4 to 6 MHz square
        waves to the amplifier. The amplifier has considerable current
        gain and enable the primary of the transformer 54 to be driven
        resonantly with the RC circuit formed by capacitor 72 and
        resistor 74 which are connected in parallel therewith. The
        transformer 54 has a step-up ratio of 2:1 and a 4 to 6 MHz
        signal of approximately 19 volts appears across the bridge
        rectifier. The impedance of the rectifier output is essentially
        determined by a parallel resistor 76, such that the switch-on
        and switch-off time of the IGBT 66 is very fast. Thus, there is
        never a point in the operation of the device when it is
        dissipating any measurable power. The load of the apparatus 12
        is placed in the drain circuit of the IGBT, which is therefore
        operating in "common-source" mode to ensure that its source
        terminal never rises above the high-side ground potential. This,
        again, is a configuration which uses excess input power. This
        circuit ensures a rise time of the switched waveform which isles
        than 10 nS and a fall time which can be as low as 30 nS at
        modest supply voltages. </p>

      <p>A second apparatus for carrying out the invention is
        illustrated in Figure 4. This apparatus comprises a tubular
        chamber 80, which may be constructed from a nonmagnetic metal or
        metal alloy material such as, but not exclusively, aluminum or
        Duralumin, or alternatively may be constructed from a
        non-permeable ceramic material or from borosilicate glass. The
        tubular chamber 80 is constructed in flanged form to allow of
        its incorporation into a system of pipework via flanges 82 and
        84 and gaskets 86. Entering the chamber 80 are two electrodes,
        the cathode 88 being shaped so as to present a circular plate
        opposite the cathode 88. The distance between the cathode tip
        and the anode plate should be approximately equal to the radius
        of the chamber 80. The cathode may be constructed from tungsten,
        zirconium, stainless steel, nickel or tantalum, or any other
        metallic or conductive ceramic material which may contribute to,
        or occasion, the dissociative process described above. The anode
        may be constructed from platinum, palladium, rhodium or any
        other inert material which does not undergo any significant
        level of chemical interaction with the electrolyte. </p>
      <p>Surrounding the chamber 80, and concentric with it, is a
        winding 98 of enameled copper or silver wire of diameter 0.1 to
        0.8 mm consisting of up to several thousand turns of the wire.
        The purpose of this winding is to create an axial magnetic field
        inside the chamber 80. </p>
      <p>Electrolyte comprising deuterium oxide, in combination with
        ordinary "light" water in varying proportions, and containing
        high-molarity salts of, but not exclusively of, potassium,
        rubidium or lithium, or combinations of such salts, is pumped
        through the chamber 80, in a direction such that the anode is
        downstream of the cathode. </p>
      <p>The anode lead wire 96 is connected to the ground plane or zero
        volts. The cathode 88 is connected to a variable source of
        between 50 and preferably 2000 volts negative with respect to
        the grounded anode 94, but may be couple to a voltage of up to
        several tens of thousands of volts negative with respect to such
        anode 94. To enhance performance of the invention, the negative
        voltage may be supplied in the form of pulses having a duty
        cycle between 0.001 and 0.5 </p>
      <p>The winding 98 is energized with an alternating voltage such as
        to provide a current flow of typically between 0.5 and 1.5 amps
        initially. The frequency of the applied alternating voltage
        should be variable from DC up to 15 KHz and may, in addition, be
        synchronous with pulses applied to the cathode 88. </p>
      <p>Under these conditions, a plasma arc will strike close to the
        cathode 88. The intensity and frequency of the current flowing
        in winding 98 may be adjusted to provide for the removal of the
        plasma arc from the immediate vicinity of the cathode 88 to
        avoid excessive evaporation of the material from the cathode 88.
      </p>
      <p>The volume of electrolyte pumped through chamber 80 and past
        the plasma arc may be varied such as to stabilize the
        temperature of such electrolyte in a closed system at below its
        boiling point. </p>
      <p>Heat may be extracted from the electrolyte by passing it
        through a heat exchanger before its re-introduction into the
        chamber 80. Provision may be made to top-off the water-deuterium
        content of the electrolyte as this becomes depleted by operation
        of the apparatus. The system may operate at a range of pressures
        to facilitate heat removal. </p>
      <p>A further apparatus for carrying out the invention, similar to
        that of Figure 4, is shown in Figure 5 on a scale of
        approximately 1:2:5. It comprises a borosilicate reaction tube
        100 supported at one end on a machined nylon support bridge 102.
        A second machined nylon element 104 is mounted across the other
        end of the tube. The bridge 102 and element 104 are clamped
        against the tube 100 by 8 mm threaded stainless steel studs 110.
      </p>
      <p>A first cathode 106 is in the form of a nickel wire mesh. It is
        mounted towards one end of tube 100 on a stainless steel support
        108. Electrical connection to the first cathode 106 is via a
        PVS-sleeved wire (not shown). </p>
      <p>A second cathode 112 consists of a 0.5mm diameter length of
        tungsten wire provided within a drilled macor ceramic sheath
        114, which is in turn placed within a 10 mm stainless steel tube
        116. Tube 116 passes through the support 102 and has a perspex
        end cap 118 on the external end through which the second cathode
        112 passes. A PVC funnel 120 is provided around the second
        cathode and is tapered towards it, with the cathode tip adjacent
        the narrower open end thereof. The funnel is supported on
        sleeves 121 provided on the stainless steel support 108. </p>
      <p>The anode comprises a 0.25 mm diameter platinum wire 122 which
        is connected at one end within the tube 100 to a sheet of
        platinum foil 124. Like the second cathode 11s, the anode is
        provided within a 10 mm diameter stainless steel tube 126, which
        passes through nylon element 104 and is closed at its external
        end by a Perspex end cap 128. Platinum wire 122 passes through
        the end cap 128. </p>
      <p>A plasma deflection coil 130 is mounted within tube 100 between
        the anode 124 and cathodes 106, 112. Electrical power is fed to
        the coil via connectors 132. </p>
      <p>Electrolyte is supplied to the tube 100 via a brass inlet 134
        provided through the support bridge 102 and flows out through
        nylon element 104 via a brass outlet 136. An additional brass
        outlet 138 also is provided in nylon element 104 to allow the
        electrolyte to be sampled during operation of the apparatus.
        Fuse holders and cable connectors for the apparatus are provided
        in a unit 140 mounted on the support bridge 102. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of Figure 5 is operated in a similar manner to
        that of Figure 4, as discussed above. The primary distinction is
        that two cathodes 106, 112 are employed in place of a single
        cathode. In use, electrolyte is fed through the tube 100, past
        the electrodes, from inlet 134 to outlet 136. A pulsed voltage
        is applied to the first cathode 106 such that a layer of metal
        hydride is formed on its surface during the voltage pulses and
        subsequently dissociates to form nascent monoatomic H/D. The
        applied voltage characteristics are selected to optimize the
        production rate of the monoatomic H/D. These products are
        channeled toward the second cathode 112 by the funnel 120. A
        voltage is applied to the second cathode 112 to generate a
        plasma discharge thereat. </p>
      <p>The characteristics and magnitudes of the voltages applied to
        the first and second cathodes may be similar, but it may be
        advantageous for different duty periods to be employed for
        respective cathodes. This cathode arrangement with the second
        cathode downstream of the first seeks to maximize contact
        between the monoatomic H/D and the plasma and therefore the
        efficiency of the apparatus. This is further assisted by the
        funnel 120. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to the generation of
        energy, and more particularly to the release of energy as a
        result of both a state-transition in hydrogen and fusion of
        light atomic nuclei. </p>
      <p>[0002] Normally, fusion processes are able to be initiated only
        at extremely high temperatures, as found in the vicinity of a
        nuclear fusion (uranium or plutonium) detonation. This is the
        principle of most thermonuclear bombs. Such a release of energy
        is impractical as a means of providing the power to generate
        electricity and heat for distribution, as it occurs too rapidly
        with too high a magnitude for it to be manageable. </p>
      <p>[0003] In recent years, many attempts have been made to
        initiate controlled fusion processes at high temperatures by the
        enclosure of a region of plasma-discharge within a confined
        space, such as a toroidal chamber, using electromagnetic
        restraint. Such attempts have met with little commercial success
        to date as systems which employ such a technique have so far
        consumed more energy than they have produced and are not
        continuous processes. </p>
      <p>[0004] Another approach which has been attempted in order to
        achieve fusion of light nuclei has been the so-called "cold
        fusion" technique, in which deuterium atoms have been induced to
        tunnel into the crystal lattice of a metal such as palladium
        during electrolysis. It is claimed that the atoms are forced
        together in the lattice, overcoming the repulsive electrostatic
        force. However, no clear and unambiguous demonstration of
        successful cold fusion has yet been presented publicly. </p>
      <p>[0005] The present invention provides a method of releasing
        energy comprising the steps of providing an electrolyte having a
        catalyst therein, the catalyst being suitable for initiating
        transitions of hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms in the
        electrolyte to a sub-ground energy state, and generating a
        plasma discharge in the electrolyte. The applicants have
        determined that this method generates substantially more energy
        than the power input used to generate the plasma, whilst doing
        so in a controllable manner. </p>
      <p>[0006] Preferably, the plasma discharge is generated by
        applying a voltage across electrodes in the electrolyte and an
        intermittent voltage has proved particularly beneficial in
        increasing the level of energy generation. It also provides a
        means of controlling the process to maintain a consistent level
        of energy production over a significant period of time. </p>
      <p>[0007] The application of a voltage higher than that necessary
        to generate plasma is also beneficial to the process and will be
        typically in the range 50V to 20000V and preferably between 300
        and 2000V, but may be higher than 20000V, whereas in
        conventional electrolysis techniques low voltages of about 3
        volts are used and applied continuously across the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0008] The applied voltage may be DC or provided at a switching
        frequency of up to 100 kHz. The duty cycle of the applied
        voltage is preferably in the range 0.5 to 0.001, but may be even
        lower than 0.001. During the pulse period a monomolecular layer
        of metal hydride may be formed at the cathode-Helmholtz layer
        interface and subsequently decays to form gas in the nascent
        state comprising monatomic hydrogen and/or deuterium. The
        waveform of the applied voltage may be substantially square
        shaped. Whilst application of DC to the electrode does produce
        the metal hydride and monatomic hydrogen and/or deuterium, the
        use of a pulsed voltage has been found to be more efficient as
        most dissociation of the hydride then occurs between the pulses.
      </p>
      <p>[0009] In applications where the electrolyte is flowed past the
        electrodes it may be preferable to use two separate cathodes,
        the first of which will be engineered to optimise production of
        hydrogen/deuterium atoms and the second of which will provide
        the plasma discharge. In this instance the direction of flow of
        the electrolyte is from first to second cathode. The design of
        the apparatus seeks to direct the flow of electrolyte to
        maximise contact of monatomic hydrogen or deuterium atoms with
        the plasma. The characteristics and magnitudes of the voltages
        applied to each cathode are preferably similar, but may have
        different duty periods. </p>
      <p>[0010] In a preferred embodiment, the cathode design and
        applied voltage are such as to provide a current density of
        400,000 amps per square meter or even greater. More preferably,
        the current density at the cathode is 500,000 amps per square
        meter or above. </p>
      <p>[0011] In carrying out a preferred method in accordance with
        the invention, it has been found that the process may be
        assisted by initial heating of the electrolyte, which may be
        water or a salt solution, prior to applying electrical input to
        the vessel. A temperature in the range 40 to 100.degree. C., or
        more preferably 40 to 80.degree. C., has been found to be
        particularly beneficial. </p>
      <p>[0012] The ratio of water to deuterium oxide (D.sub.2O) in the
        electrolyte may be varied to control the energy generation. In
        some circumstances it may be preferable to use "light" water
        H.sub.2O alone and in others to use D.sub.2O alone.
        Additionally, the amount of catalyst added to the electrolyte
        may be varied as a controlling factor and preferably lies in the
        range 1 to 20 mMol. </p>
      <p>[0013] In preferred embodiments, the method includes the step
        of generating a magnetic field in the region of the electrodes.
        The intensity and/or frequency of the current used to generate
        the field may be adjusted to move the plasma discharge away from
        the electrode from which it is struck in order to minimise
        erosion and extend the operating life of the system. Only slight
        separation may be required to achieve this effect. </p>
      <p>[0014] In further preferred embodiments, the heat generated by
        the process may be removed and utilised by way of a number of
        known and proven technologies including the circulation of the
        electrolyte through a heat exchanger, or using heat pipes to
        produce heating, or alternatively to produce electricity using a
        pressurised steam cycle or a low-boiling-point fluid turbine
        cycle, or by other means. </p>
      <p>[0015] The present invention further provides apparatus for
        carrying out methods disclosed herein comprising an anode, first
        and second cathodes, a reaction vessel having an inlet and an
        outlet, means for feeding an electrolyte through the vessel from
        its inlet to its outlet, the electrolyte having a catalyst
        therein suitable for initiating transitions of hydrogen and/or
        deuterium atoms in the electrolyte to a sub-ground energy state,
        means for applying a voltage across the anode and the first
        cathode to form hydrogen and/or deuterium atoms, and means for
        applying a voltage across the anode and second cathode to
        generate a plasma discharge in the electrolyte, the second
        cathode being downstream from the first cathode. </p>
      <p>[0016] During the methods described herein, atoms of hydrogen
        and/or deuterium are believed to undergo a fundamental change in
        their structure by exchange of photons with salts in solution.
        The applicants believe that this change, and the observed
        phenomena, can be explained as set out below. </p>
      <p>[0017] It is well known that a system comprising a spherical
        shell of charge (the electron path) located around an atomic
        nucleus constitutes a resonant cavity. Resonant systems act as
        the repository of photon energy of discrete frequencies. The
        absorbtion of energy by a resonant system excites the system to
        a higher-energy state. For any spherical resonant cavity, the
        relationship between a permitted radius and the wavelength of
        the absorbed photon is: </p>
      <p>2.pi.r=n.lambda. </p>
      <p>[0018] where n is an integer </p>
      <p>[0019] and .lambda. is the wavelength </p>
      <p>[0020] For non-radiating or stable states, the relationship
        between the electron wavelength and the allowed radii is: </p>
      <p>2.pi.[nr.sub.1]=2.pi.r.sub.(n)=n.lambda..sub.(1)=.lambda..sub.(n)
(2)










      </p>
      <p>[0021] where </p>
      <p>[0022] n=1 </p>
      <p>[0023] or </p>
      <p>[0024] n=2, 3, 4 . . . </p>
      <p>[0025] or p1 n=1/2, 1/3, 1/4 </p>
      <p>[0026] and </p>
      <p>[0027] .lambda..sub.(1)=the allowed wavelength for n=1 </p>
      <p>[0028] r.sub.(1)=the allowed radius for n=1 </p>
      <p>[0029] In a hydrogen atom (and the following applies equally to
        a deuterium atom), the ground state electron-path radius can be
        defined as r.sub.(O). This is sometimes referred to as the Bohr
        radius, a.sub.O. There is normally no spontaneous photon
        emission from a ground state atom and thus there must be a
        balance between the centripetal and the electric forces present.
        Thus: </p>
      <p>[m.sub.(e).v.sub.1.sup.2]/r.sub.(O)=Ze.sup.2/(4.pi...epsilon..sub.(O).r.su-
b.(O).sup.2)










        (3) </p>
      <p>[0030] where </p>
      <p>[0031] m.sub.(e)=electron rest mass </p>
      <p>[0032] v.sub.1=ground state electron velocity </p>
      <p>[0033] e=elementary charge </p>
      <p>[0034] .epsilon..sub.(O)=electric constant (sometimes referred
        to as the permittivity of free space) </p>
      <p>[0035] Z=atomic number (for hydrogen, 1) </p>
      <p>[0036] Looking first at the excited (higher energy) states,
        where the hydrogen atom has absorbed photon(s) of discrete
        wavelength/frequency (and hence energy), the system is again
        stable and normally non-radiating, and to maintain force
        balance, the effective nuclear charge becomes Z.sub.eff=Z/n, and
        the balance equation becomes: </p>
      <p>[m.sub.(e).v.sub.n.sup.2]/nr.sub.(O)=[e.sup.2/n]/(4.pi...epsilon..sub.(O).-
[nr.sub.(O)].sup.2)










        (4) </p>
      <p>[0037] where </p>
      <p>[0038] n=integer value of excited state (1, 2, 3 . . . ) </p>
      <p>[0039] v.sub.n=electron velocity in the nth excited state </p>
      <p>[0040] The absorbtion of radiation by an atom thus results in
        an excited state which may decay to ground state, or to a lower
        excited state, spontaneously, or be triggered to do so,
        resulting in the re-release of a quantum of energy in the form
        of a photon. In any system consisting of a large number of
        atoms, transitions between states are occurring continuously and
        randomly and this activity gives rise to the observable spectra
        of emitted radiation from hydrogen. </p>
      <p>[0041] Each value of n corresponds to a transition which is
        permitted to occur when a resonant photon is absorbed by the
        atom. Integer values of n represent the absorbtion of energy by
        the atom. </p>
      <p>[0042] Fractional values for n are allowed by the relationship
        between the standing wavelength of the electron and the radius
        of the electron-path, given by (2), above. To maintain force
        balance, transitions involving fractional values for n must
        effectively increase the nuclear charge Z to a figure Z.sub.eff,
        and reduce the radius of the electron-path accordingly. This is
        equivalent to the atom emitting a photon of energy while in the
        accepted ground state, effecting a transition to a sub-ground
        state. Because the accepted ground state is a very stable one,
        such transitions are rarely encountered but the applicants have
        discovered that they can be induced if the atom is in close
        proximity to another system which acts as a "receptor-site" for
        the exact energy quantum required to effect the transition. </p>
      <p>[0043] The emission of energy by a hydrogen atom in this way is
        not limited to a single transition "down" from ground state, but
        can occur repetitively and, possibly, transitions to 1/3, 1/4,
        1/5 etc states may occur as a single event if the energy balance
        of the atom and the catalytic system is favourable. Of course,
        the usual uncertainty principles forbid the determination of the
        behaviour of any individual atom, but statistical rules govern
        the properties of any macroscopic (&gt;10.sup.9 quanta) system.
      </p>
      <p>[0044] When a "ground-state" hydrogen atom emits a photon of
        around 27 eV, the transition occurs to the a.sub.O/2 state as
        demonstrated above and the effective nuclear charge increases to
        +2e. A new equilibrium for the force balance is now established.
        The electron path radius is reduced. The potential energy of the
        atom in its reduced radius-state is given by </p>
      <p>V=-{Z.sub.(eff)e.sup.2/[4.pi..epsilon..sub.(O)/2)]}=-{4.times.27.178}=-108-
.7










        eV </p>
      <p>[0045] The kinetic energy, T, of the reduced electron path is
        given by </p>
      <p>T=-[V/2]=54.35 eV </p>
      <p>[0046] Similarly, it can be seen that the kinetic energy of the
        ground state electron path is about 13.6 eV. Thus there is a net
        change in energy of about 41 eV for the transition: </p>
      <p>H{Z.sub.(eff)=1; r=a.sub.(O)} to H{Z.sub.(eff)=2;
        r=a.sub.(O)/2} </p>
      <p>[0047] That is to say, of this 41 eV, about 27 eV is emitted as
        the catalytic transfer of energy occurs, and the remaining 14 eV
        is emitted on restablisation to the force balance. </p>
      <p>[0048] The radial "ground-state" field can be considered as a
        superposition of Fourier components. If integral Fourier
        components of energy equal to m.times.27.2 eV are removed, the
        positive electric field inside the electron path radius
        increases by </p>
      <p>(m).times.1.602.times.10.sup.-19C </p>
      <p>[0049] The resultant electric field is a time-harmonic solution
        of the Laplace equations in spherical co-ordinates. In the case
        of the reduced radius hydrogen atom, the radius at which force
        balance and the non-radiative condition are achieved is given by
      </p>
      <p>r.sub.(m)=a.sub.(O)/[m+1] </p>
      <p>[0050] where m is an integer. </p>
      <p>[0051] From the energy change equations given above, it will be
        appreciated that, in decaying to this radius from the so-called
        "ground-state", the atom emits a total energy equal to </p>
      <p>[(m+1).sup.2-1.sup.2].times.13.59 eV (5) </p>
      <p>[0052] The applicants have found that such energy emissions as
        take place according to (5), above, only appear to occur when
        the hydrogen or deuterium is found in the monatomic (or
        so-called "nascent") state. Molecular hydrogen might be made to
        behave similarly, but the transition is more difficult to
        achieve owing to the higher energies involved. </p>
      <p>[0053] In order to achieve the transition in monatomic hydrogen
        (H) or deuterium (D), it is necessary to accumulate the
        molecular form in the gas phase on a substrate such as nickel or
        tungsten which favours the dissociation of the molecule. As well
        as being dissociated into the monatomic form, the hydrogen or
        deuterium should be bound to the catalytic system to initiate
        the reaction. The preferred method of achieving this is by
        electrolysis using cathode material which favours dissociation.
      </p>
      <p>[0054] The applicants have discovered that the catalytic
        systems which encourage transitions to sub-ground-state energies
        are those which offer a near-perfect energy couple to the
        [m.times.27.2] eV needed to "flip" the atom of H or D. It
        appears from experiment that the effective sink of energy
        provided by the catalyst need not be precisely equal to that
        emitted by the atom. Successful transitions have been achieved
        when there is an error of as much as .+-.2% between the energy
        emitted by the atom and that absorbed by the catalytic system.
        One possible explanation for this is that, in a macroscopic
        sized system, although the transitions are initiated by a close
        match in energy level, such discrepancies as arise are
        manifested as an overall loss or gain in the kinetic energies of
        the recipient ionic systems. It is thought that spectroscopic
        analysis of active H or D catalytic systems may provide evidence
        of this. </p>
      <p>[0055] One catalyst that has been found to initiate the
        transition to the a.sub.O/n state is rubidium in the Rb+ ionic
        species. If a salt of rubidium, such as the carbonate
        Rb.sub.2CO.sub.3 is dissolved in either water or deuterium oxide
        (heavy water), a substantial dissociation into Rb.sup.+ and
        (CO.sub.3).sup.2- ions takes place. If the Rb.sup.+ ions are
        bound closely to monatomic H or D, the transition to the
        a.sub.O/n state is encouraged by the removal of a further
        electron from the rubidium ion, by provision of its second
        ionisation energy of about 27.28 eV. Thus: </p>
      <p>Rb.sup.++H{a.sub.(O)/p}+27.28 eV -&gt; </p>
      <p>Rb.sup.2++e.sup.-+H{a.sub.(O)/[p+1]}+{[(p+1).sup.2-p.sup.2].times.13.59}eV











      </p>
      <p>[0056] where p represents an integral number of such
        transitions for any given H and D atom and by spontaneous
        re-association: </p>
      <p>Rb.sup.2++e.sup.-=Rb.sup.++27.28 eV </p>
      <p>[0057] Thus, the rubidium catalyst remains unchanged in the
        reaction and there is a net yield of energy per transition. </p>
      <p>[0058] Other catalytic systems can be used which have
        ionisation energies approximating to [m.times.27.2]eV, such as
        titanium in the form of Ti.sup.2+ ions and potassium in the form
        of K.sup.+ ions. </p>
      <p>[0059] The applicants believe that the above explanation is
        consistent with currently accepted quantum theory as discussed
        below. </p>
      <p>[0060] Commencing with the equations of Rydberg and Schrodinger
        it can be shown that fractional numbers for the quantum energy
        states in hydrogen yield possible transitions which result in
        emissions at frequencies which are in accord with observed UV
        and X-ray spectra. It is therefore possible that the conditions
        conducive to initiating such transitions may be artificially
        reproduced in the laboratory under certain circumstances. </p>
      <p>[0061] The Rydberg formula for the frequency of emitted
        radiation from a transition in monatomic hydrogen is: </p>
      <p>v=R.sub.(h)c(1/n.sub.(2).sup.2-1/n.sub.(1).sup.2) </p>
      <p>[0062] where: </p>
      <p>[0063] v is the frequency of the emitted photon </p>
      <p>[0064] R.sub.(h) is Rydberg constant, 1.097373 c 10.sup.7
        m.sup.-1 </p>
      <p>[0065] c is the speed of light in vacuo, 2.997.times.10.sup.3
        ms.sup.-1 </p>
      <p>[0066] and </p>
      <p>[0067] n.sub.(1), n.sub.(2) are the transition states </p>
      <p>[0068] It can be seen from the above that, if the resultant
        energy state of the hydrogen atom is that which requires
        n.sub.(2) to be equal to 1/2, emissions will occur which are of
        higher frequency than the observed Lyman 2-1 transition in the
        ultra-violet at 2.467.times.1.degree..sup.15 Hz (about 121 nm).
        There is, indeed, an observed emission at a wavelength of about
        30.8 nm, which appears to be confirmed by recent studies of
        galactic cluster emissions by Bohringer et al (Scientific
        American, January 1999) and it is difficult for the inventor to
        conceive of any other quantum-mechanical event which would give
        rise to such an emission, other than a transition, in accord
        with the above theory, from 1 to 1/2 in nascent hydrogen. </p>
      <p>[0069] As can be seen from the above use of the standard
        Rydberg equation, such behaviour of hydrogen in the monatomic
        state views the conventional hydrogen "ground-state" as one of
        many stable electronically-preferred states for single H atoms.
      </p>
      <p>[0070] To summarise, a proliferation of H or D atoms is
        produced which may have had significantly diminished
        electron-path-radii by virtue of exchange of photons with their
        environment. These atoms appear to be relatively unreactive
        chemically and appear not to readily take the molecular form H-H
        or D-D. This is a fortunate property which has significance and
        enables fusion pathways, as described below. </p>
      <p>[0071] The fusion of light nuclei, hydrogen and deuterium, to
        form heavier elements such as helium is one which has
        traditionally been encouraged by subjecting the reactants to
        extremes of temperature and pressure. This has been necessary
        because there is a large electric charge barrier to overcome in
        order to bring nuclei close enough for fusion to occur. </p>
      <p>[0072] Using atoms with diminished electron path radius,
        adjacent nuclei may experience a corresponding reduction in
        electric barrier and internuclear separations may become
        smaller. With reductions in internuclear separation, fusion
        processes become more probable, and more easily occasioned. </p>
      <p>[0073] There are two principle fusion pathways for deuterium
        atoms. The first is: </p>
      <p>.sup.2.sub.1D+.sup.2.sub.1D=.sup.3.sub.2He+.sup.1.sub.0n </p>
      <p>[0074] where two deuterium nuclei fuse to produce an isotope of
        helium and a free neutron, which subsequently decays (half-life
        6.48.times.10.sup.2S), with emission of a .beta..sup.- particle
        of medium energy (about 0.8 Mev), and a type of neutrino, to
        become a stable proton. </p>
      <p>[0075] The second is: </p>
      <p>.sup.2.sub.1D+.sup.2.sub.1D=.sup.3.sub.1T+.sup.1.sub.1H </p>
      <p>[0076] where the two deuterium nuclei fuse to produce the
        isotope of hydrogen known as tritium (T) and a free stable
        proton. The tritium eventually decays (half-life 12.3 years),
        with emission of a .beta..sup.- particle of very low energy
        (about 0.018 MeV), to become .sup.3.sub.2He </p>
      <p>[0077] Of the two, the second fusion path is preferred for the
        peaceful exploitation of its energy yield, because the fusion
        products are (relatively) harmless on production, and decay to
        completely innocuous species within a short time, emitting
        radiation which can be effectively shielded by a thin sheet of
        kitchen foil or by 10 mm of acrylic plastic, for example. </p>
      <p>[0078] When deuterium nuclei are forced together under high
        temperature and pressure conditions (as in a thermonuclear
        bomb), there is a greater than 50% probability for the first
        pathway to be the dominant one. This is because the high
        temperature process takes no account of nuclear alignment at the
        point of fusion. It is actually a matter of forcing nucleic
        together indiscriminately and hoping that enough fuse to produce
        an explosion. However, the applicants believe, in accord with
        established theory, that it is the alignment of the nuclei with
        respect to the charges in each nucleus which ultimately
        determines the favourable fusion path. </p>
      <p>[0079] In order to achieve a higher probability for the second,
        less hazardous, pathway, the approaching nuclei need to have
        time to align electrostatically such that the proton-proton
        separation is at a maximum. This can only be achieved at far
        lower energies than those found in a thermonuclear bomb. By the
        use of entities with diminished electron-path-radii, and
        correspondingly potentially smaller internuclear distances,
        fusion can be initiated at lower temperatures (and consequently
        lower energies), allowing for the charge-related alignment
        necessary to achieve a high probability for the second,
        tritium-forming, pathway. By introducing deuterium of diminished
        electron-path-radius into a plasma discharge which is confined
        within the water in the vessel itself, fusion is may be
        initiated. Temperatures of the order of 6000 K are obtained
        within certain plasma discharges and this, coupled with multiple
        quantum transitions to produce deuterium of diminished
        electron-path-radius, produces a substantial yield of energy
        from the two-stage process. </p>
      <p>[0080] Another possible but less likely fusion pathway for
        hydrogen atoms is: </p>
      <p>.sup.1.sub.1H+.sup.1.sub.1H=.sup.2.sub.1D+.beta..sup.++.tau. </p>
      <p>[0081] whereby .beta..sup.+ is produced as one of the products.
      </p>
      <p>[0082] Embodiments of the invention will now be described by
        way of example and with reference to the accompanying schematic
        drawings, wherein: </p>
      <p>[0083] <b>FIG. 1</b> shows an apparatus for carrying out a
        method in accordance with the invention on a relatively small
        scale; </p>
      <p>[0084] <b>FIG. 2</b> shows a system for operating and
        measuring the performance of the apparatus of FIG. 1; </p>
      <p>[0085] <b>FIG. 3</b> shows a circuit diagram high voltage,
        high frequency switching circuit for the system of FIG. 2; </p>
      <p>[0086] <b>FIG. 4</b> shows an apparatus for carrying out a
        method in accordance with the invention on a larger scale than
        that of the FIG. 1 apparatus; and </p>
      <p>[0087] <b>FIG. 5</b> shows a further apparatus for carrying
        out a method of the invention which includes two cathodes. </p>
      <p>[0088] The apparatus of FIG. 1 enables the generation of energy
        according to the principles of the invention in the laboratory.
        Any risk of thermal runaway is minimised, whilst demonstrating
        that the level of energy release from the two stages is far in
        excess of that which would result from any purely chemical or
        electrochemical activity. It also enables easy calorimetry, safe
        ducting away of off-gases, and of subsequent extraction of
        liquid for titration (to demonstrate that no chemical action
        takes place during the operation of the apparatus). </p>
      <p>[0089] A 250 ml beaker is provided with a glass quilt or
        expanded polystyrene surround 6 to act as insulation. This can
        include an inspection cut-out so that the area around the
        cathode 9 can be observed from outside. The beaker contains 200
        ml of water, into which is dissolved a small quantity of
        potassium carbonate so as to give a solution of approximately 2
        mMol strength. A platinum lead wire 1 is earthed to the
        laboratory reference ground plane. The anode 10, a sheet of
        platinum foil of approximately 10 mm.sup.2 in area, is attached
        to this lead wire by mechanical crimping. A digital thermometer
        2 is inserted into the liquid in the vessel. A 0.25 mm diameter
        tungsten wire cathode 9 is sheathed in borosilicate glass or
        ceramic tube 4 and sealed at the end immersed in the electrolyte
        so as to expose 10 mm to 20 mm of wire in contact with the
        liquid. The entire assembly of lead wires and the thermometer is
        carried by an acrylic plate 5 which enables of easy dismantling
        and inspection of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0090] A supply of up to 360 volts DC, capable of supplying up
        to 2 amperes, is arranged external to the described apparatus.
        The positive terminal of this supply is connected to the
        laboratory reference ground plane and the negative terminal is
        connected to one pole of an isolated high-voltage switching
        unit. The other pole of the switch is connected to the tungsten
        wire cathode 9 externally of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>[0091] To operate the apparatus, the solution 8 is initially
        brought up to between 40.degree. C. and 80.degree. C. either by
        preheating outside the apparatus or by passing power through a
        heating element in the solution (not shown). When the solution
        is between these temperatures it is either transferred to the
        above apparatus or, if a heating element is used, this is turned
        off. </p>
      <p>[0092] With all connections made as described, the switch is
        set to operate at a duty cycle of 1% and a pulse repetition
        frequency of 100 Hz. It will be seen through the inspection
        cut-out that an intense plasma-arc is intermittently struck
        under the water at or near the cathode. If equipment is
        available to monitor the current drawn, it will be seen that the
        system consumes in the region of 1 watt when the switching
        circuits is operating. It will be seen by the rapid rise in
        temperature in the apparatus that far more energy is being
        released than can be accounted for by the electrical input. As a
        comparison, a heater element can be substituted for the
        electrodes and operated 1 watt and the effects observed. There
        is really no need for sophisticated calorimetry to verify that
        large quantities of energy are being released close to the
        cathode of the equipment, such is the magnitude of the reaction
        for the process, as compared to a test with a resistive heating
        element of the same input power. </p>
      <p>[0093] The data obtained from a representative one-hour session
        with this apparatus as shown as Table 1, below: </p>

      <p>[0094] It can be seen from this table that the total energy
        input during this test was measured at 1820 Joules and, taking
        as a rough guideline that 200 ml of water requires the input of
        838 joules of energy to raise it by 1.degree. C., then by direct
        heating the water would be expect to rise by some 2.degree. C.,
        bearing in mind radiative losses. In fact, during the experiment
        the water temperature was raised from 39.2.degree. C. to
        93.6.degree. C. and considerable steam was also liberated.
        Furthermore, the calculated energy output of 134196 Joules does
        not take account of secondary effects such as light-energy
        output and Faradaic electrolysis. </p>
      <p>[0095] A system suitable for operating the apparatus of FIG. 1
        is illustrated in a block diagram in FIG. 2. A pulse generator
        20 supplies a variable duty-cycle pulse waveform to a high
        voltage switch unit 22. The pulse waveform may be monitored on
        an oscilloscope 24 and its repetition frequency is displayed on
        a first frequency counter 26. A second frequency counter 28 is
        provided to monitor the clock speed of the switch unit 22. Power
        supply 30 is operable to apply a voltage between 0 and 360 V to
        an electrode of the apparatus 12, shown in FIG. 1. The voltage
        level may be read from a digital multimeter 32. The RMS voltage
        across the electrodes 9 and 10 is indicated on a multimeter 34
        and the RMS current passing between the electrodes is shown on
        another multimeter 36, by measuring the voltages developed
        across a 1 ohm resistor 37. The temperature in the apparatus 12
        is indicated on a dip temperature probe 38. The switch unit 22
        may be bypassed by a push button switch 39 to apply a constant
        voltage across the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0096] A circuit diagram of the switch unit 22 is shown in FIG.
        3. In the system of FIG. 2, input 40 is connected to the output
        of pulse generator 20. The output 42 of the switch unit is
        connected to the cathode of the apparatus 12. Two NAND gates 44
        and 46 are two fourths of a Schmitt-trigger 2 input NAND gate
        chip type 4093. NAND gate 44 operates as an astable
        multivibrator, with its repetition frequency set by a preset
        resistor 45. The output of gate 44 is fed to one input of NAND
        gate 46, the other input forming circuit input 40. The output of
        NAND gate 46 is connected to a three transistor amplifier
        consisting of transistors 48, 50 and 52. The amplifier is in
        turn connected to one end of the primary of a transformer 54,
        the other end being connected to earth. The transformer output
        is fed to a bridge rectifier formed from diodes 56, 58, 60 and
        62. </p>
      <p>[0097] The rectifier output is fed via a resistor 64 to the
        gate of an insulated gate bipolar transistor 66 (IGBT). The load
        of the apparatus 12 is connected in the drain circuit of the
        IGBT. A 15 kV diode 68 is connected between the drain and the
        source of the IGBT 66 to protect the IGBT from the sizeable EMI
        emissions from plasma discharges in the apparatus 12 and avoids
        damage to this sensitive semiconductor. A further diode 70 is
        provided between the drain of the IGBT and the circuit output 42
        to act as an EMI blocker in a similar way. A standard 20 mm 5A
        quick-blow fuse 69 is connected between the source of the IGBT
        and ground in order to protect the device against overcurrent. </p>
      <p>[0098] The operation of the circuit of FIG. 3 is as follows.
        The repetition frequency is NAND gate 44 is preferably set to
        between 4 and 6 MHz. Pulse generator 20 is adjusted to set the
        duty of the switching. On receipt of an external pulse from the
        generator, NAND gate 46 passes a packet of 4 to 6 MHz square
        waves to the amplifier. The amplifier has considerable current
        gain and enables the primary of the transformer 54 to be driven
        resonantly with the RC circuit formed by capacitor 72 and
        resistor 74 which are connected in parallel therewith. The
        transformer 54 has a step-up ratio of 2:1 and a 4 to 6 MHz
        signal of approximately 19 volts appears across the bridge
        rectifier. The impedance of the rectifier output is essentially
        determined by a parallel resistor 76, such that the switch-on
        and switch-off time of the IGBT 66 is very fast. Thus, there is
        never a point in the operation of the device when it is
        dissipating any measurable power. The load of the apparatus 12
        is placed in the drain circuit of the IGBT, which is therefore
        operating in "common-source" made to ensure that its source
        terminal never rises above high-side ground potential. This,
        again, is a configuration which uses excess input power. This
        circuit ensures a rise time of the switched waveform which is
        less than 10 nS and a fall time which can be as low as 30 nS at
        modest supply voltages. </p>
      <p>[0099] Preferred component values and types for the circuit of
        FIG. 3 are as follows: </p>

      <p>[0107] A second apparatus for carrying out the invention is
        illustrated in FIG. 4. This apparatus comprises a tubular
        chamber 80, which may be constructed from a nonmagnetic metal or
        metal alloy material such as, but not exclusively, aluminium or
        Duralumin, or may alternatively be constructed from a
        non-permeable ceramic material or from borosilicate glass. The
        tubular chamber 80 is constructed in flanged form to allow of
        its incorporation into a system of pipework via flanges 82 and
        84 and gaskets 86. Entering the chamber 80 are two electrodes,
        the cathode 88 being sheathed in an insulating glass or ceramic
        tube 90 and shaped so as to present itself along the axis of the
        chamber 92. The anode 94 is connected to a similar insulated
        wire 96 and is shaped so as to present a circular plate opposite
        the cathode 88. The distance between the cathode tip and the
        anode plate should be approximately equal to the radius of the
        chamber 80. The cathode may be constructed from tungsten,
        zirconium, stainless steel, nickel or tantalum, or any other
        metallic or conductive ceramic material which may contribute to,
        or occasion, the dissociative process described above. The anode
        may be constructed from platinum, palladium, rhodium or any
        other inert material which does not undergo any significant
        level of chemical interaction with the electrolyte. </p>
      <p>[0108] Surrounding the chamber 80, and concentric with it, is a
        winding 98 of enamelled copper or silver wire of diameter 0.1 to
        0.8 mm consisting of up to several thousand turns of the wire.
        The purpose of this winding 98 is to create an axial magnetic
        field inside the chamber 80. </p>
      <p>[0109] Electrolyte comprising deuterium oxide, in combination
        with ordinary "light" water in varying proportions, and
        containing high-molarity salts of, but not exclusively of,
        potassium, rubidium or lithium, or combinations of such salts,
        is pumped through the chamber 80, in a direction such that the
        anode is downstream of the cathode. </p>
      <p>[0110] The anode lead wire 96 is connected to the ground plane
        or zero volts. The cathode 88 is connected to a variable source
        of between 50 and preferably 2000 volts negative with respect to
        the grounded anode 94, but may be coupled to a voltage of up to
        several tens of thousands of volts negative with respect to such
        anode 94. To enhance performance of the invention, the negative
        voltage may be supplied in the form of pulses having a duty
        cycle between 0.001 and 0.5. </p>
      <p>[0111] The winding 98 is energised with an alternating voltage
        such as to provide a current flow of typically between 0.5 and
        1.5 amps initially. The frequency of the applied alternating
        voltage should be variable from DC up to 15 kHz and may, in
        addition, be synchronous with pulses applied to the cathode 88.
      </p>
      <p>[0112] Under these conditions, a plasma arc will strike close
        to the cathode 88. The intensity and frequency of the current
        flowing in winding 98 may be adjusted to provide for the removal
        of the plasma arc from the immediate vicinity of the cathode 88
        to avoid excessive evaporation of the material from the cathode
        88. </p>
      <p>[0113] The volume of electrolyte pumped through chamber 80 and
        past the plasma arc may be varied such as to stabilise the
        temperature of such electrolyte in a closed system at below at
        its boiling point. </p>
      <p>[0114] Heat may be extracted from the electrolyte by passing it
        through a heat exchanger before its re-introduction into the
        chamber 80. Provision may be made to top-up the water/deuterium
        content of the electrolyte as this becomes depleted by operation
        of the apparatus. The system may operate at a range of pressures
        to facilitate heat removal. </p>
      <p>[0115] A further apparatus for carrying out the invention,
        similar to that of FIG. 4, is shown in FIG. 5 on a scale of
        approximately 1:2.5. It comprises a borosilcate reaction tube
        100 supported at one end on a machined nylon support bridge 102.
        A second machined nylon element 104 is mounted across the other
        end of the tube. The bridge 102 and element 104 are clamped
        against the tube 100 by 8 mm threaded stainless steel studs 110.
      </p>
      <p>[0116] A first cathode 106 is in the form of a nickel wire
        mesh. It is mounted towards one end of tube 100 on a stainless
        steel support 108. Electrical connection to the first cathode
        106 is via a PVC-sleeved wire (not shown). </p>
      <p>[0117] A second cathode 112 consists of an 0.5 mm diameter
        length of tungsten wire provided within a drilled macor ceramic
        sheath 114, which is in turn placed within a 10 mm stainless
        steel tube 116. Tube 116 passes through the support 102 and has
        a perspex end cap 118 on the external end through which the
        second cathode 112 passes. A PVC funnel 120 is provided around
        the-second cathode and is tapered towards it, with the cathode
        tip adjacent the narrower open end thereof. The funnel is
        supported on sleeves 121 provided on the stainless steel support
        108. </p>
      <p>[0118] The anode comprises an 0.25 mm diameter platinum wire
        122 which is connected at one end within the tube 100 to a sheet
        of platinum foil 124. Like the second cathode 112, the anode is
        provided within a 10 mm diameter stainless steel tube 126, which
        passes through nylon element 104 and is closed at its external
        end by a perspex end cap 128. Platinum wire 122 passes through
        the end cap 128. </p>
      <p>[0119] A plasma deflection coil 130 is mounted within tube 100
        between the anode 124 and cathodes 106, 112. Electrical power is
        fed to the coil via connectors 132. </p>
      <p>[0120] Electrolyte is supplied to the tube 100 via a brass
        inlet 134 provided through the support bridge 102 and flows out
        through nylon element 104 via a brass outlet 136. An additional
        brass outlet 138 is also provided in nylon element 104 to allow
        the electrolyte to be sampled during operation of the apparatus.
        Fuse holders and cable connectors for the apparatus are provided
        in a unit 140 mounted on the support bridge 102. </p>
      <p>[0121] The apparatus of FIG. 5 is operated in a similar manner
        to that of FIG. 4, as discussed above. The primary distinction
        is that two cathodes 106, 112 are employed in place of a single
        cathode. In use, electrolyte is fed through the tube 100, past
        the electrodes, from inlet 134 to outlet 136. A pulsed voltage
        is applied to the first cathode 106 such that a layer of metal
        hydride is formed on it surface during the voltage pulses and
        subsequently dissociates to form nascent monatomic
        hydrogen/deuterium. The applied voltage characteristics are
        selected to optimise the production rate of the monatomic
        hydrogen/deuterium. These products are channelled towards the
        second cathode 112 by the funnel 120. A voltage is applied to
        the second cathode 112 to generate a plasma discharge thereat. </p>
      <p>[0122] The characteristics and magnitudes of the voltages
        applied to the first and second cathodes may be similar, but it
        may be advantageous for different duty periods to be employed
        for respective cathodes. This cathode arrangement with the
        second cathode downstream of the first seeks to maximise contact
        between the monatomic hydrogen/deuterium and the plasma and
        therefore the efficiency of the apparatus. This is further
        assisted by the funnel 120. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An electrode (1) having an active surface for contacting an
        electrolyte. The electrode (1) comprises first and second
        metallic materials (2, 3) arranged to provide a number of first

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an electrode and to a method of
        making such an electrode. The invention also relates to a cell
        incorporating such an electrode as its cathode and to a method
        of obtaining release of gaseous products from such a cell. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
      <p>During electrolysis, the mass of a substance liberated by the
        passage of an electric current is strictly determined by
        Faraday's Laws of Electrochemical Deposition. These laws state
        that: </p>
      <p>1. "The amount of chemical change occasioned by the passage of
        an electric current is proportional to the quantity of
        electricity passed"; and </p>
      <p>2. "The masses of different substances liberated by a given
        quantity of electricity are proportional to their chemical
        equivalent weights." </p>
      <p>The chemical equivalent weight of any substance is easily
        determined and remains a fixed standard for that substance under
        all conditions of electrolytic action. It is usually quoted in
        m.g.C.sup.-1, 1 Coulomb (C) being the quantity of electricity
        used when a current of one ampere is passed for one second. </p>
      <p>If the chemical equivalent weight is represented by z, the
        mass, m, of any substance liberated during an electrolytic
        process is given by: </p>
      <p>where I is the current passed in amperes and t is the time in
        seconds. </p>
      <p>During normal electrolytic processes, it is not possible to
        induce a current to flow through the electrolyte unless the
        voltage across the electrodes of the electrolytic cell is raised
        to some specific value, which varies according to the
        electrolyte and the electrode composition. This voltage,
        V.sub.d, is known as the Decomposition Voltage. Hitherto, it has
        not been possible to arrange for electrolytic cells to function
        at voltages sufficiently low to enable of very low-power inputs
        to the cell. </p>
      <p>Any process which can be arranged to run in such a way that,
        when the calorific value of a liberated gas is higher than the
        power required to run the electrolytic process which liberates
        that gas, will act as a net provider of energy. The apparent
        surplus of energy coming, in this instance, from the bond
        dissociation energies of the ions involved in the process. </p>
      <p>An example of the operation of an electrolytic cell will serve
        to illustrate the above points more clearly. </p>
      <p>Let us first consider a cell which liberates hydrogen gas by
        the electrolysis of water containing a standard electrolyte such
        as H.sub.2 SO.sub.4 or Li.sub.2 SO.sub.4. If such a cell is run
        such that its terminal voltage is 5 volts and the current being
        passed through it is 2 amperes, it will require a power source
        of at least 10 watts, allowing for small losses in wires and
        contact resistances. The mass, and hence calorific value, of the
        hydrogen liberated from such a cell will be in accordance with
        Faraday's Laws and will be proportional to the product of
        current and time as outlined above. However, the product of
        current and time is not the same thing as the product of current
        and voltage, which gave us the power consumption of the cell. In
        the case of this cell, the power input is given simply by: </p>
      <p>P.sub.in =V.times.I </p>
      <p>where V is the cell voltage and I is the cell current. </p>
      <p>To calculate the power output of such a cell, we need to know
        how much energy is available from a given mass of hydrogen gas
        when it combines with oxygen during combustion. This figure is
        285 KJ.mol.sup.-1, where 1 KJ (kilojoule) is the energy
        converted when 1 kilowatt of power is used for a duration of 1
        second. Since the chemical equivalent weight of hydrogen is
        known to be 0.01045 mgC.sup.-1, it can be calculated, according
        to (1) above, that the cell will yield a mass, m, of hydrogen
        gas given by </p>
      <p>1 mol of hydrogen gas, as molecular hydrogen H.sub.2, has a
        mass of 2.016 g. Utilising the energy content of hydrogen as it
        undergoes combustion, we therefore have an energy yield from the
        cell of: ##EQU1## </p>
      <p>It can be seen, therefore, that this conventional cell only
        produces just over a quarter as much energy from the full
        combustion of its hydrogen yield as the electrical energy
        required to make it run. Such a device is not an efficient
        converter of energy. </p>
      <p>Consider now the performance of the same cell if its current of
        2 amperes were to flow using a very much smaller potential of
        only 0.5 volts. The input power is given by the same equation
        (2) above, namely: </p>
      <p>=0.5.times.2=1 W </p>
      <p>The output power, however, remains the same as in the 5 volt
        example, it being dependent solely upon the parameters of
        current and time. </p>
      <p>The 0.5 volt cell, therefore, yields a supply of hydrogen gas
        which is capable of being burned to provide some 2.9 times the
        electrical energy input to the cell. </p>
      <p>In the past it has not been possible to cause electrolysis
        cells to operate at the small voltages necessary to achieve this
        kind of "energy multiplier" effect. The natural barrier of the
        established decomposition voltage always halted the process some
        way before the over-unity effects of the cell became evident. </p>
      <p><b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention seeks to provide an electrode which when
        used in an electrolytic cell enables current to pass at a low
        voltage compared with conventional cells. It is also an aim of
        the invention to enable the generation of a gaseous product form
        an electrolyte. </p>
      <p>According to one aspect of the present invention an electrode
        having an active surface for contacting an electrolyte, is
        characterised in that the electrode comprises first and second
        metallic materials arranged to provide at least one first
        metallic material to second metallic material interface at said
        active surface. </p>
      <p>Preferably there are a plurality of such interfaces. </p>
      <p>Preferably the first metallic material comprises a substrate
        e.g. of steel, of the electrode and the second metallic
        material, e.g. nickel or a matrix of nickel and chromium, is
        plated over regions of the substrate. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the present invention there is
        provided an electrolysis cell for obtaining the release of
        gaseous products by electrolysis, comprising an electrolyte, an
        anode and a cathode in the form of an electrode according to
        said one aspect of the present invention. In use of the cell,
        the current can be passed in such a way that decomposition
        occurs at a fraction of the usual required voltage. Typically
        "energy multiplier" effects of the order of 6:1 are achievable.
      </p>
      <p>Suitably the electrolyte comprises dilute sulphuric acid or an
        aqueous solution of lithium sulphate monohydrate, nickel
        sulphate hexahydrate, chromium sulphate or palladous chloride. </p>
      <p>According to a still further aspect of the invention there is
        provided a method of making an electrode according to said one
        aspect of the invention, comprising plating a substrate of a
        first metallic material with a second metallic material and
        removing regions of the plated second metallic material to
        create said active surface with said plurality of first metallic
        material to second metallic material interfaces. </p>
      <p>According to a yet further aspect of the present invention, a
        method of obtaining release of gas from an electrolysis cell
        according to said further aspect of the invention, comprises
        applying a decomposition voltage of no more than 1 volt,
        preferably no more than 0.8 volts, e.g. from 0.2 to 0.6 volts,
        across the anode and cathode of the electrolysis cell. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of
        example only, with particular reference to the accompanying
        drawing, in which FIGS. 1 to 3 show three stages in the
        manufacture of an electrode according to the present invention.

      <p><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>A known electrolyte cell comprises an anode and a cathode as
        electrodes in an aqueous solution of an electrolyte. If a
        sufficiently large voltage, i.e. the "emf" of the cell, is
        applied across the electrodes, gaseous products (hydrogen and
        oxygen) are released at the electrodes. For any given
        electrolyte in water, this value lie between 1.250 volts and
        2.000 volts, depending upon the ambient conditions in the cell
        (temperature, electrode metals, degree of wetting, pH of the
        electrolyte etc.), and is known as the Decomposition Voltage or
        DV. It is made up of three component voltages, which add
        arithmetically to give the overall DV for the cell, namely: the
        hydrogen over-voltage at the cathode; the oxygen over-voltage at
        the anode; and the electrolyte breakdown voltage. </p>
      <p>An electrolytic cell in accordance with the invention differs
        from known electrolytic cells in that it functions as a
        so-called Sub-Decomposition-Voltage (hereafter referred to as
        "SDV") cell which is able to operate at voltages well below the
        predicted emfs which would be expected by summing the three
        component voltages above for any given set of cell
        characteristics. </p>
      <p>There are two principal parameters of an SDV electrolytic cell
        which cause it to function in the way it does. The first
        parameter is the nature of the electrolyte, and the second (more
        important) is the physical characteristic of the cathodic
        electrode. These two parameters are considered below. </p>
      <p><b>Electrolyte</b> </p>
      <p>In common with nearly all electrolytic mechanisms, an SDV cell
        will not work using pure water or even, to any great degree, tap
        water as the electrolyte. The activity of electrolysis depends
        upon the migration of ions towards charged surfaces, where they
        act as either donors or recipients of electrons, and there are
        simply not enough dissociated ions in pure water to enable this
        to take place effectively. An electrolyte, as well as
        dissociating into ions itself, will facilitate to a greater or
        lesser degree the dissociation of the water in which it is
        placed. The electolyte material is, nonetheless, recycled and
        wholly conserved in the process and, once charged, an SDV cell,
        in common with most other electrolysis devices, requires only to
        be topped up with water, not fresh electrolyte. Examples of
        electrolytes which have been successfully employed in SDV cells
        include dilute H.sub.2 SO.sub.4, lithium sulphate monohydrate,
        nickel sulphate hexahydrate, chromium sulphate, and palladous
        chloride, although this is by no means an exhaustive list of the
        possible substances. Those which function by the release of
        SO.sub.4.sup.2- ions in solution seem also to perform better
        when acidified slightly. </p>
      <p><b>The Nature of the Cathode</b> </p>
      <p>The cathode of the SDV cell has an active surface comprising
        two different metallic materials with a plurality of interfaces
        between the different metallic materials. Conveniently the SDV
        cathode 1 (see FIG. 3) consists of a substrate 2 of a first
        metallic material and a plurality of isolated plated region 3 on
        the substrate 2. Suitably the plated second metallic material
        comprises nickel, or a matrix of nickel and chromium, so as to
        create interfaces between the substrate and the plating. </p>
      <p>At these interfaces in use of the SDV cell, a number of complex
        electrochemical interactions take place. When a small voltage is
        applied across the anode and cathode, H.sub.3 O+ (and other+ve)
        ions are attracted towards the cathode. These ions are absorbed
        into the crystal matrix of the nickel plated areas but not into
        the areas of untreated steel. The sorption process takes place
        in three main steps, namely: the surface adsorption of the ions,
        accompanied by their partial dissociation into monatomic
        hydrogen and water; followed by intergranular rift diffusion of
        individual atoms of hydrogen between the nickel crystals; and,
        lastly, lattice diffusion of the same hydrogen atoms from the
        rifts into the actual lattice of the crystal structure. This is
        not a clathrate process, there being an immediate association of
        monatomic H into molecular H.sub.2 within the lattice,
        accompanied by an increase in pressure. The rate-controlling
        process is probably the surface adsorption as increased working
        pressure within the cell appears to have little effect on the
        rate of hydrogen take-up. </p>
      <p>Lattice diffusion continues until the interface between nickel
        and steel is encountered and it is at this point that molecular
        hydrogen is released into the adjacent electrolyte. The entire
        process maintains an equilibrium with the ion-product of the
        water in the electrolyte, new H.sub.3 O+ and other ions being
        formed at the same rate as molecular hydrogen is being
        discharged from the cell. It is thought that there are two
        catalytic, facilitating, reactions at work. Firstly, the
        transition from integranular rift diffusion to lattice diffusion
        is believed to be facilitated by the somewhat unbalanced nature
        of the two outermost quantum groups in the nickel atom,
        monatomic hydrogen being "ushered", as it were, by the weak
        forces within the lattice itself. (Although nascent hydrogen is
        not itself a polar entity, the existence within any mass of H of
        two species, ortho- and para-, dependant on Pauli m.sub.s values
        of + or -1/2, does not rule out some kind of interaction when
        such a monatomic gas is confined within an electrostatically
        active crystalline complex.) Secondly, at the small iron-nickel
        interfaces which occur when the cathode is machined, there is a
        degree of electron-sharing between adjacent iron and nickel
        atoms at the periphery of the crystal structure which in some
        way mitigates in favour of molecular H.sub.2. There are also
        grounds for considering the existence of free protons within
        such a intercrystalline confinement and there is nothing in the
        electrochemistry which would rule this out. </p>
      <p><b>The Anode Process</b> </p>
      <p>The anode process differs from that of a conventional cell in
        that the oxygen over-voltage is rarely exceeded and the reaction
        at the anode is one of the formation of a (conductive) layer of
        a matrix of ferrous- and feroso-ferrous-oxide over the plain
        steel electrode. There is some liberation, albeit slowly, of
        gaseous oxygen at the anode but this is small in comparison with
        the ejection of H.sub.2 from the cathode, which occurs
        prolifically and often (as would be expected given the pressure
        within the crystalline absorption mechanism at work) with some
        minor violence when observed under the microscope. </p>
      <p>There is, obviously, some likely benefit in obtaining hydrogen
        from such a process which is relatively free of associated
        oxygen but, to date, the gaseous mix from experimental SDV cells
        has not been such as to bring the O.sub.2 level down below the
        LEL for hydrogen/oxygen mixture, and such cells should not be
        regarded as being intrinsically safer than conventional ones. </p>
      <p>One method of creating an SDV electrode is described below. </p>
      <p>The electrode which is to become the cathode in an SDV cell is
        made by taking a sheet of ordinary mild steel as the substrate 2
        and creating on its surface a series of irregularities, in the
        form of trough regions 4 and raised regions 5 (see FIG. 1), by
        etching the steel in a bath of concentrated (50-55%) sulphuric
        acid. The natural impurity of most commonly available mild steel
        ensures that etching will take place in a random and irregular
        manner. Mostly, this is caused by the presence of finely divided
        granular alpha-ferrite which appears to be preferentially
        attacked by the acid. </p>
      <p>After inspection of the surface and the determination of the
        average size of the nodes or raised regions on the roughened
        steel (optimally these should be at 0.03-0.05 mm distribution),
        the surface is passivated in concentrated nitric acid and
        further passivated in a chromic acid bath. </p>
      <p>The roughened surface of the steel substrate 2 is then given a
        25-micron coating 6 of nickel by the "electroless" process, also
        known as auto-catalytic chemical deposition (see FIG. 2). This
        plating process provides accretion of deposited nickel in the
        trough regions 4 and thinner deposits of nickel on the raised
        regions 5. </p>
      <p>After coating, the electrode is machined or ground, e.g. using
        a linishing sander and 120 grit silicon carbide paper belt, to
        remove the "peaks" of the plated raised regions 5 and in
        particular to remove the plated nickel from these "peaks" so as
        to expose the steel of the substrate 2 (see FIG. 3). In this way
        a plurality of metal-to-metal interfaces are created on the
        active surface of the cathode between the nickel plated regions
        on the trough regions 4 of the substrate 2 and the exposed steel
        surfaces of the substrate. Constant microscopic inspection is
        required to determine the existence of the correct bi-metallic
        interfaces on the active surface of the electrode. If the
        electrode is to be used with only one active surface (SAS
        electrode), no treatment is given to the other plated surface,
        which will remain electrochemically inactive during the
        operation of the cell. If both surfaces are required to work
        electrolytically (DAS), a similar treatment is given to the
        other side. After cleaning the electrode in methyl ethyl ketone
        to remove grease and other machining deposits, it is left
        immersed in a 0.5N aqueous solution of nickel sulphate
        hexahydrate at 55.degree. C. for 24 hours, which process acts as
        an "initiator" for the later complex sequence of ion exchange
        operations in the active cell. </p>
      <p>The present invention envisages a novel cathode and SDV
        electrolytic cell provided with such a cathode. The invention
        also teaches a novel method of making such a cathode and a novel
        method of releasing gaseous products from an SDV cell. </p>
      <p>The invention discloses the provision of bi-metallic interfaces
        on the active, electrolyte-contacting surface of an electrode
        which produces hitherto unobserved electrochemical phenomena.
        The use of dissimilar metallic materials on the active surface
        facilitates lattice diffusion of gases within the crystal
        structure of the electrode. </p>
      <p>An SDV cell according to the invention acts as an "over-unity"
        cell in respect of hydrogen gas production from the cell. The
        cell operates at low voltages of no more than 1 volt, preferably
        no more than 0.8 volt and typically from 0.2 to 0.6 volts.
        However even lower operating voltages are feasible. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>The Cold Fusion Reactor ( CFR ) v3.0 uses a new enhanced design
        with a 1000 mL Dewar vessel filled with a 600 mL of
        demineralized water and 41.5 g of Potassium Carbonate, the
        electrolyte solution used is 0.5 molar ( 0.5 M, ). The Dewar
        vessel, used as the container for the CFR v3.0, keeps the strong
        heat and the light energy produced by the reactor. The reduced
        output of the Dewar neck avoid some eventual projections of the
        water outside the vessel. </p>
      <p>The CFR v3.0 runs at a very stable regime and the power
        efficiency measured during all the tests conducted is more than
        200%. </p>
      <p>The Cathode used is a pure tungsten rod ( W ) 3 mm diameter and
        25 mm length from tungsten TIG electrodes (WP) commonly used for
        TIG and Plasma welding. The Anode used is composed of stainless
        steel grid maintained with a stainless steel&nbsp; shaft. All
        the wires connections are made with a 1.5 mm2 copper flexible
        wire gained with silicon. </p>
      <p>The CFR v3.0 is powered with a DC voltage through a bridge
        rectifier connected through an adjustable isolation transformer
        to the 220V AC power grid line. The voltage input has been
        measured with a digital oscilloscope Fluke 123 with a Shielded
        Test Lead STL 120 ( 1:1, 1 Mohms/225 pF ). The current input has
        been measured with a current clamp CIE Model CA-60A ( Accuracy
        DC Amps ±1.5%, AC Amps ±2% (40 Hz - 2 kHz), AC Amps ±4% (2 kHz
        -10 kHz), AC Amps ±6% (10 kHz - 20kHz) ). The temperature has
        been measured with a type "K" temp probe ( NiCrNi ) connected on
        a VC506 digital multimeter ( -20°C to +1200 °C with an accuracy
        of +/- 3% ). </p>
      <p><i>Run # 1 ~ Test procedure :</i> </p>
      <p>1) The temperature of the K<sub>2</sub>CO<sup>3</sup> solution
        in the CFR has been set initially to 83°C. <br>
        2) The weight of the CFR has been measured initially, it was
        1336 g. <br>
        3) The power supply has been switched on continuously and the
        Voltage/Current datas has been recorded in the Fluke 123 digital
        oscilloscope used as a data logger, up to a temperature of
        102°C. <br>
        4) Then the weight of the CFR has been measured, it was 1292 g.
      </p>
      <p>The run time of the CFR has been 124.8 seconds. </p>
      <p>The Voltage/Current datas logged give an average electrical
        power input of 574.8 Watts during 124.8 seconds, so this gives :
      </p>
      <p>ELECTRICAL ENERGY INPUT = 71739 Joules </p>
      <p>The evaporated water in the CFR during the full boiling was 44
        mL. We know that we need 2260 J/g to vaporize water. The
        temperature rise of the 600 mL was 19°C. So, this gives : </p>
      <p>ENERGY OUTPUT = ( 44 x 2260 ) + ( 600 x 19 x 4.18 ) = 147092
        Joules </p>
      <p>Power OUTPUT = 1178.6 Watts, Net Power Gain = 603.8 Watts <br>
        Energy OUTPUT/INPUT = 147092 / 71739 = 2.05 </p>
      <p><i>Run # 2 ~ Test procedure :</i> </p>
      <p>1) The temperature of the K<sub>2</sub>CO<sup>3</sup> solution
        in the CFR has been set initially to 86°C. <br>
        2) The weight of the CFR has been measured initially, it was
        1334 g. <br>
        3) The power supply has been switched on continuously and the
        Voltage/Current datas has been recorded in the Fluke 123 digital
        oscilloscope used as a data logger, up to a temperature of
        103°C. <br>
        4) Then the weight of the CFR has been measured, it was 1286 g.
      </p>
      <p>The run time of the CFR has been 127.2 seconds. </p>
      <p>The Voltage/Current datas logged give an average electrical
        power input of 518.2 Watts during 127.2 seconds, so this gives :
      </p>
      <p>ELECTRICAL ENERGY INPUT = 65918 Joules </p>
      <p>The evaporated water in the CFR during the full boiling was 48
        mL. We know that we need 2260 J/g to vaporize water. The
        temperature rise of the 600 mL was 17°C. So, this gives : </p>
      <p>ENERGY OUTPUT = ( 48 x 2260 ) + ( 600 x 17 x 4.18 ) = 151116
        Joules </p>
      <p>Power OUTPUT = 1188 Watts, Net Power Gain = 669.8 Watts <br>
        Energy OUTPUT/INPUT = 151116 / 65918 = 2.29 </p>
      <p>After a lot of tests runs, some small longitudinal cracks are
        visible on the pure W cathode; these small fractures are
        produced by the Hydrogen Embrittlement Cracking effect ( HEC )
        on the tungsten. </p>
