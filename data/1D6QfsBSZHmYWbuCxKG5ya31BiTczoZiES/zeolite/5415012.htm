        <p><b><font size="+1">Cooling system having a vacuum Tight Steam
              Operating Manifold</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>16 May 1995</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A cooling system with a vacuum tight operating system manifold
        line contains at least two connecting locations on which at
        least an operating medium evaporator and at least a sorption
        agent container having sorption medium therein are coupled in an
        airtight manner to the operating system manifold. The sorption
        medium container is capable of absorbing and deabsorbing
        operating medium vapor. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1 . Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to cooling systems, and more
        particularly to a cooling system having a steam operating
        manifold on which at least an evaporator and a sorption agent
        container are connected. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Cooling apparatus and methods in accordance with the sorption
        principle, for example, German Patent No. DE 3,425,419, wherein
        a portion of an aqueous liquid is vaporized and adsorbed as
        steam by a sorption agent, are known. As a result of the
        evaporation of a portion of liquid from the aqueous solution,
        the aqueous solution cools while the sorption agent which
        adsorbs the vapor is heated. The cooling methods according to
        the sorption principle are primarily conducted in closed systems
        where a vacuum pressure is provided so as to permit the aqueous
        solution to evaporate at relatively low temperatures. This type
        of cooling system is relatively inflexible since the evaporator
        must always be connected to the cooling device. </p>
      <p>German Patent No. DE-OS 4,003,107 relates to an ice maker which
        operates in accordance with the sorption principle. This patent
        discloses freezing an aqueous liquid in an icing
        container/evaporator by means of a solid sorption agent to which
        a vacuum pump is connected. The ice maker manufactures ice cubes
        which are used to cool liquid refreshments. This ice maker, like
        the aforementioned cooling system, is relatively inflexible
        since the evaporator must always be connected to the cooling
        device. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a cooling
        system having a vacuum tight steam operating manifold. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide an
        economically efficient, universally compatible cooling system. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        universally usable cooling system which overcomes the inherent
        disadvantages of known cooling systems. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, a cooling
        system having a vacuum tight steam operating manifold includes
        at least two connecting locations, to which at least an
        evaporator and at least a sorption medium container are
        connected in a vacuum tight manner. Moreover, a vacuum pump may
        be coupled to the sorption agent container for generating a
        sufficient vacuum pressure when zeolite is used as the sorption
        agent and water is used as the operating medium so that the
        water can evaporate at relatively low temperatures. Preferably,
        for energy economy, the vacuum pump should only operate when a
        relatively high pressure condition exists within the system
        which would inhibit the evaporation of operating medium. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of the illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to
        be read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> is a diagram of a cooling system having a vacuum
        tight steam operating manifold constructed in accordance with
        the present invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, a cooling system having a vacuum tight
        steam operating manifold constructed in accordance with the
        present invention will now be described. The cooling system
        includes an operating steam manifold line 1 having a plurality
        of connecting locations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. A
        check valve 12 is coupled to connection location 2 so as to
        prevent a flow of operating steam from the manifold into
        refrigerator/evaporator 13. However, check valve 12 permits a
        flow of operating steam from the refrigerator/evaporator 13 into
        manifold 1. A swimmer valve 14, coupled to the
        refrigerator/evaporator, permits water 15 stored in supply tank
        16 to flow in small quantities into the refrigerator/evaporator
        from the supply tank when a low water level is detected in the
        refrigerator/evaporator. The refrigerator/evaporator 13 is
        thermally insulated by housing 16' and the interior of the
        housing is accessible through door 17. The evaporation
        temperature of the water in the refrigerator/evaporator 13 is
        defined by the operating steam pressure in manifold line 1. The
        lower the operating steam pressure in manifold line 1, the lower
        the evaporator temperature in refrigerator/evaporator 13. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, a ball valve 3' is coupled so as
        to be in fluid communication with connection location 3. Also
        coupled to connection location 3 is a flanged plain sealing
        surface 18. Container 19, having aqueous liquid 20 therein, has
        an opening 19' which is smaller than the smallest planar
        dimension of the sealing surface 18. Preferably, the container
        19 and opening 19' is coupled to the plain sealing face in an
        air-tight manner. When the ball valve 3' is opened, the pressure
        within the container 19 decreases and portions of the aqueous
        liquid 20 evaporate. This causes a decrease in the temperature
        of the aqueous liquid and ultimately, after sufficient
        evaporation, freezing of the liquid. After closing the ball
        valve and opening a venting valve 21 which is coupled between
        connecting location 3 and flanged plain sealing surface 18, the
        vacuum pressure in container 19 is eliminated. Therefore,
        container 19 having the frozen aqueous liquid therein can be
        separated from the system. It is particularly advantageous if
        container 19 includes thermal insulation (not shown), around
        extremities of the container to reduce the unintentional
        transfer of heat from the ambient air so as to extend the time
        that the aqueous liquid remains frozen. The time for freezing
        the aqueous liquid is dependent on the volume of frozen liquid
        generated and the characteristics or properties of the aqueous
        liquid which is to be solidified. </p>
      <p>Connecting location 4 of manifold 1 preferably has air cooler
        22 coupled in fluid communication thereto, so that cool air can
        be transported from blower 23. A thermostat 24 permits aqueous
        liquid 25 to be provided out of aqueous liquid supply container
        26 into air cooler 22. After the aqueous liquid enters air
        cooler 22, an amount of the liquid evaporates causing the
        remaining portion of liquid therein to cool and freeze. As
        blower 23 forces air over air cooler 22, the air flow is cooled.
      </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, connecting location 5 is closed by
        a blind plug 5' which may be removed when required so that
        connecting location 5 may be attached to any given
        cooling/evaporator. Blind plug 5' provides an air-tight closure
        of connecting location 5 in order to maintain the internal
        pressure of manifold 1. </p>
      <p>Preferably, connection location 6 has a ball valve 6', similar
        to that attached at connecting location 3, coupled thereto. In
        addition, a plain sealing surface 27 having an opening
        therethrough is connected to the ball valve. The opening of
        plain sealing surface 27 is in fluid communication with
        connecting location 6 and is positioned so that double wall
        containers 28, which contain a hydrophilic medium 29 (for
        example, a sponge) inside a jacket space can be air tight
        mounted thereon. The hydrophilic medium 29 preferably contains
        an aqueous liquid such as water. By opening the ball valve 6', a
        portion of the aqueous liquid evaporates from the hydrophilic
        medium 29. The evaporation of the aqueous liquid cools the
        aqueous solution still absorbed by the hydrophilic medium 29
        which causes an ice buffer to form. The double wall container 28
        can be removed by closing the ball valve 6' and venting the
        system in a manner similar to that described with regard to
        connection location 3. </p>
      <p>Connecting location 7 preferably consists of a two-sided
        closing coupler. The connecting location may be connected to a
        movable transport cart 30 (trolley) which may be used for
        storing perishable food and drinks during transport. The
        transport cart includes an evaporator 32 located inside cart 30
        which provides cooling. Preferably, the cart is provided with
        inner guide bars on which trays 31 may be mounted during
        transport and storage. The cart may be loaded with prepared
        meals and other food in the catering station. In addition, a
        water supply may be provided to the evaporator 32 in the
        catering station which will be frozen by direct evaporation when
        connected to a sorption medium container. Preferably, the
        evaporator 32 is coupled from sorption medium container at the
        catering station so as to provide an ice-buffer. This ice
        build-up bridges long waiting times from the point when the food
        is placed in the cart at the catering station until the cart is
        attached to an onboard operating steam manifold line. The cart,
        which is preferably insulated on its outer surfaces by an
        insulation layer 33, may be connected in an airplane-galley to
        an on-board operating steam manifold line contained on the
        airplane to maintain cooling during the trip. </p>
      <p>Preferably, connecting line 8 is coupled so as to be in fluid
        communication with a drink cooling system 34. The drink cooling
        system consists of an evaporator container 35 having a steel
        cooling coil 37 surrounded by a supply of aqueous liquid 36. A
        control tap 38 manipulates valve 39 which permits or prevents
        communication with the manifold 1. When tap 38 is opened, valve
        39 is also opened so that evaporated aqueous liquid can flow
        into the operating steam manifold line 1, thus cooling the
        remaining amount of aqueous liquid. This in turn cools cooling
        coil 37 which is surrounded by the aqueous liquid. Tap 38 also
        controls a flow of liquid from container 40 through the cooling
        coils 37 to container 41. After a relatively short time period,
        the aqueous liquid 36 and cooling coils 37 are cooled to such an
        extent that when tap 38 is completely open, the liquid that is
        stored in container 40 may flow through the cooling coil 37 into
        container 41 while having its temperature reduced in the cooling
        coil. By closing the tap 38, valve 39 is also closed. As a
        result, the cooling capacity of the system is not utilized and
        lost when the drink cooling system is not in use. Preferably,
        the container 40 can be stored at room temperature without any
        loss of cooling capacity. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, connecting location 9 is in fluid
        communication with a sorption medium container 42 that contains
        sorption medium 43 therein. A suitable sorption medium is
        zeolite. An electric heater 44 is preferably included and
        extends through a portion of the sorption medium in order to
        regenerate the sorption medium 43. In the lower region of the
        zeolite filler 43 contained in sorption medium container 42,
        preferably at a location distal with respect to connecting
        location 9, a vacuum line 45 having connecting location 46 is
        coupled so as to be in fluid communication with vacuum pumps 47,
        48. Each vacuum pump 47, 48 is coupled to vacuum line 45 through
        respective check valves 49, 50. The vacuum pump 47 may be a
        compressed air ejector. As soon as compressed air flows through
        feed line 51, a vacuum pressure is generated by the
        Venturi-effect, which evacuates the total cooling system through
        vacuum line 45 and sorption medium 43. </p>
      <p>A suitable vacuum pump 48 is an alternatively switchable
        mechanical vacuum pump. Vacuum pump 48 may be driven by an
        electromotor 52 which, preferably only operates if a high
        pressure signal is detected by pressure sensor 54 and provided
        through signal line 53. The pressure sensor 54 is coupled
        through connecting location 10 to the operating steam manifold
        line 1. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, condenser 55 is coupled to
        connecting location 11. The condenser liquifies the evaporated
        aqueous liquid received from the operating steam manifold 1 by
        utilizing a cold face. In the alternative, the evaporated liquid
        precipitates in form of frozen fog. The evaporation temperature
        in each of the above-described evaporators must be higher than
        the temperature of the cold face in the condenser. Any gases
        hindering the free flow of evaporated liquid may be removed
        through connecting location 56 and a shut-off valve 57 coupled
        to vacuum pumps 47 and 48. A check valve 58 prevents a return
        flow of evaporated liquid into the operating steam manifold 1 if
        the temperature within the condenser substantially increases
        causing evaporation of the condensed evaporated liquid. The
        condensed evaporated liquid 60 collects at the bottom of the
        condenser 55 and, if needed, may be removed through a discharge
        valve 59. It is particularly advantageous if the condensed
        liquid is fed back into supply containers 26 and 16 with return
        feed lines. In airplanes, the cold faces may reach a desirable
        temperature as a result of exposure to the ambient air
        surrounding the airplane. </p>
      <p>As stated above, the cooling system basically consists of a
        vacuum tight steam operating manifold 1 which has a plurality of
        connecting locations, to which at least an operating medium
        evaporator and at least a sorption medium container are
        connected in a vacuum tight manner. Moreover, a vacuum pump is
        included for generating a sufficient vacuum pressure when using
        zeolite as the sorption agent and water as the operating medium,
        so that water can evaporate at relatively low temperatures. For
        economy, the vacuum pump should only go into operation when the
        pressure conditions in the system require it and not when these
        conditions are not present. </p>
      <p>Suitable vacuum pumps are known for this purpose. However, it
        may be particularly advantageous to use vacuum pumps which do
        not require lubrication, so called dry running vacuum pumps. An
        end pressure of 8 hPa can be realized with a two step dry
        running vacuum pump. If a lower end pressure is required, a
        three step pump may be used. </p>
      <p>Recently vacuum ejectors, commonly referred to as Venturi-jets,
        have been utilized more frequently because they are only driven
        by compressed air. The Venturi-jets, which customarily operate
        in a multi-stage manner, can generate end pressures of8 hPa by
        means of a compressed air supply of 5 to 6 bar. Compressed air
        systems are present in many commercial vehicles including large
        trucks, railroad cars, and airplanes. Since the vacuum pumps are
        relatively inexpensive and have a relatively low air
        consumption, a cooling system employing a Venturi-jet is
        particularly economical. In addition, since the ambient air
        pressure at high altitudes is between 200 and 300 hPa, the
        compressed air driven vacuum ejectors are more economical and
        efficient when used in these environments. </p>
      <p>Cooling systems which are installed in passenger cars can
        benefit from the vacuum devices customarily installed in these
        vehicles. Since many vehicle systems, such as central locking,
        braking and steering require a vacuum for proper operation, it
        is advantageous to replace the standard vacuum pump with a pump
        having a lower end pressure. The initial additional expense is
        relatively low since neither a new motor nor a substantially
        more expensive and complex control is required. Moreover, any
        additional weight associated with the new vacuum pump remains
        within acceptable weight limits and restrictions since only a
        further vacuum stage has to be integrated to the existing vacuum
        pump. </p>
      <p>The vacuum pumps 47, 48 are designed to evacuate the sorption
        medium container 42 and corresponding connecting line, the steam
        operating manifold 1, as well as each of the connected operating
        medium evaporators. It is advantageous to include a device
        between the sorption medium container and the vacuum pump which
        prevents a reverse flow of air into the cooling system when the
        vacuum pump is idle. Such a reverse flow of air could impair the
        operating medium adsorption capacity of the sorption agent.
        Simple check valves are suitable for this purpose. However
        mechanically or electrically actuated valves are also suitable.
      </p>
      <p>The sorption medium container itself may have a variety of
        designs. However, the container must be constructed so that the
        operating medium steam which flows into the sorption medium
        container can reach all regions of the sorption medium within
        the container. It is therefore preferred to remove substantially
        all of the air and noncondensable gases from the sorption medium
        filler. The subsequent inflow of operating medium vapor should
        not be removed when vacuuming off the air and non-condensable
        gases from the sorption medium container. It is therefore
        preferred to configure the sorption medium container so that the
        input opening of the operating medium steamline manifold is
        located at one end of the container and the vacuum pump
        connecting line is located at an opposite end of the sorption
        medium container. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is also advantageous to configure the
        connecting locations on the sorption container with easy or
        quickly releasable connections. Therefore, a container having
        saturated sorption medium can be easily replaced with a new
        container having unsaturated sorption agent. </p>
      <p>Customarily, sorption medium containers having substantially
        saturated sorption medium can be regenerated by heating the
        sorption medium. When heat is applied, the operating medium is
        driven out of the sorption agent as vapor. This regeneration can
        be performed at any given time and any given location. It is
        even possible to use exhaust from an internal combustion engine
        or an electric heater to expel the operating medium from the
        sorption medium. Depending on the regeneration method utilized,
        the sorption medium container may be adapted to the specific
        regeneration process by installing an electric heater or by
        including heat exchanger outer walls which can transfer heat to
        the sorption medium through the container walls. Furthermore,
        reaction heat, which is released during the sorption of
        operating medium vapor by the sorption medium filler, can also
        be stored for later use in regenerating the sorption medium.
        Naturally, the heat generated as a result of the sorption action
        may be stored and transferred for any heating use. </p>
      <p>As implied above, regeneration of the sorption medium filler
        may be realized without separating the sorption medium container
        from the operating steam manifold. However, when regenerating
        the sorption medium filler, the operating medium steam should be
        prevented from returning to the operating steam manifold. This
        is accomplished by including simple check valves at each
        connecting location. Mechanically or electrically actuated
        shut-off fittings can also be used. If it is desired to
        reliquify the operating medium steam that was expelled from the
        sorption medium filler, it may be returned to the evaporators
        through separate return feed lines. </p>
      <p>Absorption and adsorption substances are commonly referred to
        as sorption agents and are well known in the cooling technology.
        It had been shown that the use of molecular screens or zeolites
        as sorption agents is particularly advantageous. Zeolites adsorb
        up to 30percent by weight of water and release the same to the
        environment as vapor at temperatures of up to 300.degree. C.
        Hence, in the preferred embodiment, the operating agent is water
        which is vaporized in each evaporator and which flows in the
        form of steam through the operating steam manifold into the
        sorption medium container. Since the vapor pressure of water is
        relatively low, the vacuum pump must reach a minimum pressure of
        6.1 hPa in order to enable evaporation temperatures of
        approximately 0.degree. C. With a pressure of 6.1 hPa, the water
        in the operating medium evaporator can completely freeze. It is
        possible, by making a larger supply of ice, to cool the
        evaporation device an additional amount even after it has been
        disconnected from the operating steam manifold. However, the
        operating medium vapor can only flow through the manifold and be
        adsorbed by the zeolite filler if the vacuum pump generates a
        sufficiently low pressure in the system. </p>
      <p>A variety of vacuum tight lines are suitable for use as the
        operating steam manifold. Since the operating medium vapor
        customarily has relatively low temperatures, flexible plastic
        lines may be used. Principally, a variety of known fittings may
        be used at the connecting locations. In the preferred
        embodiment, each connecting location that is not coupled to an
        evaporator is sealed in a vacuum-tight manner. This may be
        accomplished by utilizing self-closing rapid couplings in order
        to maintain the vacuum pressure within the system. </p>
      <p>If the evaporator and sorption medium container are easily
        connected and unconnected, they can be readily installed at any
        corresponding chosen location on the operating steam manifold.
        The operating steam manifold is designed to connect a plurality
        of evaporators with a single sorption medium container, a single
        evaporator with a plurality of sorption agent containers or any
        combination there between. Naturally, the connecting locations,
        through which only relatively small volumes of steam can be
        withdrawn, may be combined with connecting lines having
        correspondingly small cross sections. In this manner, an
        operating steam manifold having many branches may be utilized
        for only a single sorption agent container having only a single
        vacuum pump. </p>
      <p>The term "evaporator" denotes all devices for use in this
        invention wherein an operating medium liquid evaporates. The
        evaporated liquid then flows in the form of steam or vapor into
        the operating steam manifold. Therefore, all suitable components
        or systems known in the cooling technology will be considered as
        evaporators, in particular, the evaporator plate of a
        refrigerator, the evaporation line of a drink cooler and the
        evaporation air cooler of an air conditioning unit. </p>
      <p>The flow cross-section and general construction of each
        evaporator is determined by the operating medium utilized. When
        water is used as the operating medium, the evaporator may be
        constructed in accordance with the German laid open publications
        DE-OS 4,003,107 and DE-0S 4,138,114 . Since a plurality of
        evaporator construction types may be connected to the same
        operating steam manifold line, and the evaporation temperatures
        may be controllable at a variety of different temperatures, it
        is advantageous if a steam gauge or valve is installed either in
        each evaporator unit or at each connecting location. This
        controls the volume of steam flow to such an extent that a
        higher evaporation temperature is realized on the manifold line.
        The operating steam pressure in the manifold defines the lowest
        possible evaporation temperature in each of the connected
        evaporators. </p>
      <p>The vacuum pump utilized in the present invention could operate
        constantly in order to maintain the vacuum pressure required for
        vaporizing the operating medium. However, if the cooling system
        is sufficiently air-tight, the vacuum pump need only
        periodically remove the non-condensable gases from the sorption
        medium in order to make the sorption filler readily accessible
        for the operating medium vapor. Additionally, for energy
        conservation considerations, it is preferred that the vacuum
        pump only operate if an additional evaporator is connected or
        when connecting ice making devices which require a temporary low
        evaporation temperature. </p>
      <p>It may also be economically advantageous to limit operation of
        the vacuum pump to situations in which it is absolutely
        necessary. Thus, it will be realized that the cooling system
        must be evacuated only a few seconds per day. In order to
        operate the vacuum pump in this manner, a plurality of
        possibilities are available. An increasing evaporation
        temperature in the evaporator can close an installed thermostat
        and thereby activate the vacuum pump. Since it customarily takes
        time until the evaporation temperature has dropped to such an
        extent that the thermostat is again closed, it is logical to
        equip the vacuum pump with a timer that deactivates the pump
        after a few seconds even though the thermostat is still closed.
      </p>
      <p>A further possibility is to activate the vacuum pump by push
        switches. The activation pressure of the push switch can be
        easily adjusted to turn the vacuum pump on and then off when the
        pressure reaches an acceptable level. However, it is also
        advantageous to provide the connecting locations of the manifold
        line with a contact switch which operates the vacuum pump for a
        predetermined time period when an evaporator is initially
        connected. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous if the cooling system is
        equipped with a so-called cold face. This cold face enables a
        system using water as the operating medium to liquify operating
        medium vapor or to condense it at temperatures below 0.degree.
        C. However, this is only logical if the cold face has a lower
        temperature level than the lowest evaporation temperature in all
        of the evaporators. For example, when using the cooling system
        in a household during the winter months, operating steam which
        is generated in the evaporator can be condensed on the cold face
        which is cooled by the cold outside environment. In this case,
        no sorption medium is required to adsorb the operating steam and
        consequently no regeneration of the sorption medium is required.
        In the preferred embodiment, it is advantageous to utilize both
        the cold face and the sorption medium container. This is
        advantageous when the sorption medium container is subjected to
        lower temperatures, at least for a period of time. Moreover,
        when using a cold face, it must be assured that non-condensable
        gases can be removed from the system through an evacuation
        device. </p>
      <p>Further examples of applications for a cold face are on
        airplanes which fly through a very cold environment (i.e., at
        high altitudes). The temperatures at high altitudes may fall to
        -50.degree. C. Transport containers for food and drinks, so
        called trolleys (food carts) or even total freight space areas,
        may be cooled with the use of cold faces during the flight. The
        operating steam flowing out of the evaporators of the trolleys
        may be condensed or freeze on the cold faces. On the ground and
        during the initial startup phase, the sorption filler absorbs
        the operating steam instead of condensing on the cold face. It
        is also advantageous if the air conditioning of the total
        airplane cabin is performed by the inventive cooling system. The
        alternating regeneration of two sorption medium fillers is then
        performed by hot exhaust gases from the turbine or through
        "bleed air" which is available on board at over 200.degree. C.
        The operating steam manifold could be built and integrated into
        the systems of the plane, and corresponding connecting location
        coils could be coupled with air heat exchangers, ice makers and
        trolleys. </p>
      <p>A further application of the present invention includes hotels
        and restaurants. For example, the customary mini bar
        refrigerator may be replaced by simple evaporator refrigerators
        which are connected to an operating steam manifold, having one
        or a plurality of connecting locations in each hotel room. At a
        central location, the operating steam manifold line discharges
        into one or a plurality of sorption medium containers which are
        alternately regenerated by waste heat from any one of a variety
        of sources. Naturally, the subject invention may also be used in
        private homes, where refrigerators and air conditioning
        evaporators are installable in one or all of the rooms of the
        house. </p>
      <p>What is possible in the hotel and household is also possible in
        vehicles. In passenger motor vehicles, in trucks and campers, a
        comfortable cooling system may be installed with a plurality of
        connecting locations coupled to an operating steam manifold line
        which meets all required cooling tasks. It is particularly
        advantageous for the air conditioning (cooling) of vehicles to
        permanently install the vacuum pump and operating medium
        manifold line in the vehicle, while the sorption medium
        container together with the evaporator is installed only when
        needed (i.e., in hot weather). In this manner, however, an air
        conditioning unit can cool the vehicle for a specific time
        period, which may depend on the sorption medium capacity.
        Naturally, longer cooling periods are possible without
        regeneration if a plurality of spare sorption medium containers
        are carried as back-ups. </p>
      <p>A further exemplified case of application is the air
        conditioning of railroad compartments. Through a single
        operating steam manifold line, each car compartment may be air
        conditioned by means of an evaporator which operates as a heat
        exchanger. Here too, by providing additional connection
        locations, refrigerator type devices brought by passengers and
        having a corresponding evaporator may be connected to the
        manifold. Also, the possibility of passengers making ice
        directly is present. Furthermore, novel applications exist
        wherein a train restaurant can utilize the system in accordance
        with the present invention. For example, a self-service system
        may be constructed, wherein a liquid selected by a passenger is
        cooled when the liquid is drawn or passes through an evaporator
        in accordance with the invention. Therefore, the need to store
        precooled drinks is eliminated. Advantageously, each car of the
        train is equipped with its own sorption medium container and an
        associated vacuum pump so as to increase system capacity. In
        addition, a connecting line between the individual cars is
        thereby eliminated. </p>
      <p>Although the illustrative embodiments of the present invention
        have been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
