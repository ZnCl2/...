      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A method and devices for the solidification of aqueous
        substances by the direct evaporation of water from the substance
        and the sorption of the water vapor in a sorption agent in a
        vacuum system, wherein the aqueous substance and the sorption
        agent are evacuated from the surrounding pressure level to a
        system pressure of below 5 mbar (absolute) by means of a vacuum
        pump and the nonsorbable gases thereby suctioned by the vacuum
        pump are suctioned through the sorption agent. The mass of the
        used sorption agent is at least half the mass of the water
        fraction in the substance. The solidification process is
        realized in less than 2 min, particularly less than 20 sec. The
        aqueous substance is solidified in a solidification container
        that can be removed from the vacuum system, the vacuum system is
        subsequently vented, and the solidified substance removed from
        the vacuum system together with the solidification container. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to a method and devices
        for the rapid solidification of aqueous substances by the direct
        evaporation of water from the substance and the adsorption of
        the water vapor by a sorption agent under vacuum. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Methods and devices for the cooling of aqueous liquids
        according to the evaporation principle are known. By the
        suctioning off of water vapor, an aqueous liquid is brought to
        evaporation and thereby cooled. In order to cool aqueous liquids
        to temperatures close to the solidification point, considerable
        water vapor volumes must be suctioned off. </p>
      <p>[0003] Although direct evaporation makes possible a very rapid
        and gentle cooling, it has been possible up to now to implement
        it economically only in a few application cases. </p>
      <p>[0004] Adsorption devices are devices in which a solid sorption
        agent sorbs a second agent, the working agent, which boils at
        lower temperatures, as a vapor, with the release of heat
        (sorption phase). The working agent thereby evaporates in an
        evaporator with heat absorption. After the sorption agent is
        saturated, it can once again be desorbed by the supply of heat
        at a higher temperature (desorption phase). The working agent
        thereby evaporates from the adsorption agent. The working agent
        vapor can be reliquefied and then re-evaporated. </p>
      <p>[0005] Adsorption devices for cooling with solid sorption
        agents are known from EP 0 368 111 and DE-OS 34 25 419. Sorption
        agent containers filled with sorption agents suction off the
        working agent vapor that is generated in an evaporator and sorb
        it with the release of heat. This sorption heat must be removed
        from the used sorption agent. The cooling devices can be used to
        cool food and to keep it warm in thermally insulated boxes. </p>
      <p>[0006] In German Patent DE 4003107, a method for making ice
        under vacuum with a simultaneous sorption of the outflowing
        water vapor in a sorption agent is described. An aqueous liquid
        is thereby solidified in a flanged vacuum-tight icing container.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0007] The present invention involves an economical method and
        device for the simple and rapid solidification of aqueous
        substances under vacuum. The method in accordance with the
        invention permits the cooling and solidification of an aqueous
        substance within a very short time. The quantity of solidified
        substance can attain several kilograms per minute without
        expensive technology and without time-consuming preparations. A
        simultaneous and expensive removal of heat from the sorption
        agent is not necessary since the quantity of sorption agent is
        dimensioned in such a way that its sensible heat capacity is
        sufficient to buffer heat released during the sorption to such
        an extent that the sorption reaction is still sufficiently far
        from its thermodynamic equilibrium point. The solidification
        takes place within a few seconds as a function of the flow
        conditions of the water vapor. In accordance with the invention,
        the sorption agent quantity is so large that the provided
        substance quantity can be solidified only once or be a multiple
        thereof. In the latter case, however, the sorption agent should
        also be able to release heat from time to time. </p>
      <p>[0008] The sorption agent can attain temperatures of over
        100.degree. C. during the sorption process. They are
        sufficiently high for heating or keeping foods and/or beverages
        warm. </p>
      <p>[0009] In accordance with the invention, the sorption agent
        quantity is to be dimensioned and placed in such a way that only
        a minimal pressure decline within the sorption agent must be
        overcome for the inflowing water vapor. The pressure decline may
        not be more than 5 mbar. Moreover, the sorption agent must offer
        sufficient surface area to the inflowing water vapor for
        accumulation. On the other hand, the bulk density of the
        sorption agent used may not be excessively low, so that no
        appreciable water vapor can flow through the bed to the vacuum
        pump. Thus, the bulk density and diameter of the individual
        sorption agent granules must be adapted to this requirement as a
        function of type of sorption agent. With granules that contain
        zeolite, the bulk density is 2 to 5 cm with a typical granule
        diameter of 3 to 5 mm. </p>
      <p>[0010] In accordance with the invention, the vacuum system must
        be designed in such a way that the air and vapor flow suctioned
        through the vacuum pump are guided through the sorption
        substance and not partially past it. In addition, care should be
        taken that within the sorption agent filling, no nonsorbable
        gases remain that prevent the water vapor from reaching the
        sorption substance. </p>
      <p>[0011] The solidification container can assume any arbitrary
        form and be made from any materials. Technically, it is
        absolutely necessary that during the solidification process, a
        sufficiently large opening exists for the flow of the water
        vapor into the sorption agent. In accordance with the invention,
        it must be removable from the vacuum system with the solidified
        substance. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is advantageous if the aqueous substance can be
        suctioned into the vacuum chamber or if the aqueous substance is
        already contained in the solidification container when brought
        into the vacuum system. Furthermore, it may be advantageous if
        the solidification container is transparent or edible.
        Transparent containers permit an observation of the
        solidification process, if surrounding parts of the vacuum
        system make possible a look at the solidification container. For
        the case of ice cream production, the solidification container
        can assume the form, for example, of a waffle cone. </p>
      <p>[0013] It may be particularly appropriate to close the
        solidification container, still under vacuum airtight after the
        solidification process. It is advantageous, for example, if the
        solidified substance is frozen water or salt water, which is to
        be used as a cold-accumulator. As a result of the airtight
        packaging, the product to be cooled is not wetted and, because
        of the air-free packing, there is optimal heat transfer to the
        product. In these cases, it is appropriate to make the
        solidification container from a flexible, bag-like film
        material. Under vacuum, it presses close to the shapes of the
        solidified substance and optimally, if necessary, to the
        contained sorption agent. For longer vacuum periods, it is
        recommendable to use multilayer film material. Such multilayer
        films are used in the food industry, for example, as packaging
        material for ground coffee. For the method of the invention,
        reference is made to the known packaging technology in vacuum
        packaging machines, in order to heat-seal films under vacuum
        airtight. The heat-sealing of film bags under vacuum is in many
        applications, especially the food field, state of the art. </p>
      <p>[0014] According to the invention, the vacuum-packaged,
        solidified substance can take on the form or application of the
        product to be cooled. Also, the form of the vacuum chamber can
        be appropriately matched in this respect. For example, the shape
        of a drinking or portable vessel can be cited. Either a vessel
        containing the liquid can be placed into the (evacuated)
        solidification container or the solidification container itself
        can be shaped to hold the liquid or food directly. </p>
      <p>[0015] The closing under vacuum is particularly efficient if,
        in addition to the solidified substance, the hot sorption agent
        is also closed within the airtight solidification container
        under vacuum. In this case, the sorption device continues to
        function even after removal from the vacuum system. Water vapor
        can also flow from the solidified substance to the sorption
        agent, and the generation of cold in the substance and the
        release of heat from the sorption agent can be maintained. The
        prerequisite, however, is that the water vapor can also flow
        within the solidified substance and to the sorption agent. In
        accordance with the invention, the solidified substance and the
        solidification container can be characterized by a predetermined
        geometry of the vacuum chamber, which favors the flow, so that
        the flow path for the water vapor is formed by the solidified
        substance itself. Fibrous materials in which the aqueous
        substance is absorbed and which expand during the evaporation of
        the outflowing water vapor have proved to be effective for this
        case. After solidification, the vapor continues to flow to the
        sorption agent through the expanded cavity structure without the
        flow being stopped by the film bag pressed strongly by the outer
        excess pressure. A thermally insulating layer is located, in
        this case, between the solidified substance and the sorption
        agent. </p>
      <p>[0016] Technically and economically interesting are
        solidification containers in the form of portable food trays
        with adjacent hot and cold placement surfaces. They can be
        shaped advantageously to form shells into which the foods can be
        directly poured. Also advantageous are hot and cold
        accumulators, in which the hot and cold sides are opposite one
        another. These can be optimally used to separate hot and cold
        areas in cooling boxes and portable packaging. Here, an
        insulating spacer material, which ensures the vapor flow to the
        sorption agent even in the solidification container pressed by
        outer air pressure, is placed between the hot and cold areas. </p>
      <p>[0017] Due to the low pressure within the vacuum system,
        not-yet solidified aqueous substances can be suctioned in from a
        container located outside the vacuum chamber. Mechanical
        conveying devices in the supply conduits are therefore
        superfluous. It has proved particularly effective to equip the
        end of the conduit with a nozzle, which imparts angular momentum
        to the aqueous substance when entering the vacuum chamber and/or
        which atomizes it into a jet of fine drops. </p>
      <p>[0018] It is particularly advantageous to construct the
        conduits in the form of flexible hoses. They can then be easily
        inserted into commercial supply containers. Mineral water
        bottles, kegs, milk bottles, and fruit juice containers, for
        example, have proven to be good supply containers for the
        aqueous substances. </p>
      <p>[0019] It is also advantageous to lay several conduits into the
        vacuum chamber. In this way, several substances can be
        solidified one after the other (or also simultaneously) in one
        evacuation process. In the case of ice cream substances, various
        types of ice cream can be frozen onto or into one another.
        Moreover, the vacuum chamber is immediately ready to function
        for different types of ice cream. When a desired type of ice
        cream is required, only the conduit provided for it need be
        opened. </p>
      <p>[0020] During their inflow into the vacuum chamber, many
        substances foam, particularly fat-containing substances, and
        freeze in this foamed state. The increase in volume may easily
        reach 20 times that of the liquid state. New, previously unknown
        product forms are thereby produced. </p>
      <p>[0021] With other aqueous substances, it may be of interest to
        rotate and mix the solidified substance by means of stirrers.
        Also, in this case, novel forms of appearance can be generated.
        By means of foam-sweeping devices, it is also possible to
        suppress undesired foaming of the aqueous substances. </p>
      <p>[0022] The foaming of frozen substances, using rotating blades
        to form pasty, foam-like structures, is also known. These
        treatment techniques can also be used with the
        already-solidified substances within the evacuation device. It
        is advantageous if this takes place with the introduction of
        suitable gases, such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas). The frozen
        structure thus differs not only in external form but also in
        internal composition from previously known commercial forms. </p>
      <p>[0023] In accordance with the invention, the aqueous substance
        can also be suctioned into an absorbent matrix before
        solidification. In this case, potential foaming or spraying is
        suppressed. Fibrous substances, such as wadding, or
        channel-forming structures, such as corrugated cardboard and,
        also, edible pastries are advantageous. </p>
      <p>[0024] It is also advantageous to preserve the aqueous
        substance in a separate storage and transport packaging before
        solidification. This packaging is then opened before placing in
        the evacuation device and the suitably filled, aqueous substance
        is subsequently frozen. It is particularly advantageous if the
        transport packaging can be constructed in such a way that it
        automatically bursts at a location provided for this purpose
        under vacuum, releasing and distributing the aqueous substance.
        It is also advantageous if the transport packaging can be a part
        of the solidification container. In this case, the sorption
        agent may already be packaged in the solidification container,
        since the water of the aqueous substance will then not be able
        to reach the sorption agent during the storage period. Such
        packaging units contain the aqueous substance and required
        sorption agent in a user-friendly size, suitable to a portion. </p>
      <p>[0025] When using fibrous materials, it may, moreover, be
        appropriate to shape the still-formable fibrous material by a
        suitable shaping of the vacuum chamber in the area of the
        placement of the solidification container in such a way that
        after the solidification of the aqueous substance, the flow path
        for the water vapor from the substance to be solidified to the
        sorption agent is retained. Flow channels and a self-supporting
        structure can thus be produced solely by freezing, without
        additional supporting means. </p>
      <p>[0026] The task of the vacuum pump is to lower, as quickly as
        possible, the system pressure below the water vapor pressure of
        the substance to be solidified. A pump with a high suction
        volume is advantageous if the pumping time is to be kept as
        short as possible. On the other hand, a small pumping output is
        sufficient during the solidification process, so as to suction
        the released nonsorbable gases from the sorption substance. If
        oil-lubricated, sliding vane rotary vacuum pumps are to be used,
        one must be careful that an oil suction guard is present and the
        discharge of oil mist from the blow-out is suppressed. In a
        commercial vacuum packing, corresponding vacuum pumps with a
        suction output above approximately 20 m.sup.3/h are used. If
        these pumps can reach the required end pressure of less than 6
        mbar, they are also suitable for use in accordance with the
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0027] It may be particularly advantageous if the vacuum can be
        produced without electrical power. In this regard, European
        Patent EP 611888 describes, for example, a manually operable
        pump, which attains a sufficiently low end pressure. </p>
      <p>[0028] The vacuum system should be designed advantageously in
        such a way that the water vapor can load the sorption substance
        uniformly. The fraction of cavities and conduits not filled with
        the sorption substance should be as small as possible, so as to
        be able to reach the needed operating pressure quickly. </p>
      <p>[0029] During the sorption reaction, sorption heat is released,
        which heats the sorption substance. The absorbing capacity for
        water greatly declines at elevated temperatures. In order to
        maintain a high cooling output over a longer period of time, it
        is reasonable to cool the sorption agent by means of suitable
        cooling devices. In this regard, heat exchangers for air or
        special cooling water circulations are advantageous. It is also
        very efficient to place the sorption container in a water bath.
        The water heated during the cooling process can be subsequently
        used to clean the device. </p>
      <p>[0030] The task of the sorption agent is to sorb the water
        vapor, that is, to condense and bind the water vapor within the
        crystal structure. Sorption agents have only a limited
        absorption capacity for water molecules. This capacity is
        exhausted when, despite the running of the vacuum pump, the
        solidification output declines or even the solidification
        temperature can no longer be reached. In this case, the sorption
        agent must be replaced with a fresh agent or must be regenerated
        by a supply of heat. In the first case, the vacuum system has an
        opening through which the saturated sorption agent quantity can
        be removed and be replaced by a regenerated agent. </p>
      <p>[0031] To regenerate the sorption agent, it must be heated,
        depending on the material used, to temperatures between
        150.degree. C. and 300.degree. C. If this occurs within the
        vacuum system, the released water vapor must be able to flow off
        safely. Advantageously, the desorption takes place by means of
        hot air within the vacuum system. The outflowing air carries the
        desorbed water vapor along from the vacuum chamber. For the case
        that the entire sorption agent filling is renewed, it is
        advantageous to pack it in a vapor-permeable housing in such a
        way that it can be replaced together with the housing. As a
        vapor-permeable housing, structures made of expanded metal, wire
        netting, wire grating, and temperature-stable mesh are
        advantageous. </p>
      <p>[0032] Zeolite is advantageously used as the sorption agent.
        Zeolite can sorb up to 36 mass% water, reversibly, in its
        regular crystal structure. Even at relatively high temperatures
        (above 80.degree. C.) it still has a considerable water vapor
        sorption capacity and is therefore particularly suitable for use
        in accordance with the invention. </p>
      <p>[0033] Zeolite is a crystalline mineral, which consists of a
        regular lattice structure of silicon and aluminum oxides. This
        lattice structure contains cavities into which water molecules
        can be sorbed with the release of heat. Within the lattice
        structure, the water molecules are exposed to great field
        forces, whose strength depends on the water quantity already
        contained in the lattice structure and on the temperature of the
        zeolite. For practical use, up to 25 grams of water can be
        sorbed per 100 grams of zeolite. Zeolites are solid substances
        without a disturbing volume expansion during the sorption or
        desorption reaction. The lattice structure can be freely
        accessed from all sides by the water vapor molecules. As a
        result of the rapid sorption reaction involved, they are
        particularly suitable for use in accordance with the invention.
      </p>
      <p>[0034] For an economical mode of operation, zeolite
        temperatures of 250 to 350.degree. C. during regeneration and of
        50 to 120.degree. C. during sorption are recommended. It is
        particularly advantageous to carry out the regeneration during a
        hot air flow at air temperatures above 300.degree. C. If the
        zeolite filling is located in a thin layer, the regeneration can
        be concluded within a few minutes. </p>
      <p>[0035] In order to guarantee uniform sorption within the loaded
        sorption agent and a low pressure decline, sorption agent
        granules have proven particularly effective. Granule diameters
        between 3 and 5 mm exhibit the best results. Particularly with
        flexible solidification containers which also contain the
        sorption agent quantity under vacuum, in addition to the
        solidified substance, plate-shaped zeolite molded articles with
        fine flow channels have proven effective. They are easy to
        handle, stable under pressure, and also remain dimensionally
        stable under pressure, which is different from the case of a
        loose granule bed. </p>
      <p>[0036] "Aqueous substances" refers to substances that contain
        at least enough water to be able to lower the remaining
        substance to the desired temperature level during the complete
        evaporation of the water quantity. Examples of liquids in
        accordance with the invention are water, salt water, juices,
        soft drinks, coffee, tea, milk, and milk products, such as ice
        cream mixtures. Also, liquids enriched with more readily
        volatile substances, such as carbonic acid, alcohol, or aromatic
        substances, fall under this designation, although they are less
        suitable for direct cooling because of the parallel evaporation
        of more readily volatile admixtures. By using vacuum pumps with
        a strong suction, these readily volatile substances, however,
        can be suctioned through the sorption agent. </p>
      <p>[0037] In order to produce the maximum amount of cold, the
        sorption agent must be able to conduct away its sorption
        heat--to the outside, for example--between several
        solidification processes. A particularly intensive cooling
        effect is attained if the sorber container has a sufficiently
        large heat exchange surface for the surrounding air flow. It is
        advantageous if the sorption agent can be cooled to the ambient
        temperature, in order to be able to sorb the largest possible
        quantity of water vapor. Solid sorption agents have, however,
        low thermal conduction and poor heat transfer. Since the heat
        transfer of an air flow to the sorption-agent heat exchanger is
        on the same order of magnitude, heat exchangers without fins are
        recommended, in principle, such as cylindrical, plate-shaped or
        tubular configurations. Since, in particular, zeolite granules
        have a low thermal conduction, the sorption containers must be
        designed in such a way that the average heat conduction path for
        the converted water quantities does not exceed 5 cm. </p>
      <p>[0038] If, in accordance with the invention, a new sorption
        agent is used for each solidification process, a separate heat
        exchanger is not necessary, since the heat released in the
        sorption agent is released outside the vacuum system via the
        container wall. </p>
      <p>[0039] Other sorption agents, which sorb water vapor and remain
        solid during the sorption reaction, however, can also be used.
        Some solid sorption agents, such as molecular sieves, are stable
        enough to be able to support even thin container walls against
        excess external pressure without a change in volume. Additional
        rigid structures or thick-walled heat exchanger surfaces are
        therefore not necessary. This characteristic can be advantageous
        with vacuum-tight solidification containers in accordance with
        the invention. </p>
      <p>[0040] It may also be advantageous to provide the container
        containing the sorption agent with thermal insulation, in order
        to minimize the heat loss to the surroundings during the
        desorption process. </p>
      <p>[0041] The preferred embodiments of the method and devices for
        the rapid solidification of aqueous substances, as well as other
        objects, features and advantages of this invention, will be
        apparent from the following detailed description, which is to be

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0049] The evacuation device according to FIG. 1 consists of a
        vacuum pump 1, which can evacuate one sorption agent container 2
        and a vacuum chamber 3. The sorption agent container 2 contains
        a sorption agent 4, embedded in a metallic perforated sheet
        housing 16 for the unhindered acceptance of water vapor. The
        transparent vacuum chamber 3, which can be removed from the
        sorption agent container 2 on a packing strip 19 also contains a
        transparent solidification container 6 into which an aqueous
        substance 7 is sprayed from a nozzle 8. By a momentary
        evaporation of water from the aqueous substance 7, a foam-like
        solidified substance 5 is formed. The nozzle 8 is connected to
        supply tanks 12, 13 for aqueous substances 7 via a conduit 9 and
        solenoids 10, 11. The evacuation device can be vented through a
        venting valve 14. The sorption agent container 2 can be
        separated from the rest of the vacuum system at a connection
        site 20, and, as shown in FIG. 2, can be set on a regeneration
        unit 21. This contains a connection piece 22 for arrangement of
        the sorption container 2, an electrical heating device 23, and a
        blower 24, which moves the heated air along arrows 25 through
        the sorption agent 4 under pressure. </p>
      <p>[0050] FIG. 1 a shows a cross section of the cylindrical
        sorption container 2 along line A-A of FIG. 1. Along the
        cylindrical outside shell 26, thirteen flow channels 17 are
        located, via which air and nonsorbable gases from the vacuum
        system must be suctioned without drawing off water vapor at the
        same time. Due to the cylindrical arrangement, the water vapor
        (and the nonsorbable gases) flow far into the sorption agent 4
        along the interior channel 18. There is a large inflow surface
        for the rapid sorption of the large water vapor volumes along
        the interior channel 18. The uniform distribution of the flow
        channels 17 along the outside shell 26 ensures that the flow
        path for the water vapor within the sorption agent 4 is
        uniformly long. Only in this way can it be ensured that all
        sorption agent areas can sorb water vapor sufficiently before
        the first water vapor molecules reach the flow channels 17 and
        are suctioned by the vacuum pump. Between the flow channels 17,
        there is a sufficiently large contact surface for the sorption
        agent 4 with the outside shell 26 of the sorption container 2,
        in order to be able to release sorption heat to the environment.
      </p>
      <p>[0051] In the evacuation device according to FIG. 1, in
        accordance with the invention, the solidification container 6
        for the solidification of aqueous substances 7 is inserted into
        the vacuum chamber 3, and the vacuum chamber 3 is placed
        vacuum-tight on the sorption agent container 2. The vacuum pump
        1 is started with the venting valve 14 closed. It suctions gas
        from the vacuum system through the sorption agent 4. With an
        interior pressure of less than 6 mbar (abs.), one (or both) of
        the solenoids 10, 11 is opened. Aqueous substance 7, for
        example, a finished mixture for the preparation of ice cream, is
        suctioned from the nozzle 8. The finished mixture can then flow
        from the supply tanks 12, 13 via the conduit 9. By the sudden
        evaporation in the vacuum system, the substance 7 solidifies to
        form a foam-like ice structure 5. The water vapor flows via the
        interior channel 18, along the vapor arrows 17, into the
        sorption agent 4. Here, the vapor is momentarily sorbed and
        embedded into the cavity structure of the sorption agent 4. Only
        nonsorbable gases are suctioned by the vacuum pump 1 through the
        sorption agent 4, along the arrows 15. The quantity of the
        sorption agent 4 is dimensioned in such a way that in spite of
        the temperature increase, water vapor is sufficiently evaporated
        from the substance to be solidified and can be absorbed by the
        sorption agent. After solidified substance 5 is sufficiently
        produced, the solenoids 10, 11 are closed; the vacuum pump 1 is
        turned off; and the venting valve 14 is opened. Upon opening the
        venting valve 14, both the aqueous substance 7, still located in
        the conduit 9, and the conduit 9 are cleaned, together with the
        nozzle 8. After the quick flooding of the evacuation device, the
        vacuum chamber 3 can be lifted and the solidification container
        6, together with the solidified substance 5, can be removed.
        Then, with loading of sufficiently dimensioned sorption agent,
        the next solidification process can be initiated, without any
        waiting time. </p>
      <p>[0052] In order to regenerate saturated sorption agent 4 within
        the sorption agent container 2, the container is separated from
        the remaining vacuum system and placed on the connection pieces
        22 of the regeneration unit 21 (FIG. 2). By means of the blower
        24 and the electrical heating device 23, hot air of at least
        200.degree. C. is pressed through the sorption agent 4 in the
        reverse flow direction 25. The hot air heats the sorption agent
        4 and transports the thereby desorbed water vapor from the
        sorption container 2. Regeneration is then considered concluded
        if the water vapor flow from the sorption agent ceases and/or
        the temperature of the sorption agent 4 is homogeneous that of
        the hot air. After the cooling of the sorption agent 4, the
        sorption agent container 2 can again be integrated with the
        remaining evacuation device. </p>
      <p>[0053] FIG. 3 shows another embodiment of an evacuation device
        in accordance with the invention. The vacuum pump 1 is connected
        to a vacuum chamber 30 that can be closed vacuum-tight via a
        transparent cover 31 and a seal 32. A flexible, bag-like
        solidification container 34 is in the vacuum chamber 30, in
        which a plate-like sorption agent 35 and an aqueous substance 36
        are contained. The aqueous substance 36 is bound in an absorbent
        material 43, which is covered on its upper side with a
        water-repellant, vapor-permeable and insulating spacer material
        37. The spacer material 37 is used, on the one hand, to guide
        the water vapor flowing away from the aqueous substance 36
        specifically to the sorption agent 35 during the sorption
        reaction and, on the other hand, to prevent the water from
        reaching the sorption agent 35 in liquid form. </p>
      <p>[0054] The opening 38 of the solidification container 34 is
        located between two heat-sealing terminals 39, which heat-seal
        the solidification container 34 vacuum-tight when the upper
        heat-sealing terminal 39 is lowered in the direction of the
        double arrow 44 while still under vacuum. </p>
      <p>[0055] For the solidification of the aqueous substance 36
        according to FIG. 3, a flexible container 34 in the form of a
        multilayer film bag, which already contains the sorption agent
        35, the spacer material 37, and a nonaqueous absorbent material
        43, is first opened at a provided site. The absorbent material
        is then soaked with water by immersing in a water pan. The unit
        thus prepared is pushed into the solidification container 34,
        which, together with it, is placed in the vacuum chamber 30 with
        the opening 38 between the two heat-sealing pincers 39. During
        the insertion, care should be taken that, particularly in the
        area 40, the spacer material and the solidification container 34
        form a barrier that is impenetrable to water vapor. In no way
        should the water vapor be suctioned by the vacuum pump,
        circumventing the sorption agent 35. The cover 31 and the
        venting valve 14 are then closed and the vacuum pump 1 started.
        The water begins to evaporate as soon as the falling pressure
        level has reached the vapor pressure of the hydrous substance
        36. The water vapor flows through the spacer material 37 to the
        sorption agent 35, which immediately sorbs it. With a further
        reduction in pressure, the solidification point is reached,
        where the hydrous substance 36 begins to freeze. At the latest,
        at this time, the opening 38 of the solidification container 34
        can be sealed vacuum-tight by actuating the heat-sealing
        terminal 39. The vacuum pump 1 can then be turned off, and the
        vacuum chamber 30 flooded via the venting valve 14. After
        opening of the cover 31, the solidification container 34 can be
        removed from the vacuum system and conveyed to its destination.
        Since the sorption reaction continues inside the vacuum-sealed
        solidification container 34, heat from the sorption agent 35 and
        cold from the solidified substance 36 are released. </p>
      <p>[0056] FIG. 4 shows a possible application of the vacuum-sealed
        solidification container 34. The lower portion of paper
        packaging 42 contains foods 40 to be cooled, such as beverage
        cans and salad bowls. Above this area are located the evacuated
        solidification container 34 with the solidified substance 36,
        pointing down. The heat-releasing sorption agent 35 heats warm
        foods 41, such as a hamburger and french fries, located above
        it. As the aqueous substance 36, one can use tap water. The
        solidification point is then exactly at 0.degree. C.
        Advantageously, salt water can also be used. The freezing point
        is then, depending on the salt content, clearly below 0.degree.
        C., in the coldest case, at -18.degree.. Even at these low
        temperatures, the zeolite plate used as the sorption agent 35
        can release heat to a level above 80.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0057] Advantageously, the solidification container 34 is also
        to be placed vertically in an insulated box (not shown), and the
        interior space of the box is to be subdivided into adjacent cold
        and warm areas. </p>
      <p>[0058] FIG. 4a shows another advantageous embodiment of a
        solidification container 54 in the form of a food tray. The flat
        food tray contains a cold area traversed by flow channels 53,
        which consists of frozen corrugated cardboard previously soaked
        with water. The solidification takes place in a vacuum chamber
        similar to FIG. 3. In this embodiment, the sorption agent 4 is a
        flat, pressed zeolite plate 50 with incorporated flow channels
        51. The thermally insulating spacer material 52 is made of
        plastic films shaped like corrugated cardboard, which permit the
        unhindered flow of the vapor, although the film bag 55 lies
        against the inside structures due to the external air pressure.
        The opening 56 of the film bag 55 is heat-sealed vacuum-tight.
        Since the sorption reaction can take place even outside the
        evacuation device, thanks to the vacuum-tight channels 53, 51,
        the food tray cools and heats the foods set aside for eating.
        The food tray can contain additional indentations and borders,
        which can be used for the direct holding or separating of foods.
      </p>
      <p>[0059] FIG. 5 shows another advantageous evacuation device.
        Reference symbols, which already occur in the preceding
        drawings, are retained. </p>
      <p>[0060] The sorption agent 4 is located in the lower part of the
        vacuum chamber 57 in good contact with an electrical heating
        device 58. The vacuum pump 1 suctions air and nonsorbable gases
        from the vacuum chamber 57 via a flow channel 59 running below
        the sorption agent 4. There is a flexible multilayer bag 61 on a
        pan 60 placed above the sorption agent 4, which contains an
        absorbent material 43, soaked with the aqueous substance 7. The
        solidification container 53 can be introduced into the vacuum
        chamber 50 via a cover 31. The opening 38 of the multilayer bag
        61 is also located in this arrangement between two movable
        heat-sealing terminals 39. In contrast to FIG. 3, the sorption
        agent 4 is located outside the solidification container. For the
        regeneration, it remains inside the vacuum chamber 57. It can be
        heated via the electrical heating device 58. The escaping water
        vapor flows unhindered through the cover 31, which is then
        opened. </p>
      <p>[0061] At the beginning of the evacuation process, the
        absorbent material 43 soaked with the aqueous substance 7 is
        placed in the multilayer bag 61, the opening 38 of which is
        placed in turn between the heat-sealing terminals 39. After
        closing the cover 31 and the venting valve 14, the vacuum pump 1
        also pumps down the vacuum chamber 57. The water vapor flowing
        away from the substance 7 to be solidified is sorbed by the
        sorption agent 4. After the solidification of the substance 7,
        the multilayer bag 61 is sealed while still under vacuum, and
        after flooding, the vacuum chamber 57 is subsequently removed.
        The ice accumulator formed within a few seconds in this way can,
        for example, be used to keep foods and beverages cold in cooling
        pockets. Since the water that melts with time is under vacuum,
        there is good thermal contact with the multilayer bag 61. The
        melted water cannot moisten the contents of the cooling pocket.
      </p>
      <p>[0062] Although the preferred embodiments of the present
        invention have been described with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that other changes and
        modifications may be made by one skilled in the art without
        departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. </p>
