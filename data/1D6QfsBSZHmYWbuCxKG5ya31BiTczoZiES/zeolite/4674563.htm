    <blockquote><b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to blanks made from zeolite which adsorb
        and desorb an adsorbed substance and a process for making the
        same. </p>
      <p>Zeolite crystals adsorb liquid and gaseous adsorbed substances
        under heat development. The released reaction heat must be
        dissipated from the zeolite material during the adsorption and
        must again be fed thereto during the desorption (separation of
        both substances). The reaction kinetic of the adsorption and
        desorption process is limited by a low heat conductivity of
        zeolite mass and by high pressure drops of the adsorbed
        substance which either flows thereto or therefrom. </p>
      <p>The diameter of synthetic zeolite crystals is limited to a few
        micrometer. Powder fillings are not suitable for technical
        absorbing processes, since the fine zeolite crystals are
        subjected to turbulence and are carried out from the reaction
        spaces by the flow of the adsorbed substances. A further
        processing of the powderlike zeolite products in specific but
        expensive granulating processes by adding of binders in
        granulate, for example, small balls or cylinder permits the use
        of zeolite in drying processes. In these processes moist gases
        flow through the granulate fillers and emit the moisture to the
        granulate fillers. In this manner the dry gases absorb the
        generated reaction heat and cool the granulate. Hot and dry
        gases are fed in the subsequent process step for desorption of
        the granulate fillers. They transmit the reaction heat to the
        granulate and absorb the released moisture. In these so-called
        open processes the gases flow around each granulate body. The
        total surface of the granulate body is available for the heat
        exchange. </p>
      <p>Zeolite granulates for the adsorption of steam in adsorption
        heat pumps and air conditioners are suggested in a plurality of
        patent applications. There the zeolite crystals adsorb steam in
        a closed process. Gas flows which could transmit the reaction
        heat are not available. The heat must be fed and dissipated from
        the outside by specific heat exchangers. The heat can only be
        transmitted via the contact faces of the granulate fillers.
        Therefore, the heat transmission is not dependent on the
        granulate surface but from the number of contact locations of
        the granulates among each other and with respect to the heat
        exchanger. Hence, the heat conductivity is therefore lower with
        fillers than with homogenic substances. The flow resistance is
        higher than in comparable flow conduits with smooth surfaces. </p>
      <p>The DE No. 3 207 656 A1 suggests zeolite blanks which are
        adapted to the heat exchanger surfaces and which are provided
        with flow conduits that are most favorably designed for the
        adsorbed substance. After only a few desorption cycles the
        zeolite blanks detach from the heat exchanger surfaces. Thin
        slots are created which limit the heat transfer even more
        severely than with granulate fillers. Severely fluctuating
        temperature and load gradients generate cracks and slots within
        the blanks which additionally lower the heat conductivity.
        Broken-off zeolite parts block the flow conduits and prevent the
        access of the adsorbed substance to the zeolite. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is therefore an object of the invention to increase the
        inner heat conductivity and the heat transfer to an adjacent
        heat exchanger in blanks made of zeolite and to assure it even
        under severely fluctuating temperature and load conditions.
        Simultaneously, the flow resistance for the given adsorbed
        substances is to be reduced to a minimum. </p>
      <p>The object of the invention is solved in that the zeolite mass
        is imbedded into a fine meshed metal texture. The metal texture
        prevents a bursting and a breaking down of the zeolite blanks
        and simultaneously increases the heat conductivity. The low heat
        conductivity of the zeolite substance is considerably improved
        by the good heat conductivity of the metal structures.
        Particularly high adsorption speed can be obtained by a dense
        metal texture made from gold, silver, copper, aluminum, etc.,
        and by a flat method of construction of the blanks. </p>
      <p>In order to assure an unobstructed access for the adsorbed
        substances to the zeolite crystals, certain areas within the
        blank are not filled with zeolite mass. It is particularly
        advantageous when the outer zones of the metal texture are not
        covered with zeolite. Thus, a breaking off of small zeolite
        pieces and a blocking of the flow conduits can be effectively
        prevented. </p>
      <p>Particularly fine meshed metal textures retain zeolite powder
        which is not solidified with a binder or only solidified to a
        lesser degree. Low amounts of binder components are advantageous
        for high heat conditions. In one form the binder content is
        lower in the inner area of the blank than in the edge zones. The
        outer areas which are more exposed to erosion will receive a
        higher portion of binder than the less stressed inner areas. </p>
      <p>Fine meshed metal structures, like steel wool, metal textures,
        metal shavings and metal fleeces are suitable as metal textures.
        Particularly advantageous are metallic filter materials, like
        RETIMET.RTM. or BEKIPOR.RTM.. These commercial products have
        very good heat conductivity and retaining characteristics due to
        the dense interlacing structure of these products. </p>
      <p>It is contemplated that a breaking off of the blanks from the
        heat exchanger surfaces can be prevented by having the metal
        texture adhere permanently to the heat exchanger surfaces.
        Different heat expansions between the metal texture and the
        zeolite crystals are compensated for by the elasticity of the
        metal structure. </p>
      <p>For making the connections the following techniques are very
        useful, sintering, welding, galvanizing and tinning, soldering,
        among others. With the assistance of these connecting techniques
        one does not only achieve a permanent and good heat conductive
        coupling of the metal structure to the heat exchanger surfaces,
        but also to the inner interlacing metal structure at the
        crossing points of the texture. </p>
      <p>A flowable zeolite mixture consisting of zeolite powder, water
        and, if need be, binders are fed to the metal texture or the
        metal texture is immersed therein for making the blanks.
        Encapsulated hollow spaces can be filled by high frequency
        shaking on the metal texture. During a careful drying at
        temperatures of below 100.degree. C. the superfluous water is
        evaporated from the zeolite mixture. The remaining zeolite
        crystals connect with the metal texture and the admixed binders
        into solid, stable blanks. </p>
      <p>The outer areas of the metal structure which are not to be
        filled with zeolite mixture are advantageously filled with water
        which is subsequently frozen. </p>
      <p>The ice melts during the drying process and the water
        evaporates. Thus flow conduits are generated for the adsorbed
        substances. Since the conduits are filled with metal texture, no
        zeolite particles can break off and block the conduits. Flow
        conduits within the blanks may be kept free from zeolite in that
        the metal texture is removed or displaced from the flow conduits
        in a first operating step and that the flow conduits are filled
        with adaptable ice pieces which are frozen into the metal
        textures in a further processing step. The metal structure which
        had been prepared in this manner can be subsequently filled with
        the zeolite mixture. After the melting of the ice pieces, the
        flow conduits are free for the flow of the adsorptive substance.
      </p>
      <p>Flow conduits are generated in a further process in that the
        metal structure is deformed after filling with flowable zeolite
        mixture. For this purpose, pressing or roller tools are
        advantageously suitable which press the flow conduits into the
        still soft blank. Compressions are generated in the metal
        structure with this process in the transition zones from the
        blank to the flow conduits. The wall of the flow conduits become
        so strong that an additional subsequent lining of the flow
        conduits with a metal texture may be partially eliminated. The
        pressing tool remains in the blank until the blank is partially
        solidified, so that the conduits cannot fill with the zeolite
        mixture any longer. The solidification process can be
        accelerated by heating the pressing tool. The water in the
        zeolite mixture evaporates when contacted by the hot pressing
        tool. A thin layer of solidified zeolite is generated. A
        penetration of still flowable zeolite mixture is prevented after
        removal of the pressing tool. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b> </p>
      <p>A section of a laminated heat exchanger is illustrated in FIG.
        1. The blanks of zeolite 1 are mounted between the heat
        exchanger plates 2. The metal textures 3 are connected in a good
        heat conducting manner with the heat exchanger plates 2 by means
        of a resistance welding process. The blanks 1 have areas which
        are not filled with zeolite. These flow conduits 4 permit the
        adsorbed substances a rapid access to the zeolite crystals. </p>
      <p>An exemplified embodiment of a blank made from zeolite 1 is
        illustrated in FIG. 2 being mounted on a heat exchanger plate 2.
        The outer areas of the metal structure 4 are kept free from
        zeolite by a lining with ice. The flow conduits 5 on the upper
        side of the blank were produced by the pressing tools. The
        conduits are lined with a metal texture. </p>
      <p>Thus, the several aforementioned objects and advantages are
        most effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred
        embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein,
        it should be understood that this invention is in no sense
        limited thereby and its scope is to be determined by that of the
        appended claims.</p>
