      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Disclosed is a cooling container for use in a sorption
        apparatus. The cooling container is adapted for containing a
        liquid operating medium, which, during the adsorption phase of
        operation of the adsorption apparatus, cools off by partial
        evaporation and solidifies into a solidifying layer starting
        from the surface of liquid operating medium. In general, the
        cooling container comprises a vessel and a heat exchanger. The
        vessel is provided for containing the operating medium, which
        during the adsorption phase, cools off by partial evaporation
        and forms the solidifying layer which grows from the surface
        downwardly into the vessel until the solidifying layer obtains a
        maximum thickness. The heat exchanger on the other hand is
        provided for adsorbing heat from a liquid passing through the
        heat exchanger, and is positioned in the vessel and within the
        liquid (e.g. beverage) operating medium so that during the
        adsorption phase, the heat exchanger does not come into contact
        with the downwardly growing solidifying layer of operating
        medium, and also so that the liquid operating medium below the
        solidifying layer transfers the heat adsorbed by the heat
        exchanger, to the solidified layer of operating medium. Thus,
        with the cooling container of the present invention, the heat
        exchanger and liquid (e.g. beverage) passing therethrough are
        prevented from ever being exposed to temperatures below
        freezing. Consequently, ice formation within the heat exchanger
        itself is prevented using a very simply highly effective
        temperature control mechanism.</p>

    <blockquote><b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p><b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a cooling container for a
        sorption apparatus in which an operating medium cools off
        therein by partial evaporation and solidifies starting from the
        surface of the operating medium in the cooling container. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>A sorption apparatus is an apparatus wherein a liquid or solid
        adsorption medium adsorbs a second medium (i.e. the operating
        medium) as vapor at a higher temperature, thereby releasing
        heat. During the adsorption phase, the adsorption medium adsorbs
        the operating medium which is transformed into vapor as it
        evaporates upon absorbing heat from the heat exchanger in a
        cooling container. During the adsorption phase, the evaporating
        temperatures in the cooling container are in the range of
        between -40.degree. to +40.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Sorption apparatus with solid adsorption mediums, referred to
        as "adsorption" apparatuses, operate periodically, that is, an
        adsorption phase is always followed by a desorption phase
        wherein the operating medium (e.g. water) is again separated
        from the adsorption medium (e.g. zeolite). During the desorption
        phase, the operating medium cannot evaporate and can therefore
        not absorb any heat in the cooling container. Also, during the
        adsorption phase, the "evaporation capacity" in the cooling
        container is not constant since the sorption force of the
        adsorption medium depends on several factors; e.g. the
        temperature of the adsorption medium, and the given
        concentration of the operating medium in the adsorption medium.
        In order to maintain a constant evaporation capacity, or a
        constant evaporation temperature in the cooling container, an
        additional control effort is necessary with adsorption apparatus
        in particular. </p>
      <p>An example of a prior art cooling container of a
        periodically-operating adsorption apparatus, is disclosed in
        German Patent Application DE-OS 35 21 484. In such apparatus,
        during the adsorption phase, an ice bank is built up during
        partial evaporation of the water operating medium in the cooling
        container. In the above-referenced German Patent Application,
        the adsorption apparatus includes in addition to the cooling
        container, an adsorption container with a shut off means
        interposed between the adsorption container and the cooling
        container. During the adsorption phase, the water operating
        medium contained in the cooling container, partially evaporates
        and the remaining portion freezes to form ice. A heat exchanger
        is also provided in the cooling container and is used for
        cooling beverages, for example. In connection therewith, the
        beverage to be cooled is stored in a supply container, and is
        permitted to flow through the heat exchanger and transfer its
        heat to the water operating medium which is present in the
        cooling container. In order to control the discharge temperature
        of the beverage, a control unit is provided to control the
        evaporation temperature of the water by opening and closing of
        the shut off means. </p>
      <p>However, such a cooling container suffers from several
        significant shortcomings and drawbacks. When the control of the
        shut off means fails, the water operating liquid in the cooling
        container freezes into ice, which (due to the initiated
        sublimation process in the cooling container during the
        adsorption phase) cools down to a temperature far below
        0.degree. C. Consequently, the beverage which remains in the
        heat exchanger during this condition, freezes and thus a
        continuation of the beverage tapping process is interrupted. In
        addition, the provided control unit and the closable shut off
        means are complicated and expensive elements which renders such
        an equipped adsorption apparatus, prohibitively expensive.
        Consequently, such adsorption cooling apparatus is precluded
        from being used in a variety of cooling applications. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to
        provide a cooling container for an adsorption apparatus, which
        incorporates a simple, inexpensive and reliable way of allowing
        a liquid (such as a beverage) flowing through or remaining in
        the heat exchanger within the cooling container, from being
        cooled down below 0.degree. C. during the adsorption phase of
        operation. </p>
      <p>These and other objects of the present invention will become
        apparent hereinafter and in the claims. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In general, the cooling container of the present invention is
        for use with a sorption apparatus, and is adapted to contain a
        liquid operating medium, which, during the adsorption phase of
        operation of the sorption apparatus, cools off by partial
        evaporation and solidifies into a solidifying layer starting
        from the surface of the liquid operating medium. In general, the
        cooling container comprises a vessel and a heat exchanger. The
        vessel is provided for containing the operating medium, which
        during the adsorption phase, cools off by partial evaporation
        and forms the solidifying layer which grows from the surface
        downwardly into the vessel until the solidifying layer obtains a
        maximum thickness. The heat exchanger on the other hand is
        provided for adsorbing heat from a liquid (e.g. beverage)
        passing through the heat exchanger, and is positioned in the
        vessel and within the liquid operating medium so that during the
        adsorption phase, the heat exchanger does not come into contact
        with the downwardly growing solidifying layer of operating
        medium, and also so that the liquid operating medium below the
        solidifying layer transfers the heat adsorbed by the heat
        exchanger, to the solidified layer of operating medium. </p>
      <p>Thus, with the cooling container of the present invention, the
        heat exchanger and liquid (e.g. beverage) passing therethrough
        are prevented from ever being exposed to temperatures below
        freezing. Consequently, ice formation within the heat exchanger
        itself is prevented using a very simple, yet highly effective
        temperature control mechanism. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, the cross-sectional dimension of
        the vessel in the region of the solidified operating medium, is
        smaller than the cross-sectional dimension of the vessel in the
        region of the heat exchanger. Notably, this geometrical
        condition placed on the cooling container vessel results in a
        substantially higher vapor pressure drop within the cooling
        container vessel, and consequentially this higher pressure drop
        enables the use of a thinner ice layer. Thus, on the way through
        the thin ice layer, there is a sufficient vapor pressure drop to
        prevent growth of the ice layer beyond a predetermined distance
        within the cooling container, as desired. </p>
      <p>In the cooling container of the present invention, the volume
        of liquid operating medium above the heat exchanger is smaller
        than the maximum volume of the solidifying layer of operating
        medium during the adsorption phase, and the heat adsorbed by the
        liquid operating medium from the heat exchanger forms vapor
        operating medium below the solidifying layer, which flows toward
        the solidifying layer. Also, in the present invention, using the
        vapor pressure drop caused by the ice layer formation and the
        reduced cross-sectional dimension of the cooling container, the
        maximum thickness of the solidifying layer of operating medium
        is determined to be sufficient to increase the vapor pressure
        drop of the vapor operating medium so as to prevent further
        growth of the solidifying layer beyond the maximum thickness.
        This restriction of the solidifying (e.g. ice) layer, in turn,
        prevents the solidifying layer of operating medium from coming
        into contact with the heat exchanger, and thereby prevents the
        liquid (e.g. beverage) in the heat exchanger from freezing. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional periodically-operating
        sorption cooling apparatus comprising an adsorption container 1,
        a cooling container 2, and shut off means 3. The adsorption
        container 1 contains the adsorption medium 4 and the cooling
        container 2 contains the operating medium. While use of a
        variety of adsorption medium/operating medium pairs are possible
        with the present invention, in the preferred embodiment hereof,
        the zeolite/water pair is employed with excellent results. </p>
      <p>During the desorption phase, the shut-off means 3 is opened,
        and the adsorption medium 4 is heated in the adsorption
        container 1. As a result, the preadsorbed operating medium is
        desorbed from adsorption medium 4. The desorbed operating
        medium, in vapor form, flows through the shut off means 3 to the
        cooling container 2 and condenses therein by releasing heat of
        condensation. After separating the operating medium from the
        adsorption medium 4, the shut off means 3 is closed. Thereafter,
        the adsorption medium 4 is allowed to cool down to the ambient
        temperature without adsorbing the vapor-like and/or liquid
        operating medium in cooling container 2. </p>
      <p>The shut off means 3 is opened during the adsorption phase.
        Liquid operating medium can now be evaporated in (i.e. suctioned
        off from) the cooling container 2 and adsorbed by the adsorption
        medium 4. During the evaporation of the operating medium in
        cooling container 2, heat is released from the operating medium
        and as its temperature drops, it becomes very cold, and
        initially freezes rapidly to form a layer 9 of ice. This cooling
        effect can be used in different ways, depending on the use of
        the sorption apparatus. On the other hand, the heat which is
        released in the adsorption medium 4 during the adsorption phase,
        is discharged to the ambient environment through adsorption
        container 1. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, there is schematically illustrated a
        cooling container 5 constructed in accordance with the
        principles of the present invention. In the preferred
        embodiment, the cooling container 5 replaces the cooling
        container 2 of the sorption apparatus shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, a vapor pipe 6 discharges into the upper
        part of cooling container 5 with which the cooling container 5
        in the preferred embodiment is connected to an adsorption
        container of the type shown in FIG. 1. A schematically
        illustrated heat exchanger 7 shown in cross-sectional view, is
        provided in the lower portion of cooling container 5. As
        illustrated, this lower portion is flooded with an operating
        medium 8, such as water, when used for example with zeolite as
        an adsorption medium 4 in the adsorption container 1. As shown,
        the water 8 surrounds the heat exchanger 7 in a heat exchanging
        relationship. An ice layer 9 which forms during the adsorption
        phase of operation, is shown on top of the water layer 8, and
        does not reach the heat exchanger 7 as required by the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>Notably, FIG. 2 illustrates the condition of the cooling
        container 5 shown at a point in time, where the thickness of the
        ice layer 9 above the water operating medium 8, is maximum.
        Also, the cooling container 5 of the preferred embodiment has a
        cross-section in the area of the ice layer 9, which is smaller
        than in the area of the heat exchanger 7. The purpose of such a
        geometrical condition on the cooling container 5 of the present
        invention is to provide a larger vapor pressure drop on the way
        through the ice layer 9, so that the growth of the ice layer is
        stopped by a sufficiently high vapor pressure drop present
        within the cooling container 5. This feature of the present
        invention will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, the heat exchanger 7
        is arranged in the cooling container vessel 5 so that the heat
        exchanger 7 is not reachable by the downwardly expanding ice
        layer 9 formed during the adsorption phase of operation. In
        order to assure this critical condition in the cooling container
        5, the water level above the heat exchanger 7 in the cooling
        container 5 must be present in a sufficient amount at the start
        of the adsorption phase. This condition can be satisfied for the
        following reasons. Foremost, since the amount of the adsorption
        medium 4 in the adsorption container is determined for any given
        application, the maximum amount of ice generatable in the
        cooling container 5 per adsorption phase is also pre-determined.
        Also, provided that the amount of water in the cooling container
        5 above the heat exchanger 7 prior to the desorption phase, is
        larger than the maximum generatable amount of ice during the
        adsorption phase, then the heat exchanger 7 cannot come into
        contact with the downwardly growing ice layer 9 formed during
        the adsorption phase. Thus, it has been discovered that
        satisfying these two considerations, it is possible to determine
        (i) the amount of water operating medium for a particular
        cooling container 5 of selected geometry, to be used in
        connection with a particular adsorption container having a
        predetermined amount of adsorption medium; and (ii) what the
        water level above the heat exchanger 7 must be in order to carry
        out the present invention. These determinations can be made in a
        straight forward manner, employing for example, the parameters
        (i) and (ii) above, and the equilibrium condition specifying
        that the ice layer completely ceases to grow at a point of
        equilibrium where the rate of sublimination above the ice layer
        9 equals the rate of crystallization (i.e. freezing) of water 8A
        below the ice layer 9. </p>
      <p>In order to generate ice in the cooling container, a portion of
        the water operating medium in the cooling container must
        evaporate. During this evaporation process, heat is absorbed
        initially from the water in the cooling container 5 lowering the
        temperature thereof, until a portion of the water freezes,
        thereby producing a "cooling capacity" within the cooling
        container 5. As is well known, the icing process always starts
        from the surface of the water, and propagates downwardly. In
        order not to interrupt the icing process, water 8A below the ice
        layer 9 continuously evaporates at the water/ice layer boundary,
        and ice 9 above the water 8A continuously transforms into vapor
        12 by sublimation. As a result, an ice layer 9 of only a few
        centimeters causes a considerable vapor pressure drop at the ice
        layer, that is, with respect to the total vapor pressure within
        the cooling container 5. Consequently, this vapor pressure drop
        causes the ice layer 9 to grow more slowly as the ice layer 9
        grows thicker, until eventually the ice layer 9 completely stops
        growing at a point of equilibrium where the rate of sublimation
        above the ice layer 9 equals the rate of crystallization (i.e.
        freezing) of water 8A below the ice layer 9. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 2, a state of the process hereof is schematically
        illustrated where the volume of ice .DELTA.V.sub.ice is maximum
        and consequentially, the volume of water above the heat
        exchanger .DELTA.V.sub.AHE is minimum; notably, however, at this
        state, the ice layer 9 does not reach the heat exchanger 7, as
        required by the temperature control mechanism of the present
        invention. More or less a theoretical value, .DELTA.V.sub.solid
        is the maximum volume of ice which can be produced during the
        entire adsorption phase, that is, if (i) no heat enters the
        cooling container 5 via the heat exchanger 7, and (ii) if no
        additional vapor pressure drops occur. As .DELTA.V.sub.solid is
        a maximum value, .DELTA.V.sub.AHE is less than
        .DELTA.V.sub.solid during the adsorption phase of practical
        cooling applications. </p>
      <p>Depending on the geometry of the sorption apparatus, the ice
        layer 9 can cease growing after reaching, for example, 5-20
        centimeters in thickness. In connection therewith, the geometry
        of the cooling container 5 is a critical design parameter, since
        according to the present invention, modification in the geometry
        of the cooling container can be used to create vapor pressure
        drops therewithin, and the maximum volume of ice produced
        depends on the vapor pressure drops within the cooling container
        5. Thus, the following considerations are important with respect
        to ice layer formation and its limits of growth: the geometry of
        the cooling container 5; the ambient heat flow through thermal
        insulation provided to the cooling container 5; additional vapor
        pressure drops along the path of vapor to the adsorption medium
        4; and the instantaneous adsorption rate of the adsorption
        medium 4 (i.e. mass of operating medium adsorbed per second).
        Notably, while in the preferred embodiment, thermal insulation
        is provided to the exterior surfaces of the cooling container 5
        where ambient heat exchange is not required or desired, such
        thermal insulation is not necessary to carry out the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>It has been discovered that in suitably formed cooling
        containers, for example, the reduction in the cross-sectional 10
        dimension of the cooling container 5 above the heat exchanger 7,
        can be a small fraction of the maximum possible amount of ice
        .DELTA.V.sub.solid. The reason for using such a configured
        cooling container 5, is that use of a small cross-section 10
        means a higher vapor pressure drop over such a region of the
        cooling container 5, and a higher pressure drop thereabout means
        a reduction in the thickness of the ice layer 9, necessary to
        cause ice layer growth to completely stop before reaching the
        heat exchanger 7 disposed therebelow. </p>
      <p>During the adsorption of vapor by the adsorption medium 4, heat
        of adsorption is released. This heat must be discharged from the
        adsorption medium 4 so that the adsorption rate of the
        adsorption medium 4, does not prematurely decrease. As is well
        known, only so much "cold or cooling power" can be generated in
        the cooling container 5 as heat is discharged from the
        absorption container 1. As a result, it is possible to transfer
        this heat in a controlled manner to the ambient environment, so
        as to limit or throttle the "cooling power" produced in the
        cooling container 5. Thus by using this control effect on the
        "cooling power", together with the increased pressure drop
        caused by the ice layer formation in the cooling container 5
        hereof, it is possible to construct a sorption cooling apparatus
        which "adjusts" the thickness of ice layer 9 growth using a
        small column of water over which a relatively thin ice layer can
        form, thereby protecting the heat exchanger 4 from icing during
        use. </p>
      <p>Caused by the density anomaly of water, water always has a
        temperature of +4.degree. C. below an ice layer such as ice
        layer 9 in FIG. 2. Therefore, in the cooling container 5 of the
        present invention, the liquid to be cooled in the heat exchanger
        7 can become no colder than +4.degree. C., as desired. Thus,
        freezing of liquid (e.g. beverage) in the heat exchanger 7 is
        not possible when using a cooling container of the present
        invention. Accordingly, if the beverage flows into the heat
        exchanger 7 with a higher temperature than +4.degree. C., the
        heat exchanger 7 transfers heat to the surrounding water layer
        8. In turn, the vapor pressure of this water layer increases
        until the vapor pressure is so high that the water evaporates
        and condenses on the superimposed ice layer 9. Notably, this
        process of evaporating and condensing is equal to the heat
        transfer in an overflooded condenser. </p>
      <p>If the hydrostatic pressure above the heated water layer is
        larger than the evaporation pressure, there is no evaporation at
        first, but a slow rise or ascent of the heated water layer
        occurs, thereby decreasing the hydrostatic pressure thereof
        until the evaporation pressure suffices the hydrostatic pressure
        to form steam bubbles. The same then rapidly rises, caused by
        the enormous difference in density, and also condenses on the
        superimposed ice layer 9. In this manner, a very effective heat
        transfer mechanism is provided from the heat exchanger 7 to the
        ice layer 9 lying above the water layer 8, all without cooling
        the heat exchanger 7 below +4.degree. C. as desired. </p>
      <p>This additional advantage of highly effective heat transfer
        from the heat exchanger 7 to the ice layer 9, can also be used
        in conventional ice storage buffers if the conventional ice
        storage buffers are placed under a vacuum, so that the
        evaporation and condensation processes can occur at such low
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>In beverage cooling applications, beverage tapping temperatures
        of +4.degree. C. to +8.degree. C. are achievable using the
        cooling container of the present invention. This beverage
        tapping temperature range is possible with the cooling container
        hereof without any further control efforts. Using the present
        invention, thermostatically controlled valves and control of
        heat transfer away from the adsorption medium 4, are not
        required. </p>
      <p>In an adsorption apparatus constructed in accordance with the
        principles of the present invention, the shut off means 3 can
        remain open during the total adsorption phase of operation, and
        the operating medium (e.g. water) can be continuously adsorbed.
        The excess "cooling power" which is generated in the cooling
        container 5, is stored in form of the ice layer or block 9.
        During the total time of the adsorption phase of operation, the
        adsorption heat released from the adsorption medium 4, can be
        transferred to the ambient environment, for example. Also, since
        the time of adsorption phase operation is substantially longer
        than the actual beverage tapping time (e.g. the sum of the times
        in which the beverage to be cooled runs through the heat
        exchanger 7), the adsorption container 1 used with the cooling
        container 5 of the present invention, can be equipped with a
        smaller and therefore more cost effective heat exchanging
        surface. </p>
      <p>The maximum adsorption capacity of the adsorption medium 4
        depends on the lowest temperature that the adsorption medium 4
        finally attains prior to the adsorption phase. The smaller this
        end temperature is, the more vapor can be adsorbed in the
        absorption medium 4, and consequently, much more cooling power
        can be made available in the cooling container 5. Thus, by using
        the cooling container of the present invention, adsorption
        medium process can be used more advantageously at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>While the particular embodiment shown and described above has
        proven to be useful in many applications involving the
        adsorption arts, further modifications herein disclosed will
        occur to persons skilled in the art to which the present
        invention pertains and also such modifications are deemed to be
        within the scope and spirit of the present invention defined by
        the appended claims. </p>
