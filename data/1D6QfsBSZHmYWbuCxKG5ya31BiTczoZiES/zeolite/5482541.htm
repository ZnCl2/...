      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Adsorption agent cartridge includes a vacuum tight cover having
        an adsorption agent filler consisting of a substance which can
        adsorb operating medium steam. The adsorption agent cartridge
        further includes an inlet opening for the inflow of the
        operating medium steam and an exhaust opening, which preferably
        connects to an exhaust device, for expelling air and nonadsorbed
        gases from the adsorption agent filler. The adsorption agent
        filler is designed to adsorb the operating medium steam and not
        to adsorb air components. The exhaust opening and the inlet
        opening are so arranged with respect to the adsorption agent
        filler such that the non-adsorbed gases are expelled from the
        regions of the adsorption agent filler without the concurrent
        removal of the inflowing operating medium steam. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to adsorption apparatus
        cartridges, and more particularly relates to an adsorption
        cartridge having adsorption agent filler therein for adsorption
        of operating medium steam. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>In the field of sorption technology, there are differences
        between absorption and adsorption apparatus. Specifically, one
        difference is evident in that adsorption apparatus utilize solid
        adsorption materials. Adsorption apparatus are known to operate
        as either closed systems or open systems. When utilizing either
        type of system, the operating medium is exothermally absorbed by
        an adsorption agent. As a result, the operating medium steam
        source which provides the operating medium is cooled due to the
        evaporation of the operating medium. Since both the closed and
        open systems operate during the adsorption phase without air,
        system pressure is provided by the evaporation pressure of the
        operating medium. In contrast to open systems, closed systems
        operate without the presence of air even after desorption of the
        operating medium. However, semi-open systems desorb operating
        medium in air atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Known open and closed systems use these adsorption techniques
        for generating both heat and cold. In order to generate the heat
        or cold, adsorption filler is contained in an adsorption
        container which is in contact with the operating medium steam
        source. In order to regulate the flow of operating medium steam,
        a valve is typically provided between the adsorption filler and
        the steam source so as to prevent the adsorption reaction in the
        closed condition. When the valve is opened and if a sufficient
        vacuum pressure is provided, operating medium steam will flow
        into the adsorption filler. However, if a sufficient vacuum
        pressure is not present, the air contained within the system
        will prevent a rapid adsorption reaction. </p>
      <p>Closed adsorption systems are relatively inflexible because
        they require the presence of a permanent vacuum for operation.
        Since the adsorption filler and the steam source must be fixedly
        connected with each other and are therefore not exchangeable,
        closed apparatuses have relatively limited applications. In
        contrast, semi-open systems are substantially more flexible,
        since a simple exchange between the steam source and the
        adsorption container is possible. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to design an
        adsorption agent cartridge which permits a relatively quick and
        simple exchange within a currently operating adsorption system.
      </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorption agent cartridge which overcomes the inherent
        disadvantages of known adsorption containers. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, an
        adsorption agent cartridge includes an air-tight cartridge cover
        and adsorption agent filler which is capable of adsorbing
        operating medium steam. The cartridge cover also includes an
        inlet opening for providing operating medium steam and an
        exhaust opening which is preferably coupled to an exhaust device
        for withdrawing gases from the adsorption agent cartridge which
        are not adsorbed by the adsorption agent filler. The adsorption
        agent cartridge can selectively expel non-adsorbed gases through
        the exhaust opening. Preferably, the exhaust opening and the
        inlet opening are configured such that the non-adsorbed gases
        will be expelled from the adsorption agent filler while the
        operating medium steam will substantially remain within the
        adsorption agent filler. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features and advantages of the present
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be
        read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, an adsorption agent
        cartridge for use with a sorption system constructed in
        accordance with the present invention will now be described. The
        adsorption agent cartridge 25 preferably includes a metallic
        cartridge cover 1 which contains adsorption agent filler 2 which
        is only partially shown in the figure. The adsorption agent
        filler 2 is held in place within the adsorption agent cartridge
        by means of a screen 3. The screen is primarily held in place
        within cartridge cover 1 by shoulder 10. An exhaust opening 4
        extends through an entry opening 5. The entry opening 5 is
        formed by an opening of the cartridge cover 1. The exhaust
        opening 4 is formed by a first end of the exhaust pipe 6 which
        extends through entry opening 5. The exhaust pipe 6 includes a
        second end 7 which is secured to the cartridge cover 1. Openings
        8a, 8b are provided on the second end 7 of the exhaust pipe. Air
        and nonadsorbed gases are expelled from the adsorption agent
        filler 2 by entering openings 8a and 8b of exhaust pipe 6 and by
        exiting exhaust opening 4. The screen 3 of the adsorption
        cartridge is stabilized by a shoulder 9 included on the exhaust
        pipe which contacts and supports the screen. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, the adsorption agent cartridge 25
        constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the
        present invention also includes cartridge cover 1 and adsorption
        agent filler 2. A screen 3 is fixed on shoulder 10 of inlet
        opening 5. A suction pipe 11 having first and second ends 11a,
        11b extends in a vacuum tight manner out of the cartridge cover
        1. The suction pipe 11 also includes on the second end 11b, a
        mounting 12 for attachment to a hose or similar device. The
        first end 11a of the suction pipe 11 contains a plurality of
        openings 13 through which air and nonadsorbed gases can be
        provided from the adsorption agent filler 2 to the suction pipe
        11 for expulsion from the adsorption agent cartridge 25. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, an alternative embodiment of the
        adsorption agent cartridge 25 is shown as including a bottom 14
        and a lid 15 secured onto front faces of the cartridge cover 1
        which, in the embodiment of FIG. 3, is cylindrical. The lid 15
        includes an inlet opening 5 through which a suction pipe 16
        extends therethrough into the adsorption agent filler 2. The
        suction pipe includes first and second ends 16a, 16b. The first
        end 16a of the suction pipe is positioned outside the cartridge
        cover 1 and the second end 16b is disposed inside the cartridge
        cover. The second end 16b of the suction pipe 16 preferably
        discharges at a point proximate to the bottom of the adsorption
        agent cartridge within an inner flow conduit 17. The first end
        16a of the suction pipe 16 also includes connecting means 12 for
        coupling the suction pipe 16 to an exhaust device (not shown).
        The inlet opening 5 is equipped with a threaded portion 21 with
        which the total adsorption agent cartridge can be secured to an
        operating medium steam line 18. The operating medium steam line
        18 provides operating medium steam from an operating medium
        steam source (not shown) to the adsorption agent cartridge. A
        counterthread 19 located at an end of the operating medium line
        18 proximate to the cartridge cover is provided with a
        circumferential seal 20 with which the adsorption agent
        cartridge can be vacuum tight coupled to the operating medium
        steam line 18. </p>
      <p>With the above description in mind, the adsorption cartridge
        and the operation of the same will be described in more detail.
        The adsorption agent cartridge 25 of the present invention is an
        airtight device including an airtight cartridge cover for
        containing an adsorption agent filler. As described in
        connection with the drawings, the cover 1 has an entry opening 5
        for providing operating medium steam and an exhaust opening 4
        for expelling air and nonadsorbed gases. In a preferred
        embodiment, the entry opening 5 and exhaust opening 4 are
        arranged with respect to the adsorption filler such that
        operating medium steam is adsorbed by the adsorption filler in
        an unimpeded manner while nonadsorbed gases are simultaneously
        expelled. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the exhaust opening 4 is positioned within the
        adsorption cartridge so that the exhaust opening is
        substantially opposite the location of the entry opening 5. As a
        result, air and nonadsorbed gases are exhausted from the
        adsorption agent filler, without imbedding the flow of operating
        medium steam into the adsorption agent filler. </p>
      <p>The operating medium steam which is provided to the cartridge
        cover is first adsorbed by the adsorption agent that is
        proximate to the entry opening 5 of the cartridge cover. When
        the adsorption agent proximate to the entry opening is saturated
        with operating medium steam, additional operating medium steam
        that is provided will push operating medium steam to more
        remotely located regions of the adsorption agent. This
        "zone-like" flow of the operating medium steam is assured if air
        and nonadsorbed gases are expelled from the adsorption agent
        through the exhaust opening 4. After substantially all of the
        adsorption filler is saturated with the operating medium, a
        so-called "penetration" of the operating medium steam flow
        through the filler occurs. Thereafter, as additional operating
        medium steam is provided to the adsorption system, the operating
        medium steam is expelled through the exhaust opening. However,
        if the exhaust opening is located in close proximity to the
        entry opening, then some operating medium steam would be
        expelled from the adsorption container before the adsorption
        agent is substantially saturated with operating medium.
        Therefore, the air which is present in the adsorption agent in
        the more remote regions of adsorption agent filler would not be
        properly expelled. </p>
      <p>In order to maintain the capacity of the adsorption filler and
        in order to have a relatively low exhaust device operating time,
        the present invention includes an adsorption material which
        readily adsorbs operating medium steam and which does not
        significantly adsorb air molecules. If an adsorption substance
        is utilized which is capable of adsorbing nitrogen and oxygen
        molecules in addition to operating medium steam, air would be
        preadsorbed during storage of the adsorption agent cartridge.
        The operating medium steam would desorb the preadsorbed gases
        since water molecules have a stronger affinity for adsorption by
        the zeolite than the preadsorbed gas molecules. These
        preadsorbed gases which are released during the adsorption
        reaction should then be permanently exhausted. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a preferred form of the present invention,
        the adsorption agent cartridge is filled with a zeolite of the
        3-A-type. This type of zeolite has the characteristic of
        adsorbing water vapor (operating medium) molecules and adsorbing
        relatively few air components. Therefore, when using a 3-A-type
        adsorption agent cartridge, only the air between the absorption
        agent crystals must be expelled and an expulsion of desorbed air
        components is not required. In accordance with a preferred form
        of the present invention, the adsorption agent cartridge can be
        utilized in sorption systems that are evacuated with the aide of
        a manually driven vacuum pump. </p>
      <p>In accordance with a preferred form of the invention, the
        adsorption filler consists of a substance which is generally
        commercially available in rod or granular form. Preferably, the
        diameter of the particles of the granules should be larger than
        1 mm because particles of a smaller diameter generate a high
        internal pressure as compared to that of the inflowing operating
        medium which would prevent quick adsorption of the inflowing
        operating medium. </p>
      <p>When the adsorption agent filler is in granular form, it is
        preferable to secure the granulate in the cartridge cover with a
        screen such as screen 3 shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. With this
        configuration, the operating medium steam can flow through the
        screen, while the granulate is simultaneously prevented from
        falling out of the cartridge. It is particularly advantageous if
        the screen is detachable from the cartridge cover so that an
        exchange of the adsorption filler can be facilitated. </p>
      <p>It has been shown to be relatively advantageous to use a solid
        structure which is inserted into the cartridge cover in a
        paste-like shape and which solidifies during a drying process.
        In order to achieve a sufficient adsorption rate of operating
        medium adsorption, it is preferable to provide the solid filler
        structure with suitable flow conduits for permitting a flow of
        operating medium. Preferably, the flow conduits couple the inlet
        opening to the exhaust opening. The diameter of the flow conduit
        and number of flow conduits correspond to the specific
        requirements of the absorption system. </p>
      <p>It is advantageous to admix the adsorption filler with a
        substance that provides an optical indication of the amount of
        operating medium that has been adsorbed by the adsorption medium
        (i.e., charge condition). If the operating medium indicator
        substance is provided proximate to the exhaust opening, an
        indication as to when a replacement cartridge is required is
        evident when the color of the adsorption filler changes. Other
        types of sensors, such as electronic devices, have been shown to
        also provide an indication as to the proper time for replacement
        of the adsorption agent cartridge. The electronic sensor devices
        are particularly advantageous with adsorption systems which
        operate automatically when needed. </p>
      <p>As soon as the adsorption filler is saturated with operating
        medium, the adsorption agent cartridge must be replaced with
        regenerated (unsaturated) filler. This could occur by replacing
        the filler in the saturated cartridge with an unsaturated (new)
        zeolite filler or, in the alternative, the saturated filler can
        be regenerated by heating the same. In relatively simple cases,
        it is sufficient to regenerate the filler in the adsorption
        cartridge by heating. The regeneration basically includes
        placing the adsorption agent and the metallic cover in a heating
        chamber until all adsorption agent zones have reached a
        temperature sufficient for desorption (at least 200.degree. C.
        if zeolite is utilized). For certain adsorption agent fillers,
        the heating temperatures required for regeneration may have to
        exceed 300.degree. C. </p>
      <p>During the heating of the adsorption agent cartridges, the
        previously adsorbed operating medium steam is expelled from the
        filler to the air in the surrounding environment. Ammonia and
        alcohol are not suitable operating medium if regeneration of the
        filler is to occur in this manner. Ammonia and alcohol are
        better suited for use in a closed-system. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention and
        specifically when relatively large adsorption agent cartridges
        are utilized, an electric heater is installed within the
        adsorption filler for regeneration of the filler. If this
        arrangement is utilized, it is recommended to incorporate a
        thermostat with the heater in order to prevent an overheating of
        the adsorption filler. </p>
      <p>When exchanging or replacing an adsorption agent cartridge from
        an adsorption system, typically two connections must be
        manipulated. First, the entry opening from the steam source and
        second the exhaust opening to the exhaust device. In accordance
        with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, these two
        openings may be included within a single connector coupled to
        the adsorption agent cartridge. Since the exhaust opening
        usually has a smaller diameter than that of the inlet opening,
        it is advantageous to feed the exhaust opening through that of
        the inlet opening. This can be done in at least two ways. In a
        first embodiment, an exhaust tube is fixed within the adsorption
        agent cartridge in such a manner that the exhaust tube inlet is
        located at an end of the adsorption agent filler opposite to
        that of the introduction of operating medium steam. In a second
        embodiment, the exhaust tube is not coupled to the cartridge.
        Instead, the exhaust tube remains coupled to a connection
        adapter during the replacement of the cartridge. The connection
        adapter couples the inlet opening to the steam source and,
        preferably, a conduit is provided in the adsorption filler for
        acceptance of the exhaust tube. Since only a single connection
        must be detached and reattached in the above-described
        embodiments, a relatively rapid exchange of adsorption
        cartridges is possible. A further advantage of this
        configuration consists in that only the entry opening must be
        designed in a vacuum tight manner. </p>
      <p>A significant number of bottle-like containers are suitable for
        use as adsorption agent cartridges as long as they have a
        sufficiently large opening for the intended purpose. Suitable
        connecting adapters for use in the present invention are known
        from beverage dispensing systems wherein the CO.sub.2 supply as
        well as removal of beverage barrel contents is performed through
        a single adapter. </p>
      <p>All seals for connecting the adsorption agent cartridge are
        connected with the connecting adapter to the adsorption system.
        As a result, the adsorption agent cartridge substantially
        includes only a cover with adsorption agent filler. It can
        therefore be economically manufactured, replaced and
        regenerated. </p>
      <p>When utilizing adsorption agent cartridges which have a
        relatively high adsorption power, it is advantageous to provide
        additional heat exchangers for cooling the adsorption agent
        after the adsorption agent has adsorbed the operating medium
        steam. The heat exchangers may be heat guiding sheet metal in
        the outer range of the cartridge cover or pipe lines for heat
        adsorbing media within the adsorption agent filler. Liquids,
        such as water or consumable beverages, that it is desirable to
        heat, are particularly suitable as heat absorbing medium. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention.<br>
