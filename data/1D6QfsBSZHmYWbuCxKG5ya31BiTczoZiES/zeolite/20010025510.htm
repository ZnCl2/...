      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The invention concerns a sorption cooler for cooling a
        container by means of a sorption device and a method for
        regeneration of the sorption agent in accordance with the
        generic term of claim 1. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Sorption devices are devices in which a liquid or solid
        sorption agent adsorbs a second, higher boiling agent, the
        working agent, in vapor form with release of heat (sorption).
        The working agent is evaporated in an evaporator while taking up
        heat. After the sorption agent is saturated, it can be desorbed
        through the delivery of heat (regeneration). In doing so, the
        working agent is evaporated out of the sorption agent. The work
        agent vapor can be reliquefied and then reevaporated in the
        evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0003] Sorption devices for cooling with solid sorption agents
        are known from EP 0 368 111 and DE-OS 34 25 419. Sorption agent
        vessels filled with sorption agents draw off the working agent
        vapor, which arises in an evaporator, and adsorb it in the
        sorption agent fill while releasing heat. The heat of adsorption
        in this case must be withdrawn from the sorption agent fill. The
        cooling devices can be used for cooling and keeping foods warm
        in thermally insulated boxes. </p>
      <p>[0004] The sorption cooling system known from EP 9 368 111
        consists of a portable cooling unit and a stationary charging
        station that can be separated from it. The cooling unit consists
        of a sorption vessel filled with a solid sorbent and an
        evaporator, which contains the liquid working agent and a heat
        exchanger embedded therein. The evaporator and sorption vessel
        are connected to each other via a closeable vapor pipe. Liquid
        media that are cooled to the desired temperature level through
        temperature-controlled opening and closing of the closing device
        flow through a heat exchanger embedded in the evaporator. After
        the sorption agent has become saturated with the working agent,
        it can be heated in the charging station. The working agent
        vapor that flows out is reliquefied in the evaporator. The heat
        of condensation is withdrawn through cooling water, which must
        flow through the embedded heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>[0005] Because of the embedded heat exchanger and temperature
        regulation, the sorption cooling system is expensive to
        manufacture and is complicated in its practical use for the
        untrained layman. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] The task of the invention is to show an operation that
        is simpler than the prior art and a low-cost device. </p>
      <p>[0007] This task is solved by the characteristic traits of
        claims 1 and 10. The dependent claims show additional inventive
        devices. </p>
      <p>[0008] Accordingly, a sorption device in accordance with the
        invention contains a sorption agent within a sorption agent
        vessel, a vapor valve and a liquid working agent distributed in
        a working agent storage material within an evaporator. A portion
        of the outer wall of the container is in good thermal contact
        with the working agent storage material and at least this part
        of the outer wall of the container is at the same time a part of
        the boundary surfaces of the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0009] The working agent storage material contains, for
        example, nonwoven glass fiber or mineral fiber materials and is
        glued or stretched over a large area. In the case of cylindrical
        vessels it is, as a rule, sufficient to coat the outer side
        surface of the container. Coating of the more highly vaulted
        bottom and top elements is not necessary. The shape of the
        vessel does not have to be adjusted to the special requirements
        of sorption technology. The working agent is evaporated out of
        the working agent storage material and cools the contents of the
        vessel through the good contact with the vessel wall. </p>
      <p>[0010] In accordance with the invention another part of the
        boundary surface of the evaporator has thermal contact with the
        environment. In this region the working agent vapor can condense
        and give up its heat of condensation to the environment or to an
        external cooling medium. This will always take place when the
        environment or the external cooling medium is colder than the
        contents of the vessel. The working medium then evaporates from
        the working medium storage material while absorbing heat and
        condenses while giving up heat to the environment. Through this
        effect, which is also known as a heat pipe, the contents of the
        vessel are constantly reduced to the environmental temperature.
        However, if the environment is warmer than the contents of the
        vessel, no heat can be transferred from outside to the inside,
        provided the boundary surface in contact with the environment is
        free of liquid working agent. In order to guarantee this, the
        boundary surface is inclined so that the condensate runs off and
        can drip back onto the working medium storage material. This
        heat pipe effect is always of particular advantage when the
        vessel contents are supposed to take on the lower temperature
        automatically through a decrease of the ambient temperature. If,
        for example, the sorption cooler is installed in a cooling
        chamber, the temperature of the vessel contents will fall to the
        lower level; conversely, if the outside temperature rises, for
        example due to solar radiation, the construction of the sorption
        cooler in accordance with the invention acts like an insulated
        vessel under a vacuum. In doing so, the rise of the vessel
        temperature progresses a great deal more slowly than the
        decrease does. </p>
      <p>[0011] Even during the regeneration phase, in which the
        sorption agent is desorbed from the working agent, the working
        agent vapor can condense on the boundary surface of the
        evaporator that is in contact with the environment. This always
        occurs when the boundary surface is colder than the vessel
        contents. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is also advantageous if another wall region of the
        evaporator is at the same time a component of the sorption agent
        vessel. Weight and costs can be saved through the consolidation
        of the intermediate walls that is then possible. This is
        particularly true when the vapor valve is arranged in a common
        wall. Additional flow channels and connecting elements can then
        be spared. </p>
      <p>[0013] Particularly compact and stable embodiments of the idea
        in accordance with the invention are achieved when the sorption
        cooler has a shell-like structure. In this case, a cylindrical
        evaporation jacket is arranged around the cylindrical vessel and
        around this jacket in turn is the cylindrical sorption vessel,
        which uses the evaporation jacket simultaneously as its inside
        wall. In order to reduce the thermal contact between the
        sorption agent and the evaporator, thermal insulation agents can
        be arranged within the sorption agent vessel. </p>
      <p>[0014] However, this additional insulation can be avoided if
        the working agent vapor pressure is especially low. In the case
        of low vapor pressures the conductive and convective fractions
        of heat transfer are reduced. If the zeolite/water pair is used,
        the achievable insulation effect lies in the range of simple
        vacuum insulation. The radiant fraction that is still relevant
        in this case can be further reduced by building in radiation
        shields. It is particularly advantageous if the common
        intermediate wall between evaporator and the sorption agent
        vessel acts as a radiation shield. </p>
      <p>[0015] During the regeneration phase the sorption agent is
        heated and the working agent vapor is desorbed. The vapor flows
        through the vapor valve to the evaporator and condenses out
        there. At the end of the regeneration, the input of heat to the
        sorption agent is interrupted. The desorption of additional
        working agent vapor ends with this. The vapor valve is closed.
        The desorbed working agent is in liquid state in the working
        agent-storage material. The sorption agent is cooled afterwards
        to the ambient temperature by the release of heat through the
        outer wall of the sorption agent vessel. </p>
      <p>[0016] To initiate the cooling phase, the vapor valve is
        opened. The working agent vapor can now flow from the evaporator
        into the sorption agent vessel and be exothermically sorbed by
        the sorption agent. The evaporating working agent is cooled in
        the evaporator and cools the vessel together with its contents.
        In order to produce the maximum cooling power, the sorption
        agent must be able to give up its heat of sorption. A
        particularly intensive cooling effect is achieved if the
        sorption agent vessel has a sufficiently large surface for heat
        exchange to the air that surrounds it. Advantageously, the
        vessel wall should be cooled to temperatures under 50.degree. C.
        Then sufficiently low temperatures are possible in the
        evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0017] If the vessel contains liquids, only the liquid volume
        that is around and below the working agent-storage material has
        to be cooled. The volume that is higher up remains near the
        starting temperature because of the lower density and low
        thermal conduction of the liquids. By appropriate positioning
        and arrangement of the evaporator the liquid volume to be cooled
        can be selected beforehand. In practice one achieves in this way
        a faster cooling of the liquid at the bottom, which is then
        withdrawn first. The liquid at the top is not cooled until it
        falls into the region of the evaporator through the removal of
        the chilled amount of liquid. </p>
      <p>[0018] Before refilling a vessel, it is usually cleaned. For
        this, cleaning and rinse washing liquids are introduced into the
        vessel and as a rule removed by tipping the vessel. For this
        reason the evaporator is designed so that the vessel can empty
        in all cleaning processes without any problems and without
        traces of rinse agent. </p>
      <p>[0019] The use of the sorption agent pair zeolite/water is
        particularly advantageous. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral that
        consists of a regular framework structure of silicon and
        aluminum oxides. This framework structure contains voids in
        which water molecules can be sorbed while releasing heat. Within
        the framework structure the water molecules are subject to
        strong field forces that liquefy the molecules in the lattice
        and bind them in a liquid-like phase. The strength of the
        binding forces acting on the water molecules is dependent on the
        amount of water already contained in the framework structure and
        the temperature of the zeolite. For practical use up to 25 grams
        of water can be sorbed per 100 grams of zeolite. The amount of
        cold that can be generated in the evaporation here is sufficient
        to cool about 1 liter of water by about 14 kelvin. Zeolites are
        solid substances without problematic heat expansion in the
        sorption or desorption reaction. The framework structure is
        freely accessible to water vapor molecules on all sides. The
        devices are thus capable of use in any position. </p>
      <p>[0020] The use of water as working agent allows the costs
        required for control to be reduced to a minimum. In the
        evaporation of water under a vacuum the water surface cools to
        0.degree. C. and freezes to ice with continuous evaporation.
        This ice layer rapidly grows until the resulting pressure drop
        through the ice layer reduces the growth. The ice layer can be
        used advantageously to control the liquid temperature. With low
        delivery of heat from the vessel the ice layer grows, while with
        much higher delivery it melts. Through the natural ice formation
        the heat transfer from the liquid into the evaporator is reduced
        so that the liquid does not cool under 0.degree. C. and as a
        rule remains at 4 to 5.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0021] It is also possible to add substances that lower the
        freezing point to the aqueous working agent if the outlet
        temperature of the liquid is to be reduced to below 4.degree. C.
      </p>
      <p>[0022] However, it is also possible to use other sorption agent
        pairs with which the sorption agent is solid and remains solid
        even during the sorption reaction. Solid sorption agents have
        low thermal conduction and poor heat transfer. Since even the
        heat transfer from gaseous media (air, waste gases) to the
        sorption agent vessel lies in the same order of magnitude, in
        principle heat exchangers without fins are recommended, for
        example cylindrical or tube geometries. </p>
      <p>[0023] Some solid sorption agents like zeolites are stable
        enough even to compensate external excess pressures on
        thin-walled vessel walls. Additional stiffening or thick-walled
        heat exchanger surfaces are for this reason not necessary. Since
        the sorption apparatus is under a vacuum when water is used as
        the working agent and no gases should get into the system for
        the entire life span of the system, vacuum tight components are
        to be preferred for the vapor valve. For manual operation
        feed-through devices that are sealed by means of metal bellows
        have proven themselves. </p>
      <p>[0024] In accordance with the invention the vapor valve is
        operated by a lever device, one end of which is linked to the
        evaporator or sorption vessel outer wall and the other end of
        which operates the valve. By deforming the outer wall at the
        point of the first lever end the valve device can be operated in
        accordance with the invention without expensive vacuum
        feed-through devices. </p>
      <p>[0025] Sorption agent temperatures from 250 to 350.degree. C.
        in regeneration and 40 to 80.degree. C. in sorption are
        recommended for an economical mode of operation. Since zeolite
        granulates in particular have low thermal conduction, the
        sorption vessel should be designed so that the heat conduction
        path for the converted amounts of heat does not exceed 18 mm.
        All of the known devices that achieve the necessary temperature
        level and do not unnecessarily heat the contents of the vessel
        are suitable as heat sources for regeneration. Electrically
        heated plates or jackets that are matched to the geometry of the
        sorption agent vessel are advantageous. The heating can be
        arranged on a palette, for example for several sorption coolers,
        in order to make use of production-related wait times after
        filling the vessels for regeneration. Also advantageous are
        heating devices that heat the sorption agent fill via radiant or
        inductive heat (eddy currents). Of course, it is also possible
        to connect the heating device permanently to the sorption vessel
        and even to leave it there in the transportation of mobile
        sorption coolers. </p>
      <p>[0026] Regeneration in a hot air oven at an air temperature
        over 300.degree. C. is particularly advantageous. If the zeolite
        fill is arranged in a thin layer on the inner side of the outer
        jacket, the regeneration can be completed within an hour. In
        regeneration in a hot air oven, the vacuum insulation protects
        the liquid against undesired heating. </p>
      <p>[0027] During the cooling phase, the surface of the sorption
        agent vessel can heat up to temperatures over 100.degree. C. For
        this case suitable measures to protect against combustion are to
        be provided. Surface coatings of paper and fiber materials that
        protect against burning even at higher temperatures have proven
        themselves. If these coatings are wetted, a greater cooling
        power on the vessel is simultaneously possible through the
        evaporative cooling that occurs at the same time. </p>
      <p>[0028] Narrow-mesh surface protective nets that prevent contact
        with the hot sorption vessel wall are also advantageous.
        Protective nets and plastic shrink films also optimally fit
        bulgy surface shapes and at the same time offer protection
        against mechanical damage. </p>
      <p>[0029] No particular requirements are imposed on the size and
        geometry of the vessel. Thus all of the vessel that are
        conventional today for flowable contents (for example barrels,
        transport boxes, cans, open vessels, film sacks, multi-layer
        packagings, plastic vessels, canisters, hobbocks, bottles, pots,
        etc.) are suitable, provided they can be functionally connected
        to the sorption apparatus. High (tall) geometries with small
        diameters are preferred over flat shapes with large diameters,
        since the former enable faster cooling of the contents. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0031] In the bottom drain of the cylindrical vessel 4 is a tap
        hole 12 via which the liquid vessel contents can be withdrawn in
        cooled form. In the upper region, the vessel 4 has a fitting 13
        with a riser tube 14 reaching the bottom of the vessel. The
        beverage vessel is cleaned and filled via these two pieces by
        conventional methods, without the sorption technology needing
        special consideration. The evaporator 8 surrounds the complete
        vessel 4 except for the region of fitting 13. The closed
        cylindrical evaporation space is formed by parts of the outer
        wall 1 of vessel 4 and the boundary surface 5 and a part of the
        outer jacket 6 of the sorption cooler and another wall region 7.
        Through this construction the sorption cooler becomes compact,
        cheap and light. The wall region 7 is at the same time a
        component of a likewise cylinder sorption agent vessel 10. At
        the same time it also functions as a radiant barrier between the
        sorption agent 11 and vessel 4. </p>
      <p>[0032] A working agent storage material 2 is fixed on the lower
        outer wall 1 of vessel 4 by means of a metal lattice 19. The
        working agent storage material 2 consists of an absorbent glass
        fiber mat which uniformly distributes the working agent water in
        the region of the outer wall 1 of vessel 4 through its
        hygroscopic action. </p>
      <p>[0033] The sorption agent 11 is fixed in jacket form on the
        inside of the outer jacket of the sorption agent vessel 10
        through a cylindrical perforated lattice 18. Between this
        lattice and the wall region 7 is an annular gap 20, which
        extends over the bottom region and at the same time functions as
        a vacuum insulation and vapor distributor. </p>
      <p>[0034] A vapor valve 9 sits in an opening in the sorption agent
        vessel 10. It contains a metal bellows 15, via which a linkage
        16 that can be operated from outside can open and close a valve
        head 17. Linkage 16 is adjusted so that if metal bellows 15 is
        not deflected, the valve head 17 is pressed against the opening.
        A backflow of water vapor from evaporator 8 into the sorption
        agent vessel 10 is suppressed until the metal bellows 15 is
        deflected and valve head 17 is lifted. During the regeneration
        phase, in which water vapor flows back into evaporator 8, the
        valve head 17 automatically clears the way for the vapor flow. </p>
      <p>[0035] In accordance with the invention, the sorption coolers
        are regenerated after refilling with beverages by heating the
        sorption agent. The water vapor desorbed upon heating flows
        through the open valve head 17 into evaporator 8 and condenses
        on the walls of vessel 4. The beverages take up the heat of
        condensation and are heated. The heating is approximately of the
        same magnitude as the last occurring cooling, thus as a rule
        about 20 to 25 kelvin. </p>
      <p>[0036] Beer is bottled, for example, at relatively low
        temperatures of 4 to 5.degree. C. The subsequent warming through
        the regeneration process is similar to the warming to ambient
        temperature that takes place in any case during storage. </p>
      <p>[0037] To start the sorption process, linkage 16 is deflected
        and made fast. Water vapor flows from evaporator 8 to sorption
        agent 11. The beverages are cooled at the vessel wall 1, which
        is covered with the working agent storage material 2. The
        cooling rate for beverages is about 0.5 to 1 K/min, i.e., about
        30 minutes after opening the valve head 17 the first glass at a
        temperature of about 5.degree. C. can be tapped. Within another
        2 hours the remaining contents can be removed in refrigerated
        state. </p>
