      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field Of The Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a system and method for making
        ice and more particularly to a system for making ice in
        accordance with the sorption principle. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description Of The Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Methods and devices are presently known for making ice
        utilizing the evaporation principle. These methods for making
        ice remove vapor of an aqueous solution from the space above the
        surface of the solution which causes more liquid to evaporate.
        The evaporation of the liquid lowers the liquid's temperature
        causing it to enter a solid phase when its temperature reaches
        the solidification point temperature. The triple point of pure
        water, the point at which water can exist as a solid, liquid and
        vapor is at 0.degree. C. and 6.1 mbar. However, aqueous
        solutions solidify at even lower temperatures and lower vapor
        pressures. </p>
      <p>In order to solidify aqueous solutions by means of the
        evaporation principle, large amounts of vapor must be removed
        from the environment. If the vapor is then compressed to
        atmospheric pressure, considerable effort of mechanical devices
        is required. The mechanical energy which would be expended is
        considerably above alternative methods, for example, the energy
        needed to operate a conventional ice machine. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, methods and equipment are presently known whereby
        the vapor to be removed is absorbed by a sorption medium. Such a
        method and equipment is used for freeze drying of foods.
        Although the latter method enables rapid ice making, it is not
        practical for making ice in the home or in a small retail
        establishment. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the invention to provide a method and
        apparatus for economically efficient and commercial ice making.
      </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide a method and
        apparatus for rapid and energy efficient ice making. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, an ice
        making system utilizing the sorption principle includes a
        sorption container, a vacuum pump and an icing container. The
        sorption container and icing container are able to maintain a
        vacuum pressure produced by a vacuum pump which is operatively
        coupled to both the sorption container and the icing container.
        The sorption container is coupled to the icing container by a
        suction opening. </p>
      <p>The ice making system further includes a feeding line which
        extends from a liquid supply container to the icing container.
        The icing container is coupled to the suction opening by a flat
        sealing surface which produces an air tight seal. The suction
        opening contains a venting device which provides a means through
        which the icing container can be repressurized. The suction
        opening also has a shut off device between the sorption
        container and the venting device which isolates the vapor within
        the icing container from the sorption container. </p>
      <p>Zeolite has been successfully employed as a sorption medium. To
        assure uniform absorption of vapor within the sorption medium,
        sorption medium granulates should be used to produce optimum
        results. However, sorption mediums have limited absorption
        capabilities. In order to regenerate the sorption medium, the
        ice making system should include a heating device capable of
        heating the sorption medium so that the previously absorbed
        liquid vapor can be expelled. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features, and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be
        read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, an ice making system
        utilizing the sorption principle constructed in accordance with
        the present invention will now be described. The ice maker
        illustrated in FIG. 1 contains a sorption medium 2 in form of a
        granulate. A vacuum pump 3 in the lower area of the sorption
        container 1 is driven by means of an electromotor 4 and a
        coupling 5 flanged onto it. The sorption medium 2 is fixed by
        means of a wire netting 6 and 7. A cover is disposed in the
        upper part of sorption container 1 which is braced air tight on
        the sorption container 1 by means of a sealing ring 9 and clamps
        10. Through a ball stopcock 11 which is actuated by means of a
        manual lever 12, a flat sealing face 13 is connected to a
        suction opening 15. The flat sealing face is provided with a
        smooth seal 14. A vent device 16 is inserted between the
        stopcock 11 and the flat sealing face 13. A feeding line 17 is
        partially contained within the suction opening 15. The feeding
        line 17 expands to form a funnel-like discharge portion at one
        end which extends inside an icing container 21. A baffle 18 is
        located below the suction opening 15 and is mounted on feeding
        line 17 and thereby prevents flow of liquid from the icing
        container to the sorption medium. A shut off stopcock 19 is
        located on feeding line 17. The shut off stopcock 19 controls
        the flow of the liquid to the icing container 21 which is to be
        solified. A second end of the feeding line 17, which does not
        contain the funnel-like discharge portion, extends into a supply
        container 20 which stores the liquid to be solidified. Holding
        clamps 22 and 23 allow differently shaped icing containers 21
        with different cross sectional openings to be attached and
        sealed airtight to the smooth seal 14 of the flat sealing face
        13. The holding clamps 22 and 23 also prevent the icing
        container from separating and falling from the flat sealing face
        13 after venting. </p>
      <p>The following method is performed with the aid of the ice maker
        of the present invention for generating water ice in a drinking
        glass. </p>
      <p>The icing container 21 is pressed with its opening onto seal 14
        and the ball stopcock 11 is opened. By activating the ball
        stopcock, the vacuum pump 3 is turned on by electromotor 4.
        Since the venting device 16 and the shut off stopcock 19 are
        automatically closed, the pressure in the icing container and
        the sorption container 1 readily drop below 6.1 mbar. After the
        pressure drop has been achieved, the shut off stopcock 19 is
        opened so that the water is suctioned from the supply container
        and exits at the funnel shaped expansion end of the feeding
        line. As the water enters and falls to the bottom of the icing
        container, it immediately freezes to ice. The discharged water
        vapor is absorbed in sorption medium 2. As soon as the desired
        amount of ice has been made, the shut off stopcock 19 and the
        ball stopcock 11 are closed. Simultaneously, the venting valve
        16 can be opened in order to repressurize the drinking
        container. The holding clamps 22 and 23 prevent the drinking
        container from falling and breaking during the venting process.
        After venting, the drinking container 21 containing the newly
        made ice can be released from the holding clamps 22 and 23. The
        sorption container 1 remains under vacuum due to the
        repositioning of the ball stopcock 11 until the next icing
        container has been mounted. Therefore, as a result of the
        position of the ball stopcock 11, the vacuum pump 3 does not
        have to repressurize the entire ice maker. But, depending on the
        size of the icing container, only about 100 to 150 mbar of vapor
        pressure must again be removed by the vacuum pump. As a result
        of not repressurizing the entire system, the re-depressurizing
        time can take only a few seconds. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2 of the drawings, a second embodiment of
        the ice making system utilizing the sorption principle
        constructed in accordance with the present invention will now be
        described. The ice maker which is partially illustrated in FIG.
        2, operates without a shut off device between the sorption
        container 31 and icing container 32. A zeolite filler 33 is
        mounted in sorption container 31 within a gas permeable housing
        34. The gas permeable housing 34 and the zeolite filler 33 can
        be simultaneously replaced as one unit. The unit can be removed
        from the sorption container 31 through a vacuum tight access
        device 35. A connecting socket 36 connects the sorption
        container to the vacuum pump (not shown in FIG. 2). The upper
        part of the sorption container 31 is provided with an extension
        37 which forms a flow conduit to the icing container. A flat
        sealing face 38 is provided between extension 37 and icing
        container 32 so as to secure the icing container to the sorption
        system in a vacuum tight manner. A venting valve 39
        repressurizes the icing container 32 and sorption container 31.
        Two feeding lines 41 and 42 extend through suction opening 40.
        Each feeding line has its own funnel-like discharge end
        suspended in the upper part of the icing container 32. An ice
        structure 43 is shown within icing container 32. The ice
        structure 43 starts its formation from the funnel-like discharge
        end, which can be removed from the feeding lines 41 and 42 when
        the icing container is separated from the flat sealing face 38.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, aqueous liquids can
        be quickly and easily solidified in icing containers of any
        shape and almost any cross sectional opening. As a result of a
        vacuum pressure generated by a vacuum pump, icing containers are
        pressed air tight against a flat sealings surface of the
        sorption system. Since the sealing surface is flat and has a
        smooth seal, it is not necessary to place the icing container in
        the center the vacuum suction opening. In addition, the use of
        icing containers with a small cross sectional opening can be
        used (i.e., a shot glass) since even with a small cross
        sectional opening, sufficient contact pressure is produced due
        to a low operating pressure. On the other hand, the flat sealing
        surface may be so large that icing containers such as wine or
        champaign glasses may be used. The flat sealing surface is
        aligned so the icing container is substantially vertical.
        Therefore, the inflowing liquid and the frozen liquid particles
        drop directly to the bottom of the icing container. </p>
      <p>During the absorption of vapor from the icing container by the
        sorption medium, vapor flow speeds through the suction opening
        may exceed 100 m/s. As a result of this flow speed, water drops
        or frozen ice particles may also be forced into the sorption
        container. In order to prevent the water or ice from entering
        the flow conduit, a drip or particle separator is situated
        within the icing container so that the water drops and ice
        particles will fall to the bottom of the icing container.
        Advantageously, the drip separator is located at the mouth of
        the suction opening such that the water drops and ice particles
        are repeatedly deflected and subsequently prevented from flowing
        through the suction opening to the sorption container. </p>
      <p>The feeding line which supplies liquid from the supply
        container to the icing container discharges at a point within
        the icing container and below the drip separator, but at a
        considerable distance above the bottom of the icing container.
        Relatively good results are obtained when the diameter of the
        feeding line is approximately 1 mm and the maximum diameter of
        the funnel-like outlet of the feeding line is 10-20 mm. As a
        result of this arrangement and configuration of the feeding line
        outlet, blockage of the feeding line at the discharge outlet
        during the freezing operation can be effectively prevented. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the feeding line is contained within
        the suction opening. In addition, the drip separator and the
        discharge outlet opening of the feeding line are configured to
        form one unit. In this manner, it is possible to provide a
        compact unit containing both the drip separator and feeding line
        which does not extend a significant distance into the icing
        container even when a small icing container is used. Preferably,
        the feeding line and the drip separator are mounted so the
        entire unit can be easily disconnected from the ice maker.
        Disconnection of the drip separator/feeding line unit allows the
        unit to be easily cleaned. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to provide many different feeding lines to
        supply various types of aqueous solutions from different supply
        containers. In this manner it is possible, with the same ice
        maker, to freeze water, fruit juices and even cream (to produce
        ice cream) without reconfiguration of the ice maker. Each
        feeding line of the ice maker with multiple supply containers
        may have separate discharge outlets or the ice maker may have a
        common discharge outlet. </p>
      <p>The feeding lines are provided with a shut-off stopcock. After
        the pressure in the icing container falls below the operating
        pressure of 6.1 mbar, liquid from the supply container is
        permitted to flow through the feeding line into the icing
        container. If the liquid is supplied to the icing container
        before the pressure in the icing container drops to 6.1 mbar or
        less, (in aqueous solutions the pressure should be even lower),
        the liquid cannot solidify. This low pressure value is called
        the ice operating pressure. If the container pressure is not low
        enough, the liquid will not freeze while falling to the bottom
        of the container. The liquid will then collect on the bottom of
        the icing container and freeze when the container pressure drops
        below the ice operating pressure. The liquid will then undergo a
        violent evaporation reaction and the surface of the liquid will
        transform into ice while a liquid phase remains under the ice
        layer. In order to prevent this situation, it is advantageous to
        provide an automatic control which prevents liquid flow from the
        supply container before the pressure in the icing container
        attains the ice operating pressure. An optical pressure
        indicator which indicates when the container pressure reaches
        the ice operating pressure is advantageous. Furthermore, pure
        automatic injection devices which monitor container pressure are
        also known from cryogenics technology. </p>
      <p>Mechanical feeding devices which pump liquid through the
        feeding lines are not required because the low pressure of the
        icing contain draws the liquid through the feeding line at a
        sufficient rate. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous to use flexible hoses as
        feeding lines. Therefore, the feeding lines can be easily
        inserted into almost any supply container which stores the
        liquid to be frozen. Supply containers may take many shapes
        including mineral water bottles, milk bottles and fruit juice
        containers among others. The system can operate if a relatively
        large opening is pierced in the cover or the upper face of the
        package through which the thin flexible feeding hose is
        inserted. </p>
      <p>A vacuum pump operates to lower the pressure of the system
        below 6.1 mbar. In the preferred embodiment, the vacuum pump has
        a high suction volume which can accommodate a relatively large
        icing container in addition to reducing the pressure in the
        sorption container. However, a vacuum pump of 1 mbar in
        magnitude has been shown to be sufficient. Theoretically, it
        would be sufficient to attain a system pressure of 6.1 mbar, but
        in order to overcome corresponding flow resistances in the
        suction opening as well as in the sorption medium, the end pump
        pressure should be lower. It has been found that an end pump
        pressure of less than 1 mbar does not provide a further
        advantage. If a rotary vane vacuum pump is used, care should be
        taken that an oil return flow safety is provided so that the
        discharge of oil mist from the discharge opening is as low as
        possible. </p>
      <p>It is advantageous to design the sorption container so that the
        vapor produced in the icing container can interact with the
        sorption medium filler in a uniform manner. The portions of the
        system which are open spaces such as hollow spaces within the
        sorption medium granulate and parts of the feeding lines not
        filled with liquid should be minimized. Therefore, the system
        pressure can be rapidly reduced to the ice operating pressure. </p>
      <p>The sorption medium located within the sorption container
        adsorbs vapor from the icing container. The absorption causes
        the vapor to condensate to liquid within the sorption medium
        structure and to bind to the sorption medium granulate. As a
        result of the transformation from vapor to liquid, sorption heat
        is released which heats the sorption medium. The absorbability
        of the sorption medium rapidly decreases as its temperature
        increases. In order to maintain high absorbability of the
        sorption medium and high icing efficiency of the system over a
        long period of time, it is advantageous to reduce the
        temperature of the sorption medium Therefore, a cooling device
        is required to reduce the temperature of the sorption medium
        located in the sorption container. The cooling device may
        include heat exchangers for air or water cooling. </p>
      <p>At room temperature the sorption medium has only a limited
        absorbability for water molecules. As the absorption capacity of
        the sorption medium decreases, the amount of ice produced
        diminishes. This reduction in output is noticeable at room
        temperature despite a working vacuum pump. In this case the
        sorption medium must be replaced with new sorption medium or the
        old sorption medium must be regenerated by a heating unit.
        Preferably, the sorption container is provided with a locking
        device through which the saturated sorption medium filler can be
        replaced with regenerated filler. A vacuum tight lid with a
        clamping ring is particularly advantageous for efficient and
        easy replacement of the sorption medium. To regenerate the
        sorption medium, it must be heated to temperatures between
        150.degree. C. and 300.degree. C. depending on the type sorption
        medium and liquid used. As regeneration of the sorption medium
        occurs within the sorption container, the released liquid vapor
        must exit the sorption container and vent to the outside.
        Therefore, the condensation of the vapor to liquid within the
        ice maker is avoided. </p>
      <p>In the case where the entire sorption medium filler is
        replaced, it is advantageous to pack the filler into a permeable
        housing and to exchange both the sorption medium and the
        housing. The housing must be shaped so that the vapor suctioned
        off by the vacuum pump from the icing container is always fed
        through the sorption medium and can never by-pass the sorption
        medium. In addition, care should be taken to avoid the presence
        of air pockets within the sorption medium filler because air
        pockets can prevent the vapor from properly contacting the
        sorption medium filler. </p>
      <p>Zeolite has been successfully employed as a sorption medium.
        Zeolites are alumosilicates having a uniform crystal structure
        in which up to 36% by weight of water can be absorbed within its
        structure. Zeolites have a considerable ability to absorb vapor
        even at relatively high temperatures (above 100.degree. C.).
        Therefore, zeolites are particularly well suited for use with
        the ice maker of the current invention. Specifically, zeolite
        type A, which contains sodium and magnesium and is stable even
        with frequent regeneration at temperatures of
        250.degree.-300.degree. C., works well in the current invention.
      </p>
      <p>To assure a uniform absorption within the sorption medium
        filler, sorption medium granulates should be used. Optimal
        results were observed with sorption medium granulate diameters
        of between 1-10 mm. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, a ball stopcock shut off device is
        provided between the sorption container and the icing container.
        The shut off device closes the suction opening of the sorption
        container and does not allow vapor to leave the icing container
        and contact the sorption medium. In this manner the vacuum pump
        can preactivate the sorption container by reducing the pressure
        in the sorption container. After attaching the icing container
        and opening the shut off device, the required ice operating
        pressure in the system is obtained more rapidly. In addition,
        the instantaneous work which the vacuum pump must perform is
        lowered since the pump does not have to reduce the pressure of
        the entire system from atmospheric pressure, but instead reduces
        the system pressure from about 100 mbar depending on the volume
        of the icing container. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, the ball stopcock shut off device
        is closed before venting the icing container. By venting the
        icing container through a venting device, the icing container
        can be easily removed from the flat sealing surface. Ideally,
        this venting device is located between the ball stopcock shut
        off device and the icing container so that when the icing
        container is changed, the pressure in the sorption container
        will not increase. </p>
      <p>It is also desirable to couple the vacuum pump switch with the
        ball stopcock shut off device. If this is done, the vacuum pump
        will automatically operate when the shut off device is opened
        and it will automatically shut off then the shut off device is
        closed. As a result, the sorption container can remain under
        vacuum while the icing container and the suction opening are
        vented. </p>
      <p>An ice maker not having a shut off device will allow the
        sorption container to become repressurized when the venting
        device is open. When attaching a new icing container, the vacuum
        pump must be separately started if it is not already operating.
        In order to circumvent a permanent operation of the pump, it is
        advantageous to provide an on/off switch which terminates pump
        operation when absolute pressure is below 6 mbar and which
        begins operation when the absolute pressure exceeds 6 mbar. The
        switch allows the pump to operate only when necessary and it
        prevents the continuous operation of the pump. </p>
      <p>Mechanically actuated ball valves with nominal values above 20
        mm have been shown to be effective for the ball stopcock shut
        off devices. </p>
      <p>The ball valve may be coupled with a switch that turns the
        vacuum pump off when the ball valve is completely closed and
        turns the vacuum pump on when the ball valve is opened.
        Simultaneously, the venting device may be coupled with the
        actuation of the ball valve. Here, the venting device is opened
        when the ball valve is closed and closed when the same is
        opened. </p>
      <p>Various structures may be inserted within the icing container,
        in particular on the bottom, which permit the frozen mass to be
        divided after removing the icing container from the flat sealing
        face. For example, "ice cubes" or similar structures may be made
        and can be later separated. </p>

        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without department from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
