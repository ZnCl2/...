      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A sorption method and sorption medium container arrangement
        utilizes two sorption medium containers and at least one heat
        exchanger for use with each sorption medium container for
        absorbing or emitting heat. Each sorption medium container is
        filled with a sorption medium that can adsorb an operating
        medium by releasing heat and can desorb or expel the operating
        medium by absorbing heat. The sorption medium container
        arrangement also includes steam sources or steam troughs which
        are connected to the sorption medium containers. The steam
        source or trough is designed to provide or receive operating
        medium steam. A heat carrier medium flows through the heat
        exchanger of the first sorption medium container during a first
        partial operation phase wherein the sorption medium is cooled
        and the first sorption medium container is heated. The operating
        medium is subsequently heated by a heater and flows through the
        heat exchanger of the second sorption medium container wherein
        the operating medium cools itself by releasing heat to the
        sorption medium. During a second partial operating phase, the
        operating medium is initially provided to the second sorption
        medium container, whose sorption medium is cooled and the
        sorption medium container is heated. Subsequently the operating
        medium is heated by the heater and thereafter flows through the
        heat exchanger of the first sorption medium container wherein
        the operating medium is cooled and the sorption medium is
        heated. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to sorption containers, and more
        particularly to a sorption container and method for regenerative
        heat exchange between at least two sorption containers. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Typically, in devices and methods providing regenerative heat
        exchange, a light volatile operating agent is absorbed by a
        heavier volatile sorption agent as a result of a release of heat
        energy. The light volatile operating agent can then be
        subsequently desorbed or separated from the heavier volatile
        sorption agent as a result of heat adsorption by the sorption
        agent. The sorption agent may be in liquid as well as in solid
        form. When using a liquid sorption agent that has become
        enriched with operating agent, the sorption agent can be pumped
        between the sorption container which functions as an adsorber
        and the sorption container which functions as a desorber. During
        thermal cycling, both the light volatile operating agent and the
        heavier volatile sorption agent remain in the same container
        depending on the temperature level which is maintained by the
        adsorber container and the desorber container. In order for the
        operating agent to be expelled from the sorption agent, the
        adsorber container along with the sorption agent and heat
        exchangers must be heated from a relatively low adsorption
        temperature to a relatively high desorption temperature and
        subsequently cooled. </p>
      <p>While a heat exchange between solutions that are poor and rich
        with liquid sorption agents is possible in a relatively simple
        manner using separate heat exchangers, this can usually only be
        achieved under very special conditions when solid sorption
        substances are utilized. </p>
      <p>Suggestions to overcome this limitation are found in German
        Patent No. DE-OS 3207656.8. In this reference, a portion of the
        sorption agent heat and container heat is transmitted between
        the two sorption agent containers by means of a heat carrier
        medium and a relatively expensive apparatus that couples the two
        sorption medium containers. As a result, it is possible to
        partially transfer the heat of operation in order to heat the
        sorption agent and expel the operating medium while forcing it
        into a second sorption container during its cooling process. As
        a result, less operating heat has to be generated in order to
        heat the second sorption medium container. Therefore, the system
        is able to exchange as much heat as desirable between the two
        sorption medium containers. In devices such as the one described
        above, the relationship between the cold that is generated with
        respect to the heat that is generated can be greatly improved. </p>
      <p>An alternative device for exchanging heat between two sorption
        medium containers is described in "Zeolites: Facts, Figures,
        Future"; by P.A. Jacobs and R.A. Van Santen on page 519,
        published in 1989 by Elsevier Science Publishers, B.V.
        Amsterdam. In this reference, two sorption medium containers are
        heated by oil. During a first phase, the oil coming from the
        first sorption medium container is heated in a heater, and flows
        into the second sorption medium container. The oil is cooled in
        the second sorption medium container due to the fact that the
        sorption medium therein absorbs the heat energy. This causes the
        sorption medium in the second sorption medium container to
        desorb the operating medium. The oil is subsequently cooled a
        second time by an oil/air heat exchanger and then provided to
        the first sorption container by a circulation pump. The oil
        which is now located in the first sorption container absorbs the
        heat from the first container thereby cooling the sorption
        medium contained therein. During the next phase of operation,
        the oil flow direction is reversed so that unheated oil is
        provided by the circulation pump to the second sorption medium
        container wherein the oil is heated while the sorption medium in
        the second container is cooled. The oil is then sent from the
        second sorption medium container to the heater where the oil is
        heated and then pumped into the first sorption medium container.
        Therein, the heat of the oil is absorbed by the sorption medium
        of the first container which will cool the oil. Hence, by
        utilizing this oil cycle, a sorption medium container is cooled
        and another is heated while the heat losses are only equalized
        by the heater. This can only be achieved when the sorption
        medium container heat exchangers are designed so that the heat
        emitted by the oil is consistently provided to the lowest
        temperature portions of the sorption medium. This requires
        maintaining a slowly progressing and severely limited
        temperature variation along the heat exchanger surface. </p>
      <p>The above requirements result in a heat exchanger design
        wherein only a relatively small area of the face of the heat
        exchanger transfers heat between the oil and the sorption
        medium. As a result, the remaining portion of the heat exchanger
        face is ineffective during the individual partial operating
        phases. In practical applications, extremely large heat
        exchanger faces are required which can correspondingly cost a
        significant amount. </p>
      <p>Installations of this type have additional disadvantages.
        First, only the sorption medium filling that is in close
        proximity to the hot oil inlet within a sorption medium
        container is heated. The boundary of the resulting desorption
        front within the sorption medium will subsequently traverse
        through all of the sorption medium filling if enough heat is
        provided. During the heating of the sorption medium, the
        operating medium is normally desorbed. However, since some areas
        of the sorption medium may not be heated to the critical
        desorption temperature level, any desorbed operating medium will
        not be expelled and liquified into an operating medium steam
        trough as desired. Instead, the unheated portions of the
        sorption medium will readsorb the operating medium that is
        expelled by the heated sorption medium areas. This causes the
        first operating medium steam that is liquified to be provided to
        the operating medium steam trough only after heating the
        sorption medium for a relatively long time after the individual
        partial operating phase has begun. </p>
      <p>Tests have shown that this relatively long heating time may be
        up to 50% of the total cycle time. Due to the readsorption of
        the operating medium, the areas of the sorption medium which
        have not yet been heated by the oil are later heated. The oil is
        undesirably heated by these heated sorption areas before leaving
        the sorption medium container. The required severe and limited
        temperature gradient during the oil cycle is therefore
        significantly effected. The same negative effect correspondingly
        occurs in the adsorption phase. </p>
      <p>A further disadvantage consists in that due to the relatively
        slow flow of oil and the long flow path in the heat exchanger, a
        relatively large volume of oil must be cycled in order to obtain
        desired results. Therefore, the system becomes so slow that
        approximately 30 minutes are needed before the first cold
        production is realized after the initial system startup. As a
        result, this device is not suitable for relatively short
        operating times or a cyclical on/off operation. </p>
      <p>The final disadvantage is that oil is flammable. Therefore, the
        use of oil requires various safety measures against overflow and
        combustion, as well as high drive energies for the circulation
        pump and expensive heat exchangers for heating or cooling of the
        oil. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a sorption
        medium container arrangement and method which permits a heat
        exchange between two sorption medium containers whereby the
        effort of material and drive heat is low and the partial
        operating phases are relatively short. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to obtain a large
        variation in temperature between the input and output of the
        heat exchangers so that almost a linear temperature gradient is
        realized along the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        sorption medium container arrangement and method which overcomes
        the inherent disadvantages of known sorption medium container
        arrangements and methods. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, a
        sorption agent container device having a regenerative heat
        exchange includes two sorption medium containers and at least
        one heat exchanger for use with each sorption medium container
        for the purpose of absorbing or emitting heat. Each sorption
        medium container is filled with a sorption medium that can
        absorb an operating medium by releasing heat and can desorb or
        expel the operating medium by absorbing heat. The sorption
        medium container arrangement also includes steam sources or
        steam troughs which are connected to the sorption medium
        containers. The steam source or trough is designed to provide or
        receive operating medium steam. A heat carrier medium flows
        through the heat exchanger of the first sorption medium
        container during a first partial operation phase wherein the
        sorption medium is cooled and the first sorption medium
        container is heated. The operating medium is subsequently heated
        by a heater and flows through the heat exchanger of the second
        sorption medium container wherein the operating medium cools
        itself by releasing heat to the sorption medium. During a second
        partial operating phase, the operating medium is initially
        provided to the second sorption medium container, whose sorption
        medium is cooled. Subsequently the operating medium is heated by
        the heater and thereafter flows through the heat exchanger of
        the first sorption medium container wherein the operating medium
        is cooled and the sorption medium is heated. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of the illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to
        be read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, a sorption medium container
        arrangement constructed in accordance with the present invention
        will now be described. The sorption medium container arrangement
        includes sorption containers 1 and 11 which are connected with
        operating medium steam sources/troughs 2 and 12 by means of
        operating medium steam lines 4 and 14. Preferably, corresponding
        sorption containers, operating medium steam lines and operating
        medium steam sources/troughs comprise an airtight closed system.
        Condensers or evaporators may be utilized as the operating
        medium steam sources/troughs. However, other comparable devices
        can perform the desired functions. The operating medium steam
        sources/troughs are designed to alternatively provide operating
        medium steam and to remove operating medium steam, from the
        sorption medium containers 1 and 11. A specific arrangement for
        the operating medium steam sources/troughs is disclosed in
        German Patent No. DE-OS 35 21 484.8. </p>
      <p>Heat exchangers 6 and 16 extend through the sorption medium
        filling (not shown) of the sorption medium containers 1 and 11.
        The heat exchangers are flow connected through heater 5. Ambient
        air is provided through ventilator 7 and fed through the heat
        exchanger 6, whereby the ambient air absorbs heat from the
        sorption medium. This causes the sorption medium of container 1
        to cool. The air flowing out of the heat exchanger 6 is then
        additionally heated by heater 5 and blown into heat exchanger
        16. The sorption filling within sorption container 11 absorbs
        heat from the heated air which in turn cools the air that is
        provided through the heat exchanger 16. The cooled air is then
        emitted to the environment by ventilator 17. </p>
      <p>According to the first partial operation phase as shown in FIG.
        1, operating medium steam is desorbed from the sorption medium
        in sorption medium container 11 and fed through steam conduit 14
        into the operating medium steam trough 12. The operating medium
        steam is subsequently liquified within the steam trough and
        stored therein. Simultaneously, operating medium steam is
        provided by operating medium steam source 2 through operating
        medium steam line 4 and adsorbed by the sorption medium in
        sorption medium container 1. The adsorption heat that is
        released by the sorption medium in container 1 is provided to
        the heat exchanger 6 and is discharged to the airflow supplied
        by ventilator 7. The heat from the heat exchanger 6 as well as
        the desorption heat supplied by the operating medium is carried
        by the airflow through heater 5. The airflow then passes to the
        heat exchanger 16 wherein the heat is transferred to the
        sorption medium of container 11. The airflow provided by
        ventilators 7 and 17 causes a temperature gradient within the
        heat exchangers 6 and 16. The temperature is at its highest in
        each sorption medium at the intersection with heater 5, while
        the opposite ends of the sorption container are at a
        correspondingly lower temperature level. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2, the sorption medium container
        arrangement of FIG. 1 is illustrated in accordance with the
        second partial operation phase. During this phase, ambient air
        is driven by ventilator 17 and fed through heat exchanger 16 and
        subsequently through heater 5 into heat exchanger 6 of sorption
        container 1. Therefore, it can be seen that the flow direction
        is reversed as compared to that of FIG. 1. In the partial
        operation phase of FIG. 2, the sorption containers 11, 1 as well
        as the operating medium steam sources/troughs 12, 2 reverse
        their function as compared to FIG. 1. As a result of the
        reversal of airflow from the environment, the sorption medium
        within sorption medium container 11 is cooled. Thus, operating
        medium steam is provided through the operating medium steam
        conduit 14 from operating medium steam source 12. The ambient
        air that is provided by ventilator 17 and heated within heat
        exchanger 16 is emitted from the heat exchanger and heated in
        heater 5. The airflow is fed into heat exchanger 6 so as to
        transfer heat through the heat exchanger 6 to the sorption
        medium of sorption container 1. The operating medium trapped
        within the sorption medium in sorption container 1 is desorbed
        and the operating medium steam is emitted through the operating
        medium steam line 4 to the operating medium trough 2 as shown in
        FIG. 2. As a result of the above process, the air exiting the
        heat exchanger 6 is noticeably cooler than the air which first
        entered heat exchanger 6. However, the air leaving heat
        exchanger 6 is still hotter than the ambient air that was
        provided by ventilator 17. Additionally, during this partial
        operating phase, the portions of the heat exchanger which are
        closer to the heater 5 are noticeably hotter than the other
        portions of the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Subsequent to the second partial operation phase as illustrated
        by FIG. 2, the flow direction of the ventilators 7 and 17 and
        the resulting airflow is reversed so that the system operation
        is continued in accordance with FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3, sorption medium containers 1 and 11,
        operating medium steam conduits 4 and 14 as well as the
        operating medium steam sources/troughs 2 and 12 are present as
        previously described with regard to FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG. 3
        simultaneously illustrates both partial operating phases of
        FIGS. 1 and 2. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 3, air blower 20 provides an ambient airflow
        which is fed through flap 21 causing flap 21 to rotate in a
        counterclockwise direction. The airflow is provided through heat
        exchanger 16 where the airflow is heated. Thereafter, the
        airflow is forced into heater 5 wherein the airflow is
        additionally heated. Within heater 5, the airflow is admixed
        with hot exhaust gas 22 which heats the airflow. In the heated
        condition, the airflow/exhaust gas mixture enters the heat
        exchanger 6 and transfers heat through the heat exchanger 6 to
        the sorption medium of sorption container 1. This transfer of
        heat permits the airflow/exhaust gas mixture to cool. The
        airflow/exhaust gas mixture then leaves the sorption container 1
        and is fed through flap 21. Since the exhaust air is hotter than
        the ambient air that is continually provided by air blower 20,
        an additional heat exchanger 23 is connected at the
        airflow/exhaust gas mixture outlet in order to absorb any
        residual heat remaining in the airflow/exhaust gas mixture. The
        heat exchanger 23 can be of any known type including devices
        such as a hot water heater. </p>
      <p>At the conclusion of the first partial operation phase, and
        before the second operation phase begins, the flap 21 is
        adjusted by 90.degree. (shown in phantom). As a result of the
        rotation, ambient air is fed through air blower 20 in a
        clockwise direction through heat exchanger 6, heater 5, heat
        exchanger 16 and subsequently through heat exchanger 23. In a
        manner similar to that of the first partial operation phase,
        during the second partial operation phase, hot exhaust gas 22 is
        admixed in heater 5 with the airflow provided from heat
        exchanger 6. This combined airflow/exhaust gas mixture is then
        fed into heat exchanger 16. The adsorption or desorption
        reactions within sorption containers 1 and 11 occur, as a result
        of the transfer of heat, in a manner similar to that previously
        described in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 4, an additional embodiment of a sorption
        medium container is illustrated in a cross-sectional view. A
        heat insulated U-shaped flow conduit 40 is formed from limiting
        walls 41 and 42. In the two straight portions of the flow
        conduit 40, two sorption medium container bundles are provided
        which consist of metal corrugated hoses 43. Each corrugated hose
        contains sorption medium 44 and a flow conduit 45. Located at
        the open ends of the U-shaped flow conduit 40 are ventilators 46
        and 47 which are driven by an electromotor 48. The ventilators
        can alternately change their rotational direction so that air
        being fed by the ventilators can also change flow direction. </p>
      <p>For example, during the first partial operation phase, ambient
        air is provided by ventilator 46 and forced through the right
        hand portion of the U-shaped flow conduit 40 having sorption
        medium 44 contained within metal corrugated hose 43. A heater 5
        is provided at the bottom of the U-shaped flow conduit. The
        heater 5, which may be a propane gas burner having a feed line
        49, ignites and burns the propane gas together with the airflow
        being fed by ventilator 46. As a result of this combustion
        process, the air that is provided through the right corrugated
        hose bundle is heated and fed through the left hand portion of
        the U-shaped flow conduit. Thereafter, the airflow is discharged
        to the environment by ventilator 47. </p>
      <p>As a result of the above process, the right side of the
        U-shaped flow conduit 40 is cooled while the left side of the
        U-shaped flow conduit is heated. Upon changing the rotational
        direction of drive motor 48, air is fed in the reverse
        direction. When the rotational directions are changed, the
        ambient air that is provided by ventilator 47 is heated within
        the left hand portion of the U-shaped flow conduit and further
        heated by the gas burner. As a result, the heat that is absorbed
        by the airflow is transferred to the sorption medium contained
        within the corrugated hoses in the right hand portion of the
        U-shaped flow conduit. This arrangement permits control of the
        sorption process without utilizing a flap as disclosed in
        connection with FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 5, a sorption medium container
        arrangement is shown which can be provided, for example, at the
        end of an exhaust pipe 50. Two sorption medium containers are
        symmetrically positioned around the perforated pipe end 51 of
        the exhaust pipe 50. The sorption medium containers consist of
        metal corrugated hoses 43 which are confined within two sorption
        medium container bundles. One end of the group of metal
        corrugated hoses 43 is connected with condenser/evaporator pipes
        52 which are provided with heat exchanger lamellas 53 in order
        to emit the condenser heat to the ambient air. Alternatively,
        the condenser/evaporator pipes and heat exchange lamellas can be
        used during evaporation of the operating medium to absorb heat
        from the environment. </p>
      <p>The total sorption medium container arrangement in accordance
        with FIG. 5 is in parallel with a strong airflow characterized
        by arrow C. The airflow C may be generated by the movement of a
        travelling motor vehicle. Utilizing two pivotable flaps 54 and
        55, the right sorption medium container bundle has airflow C
        flowing thereon. After hot exhaust air had been admixed with the
        airflow by the perforated pipe end 51, the left sorption medium
        container bundle has the airflow C flowing thereon. The
        airflow/exhaust gas mixture leaves the system through outlet 56.
        In order to reverse the process, the flaps 54 and 55 are moved
        to the positions shown in phantom by rotating pivotable flaps
        about rotating axis 58 and 59. As a result, airflow C is first
        forced over the left sorption medium container bundle, then
        further heated by hot exhaust gases. Finally, it flows through
        the right hand bundle and exits the system through outlet 57. </p>
      <p>The advantage of the arrangement according to FIG. 5 is that no
        ventilators or blowers are required for operation. By simply
        readjusting flaps 54 and 55, the flow within the sorption medium
        container system is changed. With an arrangement of the system
        at the end of the exhaust pipe of a motor vehicle, an "air
        conditioning" system may be operated from the heat contained in
        the hot exhaust gases. </p>
      <p>By utilizing a gas mixture as the heat carrier medium, specific
        advantages with respect to the state of the art sorption agent
        container devices with a regenerative heat exchange are
        obtained. In particular, the use of air as the heat transfer
        medium renders the use of an oil/air-cooler and an oil
        circulation pump unnecessary since the present invention
        utilizes the ambient air as the heat trough. As a result, the
        gas mixture that is emitted from the second heat exchanger does
        not need to be additionally cooled before reentering the first
        heat exchanger. By employing ambient air, the heat carrier flow
        is at the lowest possible starting temperature level. Thus, it
        can significantly cool the first sorption medium filling and
        achieve an optimal adsorption reaction. </p>
      <p>The inventive heat exchanger device of the present invention is
        designed so that it does not bring the total sorption medium
        filling to a possible uniform high or low temperature level as
        is known from the state of the art devices. The present device
        is designed to obtain a large temperature gradient between the
        input and the output of the heat exchangers. An almost linear
        temperature gradient can be expected along the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Since the operating medium steam pressure is generally uniform
        within the sorption medium container, each portion of the
        sorption medium that has different concentrations of operating
        medium causes varying temperature ranges. The present invention
        is designed so that the heat exchange geometry can accommodate a
        relatively large charge volume in each sorption medium part and
        can simultaneously optimize the heat transfer to the heat
        carrier medium so that as much heat as possible can be
        transmitted between the two sorption medium containers. </p>
      <p>Aside from the unavoidable heat losses, energy must be provided
        by the heater in order to heat the gas mixture that will be
        emitted from the second sorption container. Depending on the
        optimization of the heat exchanger, the heat loss is only a
        fraction of that required for the desorption of a sorption
        container. The efficiency number which, for example, is at 0.3
        to 0.4 with a zeolite/water-sorption substance without an inner
        heat exchanger can be improved to values of over 1 by utilizing
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>As a result of the present invention, a simple air blower may
        be used instead of the prior art oil circulation pump. The air
        blower is particularly advantageous because it requires less
        energy to operate as compared to an oil circulation pump and no
        safety precautions are required. In addition, the total weight
        of the sorption agent device is clearly reduced as a result of
        not needing to incorporate safety devices and the heavy oil
        filling. Moreover, a controlled airflow through the heat
        exchanger is not as complicated as compared to an oil cycle. </p>
      <p>When using a gas as a heat carrier medium, a limited
        temperature variance cannot be achieved within the sorption
        medium filling. However, the limited temperature variance is
        compensated in that the heat exchanger geometry is selected in
        such a manner that a relatively high temperature gradient occurs
        between the input of the heat carrier gas mixture and the
        corresponding output. In addition, during the reversal of the
        flow direction, the temperature gradient of the gas mixture is
        maintained. The temperature level changes only during the
        adsorber mode of operation when it becomes low and during the
        desorber mode of operation when it becomes correspondingly high.
      </p>
      <p>When using zeolite as the sorption medium, a further
        temperature range can be observed. For example, the range of the
        lower temperature end of the sorption medium filling fluctuates
        between 40.degree. C. during the adsorption phase and
        160.degree. C. during the desorption phase. At the same time,
        the temperature of the hot end of the sorption medium filling
        fluctuates between 140.degree. and 280.degree. C. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous that the heating of the airflow
        between the two heat exchangers is performed by admixing the
        airflow with hot gases, specifically combustion gases. As a
        result of admixing the combustion gases with the airflow, an
        additional heat exchanger and its corresponding large heat
        exchanger surface is eliminated. The hot gases that are admixed
        with the ambient air may be exhaust gases of a mobile or
        stationary combustion engine or they may be directly generated
        by an oil or gas burner. As a result, the hot combustion gases
        that are admixed in the heater with the ambient airflow are
        provided through the heat exchanger of the second sorption
        exchanger while flowing through the second sorption container.
        The gas mixture cools off by emitting heat to the sorption
        medium filling. During the next partial operation phase, the
        flow direction of the air is reversed so that now the air is
        heated in the second heat exchanger and then both the exhaust
        gases and the airflow are fed through the first heat exchanger.
        In this manner, the heat exchangers are part of the exhaust gas
        lines. Hence, the flow direction of the exhaust gases is solely
        defined by the predetermined flow direction of the gas mixture.
      </p>
      <p>Preferably, the flow direction of the gas mixture can be
        manipulated by air blowers or ventilators. Thereby, the natural
        flow may be helped by the addition of airflow aids such as the
        suction effect of an exhaust flue. </p>
      <p>The mechanism for driving the blower or ventilator for feeding
        the gas mixture is generally performed by electromotors.
        However, it may also be beneficial that the drive be performed
        by hot combustion gases such as occurs with exhaust gas
        turbines. </p>
      <p>In these cases, a change of the flow direction may be performed
        by varying flap positions, whereby the need for change is
        indicated by a thermostat. Bi-metals or so-called memory metals,
        which have a large expansion at a defined temperature, may also
        be utilized to alter the flow direction in response to a change
        in temperature. </p>
      <p>A further advantage to employing gas mixtures as heat carriers
        consists in that the heat carrier medium itself has a low
        noticeable heat capacity. Therefore, when a suitable heat
        exchange geometry is implemented, a faster switch over of the
        flow direction is possible. This results in shorter cycle times
        and higher sorption efficiency. On the other hand, the sorption
        efficiency, the amount of sorption medium and the device volume
        may be reduced. </p>
      <p>Particularly advantageous heat exchanger geometries may be
        obtained by using so-called metal corrugated hoses. As a result,
        the sorption medium is positioned in the inner range of the
        corrugated hose, particularly in the wave crests. A flow conduit
        for the operating medium steam extends through the center of the
        corrugated hose within the sorption medium filling. Each of the
        hose ends are connected with the given operating medium steam
        trough or source. A plurality of these corrugated hoses may be
        arranged in a bundle and may be admitted transversely to the
        corrugated hose axis from the outside. In this manner, a very
        efficient sorption medium container may be built which
        substantially consists of heat exchangers (i.e., corrugated
        hoses). The corrugated hoses should be pressure and vacuum
        resistant and may be made from very thin walled sheet metal. In
        this way, the container has a relatively small percentage of
        weight as compared to the sorption medium filling. The
        particular arrangement of the bundles results in each corrugated
        hose running through a temperature range specific for each hose
        depending on its position within the corrugated hose bundle. </p>
      <p>For example, the lowest sorption temperature of a corrugated
        hose may be 100.degree. C. and its highest desorption
        temperature at 240.degree. C., while the sorption medium in the
        adjacent corrugated hose has the lowest adsorption temperature
        of 115.degree. C. and reaches the highest desorption temperature
        of up to 255.degree. C. As a result, each sorption medium
        portion has a very high temperature fluctuation range. </p>
      <p>When employing zeolite as the sorption medium and water as the
        operating medium, the total sorption system operates in the
        vacuum pressure range in every operation phase. Consequently, as
        a result of the flexibility of the corrugated hoses, the hose is
        shortened in the axial direction. Thus, each corrugation is
        pressed onto the solid zeolite filler within the corrugations
        and the heat transfer from the gas mixture to the inner sorption
        medium filling is improved. </p>
      <p>Good results are also obtained when the corrugated hoses have
        the solid sorption medium in the wave troughs on the outside of
        the corrugated hose and the gas mixture is fed in an axial
        direction within the corrugated hose. Similar to that previously
        described, a temperature gradient is generated between the input
        of the gas mixture and the output from the corrugated hose. This
        means that sorption medium portions at the hot end of the heat
        exchanger operate with noticeably higher temperatures than the
        sorption medium portions on the opposite end of the heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p>Although the illustrative embodiments of the present invention
        have been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
