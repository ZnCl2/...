      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present is concerned with periodically operating, dry
        adsorption coolers. The coolers are of the type which includes
        an adsorption container filled with a solid adsorption substance
        which desorbs steam as an operating substance at a relatively
        high pressure and adsorbs during a subsequent adsorption phase
        at a relatively low pressure. The cooler also includes a
        condenser for liquifying the operating substance and also a
        subsequently disposed collection container. For many years, dry
        adsorption devices were used for cooling food stuffs. More
        recently and at present the more economical compression systems
        have replaced all of the periodic adsorption processes. Today
        there are only two continuously operating adsorption systems in
        use for certain cooling tasks and which operate on the basis of
        the liquid pairs of substances LiBr/H.sub.2 O and H.sub.2
        O/NH.sub.3. In contrast, the more recently suggested pair of
        substances zeolite/water belongs to the dry pair of substance
        classification with which only a periodical cooling process is
        possible. This new pair of substances has very good
        thermodynamic characteristics, but its use in cooling technology
        is limited by the required periodical mode of operation. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>With the above background in mind, it is among the primary
        objective of the present invention to provide a periodically
        operating adsorption apparatus with which a continuous cooling
        is possible. </p>
      <p>This object of the invention is satisfied by filling an
        adsorption container with the pair of substances zeolite/water.
        Connected in succession are the adsorption container, a
        collecting container and a shut-off member. The shut-off member
        is connected as well to a cooling container with a heat
        exchanger for cooling of liquids. </p>
      <p>A further objective is to provide a periodically operating dry
        adsorption cooler including an adsorption container filled with
        a solid adsorption substance which desorbs an operating
        substance at a relatively high pressure and adsorbs during a
        subsequent adsorption phase at a relatively low pressure. The
        cooler also contains a condenser for liquifying the operating
        substance and a subsequently disposed collection container. The
        liquid operating substance flows from the collection container
        where it evaporates during the adsorption phase, and passes
        through a shut-off member into an insulated container and is
        able to flow in the form of steam through the shut-off member
        back into the adsorption substance. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler utilizing an adsorption substance in the form
        of zeolite of the type Mg-A, Na-Y or H-Y, in particular zeolite
        with the commercial designation Y-72 and Y-52 sold commercially
        by Union Carbide Corporation, and utilizing water as an
        operating substance. </p>
      <p>It is a further objective of the present invention to provide
        an adsorption cooler which includes a second shut-off member and
        subsequent thereto a further collecting container and condenser
        and a further zeolite filled adsorption container connected to
        the cooling container. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption container made from glass and being suitable for
        adsorbing radiation heat and to provide zeolite that is
        blackened or contains admixtures of heavy light adsorbing
        substances. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler with adsorption containers that are in good
        heat conducting contact with the exhaust lines of a motor
        vehicle. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler with condensers that are designed for air and
        water cooling. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler wherein the cooling container portion thereof
        contains a heat exchanger which is suitable for the adsorption
        of heat from drinks. </p>
      <p>Still a further object of the present invention is to provide
        an adsorption cooler with a heat exchanger mounted in the
        cooling container and connected with a conventional heater
        regulator of a motor vehicle heating system by means of the
        cooling water cycle. </p>
      <p>It is a further objective of the present invention to provide
        an adsorption cooler with a shut-off member in the form of a
        thermostat valve which is controlled by the discharge
        temperature of the medium flowing through the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler with a shut-off member in the form of an easy
        motion check valve provided with a magnetic or thermostatic
        auxiliary means to let the condensate flow off. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler that operates with shut-off members closed
        during the desorption phase and open at the start of the
        adsorption phase so that the condensate can flow from the
        collection containers into the cooling container. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide a
        shut-off member that remains open during the adsorption phase
        only when the liquids flowing through the heat exchanger exceeds
        a predetermined value. The adsorption container can also be
        designed so that it is exposed to sun radiation during the day
        for heating purposes and can be cooled off at night by emitting
        heat radiation and heat conductivity to the environment. </p>
      <p>A further objective of the present invention is to provide an
        adsorption cooler system wherein the shut-off members are closed
        during a long interruption in operation and that at first both
        shut-off members are opened during the start of the operation,
        no matter in which phase the given adsorption container had been
        at the end of the preceding operational phase. </p>
      <p>With the above objectives among others in mind, reference is
        made to the drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 1, an adsorption container 1 is
        provided with cooling ribs and with zeolite 2 therein. A
        condenser 3, a collecting container 4 and a shut-off member 5
        are connected to the adsorption container 1 in a serial manner.
        A heat exchanger 7 extends through the cooling container 6. The
        heat exchanger 7 is a part of a beer line from a barrel to a
        tap. The temperature of the discharging beer is controlled by a
        regulator 8 which acts on the shut-off member 5. An electrical
        heater 9 heats the adsorption container in the desorption phase.
        A ventilator 10 takes care of the heat exhaustion. </p>
      <p>In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, an adsorption
        cooler similar to that of FIG. 1 is illustrated, with a slight
        modification. Instead of providing an "air cooled" condenser 3
        as in FIG. 1, FIG. 1A shows a conventional "water-cooled"
        condenser 3'. In one embodiment, the water cooled condenser
        comprises means for passing water or other fluid over the heat
        exchange surfaces of the condenser 3B, as by enclosing such
        surfaces within a water-tight enclosure 3A, having an input port
        31A and output port 31B connected in series in a conventional
        water cooling cycle having a pump 33 and preferably a second
        heat exchanger 34, as illustrated in FIG. 1A. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, the adsorption cooler is
        being used as a vehicle air conditioning unit. Two adsorption
        containers 1 and 11 are supplied with heat through two exhaust
        gas lines. A flap 12 controls the exhaust gas flow. The
        condensers 3 and 13, the collecting container 4 and 14 and the
        shut-off members 5 and 15 are connected in a serial manner to
        the adsorption containers 1 and 11. The insulated cooling
        container 6 contains the heat exchanger 7. The adsorption cooler
        is connected with the cooling water cycle of the vehicle. A
        circulation pump 16 circulates the cool water through the
        heating register 17. The cooling water cycle is separated from
        the remainder of the cooling water system of the engine by a
        shut-off device 18. </p>
      <p>The operational principles of the present invention are
        applicable to both the embodiments of FIGS. 1 and 2. The
        periodic mode of operation of the adsorption cooler is separated
        into two partial phases. </p>
      <p>Zeolite is heated in a desorption phase. For example in the
        embodiment of FIG. 1, electric heater 9 is employed to heat the
        zeolite 2. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the exhaust gases heat
        the zeolite in the container. </p>
      <p>In this phase, steam is desorbed from the zeolite and is
        liquified in the connected condenser 3. The condensate flows
        drop by drop into the collecting container 4. The shut-off
        member 5 prevents a discharging into the cooling container 6.
        The duration of the desorption phase can take between a few
        seconds and a few days depending upon the geometry of the
        adsorption container and the amount of zeolite. </p>
      <p>The zeolite is cooled in the following adsorption phase. It
        starts with the adsorption of steam during the cooling down
        phase in accordance with its thermodynamic adsorption
        characteristic. The steam which is siphoned off or removed by
        suction from the adsorption container 1 is resupplied from the
        collecting container 4. Thus, the condensate cools below the
        condenser temperature. The shut-off member 5 is open during this
        cooling operation. The condensate flows into the insulated
        cooling container 6 and evaporates further therein. </p>
      <p>Thereupon, the steam flows through the collecting container 4
        back to the zeolite 2 while the shut-off member 5 is open. At an
        evaporation temperature of 0.degree. C., the water collecting in
        the cooling container 6 starts to freeze. If the heat fed
        through the heat exchanger 7 is less than the cold generated by
        the adsorption, the ice layer grows in the cooling container 6.
        Therefore, a corresponding amount of water is introduced into
        the cooling chamber in order to store the desired total cold
        production in the form of ice. </p>
      <p>The adsorption phase is finished when the zeolite has reached
        its lowest temperature and when the steam pressure in the
        adsorption container 1 has increased to the evaporation pressure
        in the cooling container 4. The adsorption phase is interrupted
        when shut-off member 5 is closed. The zeolite cannot adsorb any
        water, however, its adsorption ability is maintained. As soon as
        the shut-off valve 5 is opened, steam can flow to the zeolite
        and cool the cooling container 6. Due to a controlled opening
        and closing, the temperature of the water entering and filling
        the cooling container or the temperature of the liquid flowing
        through the heat exchanger can be accurately controlled during
        the adsorption phase. </p>
      <p>The shut-off member 5 is closed before the repeated desorption
        phase. Hot steam is condensated from the zeolite 2 in the
        condenser 3 and not in the cooling container 6. The ice layer
        which had built up in the cooling container is not melted down.
        The stored amount of cold or cooling power is sufficient that it
        covers the demand for cooling power of the consumer during the
        desorption phase during which a generation of cooling power is
        not possible in this system. The stored cold or cooling power is
        cold on demand through the heat exchange 7. Therefore, the
        maximum removal of the cold capacity may be a multiple of the
        average cold capacity. </p>
      <p>The adsorption cooler of the present invention is capable of
        being advantageously used in the cooling of drinks, for example,
        beer, water, lemonades and other beverages. The warm beverage
        flows from a beverage container through the heat exchanger in
        the cooling container and releases heat to whatever water is
        present and filling the cooling container. The discharge
        temperature of the beverage can be controlled in a simple manner
        by a thermostat which opens the shut-off member when a
        predetermined temperature is exceeded and closes it when the
        temperature falls below the predetermined temperature. The
        cooling effect is immediately available and, also, with an
        unusually high efficiency in a desorbed and cooled adsorption
        cooler. This is in contrast to a conventional compression
        system. The customary cooling water buffer in compression
        systems is no longer required. An effective cooling of the
        beverages is made possible even without a connection to
        electricity. </p>
      <p>Generally, it is recommended to heat the zeolite during the
        desorption phase by means of an electrical resistor line. Since
        adsorption and condensating heat (above 50.degree. C.) may be
        generated at high temperatures, the use of waste heat is also
        possible. For example, it is advantageous to preheat consumption
        water through a liquid cooled condenser. However, the condenser
        should be additionally air cooled so as to emit condensation
        heat to the ambient air, if need be. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, cooling rooms or cooling furniture may be cooled
        with the adsorption cooler in accordance with the present
        invention. In those instances, a cooling brine circulates
        through the heat exchanger instead of the beverages. </p>
      <p>The position and shock proof independent adsorption enables the
        installation of the adsorption cooler in motor vehicles. The
        adsorption cooler may be used for air conditioning automobiles
        and buses as well as cooling of commercial vehicles. This is
        depicted in the embodiment of FIG. 2 where the exhaust gas line
        is separated into two parallel systems of the present invention.
        The two parallel systems operate side by side in the same
        manner. They contain corresponding parts. Accordingly,
        adsorption containers 1 and 11 are serially connected with
        condensers 3 and 13, collecting containers 4 and 14, and
        shut-off members 5 and 15 respectively. The shut-off members 5
        and 15 are connected to a single cooling container 6 which
        surrounds the heat exchanger 7. Accordingly, describing one of
        the serial arrangements of components of the adsorption cooler
        of the present invention also serves to describe the companion
        serial arrangement. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, a flap system 12 in the exhaust line
        deflects the exhaust gases over the adsorption containers 1 and
        11 sequentially as determined by the control flap 12. Thus,
        first the exhaust gases are directed by control flap 12 to
        container 1 during the desorption phase of that container and
        away from adsorption container 11 which is in the adsorption
        phase of its cycle. The direction is reversed when adsorption
        container 11 is in the desorption phase and adsorption container
        1, is in the adsorption phase. By use of the appropriate control
        flap, the exhaust gases can be directed to one or both of the
        adsorption containers at the same time or in sequence depending
        upon the chosen means of operation. Alternatively, the heating
        of the zeolite may also be performed by means of an idle heater
        when the vehicle is not being used. </p>
      <p>A separate burner is normally provided when using refrigerated
        trailers. The transmission of the cooling power or cold stored
        in the cooling container 6 into the space to be cooled is
        performed through a brine cycle 19 with a separate circulation
        pump 16, as illustrated in FIG. 2. As shown, heat exchanger 7
        (mounted in the insulated cooling container 6) is connected in
        series with a heat exchanger 17 (i.e. cooling register) and the
        circulation pump 16 to form a vehicle cooling circuit. In a
        passenger automobile, an engine 22 is connected in parallel with
        a vehicle heater and an engine radiator 23 by way of a cooling
        water cycle 21 of the 22. In this arrangement, the vehicle
        heater comprises a conventional heat regulator 18 and the heat
        exchanger 17, which functions as a heating register in the
        vehicle heater circuit (i.e. working water cycle). Notably,
        heating register 17 of the vehicle heater may be used
        alternatively as a cooling register in the vehicle cooling
        circuit. Only the circulation pump 16 has to be used when
        cooling is required. </p>
      <p>Particular advantages are obtained with respect to a vehicle
        cooling during the starting phase with a hot inner vehicle space
        in a stop and go traffic situation. In contrast to the
        mechanical cooling the cooling effect remains present over a
        longer time period after the motor has been shut-off, depending
        on the amount of zeolite and ice in the cooling container. This
        is certainly a welcome effect for drivers frequently in heavy
        traffic such as taxi drivers. The stop and go cooling problems
        are solved in the same manner. A vehicle which has been heated
        by sun rays may be cooled to an acceptable inner temperature in
        about 20 minutes. A vehicle with an adsorption cooler of the
        present invention may be cooled with high efficiency before the
        motor is even started. When the shut-off member is opened for a
        short time for discharging the condensate into the cooling
        container when shutting off the motor and is subsequently
        closed, the zeolite can cool off in the uncharged condition and
        can adsorb heavily after a renewed opening of the shut-off
        member. The cooling efficiency generated in the cooling
        container is then particularly high. </p>
      <p>The adsorption cooler may be used in the heating phase of the
        motor transitorily for heating the inner space by means of a
        simple control technical measure. For this purpose, the shut-off
        member to the cooling container remains closed during the
        desorption phase. The steam desorbed from the zeolite condenses
        on the heat exchanger in the cooling container. The condensation
        heat is transmitted to the inner space through the cooling water
        cycle and the heating register. </p>
      <p>A further very effective application of the present adsorption
        cooler is found with respect to the brine cooling system
        illustrated in FIG. 3. In the system 25, the adsorption cooler
        is heated during the day by means of sun rays. During the night
        the zeolite cools off and adsorbs the water. In this manner, the
        adsorption cooler generates ice during the cooling off period
        which remains stored in the cooling container and may be used
        for cooling tasks the following day. It is recommended that the
        cooling container be of sufficiently large dimensions so that a
        number of days may be bridged without any sun rays. The brine
        operated adsorption cooler can be used without any additional
        components like water cooling or hot water storage, in contrast
        to all known solar cooling systems. A simple easy motion check
        valve is sufficient as the shut-off member which is supported
        for opening after the desorption phase by means of an auxiliary
        device, for example a magnet or a thermostat. The check valve
        between the cooling container and adsorption container remains
        open by means of the pressure difference as soon as the
        condensate is discharged into the cooling container. </p>
      <p>In the solar-operated adsorption cooler 25 illustrated in FIG.
        3, the adsorption container 1 may be designed as a collimating
        collector which more easily reaches the required temperatures of
        above 130.degree. C. for an effective desorption. The adsorption
        container preferably consists of glass 27 which is provided with
        a suitable coating. For an improved heat adsorption, zeolite 2
        may be blackened or may contain black light adsorbing admixtures
        26, like charcoal. The shut-off member of the adsorption cooler
        25 is realized as an "easy motion" check valve 28 provided at
        the bottom opening of the collection container 4. Check valve 28
        has an opening and closing motion such that it can be opened and
        closed easily, that is with minimal force or displacement
        provided by a thermostatic lever or switch 29 known in the art.
        A heat exchanger 7 is contained in the insulated cooling
        container 6 and is adapted for passing fluid (e.g. beverage)
        through the heat exchanger 7. The temperature of the fluid
        passing through the heat exchanger 7, is sensed by an auxiliary
        temperature sensing device 30. The thermostatic switch 29 opens
        and closes the easy motion check valve 28 in response to a
        predetermined temperature level sensed by the auxiliary
        temperature sensing device 30, whereby the opening of the easy
        motion check valve 28 permits the liquefied operating substance
        in the collection container 4, to flow into the insulated
        cooling container. </p>
      <p>Of course, adsorption coolers with only one adsorption
        container can adsorb heat during the desorption phase. For
        example, in a motor vehicle where exhaust gas is constantly
        available, this type of heat use is insufficient. However, this
        difficulty may be circumvented in that a second shut-off member
        with a collecting container, a condenser and an adsorption
        container is connected to the cooling container. This system is
        depicted in FIG. 2. As previously stated, the mode of operation
        of the secondary system is identical with the primary system
        described in detail above in regard to desorption and adsorption
        phases. However, an additional advantage in the parallel systems
        is that the individual phases may be performed completely
        independent of each other. While one desorption container is
        heated, the other may be cooled, for example, thus increasing
        the amount of ice in the cooling container. However, both
        adsorption containers may operate at the same phase, for
        example, in the aforementioned cooling process of the vehicle
        during the starting procedure. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment of FIG. 2, an optional timer control 40 is
        provided to the shut-off valves 5 and 15. The timer control
        operates when the shut-off members 5 and 15 are closed during a
        long interruption in operation of the cooler system. The timer
        control 40 ensures that after a long interruption in operation,
        both shut-off members 5 and 15 initially are opened during the
        start of operation, regardless of the phase either one of the
        adsorption containers had been in, at the end of the preceding
        operating phase. </p>
      <p>The zeolites which are particularly suitable are the ion
        exchanged Mg-A-zeolite and the Y-zeolites Y-52 and Y-72
        available commercially from Union Carbide Corporation. These
        zeolites have sufficient cycle and temperature stabilities.
        Thus, their use is permitted during high desorption and
        condensation temperatures. </p>
      <p>Thus, the several aforenoted objects and advantages are most
        effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred
        embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein,
        it should be understood that this invention is in no sense
        limited thereby and that scope is to be determined by that of
        the appended claims. </p>
