      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an adapter for an adsorption
        system, and more particularly to an adsorption system adapter
        for coupling an adsorption agent container to an operating
        medium steam source. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>In the field of adsorption technology, there are differences
        between absorption apparatus and adsorption apparatus.
        Specifically, one evident difference is that adsorption
        apparatus utilize solid adsorption materials. Adsorption
        apparatus are known to operate as either closed systems or open
        systems. When utilizing either a closed or open system, the
        operating medium is exothermally adsorbed by an adsorption
        agent. As a result, the operating medium steam source that
        provides the operating medium is cooled due to the evaporation
        of the operating medium. Since both the closed and open systems
        operate during the adsorption phase without air, the system
        pressure is only generated by the evaporation pressure provided
        by the operating medium. In contrast to open systems, closed
        systems operate without the presence of air even after
        desorption of the operating medium. However, semi-open systems
        desorb operating medium in an air atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Known open systems and closed systems utilize adsorption
        techniques for generating both heat and cold. In order to
        generate the heat or cold, adsorption filler is contained in an
        adsorption container which is in communication with the
        operating medium steam source. In order to regulate the flow of
        operating medium steam, a valve is provided between the
        adsorption filler and the steam source so as to prevent the
        adsorption reaction when the valve is closed. When the valve is
        opened, and if a sufficient vacuum pressure is provided,
        operating medium steam will flow into the adsorption filler.
        However, if a sufficient vacuum pressure is not present, the air
        (and corresponding air pressure) contained within the system
        will prevent a rapid adsorption reaction. </p>
      <p>Closed adsorption systems are relatively inflexible because
        they require the presence of a permanent vacuum for operation.
        Since the adsorption filler and the steam source must be fixedly
        connected with each other and are therefore not exchangeable,
        closed apparatuses have relatively limited applications. In
        contrast, semi-open systems are substantially more flexible,
        since a simple exchange between the steam source and the
        adsorption container can occur because a permanent vacuum
        pressure need not be sustained. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorption system adapter for coupling an adsorption agent
        container to an operating medium stream source. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorption system adapter and method of using the same which
        overcomes the inherent disadvantages of known adsorption system
        adapters and methods. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, an
        adapter for coupling an adsorption agent container, having
        adsorption agent therein, to an operating medium steam source,
        having operating medium therein, includes a sealing seat for
        coupling the adsorption agent container to the adapter in a
        vacuum tight manner. The adapter further includes a sealing face
        for coupling the operating medium steam source to the adapter in
        a vacuum tight manner. </p>
      <p>The adapter also includes a flow conduit which provides fluid
        communication between the operating medium steam source and the
        adsorption agent container when both the adsorption agent
        container and the operating medium steam source are coupled to
        the adapter. Separating means is also included which defines a
        tortuous path for substantially permitting a flow of operating
        medium steam and substantially preventing operating medium
        particles from traversing through the flow conduit. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features, and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be
        read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, an adsorption system
        adapter for coupling a variety of different adsorption agent
        containers to a variety of different operating medium steam
        sources constructed in accordance with the present invention
        will now be described. The adapter 1 preferably includes a
        "disk-like" base body 2 with a sealing seat 3 for a vacuum tight
        connection of an absorption agent container 4 to the adapter.
        The adapter also preferably includes a sealing face 5 for a
        vacuum tight connection of an operating medium steam source 6 to
        the adapter. The sealing seat 3 and the sealing face 5 are
        preferably formed by a soft rubber ring. The sealing seat of the
        adapter is designed to connect to an inlet opening 7 of the
        absorption agent container 4, while the sealing face of the
        adapter is designed to connect to an outlet opening 8 of the
        operating medium source 6, in a vacuum tight manner. </p>
      <p>In a preferred form of the present invention, the lower part of
        the operating medium steam source 6 is substantially filled with
        an aqueous liquid 9, and the adsorption agent container 4 is
        substantially filled with an absorption agent 10. The adsorption
        agent is preferably in a solid granular form. The adsorption
        agent container further includes a screen 11 which is designed
        to retain the absorption agent within the adsorption agent
        container and prevent the adsorption agent from falling out
        through inlet opening 7. The screen 11 is preferably held in
        place by an inner shoulder 16 of the adsorption container. The
        adsorption agent container 4 further includes a metallic cover
        12 which has a vacuum pipe 13 through one region. The vacuum
        pipe includes an inner end having holes 14 therethrough
        contained within the adsorption agent container, and an outer
        end with a hose connection means 15 attached thereto. A vacuum
        device (not shown) may be connected to the connection means in
        order to facilitate the removal of air and nonabsorbed gases
        from the adsorption agent container through holes 14 and vacuum
        pipe 13. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the adapter
        base body 2 is provided with a flow conduit 17 for permitting
        the fluid communication of the absorption agent container 4 and
        the operating medium steam source 6. Specifically, the flow
        conduit 17 permits the flow of operating medium steam from the
        steam source 6 into the adsorption agent container 4. The
        adapter 1 further includes a separating means 18 mounted on the
        base body 2. The separating means 18 may be coupled to the base
        body by means of a threaded screw 19. The separating means is
        mounted to the base body in such a manner that the flow conduit
        includes a tortuous path for preventing a direct straight-line
        flow of operating medium steam from the steam source to the
        adsorption agent container. As a result of the tortuous path of
        flow conduit 17, non-vapor particles which may have been
        included in the operating medium steam will be prevented from
        contacting the adsorption agent filler 10. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2 of the drawings, an alternative form of
        the present invention will now be described. The adapter 1 of
        the present invention is shown in FIG. 2 as being connected to a
        cylindrical adsorption agent container 4 and to a cylindrical
        operating medium steam source 6. In contrast to the embodiment
        of FIG. 1, the vacuum line 13 of FIG. 2 extends through inlet
        opening 7, and the vacuum line is detachably coupled to the
        adapter by vacuum connector 20 which includes an O-ring seal 21.
        The adsorption container 4 of FIG. 2 also includes a screen 11
        which engages vacuum line 13 by means of shoulders 22. Screen 11
        is also secured to metallic cover 12 of adsorption container 4
        by means of shoulders 16. Preferably, one end of the vacuum line
        13 is coupled to the bottom of the adsorption agent container 4
        as shown in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, a plurality of
        openings 23 are located at the end of vacuum line 13 at a region
        proximate to where it is coupled to the adsorption agent
        container. The openings 23 are included for permitting the
        expulsion of air and nonadsorbed gases from the adsorption
        medium 10 proximate to the openings 23. The air and nonadsorbed
        gases are preferably expelled from sorption medium through
        vacuum line 13 and vacuum bore 24 by a vacuum device (not
        shown). The vacuum device may be connected to connector 25 by a
        flexible hose (not shown). </p>
      <p>The adapter 1 also includes a bore 26 which is utilized for
        venting the operating medium steam source 6 and adsorption
        medium container 4. During normal operation, bore 26 is closed
        by sealing seat 3 to maintain a closed system and vacuum
        pressure. However, when the operating medium container 6 or
        adsorption medium container 4 are to be replaced, the vacuum
        pressure of the system is reduced by simply removing sealing
        seat 3 from bore 26 so that the appropriate container can be
        removed from the adapter and replaced. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the adapter
        1 also includes separating means 18 coupled to base body 2 by
        means of screw 19. If screw 19 is rotated a sufficient amount
        with separating means 18 coupled thereto, the separating means
        18 can engage sealing seat 3 and close flow conduit 27 which
        provides fluid communication between the operating medium
        container 6 and the adsorption medium container 4. When the
        separating means engages the sealing seat 3, the adsorption
        agent container is prevented from receiving a flow of operating
        medium steam from the operating medium steam source. </p>
      <p>In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the
        operating medium steam source 6 may include a double-walled
        container which substantially encloses a beverage 28 for
        cooling. In the interior of the container double wall, an
        absorption means 29, such as a sponge-like material, is
        provided. The absorption means is preferably in good heat
        conducting contact with the inner surface of the double-walled
        container. The absorption means 29 is preferably saturated with
        a liquid such as water. In order to cool the beverage 28, a
        vacuum pump (not shown) is connected to connector 25 of adapter
        1 through a hose (not shown) for removal of air and nonabsorbed
        gases from the adsorption agent filler 10 through vacuum line
        13. The air and nonabsorbed gases are removed from the container
        6 until the internal system pressure is lowered below the water
        vapor steam pressure. Thereafter, water evaporates from the
        absorption means 29 and flows to the adsorption agent filler
        causing the absorption means to cool. Heat from the beverage is
        transferred through the container wall to the absorption means
        causing more water to evaporate from the absorption means which
        lowers the temperature of the absorption means once again. The
        water vapor steam preferably flows proximate to the separating
        means 18 and into the adsorption agent container 4 in accordance
        with arrows 27 shown in FIG. 2. The water vapor steam is
        thereafter adsorbed in the adsorption medium container by the
        adsorption agent filler 10. Air and nonabsorbed gases are also
        taken along with the flow of water vapor steam and provided to
        the adsorption agent filler 10. The nonabsorbed gases and air
        components are provided through opening 23 and removed from the
        adsorption medium container by way of the vacuum line 13 and
        vacuum pump (not shown). </p>
      <p>Utilizing the adapter as described above in accordance with the
        invention, interconnection of a variety of different adsorption
        agent containers and a variety of different operating medium
        steam sources is readily possible without additional connection
        means. During connection of the adsorption agent container to
        the operating medium steam source, a closed flow conduit is
        provided for the transfer of operating medium steam from the
        operating medium steam source to the adsorption agent container
        which is substantially filled with adsorption agent. Since the
        operating medium steam source may be a container of any given
        size having differing amounts of operating medium, it is
        necessary to provide a separating means between the steam source
        and the absorption agent container that prevents liquid
        operating medium particles from being included with the flow of
        operating medium steam. If liquid operating medium particles are
        introduced into the adsorption agent filler, the adsorption
        capacity of the adsorption agent will be rapidly exhausted and
        therefore the amount of cold generated by the system is severely
        limited. </p>
      <p>All shapes and sizes of containers are suitable for use as the
        adsorption agent container as long as the chosen container is
        suitable for receiving solid adsorption agent or liquid
        absorption agent. Preferably, the container is vacuum tight and,
        if the adsorption agent is a liquid, the container should also
        be vacuum resistent. Furthermore, the adsorption agent container
        should have an inflow opening for the operating medium steam
        which can be coupled in a vacuum tight manner with the sealing
        seat of the adapter. The adsorption agent container may also
        include a heater so that operating medium can be expelled from
        the adsorption agent and returned to the operating medium steam
        source container after saturation. The adsorption agent
        container may also include additional heat exchanger faces so as
        to disperse the thermal energy of the system to an external
        medium during the adsorption reaction. </p>
      <p>A plurality of known adsorption agents used in the
        refrigeration technology are suitable as adsorption agents
        provided that the selected adsorption agent is compatible with
        the operating medium being utilized. Water is frequently used as
        the operating medium in semi-open adsorption systems. Operating
        mediums like alcohols or ammonia are less suitable for use with
        semi-open systems because semi-open systems are characterized by
        the operating medium being emitted to the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Zeolite and silicagel are known adsorption agents which can be
        utilized when water is the operating medium. Zeolites are
        characterized by the ability to adsorb water vapor steam very
        rapidly and at high concentrations. Therefore, zeolites are a
        particularly advantageous absorption agent for semi-open
        systems, wherein the operating medium is water. It is
        particularly advantageous to utilize zeolites of the type which
        adsorb water molecules and which only adsorb relatively small
        amounts of air components. This type of zeolite does not readily
        adsorb nitrogen molecules. This is preferable since air
        components such as nitrogen, which are released during the
        adsorption of water vapor steam, would tend to affect future
        vacuum performance and prevent a rapid adsorption reaction. If
        air components happen to be adsorbed by the adsorption medium,
        it is preferable to utilize the vacuum device to remove the
        expelled air components from the adsorption medium. </p>
      <p>A plurality of containers are suitable for use as the operating
        medium steam source container provided that the container has an
        opening of sufficient size for the operating medium steam to
        exit, and that this opening is capable of providing a vacuum
        tight connection with the sealing face of the adapter.
        Therefore, all containers with a plane edge such as a drinking
        glass would be suitable for use. In addition, a double wall
        container which contains an absorption medium such as a sponge
        within the interior of the double wall and which binds aqueous
        substances, is preferably in good thermal contact with the inner
        face (wall) of the container. Containers which are also suitable
        for use include those capable of receiving a smaller container
        for placement therein wherein the outer surfaces of the smaller
        container are in thermal contact with the absorption material.
        Examples of such a configuration include metallic beverage cans
        and glass bottles that can be surrounded with a wet jacket. </p>
      <p>In order to cool the contents of the smaller container, the
        smaller container is placed within a suitable receiving
        container together with the wet jacket. The receiving container
        is thereafter coupled with this vacuum tight opening to the
        sealing face of the adapter so that air and nonabsorbed gases
        can be expelled from the adsorption agent by means of a vacuum
        device which is also coupled to the adapter. As soon as the
        vapor pressure of the adsorption agent container falls below the
        operating medium steam pressure of the aqueous substance, the
        aqueous substance evaporates and thereby cools itself as well as
        the smaller container to which the aqueous substance is
        thermally in contact. The operating medium steam which is
        generated flows through the flow conduit to the adsorption agent
        container where it is adsorbed by the absorption agent. The
        adsorption agent increases in temperature and preferably emits
        the heat energy through the adsorption agent container walls to
        the environment. The connection of the vacuum device to the
        adsorption agent container must be such that only air and
        nonabsorbed gases are removed from the adsorption container and
        substantially no operating medium steam which flows into the
        adsorption agent filler is expelled. </p>
      <p>If the vacuum device is permitted to operate for a long enough
        period of time, the aqueous substance (i.e., beverage to be
        cooled) may be cooled until it solidifies. If the aqueous
        substance to be cooled is water, the solidifying vapor steam
        pressure is at 6.1 mbar. Therefore, the vacuum device employed
        would preferably reach a pressure of less than 6.1 mbar. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the base
        body of the adapter is shaped like a disk wherein the sealing
        seat for attachment to the adsorption agent container is coupled
        to one face of the base body and the plane sealing face for
        attachment to the operating medium steam source is coupled to an
        opposite face. Since all adsorption agent containers and water
        steam sources generally have a cylinder-like geometry, space and
        material is saved with a disk-like adapter. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the sealing
        seat and the sealing face are arranged on opposite surfaces of
        the base body such that they are located in parallel opposed
        planes. If the adsorption agent container and the operating
        medium steam source have suitable support faces, the water steam
        source or the adsorption agent container may alternatively serve
        as support. In this manner, the operating medium steam sources
        with upper positioned as well as with lower positioned exit
        openings may be coupled to an adsorption agent container with a
        single adapter. </p>
      <p>It is preferable to equip the adapter with a mounting means for
        coupling the adsorption agent container to the adapter.
        Therefore, removal of the adapter from the adsorption agent
        container can be prevented without the elimination of system
        vacuum pressure. This is particularly advantageous if the
        adapter is also used for covering the adsorption agent container
        during period of non-use. It is preferable to close the
        adsorption agent container during periods of non-use if there is
        substantial humidity in the environment which may impair the
        adsorption capacity of the adsorption agent. In such a
        situation, it is advantageous if the separating agent is a
        droplet separator as shown in FIG. 1 which can close the flow
        conduit and eliminate the fluid communication between the
        operating medium steam source and the adsorption agent
        container. </p>
      <p>When a vacuum device is coupled to the system for the purpose
        of assisting in the removal of air and nonadsorbable gases from
        the adsorption medium container, the system must be ventilated
        in order to separate the operating medium steam source from the
        adapter. In order to ventilate the system, it is advantageous to
        provide the adapter with a vent valve through which the
        operating medium steam source is directly vented. As a result,
        the adapter will also prevent the flow of operating medium steam
        from providing dust particles from the adsorption agent filler
        into operating medium steam source when the adsorption system is
        vented. </p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, air and nonabsorbed gases are removed
        from the adsorption agent filler with the assistance of the
        vacuum pump. In order to facilitate this vacuum process, a
        suction pipe having one end within the adsorption agent
        container and a second end outside the adsorption agent
        container are provided with a connector for coupling to the
        vacuum pump. When removing an adsorption agent container from
        the adapter, typically two connections have to be disconnected
        for removal of the saturated container and reconnected in order
        to install a new unsaturated adsorption agent cartridge. For
        this purpose, the adapter in accordance with the present
        invention includes a separate connector for coupling the vacuum
        pump so that the adsorption agent container need only be
        disconnected from the adapter and not from the vacuum pump. In
        accordance with the invention, this connection may be an
        immerser pipe having one end fixed in the adapter with a
        suitable connecting socket for coupling to the vacuum pump,
        while its other end penetrates deep into the adsorption agent
        container so as to assist in the removal of air and nonabsorbed
        gases. The insertion of the immerser pipe into the adsorption
        agent container is preferably performed with the sealing seat
        and through the inlet opening of the operating medium steam
        source container into the adsorption agent container. However,
        the vacuum line can be fixedly mounted onto the adsorption agent
        container and exchanged when the adsorption container is
        replaced. Furthermore, in order to be able to remove air and
        nonabsorbed gases through the adapter with a vacuum device, an
        additional vacuum connection is preferably provided which
        connects the vacuum line with the adapter within the sealing
        seat. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
