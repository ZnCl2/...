        <p><b><font size="+1">System Comprising at Least One Absorption
              Heat Pump</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>In a system with at least one absorption heat pump, a working
        medium is generated in a generator or explusion unit by the
        input of heat energy of relatively high temperature, from an
        absorption material. The generated working medium is condensed
        in a condenser and then undergoes expansion in an expansion
        unit. The expanded, condensed working medium is evaporated in an
        evaporator with the input of heat energy at a relatively low
        temperature and the evaporated working medium is absorbed again,
        in an absorber, in the absorption material. The heat energy,
        used for generation of the working medium from the absorption
        material, is so stored for the heat pump that the heat energy,
        as taken from the store, is on hand at a temperature which is
        high enough for the generation of working medium from the
        absorption material. The heat store may preferably take the form
        of a sorption store, comprising a zeolite as sorption material
        and forming a part of a further discontinuously operated
        absorption heat pump. Such a heat pump, using zeolite and,
        preferably H.sub.2 O as a working material system, is
        responsible, when used by itself, for a useful effect on
        producing useful heat (that is to say heat able to be utilized)
        at a relatively high temperature, as for example 80.degree. to
        100.degree. C. and higher and, if desired, for producing cold as
        well. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>(i) Field Covered by the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a process for the operation of
        a system comprising at least one absorption heat pump, in which
        a working medium or fluid is generated or expelled, by the input
        of heat energy at a relatively high temperature, from an
        absorption material, the generated working medium is condensed,
        the condensed working medium undergoes expansion, the expanded,
        condensed working medium is evaporated by the input of heat
        energy at a relatively low temperature, and the evaporated
        working medium is lastly absorbed again in the absorption
        material. Furthermore, the invention relates to forms of plant
        for effecting such a process. </p>
      <p><b>(ii) The Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>For making the best economic use of fossil and nuclear energy
        supplies on hand, heat pumps have of late come to play an
        increasingly important part for heating purposes, in addition to
        their use in refrigeration and cooling systems, which have been
        in existence for a much longer time. One shortcoming in this
        connection, which has so far not been completely taken care of,
        is with respect to supplying a heat pump with input energy.
        Compressor heat pumps, powered by an electric motor, have the
        shortcoming of needing their own, further power from the public
        electricity line and such further power may well be, in fact,
        needed at the same time as the peak load on the public
        electricity line. This is true not only for heating, but
        furthermore for cooling (that is to say generally "temperature
        control") of rooms. While it is true that this shortcoming may
        be taken care of by the heat pump only being run at off-peak
        times, more specially overnight, and by the heat or cold being
        stored in a heat or cold storing unit, from which it may then be
        taken as needed, the heat coming from a heat pump is generally
        at low temperatures so that low-temperature heat storing units
        of great size would be needed for storing the necessary amount
        of heat. Much the same would furthermore be true for the storing
        of cold. </p>
      <p>Absorption heat pumps may be supplied with input power or
        energy by oil or gas burners so that some of the shortcomings
        noted for electric motor-powered compressor heat pumps are taken
        care of. Absorption heat pumps, supplied with input power by a
        gas or oil burner, have, however, their own special
        shortcomings: Economic use of the primary energy makes it
        necessary for the cold and/or heat output of the heat pump to be
        kept in step with the heat need at the time in question, that is
        to say the plant's output rate has to be controllable. However,
        stepless control of oil burners has turned out to be difficult.
        On-off automatic control has, on the one hand, not given
        anything like the same efficiency as continuous control and,
        furthermore, at times when the heat need is generally low, in
        which the on-times of the burner are generally short and
        separated by long off times, there is the danger of the
        combustion by products being condensed in the chimney or stack.
        The supply rate from a public gas system furthermore has an
        upper limit and, generally speaking, in this case as well,
        smooth loading of the system without any sudden increases at
        peak loading times is desired. Furthermore, when the oil or gas
        heating is turned off, there will be great heat losses because
        of the convection through the chimney, which may not be stopped.
        Electric heating of absorption heat pumps produces the same
        shortcomings with respect to loading of the public line as
        driving of a compressor heat pump by an electric motor. </p>
      <p>In the U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,870 (Bahel et al.) a suggestion has
        been made for producing hot water with the energy of the sun and
        storing it in a supply vessel for use, if heat is needed, simply
        for heating purposes or, if cooling is needed, using it for
        heating (after further heating in the condenser of a compressor
        heat pump) the generation unit of an absorption refrigeration
        machine. The heat energy, stored in the hot water, can not, as
        such, be used for operation of the absorption refrigeration
        machine, however, because of its low temperature level. </p>
      <p>In the U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,569 (in part the same as the German
        Offenlegungsschrift specification No. 2,720,561 (Tschernev)), an
        account is given of a cooling system, working on the same lines
        as an absorption refrigeration or cooling machine, with, for
        example, a zeolite-water working medium system, and with heating
        with energy from the sun. Because, on producing a cooling
        effect, the generation unit is heated by solar energy, the
        working medium, evaporated on producing a cooling effect, has to
        be stored till absorption takes place again. For that reason, it
        is only the working medium and not the input or useful energy
        which is stored. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,138,861 (Wurm) and 4,169,362
        (Weil et al) disclose solid adsorption air conditioning
        apparatus using, inter alia, the system zeolite-water as an
        adsorbent-working fluid system. It is, however, not to be seen
        from these publications that zeolite has properties making it
        useful as an absorption material for an absorption heat pump
        system in which not only useful heat at a relatively high
        temperature level is produced, but, in addition to the heating
        effects, cooling effect (cold) is obtainable and, further
        operation-energy for a subsequent heat pump may be stored with
        good effect. </p>
      <p>The German Pat. No. 596,308 (Normelli) describes a
        discontinuously working absorption refrigeration or cooling
        machine, in which the working medium is generated, is condensed
        and stored, when cheap energy, as for example overnight
        electricity, is on hand, at a later point in time, when a
        cooling effect is desired, the stored working medium is
        evaporated, for producing such a cooling effect, and absorbed
        again. The heats of condensation and absorption are to be used
        as well. However, wide-scale use of this system has so far not
        been possible because the right sort of absorption
        medium/working medium systems have not so far been designed, and
        it is, furthermore, not to be seen from the above patents that
        zeolite would be useful for a system, working with completely
        different operation properties of the type disclosed below. </p>
      <p>Lastly, multi-stage absorption heat pumps have been suggested
        in German Pat. Nos. 620,249; 671,791 and 678,942, the first
        stage heat pump being utilized as a heat store. The operation
        heat or driving heat supplied to the first stage has so far been
        limited to temperatures below about 180.degree. C., because
        practical working medium systems for higher temperatures were
        not available. Further these multi-stage systems do not make
        optimum use of the heat output of the first stage. </p>
      <p><b>SHORT OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>For these reasons, one purpose of the present invention is that
        of designing a system or a plant for producing heat and/or cold
        with at least one absorption heat pump, which makes possible
        low-price operation and the best possible use of energy sources
        on hand. </p>
      <p>This and other purposes are effected in a system comprising at
        least one absorption heat pump, wherein the driving or input
        energy to the heat pump is stored in at least one of the
        following forms: specific heat, latent heat and heat stored in a
        zeolite by expelling an absorbed medium or fluid. </p>
      <p>According to a first aspect of the invention, the heat or cold
        energy, which may be used for heating or cooling purposes as
        necessary; is not stored as known, rather it is the driving or
        input heat energy at a relatively high temperature for the
        absorption heat pump which is stored. That is to say, heat
        energy is stored which, on heating is further increased by the
        heat pump before use for heating purposes or, on cooling, is
        latter used for producing cold (cooling effect). </p>
      <p>The heat energy for a generation unit of the heat pump has to
        be stored, naturally enough, within a temperature range, which
        is wide enough for operation of the generation unit of the
        absorption heat pump, for which purpose an operation temperature
        range of the storing unit from 200.degree. C. to about
        100.degree. C. may be great enough. Specially useful effects
        are, however, produced on using a "high temperature heat storing
        unit", that is to say a heat store, whose upper limit to the
        operation temperature (temperature of the storing medium at the
        end of charging) may be 800.degree. C. and more and, generally,
        will be greater than 180.degree. C. or, more specially, greater
        than 200.degree. C. or 250.degree. C. </p>
      <p>A further important aspect of the present invention is to
        provide an absorption storing system, making possible the
        storing of the driving heat for an absorption heat pump at high
        enough temperatures and, furthermore, able to operate as an
        absorption heat pump. This absorption heat pump, operating with
        a special absorption medium/working medium system along new
        lines, may be used with very good effect for heating and/or
        cooling purposes by itself, that is to say without any output
        second heat pump supplied by it with driving or input heat
        energy (generation heat). </p>
      <p>Because of the use of a heat store for the input energy for the
        absorption heat pump, great benefits are achieved by my
        invention in a number of different directions: The heating
        apparatus, supplying the heat to be stored in the heat store,
        may be run under the best possible operation conditions. On
        using an electric heating system for the storing of heat in the
        heat store, cheap-rate electricity may be used overnight, or
        electricity which is not otherwise needed may be used at times
        of low loading. Furthermore, in the heat store, the waste heat
        of an engine, a turbine or an industrial process may be stored.
        On heating the store with fuel, the burner may be operated under
        optimum conditions and with long on times. Then the store may be
        heat-insulated or cut off so that no stack losses will take
        place. </p>
      <p>Automatic control on the heat-producing side is unnecessary,
        and, in place of this, the absorption heat pump may be
        automatically controlled by withdrawing from the store the
        amount of stored energy needed at any given time. The wording
        input or "driving energy"(operation energy) is to be taken, for
        this reason, herein to have the sense of the heat energy used in
        the generation unit for driving out (generating) the working
        medium from the absorption material, it having a relatively high
        temperature. The wording is not to be taken to have the sense of
        the heat energy supplied to the evaporator of the heat pump,
        this heat energy having a relatively low temperature. </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiments of our invention's heat storing
        units, which are described in detail below are completely safe,
        are not the cause of any damage to the environment, and may be
        run with materials which are not poisonous or corrosive. </p>
      <p>In comparison with storing heat and/or cold as supplied by a
        heat pump run on cheap rate electricity in the night, there is
        the further useful effect or step forward that, even with the
        use of overnight electricity, the heat pump may be used in the
        daytime, in which, generally the greater part of the heat and/or
        cold (cooling effect) is needed. Furthermore, in the daytime,
        generally the heat needed for the evaporator will be on hand at
        a higher temperature level than overnight so that useful heat
        may be produced at a higher temperature level and/or the heat
        pump may be run with a higher efficiency. </p>
      <p>The wording "absorption heating pump" is herein to be taken to
        have the sense of resorption heat pumps as well; in this case
        evaporation and condensation of the working medium are the same
        in function as desorption and resorption. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The system shown in FIG. 1, which may be used for heating
        and/or cooling, includes an absorption heat pump, generally
        numbered 10, and a heating apparatus, generally numbered 12, for
        a generation or expulsion unit 14 of the heat pump 10. The
        generation unit 14 comprises as usual, an absorption material
        for absorption of a working medium, which may undergo generation
        or expulsion, by heating, from the absorption material again. </p>
      <p>The generation unit 14 has an outlet for working medium in gas
        form, coupled by a pipe 16 to a condenser 18 operating as a heat
        exchanger, and having a heat outlet 20. In a system designed for
        heating, there will be output of useful heat (heat made use of)
        at this point while, in the case of a cooling plant only, this
        will be the take-off point for waste heat. </p>
      <p>Coming from condenser 18, liquefied working medium goes by way
        of pipe 22, a throttle valve 24 and a pipe 26 into an evaporator
        28, which operates as a heat exchanger and has a heat input 30
        by way of which the heat energy goes in, which is necessary for
        evaporation of the liquefied and depressurized working medium.
        On use of the system for cooling, the heat input 30 will take up
        the heat which is to be removed. The evaporated working medium
        goes by way of pipe 32 to an absorber 34, in which the working
        medium vapor is absorbed by the absorption material, giving up
        heat of absorption, which goes to a useful heat or waste heat
        output 36 of the absorber. </p>
      <p>The absorption material, having taken up the working medium, is
        transported by way of pump 38 into the generation unit 14, which
        has a heat input part, for example in the form of a heating tube
        coil 40. Because of the input of heat, the working medium is
        regenerated from the absorption material again and the
        absorption material, then depleted of working medium, goes by
        way of an absorption material output line 42 and a throttle 44
        into absorber 34. </p>
      <p>The absorption heat pump 10 operating continuously has further
        parts of normal design, not given in the figure to make the view
        simpler, as for example heat exchangers between absorption
        solvent with a high and with a low level of working medium, and
        between working medium in liquid and gas forms. It is, however,
        possible to make use of a discontinuously working heat pump, of
        which an account will be given, for example, in connection with
        FIG. 3 (portion 212). </p>
      <p>The heating apparatus 12 for the absorber heat pump 10
        preferably comprises a high-temperature heat store 46. The
        wording "high-temperature heat store" is to be taken to have the
        sense of a heat store, which is worked with an upper operation
        temperature limit of the storing medium greater than 250 and,
        more specially greater than 400.degree. C., up to more than
        800.degree. C. Such high temperature heat storing units are
        known in the art and, in part, have been produced with a high
        level of technical development. Examples of such conventional
        high-temperature heat stores are, for example (a) ceramic stores
        with, for example, MgO-ceramic material; (b) salt stores, making
        use of the heat of fusion of salts, for example LiF; (c) cast
        iron stores and (d) sorption stores. Further details and
        observations on the design of a sorption store for the present
        purposes will be given in connection with FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>In the case of the working example of FIG. 1, the heat store 46
        is heated up or "charged" by electrical heating elements 48. The
        storing medium itself is naturally shut off in a heat-insulating
        housing 50, which is only roughly outlined in the figure. </p>
      <p>For transport of the stored heat from the heat store or storing
        unit 46 to the generation unit 14, use may be made of a heat
        carrier circuit 52, which has a pipe coil 54, placed in the heat
        store, and which, by way of a pipe 56 is joined with the inlet
        of the pipe coil 40, forming the heat input part, in the
        generation unit 14. The outlet of the pipe coil is joined by way
        of pipe 58 with an intermediate store 60, from which a pipe 62,
        having a control valve 64, goes to the inlet of pipe coil 54. If
        the heat carrier or transfer is water, the pipe 56 is used for
        steam, which will be condensed in the coil 40 giving up heat.
        The condensed water then goes by way of pipe 48 into the
        inbetween store 60, from which the water goes, as needed, by way
        of the automatic control valve 64, joined up with an automatic
        control system, back into the pipe coil 54, in which it is
        evaporated again. </p>
      <p>With the help of the control valve 64, the heat or cold output
        rate of the absorption heating pump 10 may be regulated
        steplessly in the simplest possible way so that a good level of
        efficiency is secured. </p>
      <p>If a heat transfer medium is used in the heat transfer circuit
        52, which keeps liquid in the operation temperature range of the
        heat store and of the generation unit, in addition a circulating
        pump 66 will be used as part of the heat transfer circuit 52. If
        the pumping rate of the circulating pump is able to be
        controlled, the control valve 64 will not be needed. </p>
      <p>On operation of the system of FIG. 1, the heat store, which is
        best designed as a high-temperature heat store, such as a
        ceramic material store or a cast iron store with an upper limit
        to the operation temperature of about 800.degree. C., is charged
        up by the electrical heating elements 48 when there is only low
        loading of the public electricity system. The heat pump 10 is
        powered by taking heat energy from the heat store 46, such
        taking of heat and, for this reason, the heat output and/or
        cooling effect of the heat pump being independent in time from
        the charging of the heat store 46 and, using the control valve
        64 or the pump 66, may be steplessly controlled. </p>
      <p>The generation (or expulsion) unit 14 may, for emergencies, be
        designed with a standby heating apparatus 15, making possible
        operation of the heat pump 10 even if the heat store 46 has not
        yet been charged up, or if the heat energy, with which it was
        charged, has been used up. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is a view of a modification of part of the heating
        apparatus 112 for a heating system of the type shown in FIG. 1.
        The heating apparatus 112 has a heat store 146 placed in a
        fire-box or combustion chamber 168, which has heat insulation
        150 and a burner 170 within it, getting oil or gas fuel by way
        of a line 172. The heat store 146 is best designed as a
        high-temperature heat store, for example a ceramic material or
        cast iron store. Furthermore, it may be designed to be heated up
        by electrical heating elements 148 or by a heat transfer fluid,
        e.g. oil, which in turn is heated e.g. by concentrated solar
        heat or waste heat. </p>
      <p>The chamber 168 is connected to a stack 174, able to be shut
        off by a shut down door 176, when burner 170 is not in operation
        for cutting heat losses. In stack 174 a heat exchanger 178 is
        placed for making use of the rest of the heat of the gases
        produced by burning, this heat being used, for example, for
        producing hot water. In place of a combustion chamber for liquid
        fuels or, in addition to such a chamber, it is furthermore
        possible to have a fire-box designed for solid fuels (coal,
        wood, waste material which may be burned) or for operation by
        hot waste gases or a heat transfer fluid connected to any
        suitable heat source. Furthermore, the heating system may be
        designed on the same lines of that of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>A further sort of store, which may be used with good effect, is
        a "sorption store", that is to say a form of store working with
        desorption and sorption of a working medium by or in a sorption
        medium, as for example with a CaO/H.sub.2 O system. In the
        present case sorption stores which use zeolite as the absorption
        medium or material are preferred. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 is a view of a further embodiment of the system of the
        invention which operates with a sorption store. Parts which are
        the same as parts of the system FIGS. 1 and 2, are marked with
        part numbers, whose first figure is a 2, while the two last
        figures are the same as those used for the parts of the plant of
        FIGS. 1 and 2. For this reason, the account, now to be given of
        the plant of FIG. 3, is limited to parts of it which are
        different to those of FIGS. 1 and 2. </p>
      <p>The heating apparatus 212 for the generation unit 214 of the
        heat pump 210 is designed in the system FIG. 3 as a heat pump
        joined up with the input of the main heat pump 210, and it has a
        sorption heat store 246, which is best designed for operation
        with zeolite as the sorption material and with water as the
        working medium. It would, however, be possible to make use of
        other absorption/working medium systems, as for example
        zeolite/CH.sub.3 OH, zeolite/NH.sub.3, CaO.sub.2 /H.sub.2 O
        systems or systems using their mixtures, of which details will
        be given later on. The heat store 246 has a liquid-tight housing
        246a (which may be made up of the housing units or modules) in
        which the absorption material is placed (not shown). In the
        account now to be given, it is assumed that the absorption
        material in store 246 is zeolite and the working medium is
        H.sub.2 O. The housing is figured diagrammatically as a box, but
        in fact it will be made up of a number of modules, as is
        generally normal in the art. </p>
      <p>The housing 246a is joined up with a working medium vapor
        output line 382, having a shut-off valve 382a, and going to a
        heating coil 340 in the generation unit 214 of the absorption
        heat pump 210. The outlet of the heating coil 340 is joined up
        with the working medium storing vessel 384, which, in the case
        of the working medium used (water) in the present example will,
        for this reason, comprise liquid water. The store vessel 384 has
        an outlet line 386 which is joined by way of a liquid/gas heat
        exchanger 387 (only to be used if necessary) and which is useful
        in the case of a high working medium vapor density in the
        evaporator 394, with a throttle valve 388 made up of a shut-down
        and control valve and which has its low pressure end joined by
        way of an evaporator 394 and the gas end of the heat exchanger
        387 with a working medium inlet line 390 of the sorption store
        246, which has a shut-down valve 390a. Between the inlet end of
        the heating coil 340 and the inlet of the storing vessel 384, a
        heat exchanger 392 may be advantageously be provided, from which
        heat may be taken for use. </p>
      <p>In the heat store 246 there is furthermore a tube coil 254,
        used for taking off heat energy, which is stored in the heat
        source 246 as specific heat, and which is given off on input of
        the working medium as sorption heat. The tube coil 254 is joined
        up as part of a heat transfer medium circuit 252, which, for
        example, may be worked with water as the heat transfer medium
        and has an outlet line joined up with the outlet end of the tube
        coil 254. This outlet line 256 goes to a second heating coil
        246, placed in the generation unit 214. The outlet side of the
        heating coil 240 is joined up by way of an outlet line 258,
        which has a heat exchanger 304 within it, with the inlet of a
        heat transfer medium storing vessel 260, whose outlet is joined
        by way of a control valve 264 (or with a controlled rate pump
        266 having the function of pump 266, or the function of pump 66
        in FIG. 1) with the inlet end of the tube coil 254. </p>
      <p>An account will now be given of the operation of the heating
        apparatus of FIG. 3: </p>
      <p>In the heat store 246, using the electrical heating system 248
        and/or the burner 270 and/or by the input of heating air, hot
        waste gases, heat transfer fluid and the like, heat energy is
        stored. When this is done, vaporized working medium is generated
        from the absorption material in the heat store 246 and
        desorption heat and, furthermore, specific heat, are stored in
        the absorption material. On generation, valve 382a is opened and
        valve 390a shut. The vapor of the working medium goes through
        the heating coil 340 where it is condensed and the heat thereof
        goes into the generation unit 214 of the absorption heat pump
        210. The working medium (water), now in a liquid form, is stored
        in the storing vessel 384. The control valve 388 is generally
        shut when charging up the heat store 246. If no operation or
        driving heat is needed for the heat pump 210, the working medium
        may be forced to give up its heat in the heat exchanger 392, for
        example for room heating or for producing hot water. </p>
      <p>If, later on, heat is needed for the generation unit 214 of the
        heat pump 210 and/or cold (a cooling effect) is needed at the
        input of the evaporator 394, the working medium, controlled in
        its rate by the valve 388, designed as a shut-down and control
        valve, will go into the sorption heat store 246. The valve 382a
        is now shut and the valve 390a opened. The working medium will
        then be absorbed by the absorption material, giving off sorption
        heat, which is transported by the heat transfer circuit 252 to
        the heating coil 240 in the generation unit 214, and the heat
        pump 210 is now supplied with its driving or operation energy. </p>
      <p>The heating coils 340 and 240 will, in the way of operation
        noted, give up heat to the generation unit 214 at different
        times. </p>
      <p>When the heat store 246 has given up so much heat that the
        temperature of the heat transfer medium in the heat transfer
        circuit 252 is no longer at a high enough level for heating the
        generation unit 214, the rest of the heat may be taken from the
        heat store by way of the heat exchanger 304. </p>
      <p>It has been noted earlier on that the heat inlet end of
        evaporator 394 may be used for cooling purposes. If, however,
        heat at a higher level, for example the heat of waste air or the
        like is on hand, the heat input end of the evaporator 394 may be
        heated to a relatively high temperature, this producing the
        useful effect that the temperature level in the heat store 246
        will be moved towards higher temperature values and in the heat
        transfer circuit 252 correspondingly higher temperature will be
        available. </p>
      <p>The heating apparatus 212 may, as noted earlier, be designed
        for operation as a simple sorption heat store, that is to say
        one without increasing the amount of heat, this offering the
        useful effect that a greater amount of the heat able to be used
        (useful heat) will be on hand for later sorption operation. In
        this case, the heating coil 340 may be bypassed by the valve 341
        and generation will be undertaken at such low pressures in the
        generation unit 246 that condensation will take place in the
        heat exchanger 392 at the temperature of the atmosphere. The
        sorption operation will take place as noted and the useful heat,
        produced in this respect, will be taken off by way of the heat
        transfer medium circuit 252. </p>
      <p>The system of FIG. 3 may be changed in design so that the
        heating coil 240 is shorted by a three-way valve 305, or may be
        dropped all together and then the heat transfer medium outlet
        line 256 will be joined with the heat exchanger 304 itself. In
        this case, on discharging the heat store 246, the heat will be
        taken from the system by way of the heat exchanger 304 as useful
        heat, that is to say heat which is to be used for example for
        cooking, washing, washing up, heating rooms or like purposes. </p>
      <p>If the heat stored in the heat store 246 is only to be used for
        heating rooms, the heat transfer medium circuit 252 may be
        replaced by a blower or the like, controlledly blowing air
        through airways in the store 246. </p>
      <p>In a further possible design, which, as well, has its own
        special useful effect, the system is designed without the
        heating coil 340 or, it is shorted by a three-way valve 341. The
        heat of condensation given up on charging the heat store 246 and
        filling the storing vessel 384 is, in this case, then only taken
        off by way of the heat exchanger 392 from the system to be used
        as "useful heat" (and not as waste heat). </p>
      <p>Under certain conditions, for example if heat energy is needed
        at a generally high temperature, or the efficiency of the heat
        pump 210 is at a low level for heating purposes because of a
        very low outside temperature, all the useful heat may be taken
        from the system by way of the heat exchangers 304 and 392 at
        generally high temperatures. </p>
      <p>In the case of the heating system of FIG. 3 it is, generally
        speaking, possible to do without the heat exchanger 387 and the
        evaporator 394. Because of the evaporator 394, which may be
        supplied with low quality heat at a low temperature, the working
        medium circuit may, however, be run with a very useful effect as
        a heat pump, and the heat, supplied by way of the heat transfer
        fluid circuit 252, is increased in amount by the amount of heat
        coming in by way of the evaporator 394. In the case of cooling,
        the cooling effect or cooling power is, in addition, increased
        by the heat taken up by evaporator 394. The heat store 246 is,
        for this reason, run in addition as the generation unit and as
        the absorber of a discontinuously run heat pump, that is to say
        the generation operation and the absorption operation may take
        place at different times in turn. </p>
      <p>It is to be noted, in this connection, that the design of the
        heat pump 10 (FIG. 1) and, in the other case, 210 (FIG. 3) is
        not limited to a special sort of pump. For these heat pumps, it
        is possible to make use not only of continuously run pumps (as
        noted), but furthermore of pump designs run discontinuously as
        the word is used hereinbefore. In the case of a discontinuously
        run absorption heat pump, it is possible, as normal in the art,
        for different parts, which have been named separately, to be
        united with respect to function, for example the generation unit
        and the absorber and/or evaporator and condenser, something
        which will be made clear in more detail later, on using FIGS. 6
        and 7. </p>
      <p>We have pointed out earlier that the heating apparatus 212
        supplying heat energy to the generation (or expulsion) unit 214,
        is run as a discontinuous heat pump with respect to the working
        medium circuit 382-392-384-388-394-390 with the sorption store
        246. If in the heat store 246, which is operated alternatingly
        as an expulsion unit and absorber, zeolite is used as an
        absorption material, the outcome will be a heat pump system,
        which may be worked by itself, that is to say separate from any
        heat pump 210 at its output, because such a system is in the
        position of supplying useful heat at temperatures of the order
        of 100.degree. C. and above. This is not practical with the old
        absorption medium/working medium systems of the prior art. With
        a NH.sub.3 /H.sub.2 O system, the useful heat may be produced
        with a temperature of 60.degree. C. at the most and, in this
        case, the pressure of the working medium on generation will be
        as high as 30 bar. Although a LiBr/H.sub.2 O system makes
        possible higher temperatures of the useful heat, corrosion will
        then be serious and, because of increasing decomposition of the
        lithium bromide, the limit of the generation unit temperatures
        will be as low as about 150.degree. C. A heat pump comprising
        zeolite as absorption material, on the other hand, can be used
        to convert heat of a higher temperature, for example within a
        temperature range of 150.degree. to 300.degree. C. and higher
        into a greater amount of heat of temperatures of about
        100.degree. C. The increase in heat is because of the "pumping
        up" of the low grade low temperature heat going to the
        evaporator 394 and taken for example from the free atmosphere,
        from ground water, an "energy roof" (one with environmental
        energy input) or the like. </p>
      <p>On using the system 212 without any heat pump 210 joined up
        with its output, the heating coils 240 and 340 will not be
        present and the useful heat (or utilized heat) will be taken
        from the condenser 392 and the heat carrier circuit 252. The
        system 212 may furthermore take the place of the heat pump 10 in
        FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>With the system having the heating apparatus 212 and the heat
        pump 210 joined up with its output (as in FIG. 3), it is
        possible for very high efficiencies to be produced. It is to be
        noted that not only for the heating apparatus 212, run as a heat
        pump, but furthermore for the heat pump 210 on its output side,
        in theory the efficiency factor (amount of high temperature
        input heat used for producing the low temperature output heat)
        is, in each case, 2.0. For general purposes, the heating
        apparatus may be taken to have an efficiency factor of 1.4 while
        the heat pump 210 will have an efficiency factor of 1.5, this
        giving an overall efficiency of 2.0. If the burner 270 is taken
        to have an efficiency of 0.8, something certainly possible with
        present-day oil or gas burners, the overall efficiency factor
        will be 1.7 for the primary energy made use of. The efficiency
        factor of the best prior art designs of absorption heat pump
        systems was only about 1.2. </p>
      <p>If the zeolite is run with H.sub.2 O as a working medium--this
        generally being the best way of operation--there will be a
        danger of the working medium's (water) icing up at low outside
        temperatures in evaporator 394. Certain steps may then be taken
        for preventing this: </p>
      <p>Firstly, an anti-frost material, as for example ethyleneglycol,
        may be used in the water in the evaporator 394. Secondly, the
        evaporator 394 may be bridged over or shunted by a valve so
        that, when the valve 386a is opened, liquid water will go
        through line 390 into store 246. </p>
      <p>With respect to operation of the system to be seen in FIG. 3,
        some further points are to be noted, namely: </p>
      <p>(a) Heat may be taken from condenser 218 and/or absorber 234
        and supplied to the evaporator 394. In the case of this form of
        the plant, the heat transfer medium from 218a or 236 may firstly
        be run through 394a before getting to the heat user or cooling
        tower K. In this way, a high temperature is produced in
        evaporator 394. To this end, the heat exchanger 394a is joined
        by way of lines X and Y with heat exchangers 236 and 218a. In
        theory, the efficiency factor of the overall plant will then
        still be 3.0, the working power factor will be about 1.7 and for
        the efficiency of use of the primary energy there will then
        still be a factor of 1.36, taking into account the burner
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>(b) The efficiency of heat pump 210 may be stepped up by using
        the evaporator 394 for: </p>
      <p>1 further cooling of the liquid working medium before it gets
        to throttle valve 224, and </p>
      <p>2 cooling the heat transfer medium, flowing through line 236,
        before it gets to the absorber 234 and/or cooling the heat
        transfer medium, running through 218a, before it gets into the
        condenser 218. In this case, the heat transfer medium in 218a or
        236, respectively, will firstly go through the heat user or
        cooling tower K and, only afterwards, the evaporator 394. The
        resulting reduction of the inlet temperature of the heat
        transfer medium flowing into condenser 218 or into the absorber
        234 respectively, will have the effect of increasing the amount
        of gas removed from or absorbed in the absorbing medium in heat
        pump 210. </p>
      <p>(c) A further possible form for operating on heating is such
        that the sorption store 246 with its evaporator 394 is giving up
        so much heat by supplying heat to the evaporator from the
        surroundings (whose temperature may, for example, be 5.degree.
        C.) that the temperature of the heating coil 240 is eventually
        no longer high enough for the generation of the working medium
        vapor in the generation unit 214; in the case of this form of
        operation, in theory the efficiency, as noted, of the system 210
        to 212 is equal to 4.0. Then the heat transfer medium circuit,
        supplying evaporator 394 with input heat, will be switched over
        to condenser 218 and/or absorber 234 as a heat source, the
        efficiency in theory still being 3.0. Using this measure, the
        vapor pressure of the working medium in the sorption store 246
        and, for this reason, the temperature, will be increased and the
        store may be forced to give up heat in this way to a greater
        degree by way of the heat transfer circuit 252 so that the
        generation unit 214 will again be getting working energy with a
        high enough temperature by way of heating coil 240. </p>
      <p>What has been said so far in this respect has been, more
        generally, in connection with heating operation. Some
        observations are now made on operation with cooling: </p>
      <p>The store 246 is charged with energy, the working medium
        undergoing generation and working energy being supplied to
        generation (or expulsion) unit 214 of heat pump 210 by way of
        heating coil 340 so that cold or cold power will be on hand at
        evaporator 230, it being supplied to a cold user W, that is to
        say something to be cooled. (In the cases of other forms of
        operation, W may be the surroundings). </p>
      <p>On discharge of the store, cold power will be on hand, not only
        at the evaporator 230, but furthermore at evaporator 394. In
        theory, the efficiency of the compound system 210-212 will be 3,
        that is to say one unit of input heat coming to the sorption
        store 246 operating alternatingly as an expulsion unit and
        absorber, will, in theory, be responsible for producing three
        units of cold. If heat pump 210 has a cold efficiency of 0.7,
        something which is likely to be the true value for a lithium
        bromide water system, and the working efficiency of the input
        heat of the heating apparatus 212, changing the heat into
        operation heat for heat pump 210, is equal to 1.4, it will be
        seen that the overall cold efficiency is equal to
        0.7.times.1.4+0.4=1.38. The amount 0.4 added on is the amount
        produced by evaporator 394. </p>
      <p>For these reasons, even on using electricity for heating, the
        present system has an efficiency generally equal to the
        efficiency on operating a compressor refrigeration machine
        (.eta. equal to about 2.1) with electricity from a pumped
        storage hydroelectric plant (.eta. equal to about 0.65). In
        addition, the useful effects generally produced by decentralized
        plants are produced, the transmission lines of the public
        electricity system is freed of heavy peak loads and less
        electricity has to be produced at peak load times. </p>
      <p>When, as discharge of the sorption store 246 goes on further,
        the temperature in the generation unit 214 will lastly not be
        high enough for operation of the heat pump 210, and the cold
        power may only be produced at evaporator 394. Heat pump 210 is
        then turned off and the cooling fluid, which is otherwise
        circulated through the condenser 218 and/or absorber 234, is now
        forced through the heat exchanger 304 so that store 246 may be
        completely discharged and, in evaporator 394, further cold power
        may be produced. </p>
      <p>From a practical point of view, there may be much to be said
        for using the cold power of the evaporator 394 not as such, that
        is to say directly, but for increasing the efficiency of heat
        pumps 210 and 212, now running as a refrigerating machine, by
        making use of the measures of which an account has been given
        earlier in connection with heating operation as the ways of
        working arrangements (a), (b) and (c). </p>
      <p>It should be pointed out that the disclosed zeolite absorption
        heat pump may be used, without any further cascaded heat pump
        (as 210), by itself for cooling or refrigerating and/or heating
        purposes, e.g. in an air conditioning apparatus. A preferred
        application of such one-stage zeolite heat pump is in an air
        conditioning apparatus of a vehicle, as a car, truck or bus, the
        heat pump being powered by the exhaust heat of the vehicle. </p>
      <p>Some examples will now be given for design figures for the
        sorption store 246; in all cases the selection of the greatest
        temperature level for generation is to be such that the
        stability limit of the absorption material/working medium system
        used, for example of the zeolite, is not exceeded. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE I</b> </p>
      <p>Absorption material zeolite; working medium H.sub.2 O </p>
      <p>Let the degree of saturation .xi. of the absorption medium be
        taken to be the ratio of the weight of the sorbed H.sub.2 O to
        the weight of the zeolite in the desorbed condition. </p>

      <p>By using, in place of all or part of the CaO, Mg.sub.x
        Ca.sub.1-x O, and/or mixing in zeolite, the generation unit
        temperature may be lowered while keeping to the same generation
        unit pressue and the same condenser temperature. x may have
        values from about 0.1 to about 1.0. </p>
      <p>Useful effects may be produced by having a division of the heat
        store for putting its heat capacity in line, for example, with
        changes in the heat need (or heat requirement) dependent on the
        seasons of the year. In summer, for example, a heat store will
        take a generally long time to become discharged, it having a
        heat capacity designed for winter operation and, because of
        this, the store would then be used for a generally long time at
        an undesirable low temperature range. </p>
      <p>Division of the store furthermore makes possible a
        quasi-continuous operation by operating the sections of the
        store out of phase with each other; furthermore, the efficiency
        of the system may be increased by internal heat exchange between
        the parts of the store. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 is a view, by way of example, of a sorption store of the
        sort noted in connection with FIG. 3, it being divided up into
        two halves 246a and 246b and which may be used in a system as in
        FIGS. 3, 6 and 7 and furthermore in the system of FIG. 1, if the
        heat pump 10 is a discontinuously run heat pump. Between the two
        store halves, there is heat insulation 250. Each store half has
        is own heating means, as electrical heater 248a (and 248b)
        and/or its own burner 270a (or 270b). In each store half, there
        is a tube coil 254a (and 254b) which may be put in the heat
        transfer medium circuit 252 (FIG. 3) as desired using three-way
        valves 400. </p>
      <p>Each store half furthermore has a working medium outlet line
        382a (and 382b) able to be connected to line 382 (FIG. 3) as
        desired using a three-way valve 402. On the same lines, each
        store half has a working medium inlet line 390a (and 390b) being
        able to be connected as desired to line 390, FIG. 3, by means of
        three-way valve 404. </p>
      <p>A heating system with division of the heat store, to be seen in
        FIG. 4, may be worked in a number of different ways to good
        effect: </p>
      <p>In times when the heat need (or requirement) is low, for
        example in summer, the heating plant may be operated with only
        one half of the store, that is to say only the one half, for
        example half 246a, is completely charged and discharged. Store
        losses will then be lower than on using the complete, full
        store. The other half 246b is out of operation. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, in the case of a sorption store, the two halves
        may be used in turn as a generator and absorber so that it is
        then possible to have a quasi-continuous operation of the heat
        pump part of the heating apparatus 212 (FIG. 3). It is then
        possible, for this reason, for heat to be continuously taken off
        at heating coils 240 and 340 and at heat exchangers 304 and 392
        while at evaporator 394 cold may be continuously produced. </p>
      <p>A further useful effect of the division of the sorption heat
        store is that the heat energy, produced in the generation phase,
        may be re-stored by the inlet of working medium, having
        undergone generation, into the store part run as an absorber. </p>
      <p>One part of the useful effects, of which an account has been
        given in connection with the division of a sorption store, will
        furthermore be produced on the division of other sorts of
        stores, such as ceramic material, cast iron and chemical stores.
      </p>
      <p>In the case of in-turn (or alternating) operation of the two
        halves of the store, it is possible for waste heat, derived from
        stack gases and coming from the heat exchanger 278 (FIG. 4), to
        be supplied to evaporator 394 (FIG. 3). For this reason, the
        temperature level in the absorption phase will be increased,
        because a higher working medium vapor pressure will be produced.
      </p>
      <p>A like increase in temperature will be produced on supplying
        the evaporator 394 with heat energy at a high temperature,
        derived from waste air from kitchens or the like. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows a heat exchanger 504 which may be used with
        specially useful effects in place of heat exchanger 304 (FIG.
        3). The temperature of the heat transfer medium in the heat
        transfer medium circuit 252 (FIG. 3) will undergo great changes
        in fact in the absorption operation cycle of the absorption,
        heat store 246. The exchanger 504 is a hot water heat exchanger
        supplied by way of line 506 with cold water and having a warm
        water output by way of line 508. Line 508 is joined by way of a
        three-way valve 510 with a lower and with an upper heat outlet
        connection 512 (and 514) of the water heater. </p>
      <p>The water heater 504 has, for example, three heating coils 516,
        518 and 520. The input end of heating coil 516 is joined by way
        of an input pipe 307 (see furthermore FIG. 3) with the heat
        transfer medium circuit 252. The inlet ends of the tube coils
        518 and 520 may be joined by way of valves 522 and 524 as
        desired with the inlet pipe 307. The outlet end of the heating
        coil 516 is joined up with the inlet itself of the heat transfer
        medium store 560, while the outlet ends of the heating coils 518
        and 520 are connected by two check valves 526 and 528, to the
        inlet of the heat vehicle medium store 560. When, at the start
        of the absorption cycle, the temperature of the heat transfer
        medium in the heat medium circuit 252 (FIG. 3) is still
        generally high, the heat transfer medium is only run through the
        heating coil 516 (FIG. 5), valves 522 and 524 being shut. With a
        drop in temperature then firstly the valve 522 and lastly valve
        524 are opened and, for this reason, the temperature of the heat
        transfer medium is put in line with the different temperature
        levels of the water column in the water heater 504. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 6 we have a further example of the invention having a
        heating apparatus 212 of the sort noted in connection with FIG.
        3 and whose output is joined up with a heat pump 610, run
        discontinuously as the word is used herein. The heat pump 610
        has a generator 614, heated by the heating apparatus 212 and
        which is run first as a generator and then as an absorber and so
        on. The working medium undergoing generation in the generation
        phase goes through a working medium output pipe 682, having a
        valve 682a, to a condenser 618, supplying useful or waste heat
        by way of a heat exchanger 618a, and is condensed here. The
        condensed, liquid working medium goes into a store vessel 600
        (which, in function, is the same as the store vessel 384). From
        store vessel 600, the liquid working medium is supplied to
        evaporator 630 at a rate controlled by a control valve 624
        acting as an expansion unit. Evaporator 630, which has a heat
        exchanger coil 630a therein, takes up heat so that a system,
        joined up with the exchanger coil 630a, may be cooled. The
        evaporated working medium then goes from evaporator 630 by way
        of a working medium inlet pipe 690 with a valve 690a, more
        specially taking the form of a check valve, back to the
        generator-absorber 614. The generator-absorber 614 furthermore
        has a unit for output of absorption heat freed on absorption of
        the working medium. This apparatus will be seen in FIG. 6 in the
        form of a heat transfer medium circuit 636 made up of: </p>
      <p>a heat exchanger coil 654, used for output of sorption heat,
        and placed in the generator-absorber 614, </p>
      <p>a heat exchanger 604 (for example a room heater, radiator or
        the like) for making use of the sorption heat so taken, or, at
        any rate, taking it out of the system, </p>
      <p>a heat transfer medium store or balancing (compensation) vessel
        660, </p>
      <p>a control valve 664 and, if necessary, a circulating pump 666.
      </p>
      <p>The generator-absorber 614 may, however, be so designed that
        the sorption heat freed on absorption may be taken from it
        straightway or directly, for example by blowing air through a
        tube system placed in it. </p>
      <p>The generator-absorber 614 is run in a first phase (expulsion
        phase) as a generator, the valve 682a being opened and valve
        690a being shut. The working medium, in the form of a gas and
        undergoing generation from the absorption material because of
        the input of heat from the heating apparatus 212, goes through
        pipe 682 into condenser 618, where it is condensed, giving up
        useful heat (that is to say heat to be utilized) and the
        condensed working medium is then taken up in store vessel 600.
        Control valve 624 and valve 690a are generally shut in this
        phase. The heat transfer medium circuit 636 is out of operation
        in this generation phase. </p>
      <p>Then, or at some later point in time as desired, the
        generator-absorber is switched over to absorber operation. Valve
        682a is shut, valve 690a is opened and, by way of control valve
        624, liquid working medium, controlled in a way dependent on the
        need for heat and/or cold, is caused to go from store vessel 600
        into evaporator 630. The evaporating working medium takes up
        heat so that a system, joined up with heat exchanger coil 630a,
        may be cooled. At the same time, absorption heat is freed in the
        generator-absorber 614 and this heat is taken off by way of heat
        transfer medium circuit 636 and made use of, for example, for
        heating water or it may be taken up by the surroundings. </p>
      <p>Examples are now given of some absorption material-working
        medium systems, which may be used in the system of FIG. 6: </p>

      </p>
      <p>The heat transfer medium in circuit 252 may, for example, be
        water (steam) or oil. </p>
      <p>Useful effects may furthermore be produced by not taking the
        heat of evaporation for evaporator 394 from the surroundings or
        a system to be cooled, but from the condenser 618 and/or the
        heat exchanger 604. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 is a diagrammatic view of a system of the sort noted in
        connection with FIG. 6, which, however, by uniting certain parts
        and compounding of the working medium circuits of the heat pump
        used as a heating apparatus, and of the heat pump on the output
        side, has been made even simpler. In this case, the working
        medium in the two heat pump circuits and the heat transfer
        medium in the heat transfer medium circuits has to be the same
        material, for example, H.sub.2 O. </p>
      <p>The system of FIG. 7 includes a sorption store 246 operating in
        turn (or alternately) as a generator and absorber, the store 246
        corresponding to that of the system of FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>The system furthermore has an absorber-generator 714,
        performing the function of the generator-absorber 614 and having
        a heating coil 754 in it, which performs the functions of the
        heating and heat exchanger coils 240, 340 and 654 of the plant
        of FIG. 6. An evaporator 794 is used in connection with the
        generator-absorber heat stores 246 and 714, it taking over the
        function of the evaporators 394 and 630 (FIG. 6). It is supplied
        from a store vessel 760, the same in function as the store vesel
        600 and store vessel 384 in FIG. 6. </p>
      <p>A condenser 718 is used together with the generator-absorber
        714, it having the same functions as the heat exchanger 604 and
        the condenser 618. The working medium condensed in it goes into
        a store vessel 760, the same in function as the store vessels
        600 and 660 and, in part, the store vessel 384. The functions of
        the heat exchanger coils 240, 340 and 754 are taken care of by
        the single heat exchanger coil 754. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, use is made of a heat exchanger 792 having the
        same functions as the heat exchangers 392 and 304. </p>
      <p>These parts of the system noted are joined by pipes which have
        valves 701 to 713 and 717 in them. These valves are placed in
        circuit as given in FIG. 7. A table will now be given of the
        control of these valves in the different phases of operation of
        the plant of FIG. 7 (in which "o" has the sense of "open", and
        "-" has the sense of "shut"). </p>

      <p>The valves 715 and 716 are drain valves used for cleaning the
        store vessels 760 and 784. The taking of medium from the store
        vessel 760 for sorption not only in the generator-absorber 714,
        but furthermore in the sorption store 246, makes for a better
        efficiency in evaporator 794, because the average temperature
        level in vessel 760 is lower than in vessel 784. </p>
      <p>In the case of the systems of FIGS. 6 and 7, it is possible to
        make use of a two-part heat store 246, as noted in connection
        with FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>Heat pumps as noted, using zeolite as an absorption material,
        are responsible for very useful effects, more specially when
        operated quasi-continuously with a double store as in FIG. 4,
        both alone or with a heat pump 210 coupled with the output, for
        making use of the waste heat of an internal combustion engine.
        In this respect, the heat of the exhaust gases is used for
        generation or expulsion and the cooling water or cooling air
        heat (cooling fluid heat) is used for heating the evaporator
        (for example evaporator 394 in FIG. 3). Useful heat is produced,
        whose temperature is greater than that of the cooling fluid, so
        that the full waste or output heat of the engine is available at
        a higher temperature level. This heat may be used directly for
        heating purposes or, by way of an absorption heat pump (for
        example 210 in FIG. 2), for heating and/or cooling, more
        specially, if the engine, for its part, is driving a compressor
        heat pump. </p>
      <p>The wording "storing with a temperature high enough for
        generation" is to have the general sense that the stored heat
        energy will be on hand or available at a high enough temperature
        on being taken from the heat store. </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger elements supplying or removing heat to or
        from the various parts of the systems disclosed have been termed
        tube coils for the sake of simplicity. It is to be understood,
        however, that these elements may take other forms in a practical
        system, as the form of plate heat exchanger elements, finned
        tube sections and the like as well known in the art.</p>
