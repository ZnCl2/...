        <p><b><font size="+1">Adsorbent Bed Coating on Metals and
              Processing for Making the Same</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>17 December 1996</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Adsorbent bed coating for use on a metallic surface includes a
        powder-like solid adsorbent bed with a grain diameter between 1
        and 50 .mu.m bonded by a finely dispersed binder agent with a
        mass component of less than 50% with respect to the powder
        component. The thickness of the adsorbent bed coating on the
        metallic surface is less than 4 mm such that the adsorption
        speed of water vapor at a steam pressure of less than 20 mbar
        results in a weight increase of at least 5% (with respect to the
        adsorbent bed) within 30 minutes. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to adsorbent coatings, and more
        particularly to adsorbent coatings that are applied to metallic
        surfaces and a process for applying the same. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Adsorbent beds are substances whose surface or capillary hollow
        space structure can adsorb a lighter volatile operating medium.
        Thus the adsorbent beds are typically well suited for heat
        transformation. European Patent Nos. EP 0 151 237 and EP 0 205
        167 disclose typical embodiments of adsorbent beds. These
        adsorbent beds generally adsorb a vaporous operating medium
        stored in an evaporator by releasing the heat carried by the
        operating medium. As is known, the continued vaporization of
        operating medium generates cold in the evaporator. As a result,
        operating medium vapor will continue to be removed from the
        evaporator at lower temperatures. In order to expel the
        operating medium from adsorbent bed, heat is provided to the
        adsorbent bed which serves to again convert the operating medium
        to a vapor which is then reliquified in a condenser. In order to
        achieve rapid adsorption and expulsion of the operating medium
        by the adsorbent bed, the adsorbent bed should have a good heat
        conductivity in the adsorbent bed and a good heat transfer to
        heat exchanger faces. </p>
      <p>European Patent No. EP 0 151 786 discloses an adsorption bed
        blank with a high heat conductivity and a method for making the
        same. The patent discloses admixing a powder-like adsorption
        medium (zeolite) with a binder agent and water. The mixture,
        which is in a semi-liquid state, is poured into receptacles,
        specifically heat exchangers. After the mixture is dried and
        gelled, the zeolite adsorption medium is prepared to adsorb
        operating medium. The zeolite mixture is not applied to
        strategically mounted flow conduits so as to ensure that an
        inflow of vapor is not substantially disrupted. One disadvantage
        of this configuration is that during frequent and rapid
        temperature changes, the zeolite blank will separate from the
        heat exchanger surface. Therefore, a rapid heat exchange between
        the heat exchanger and the zeolite is no longer assured. </p>
      <p>A further disadvantage of the above-identified adsorption bed
        blanks is that structures which contain zeolite generally
        conduct heat relatively poorly. Despite having good heat
        exchanger geometries, the time period required for the
        adsorption and expulsion of operating medium vapor is in the
        range of from a few minutes to hours. These adsorption blank
        structures are unsuitable in devices that have strict weight
        limits such as those that are intended to be mobile. </p>
      <p>Commercial zeolites are available as either a powder or
        granulate, in spherical or cylinder form. Zeolite powder is
        incapable of being used in the aforementioned adsorption system
        because the inflow and outflow of operating medium vapor will
        remove the zeolite powder from the adsorption system. Granulate
        zeolite may be utilized in the above-described system but, the
        device still has the aforementioned disadvantages of poor heat
        conductivity and poor heat contacting. Both natural and
        synthetic zeolites adsorb a certain amount of operating medium
        vapor and thereafter again emit the operating medium when heat
        is applied. The absorbability of zeolites may differ by more
        than 25% by weight depending upon the type of zeolite. However,
        for most zeolites, the desorption temperatures for complete
        expulsion of operating medium must be between 200.degree. and
        300.degree. C. But, when the zeolite adsorbs operating medium
        vapor, the temperature of the adsorption bed blank should
        preferably be below 100.degree. C. This provides very high
        temperature differences between the operating medium vapor and
        the adsorption bed blank which can only be realized with large
        heat exchanger faces having thin zeolite layers. </p>
      <p>Since the desorption temperatures of zeolite are typically
        above 200.degree. C., the employment of metallic heat exchangers
        is advantageous. However, due to the differences in heat
        expansion coefficients between the adsorbent bed coating and the
        metallic heat exchangers, the adsorbent bed coating typically
        separates from the heat exchanger. When cracks develop between
        the adsorbent bed coating and the heat exchanger faces, heat
        transfer between the adsorbent bed coating and heat exchanger is
        severely limited. This results in longer cycle times and
        requires larger amounts of adsorbent bed coatings for the given
        intended application. In addition to a good contact between the
        adsorbent bed coating and the metallic heat exchanger, a
        sufficient input of operating medium vapor must be assured for
        proper operation. However, an adsorbent bed coating that
        maintains relatively good heat contact with metallic surfaces
        such that a sufficient input of operating medium vapor is
        assured and the adsorbability of the adsorbent bed is
        uninterrupted is not previously known. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
        structure which enables a very good adherence of an adsorbent
        bed coating to a heat exchanger during very rapid temperature
        increases and decreases. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorbent bed coating that has relatively good heat transfer
        characteristics with a metallic surface of a heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        method of applying an adsorbent bed material to a heat exchanger
        so that the adsorbent bed material adheres to the heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorbent bed material that has relatively good adsorbability
        while contacting a heat exchanger surface. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
        adsorbent bed material and method of adhering the same to the
        surface of a heat exchange which overcomes the inherent
        disadvantages of known adsorbent bed materials. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, the
        adsorbent bed coating for use on a metallic surface includes a
        solid adsorbent material having a grain diameter of between 1
        and 50 .mu.m and a finely dispersed dehardened binder agent.
        Preferably, the binder agent is less than 50% of the solid
        adsorbent material. In addition, the solid adsorbent material is
        preferably a zeolite and the finely dispersed dehardened binder
        agent is preferably a high temperature adhesive. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another form of the present invention a heat
        exchanger including a flow conduit and means for transferring
        heat energy to and from the flow conduit includes an adsorbent
        bed coating on the means for transferring heat energy.
        Preferably, the adsorbent bed coating has a thickness that is at
        most 4mm wherein the adsorption speed for water vapor at a steam
        pressure of less than 20 mbar provides a 5% weight increase in
        the adsorbent bed coating within 30 minutes. In one form of the
        present invention, the heat exchanger is a lamella heat
        exchanger and the means for transferring heat energy is a metal.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with another form of the present invention, a
        method for providing an adsorbent bed coating on a heat
        exchanger includes applying an emulsion including a binder
        agent, water and an adsorbent bed material to an oil and dust
        free metal surface of the heat exchanger. Preferably, the
        flowable emulsion has a thickness of no more than 1 mm. The
        method also includes wetting the heat exchanger including the
        flowable emulsion and drying the heat exchanger in open air.
        Thereafter, the heat exchanger and adsorbent bed coating is
        dried at air temperatures over 150.degree. C. The method of the
        present invention may also include applying a second adsorbent
        coating layer to the first layer. Thereafter, the second coating
        layer is dried and hardened at air temperatures above
        150.degree. C. </p>
      <p>A preferred form of the adsorbent bed material as well as other
        embodiments, objects, features and advantages of this invention,
        will be apparent from the following detailed description of
        illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in
        connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> is a cross-section of a pipe-lamella heat
        exchanger having an adsorbent bed material of the present
        invention coated thereon. </p>

        <p><img src="5585-1.jpg" height="350" width="346"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional
        view of a pipe-lamella-heat exchanger with pipes 1 and 2 having
        lamellas 3 mounted thereon. In a preferred embodiment of the
        invention the lamellas are made of aluminum. Pipes 1, 2 and
        lamellas 3 are preferably coated with a zeolite layer 4 in
        accordance with the invention. Flow conduits 5 are located
        between the coated lamellas 3 for the unobstructed access of
        operating medium vapor. The coated pipe-lamella-heat exchanger
        is built into a housing 6, whose exterior wall 7 is supported by
        a front face of the lamella 3. In a preferred embodiment of the
        invention, the lamellas 3 have a fiber fleece 8 bonded thereto
        before the lamellas are coated with the zeolite layer 4. </p>
      <p>In operation, a relatively hot medium flows through pipe 1
        effectively transferring heat through the lamellas 3 to the
        zeolite layer 4. When the zeolite layer is heated, operating
        medium vapor is expelled from the zeolite layer. The expelled
        operating medium thereafter is provided through the flow
        conduits 5 to a vapor collector (not shown). Additionally, a
        relatively cold medium may simultaneously flow through pipe 2
        and effectively absorb heat through lamellas 3 to cool the
        zeolite layer 4 and lower the vapor pressure of the operating
        medium vapor. As a result, operating medium vapor flows in from
        an operating medium vapor source (not shown) for adsorption by
        the zeolite layer 4. </p>
      <p>The requirement of good adherence to the heat exchanger, good
        heat transfer characteristics and good adsorbability of
        operating medium are present in the adsorbent bed coating of the
        present invention. Specifically, sufficient mechanical and
        thermal stability is obtained by adsorbent material, such as
        zeolite powder, with a grain size of between 1 and 50 .mu.m. The
        zeolite powder is preferably admixed with a ceramic binder agent
        that is less than 50% by weight of the adsorption bed coating.
        In addition, the thickness of the adsorption bed coating or the
        heat exchangers is preferably less than 5 mm. The limitation of
        the thickness of the adsorption bed coating does not limit the
        adsorbability of the operating medium. In fact, the maximum
        adsorbability of operating medium occurs within a few minutes of
        the time of application of the adsorbent bed coating to the heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p>When zeolite is employed as the adsorbent material, the
        adsorption bed coating is stable at temperatures between
        -30.degree. C. and 300.degree. C. High temperature adhesives
        that are utilized for adhering ceramic and glass products on
        metals are particularly suitable for use as binder agents in the
        present invention. The use of high temperature adhesives permits
        the adhesive bed coating to be utilized even under relatively
        high thermal stresses. </p>
      <p>It has,been determined that an adsorption bed coating thickness
        of less than 5 mm on the heat exchanger is preferable to thicker
        layers. This is because thicknesses of greater than 5 mm cause
        an increase in the diffusion resistance of the operating medium
        vapors. In addition, an adsorption bed coating thickness of more
        than 5 mm decreases the conductivity of thermal energy. This
        neutralizes the positive effects provided by the increased
        contact with the heat exchanger provided by the adsorption bed
        coating of the invention. </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger lamellas utilized in the present invention
        are preferably made of a metallic material whose surface is
        roughened and which has been cleaned so as to be both oil and
        dust free. After the cleaning and roughening, the coating may be
        applied to the lamellas. The lamellas can be made from any metal
        that has a relatively good heat conductibility. Among the
        suitable materials for use in fabricating the lamellas are
        aluminum and copper. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, particularly good
        results may be obtained with lamella heat exchangers wherein the
        separation between lamellas is less than 2 mm. The heat
        exchanger may be coated with one or a plurality of adsorbent bed
        coating layers via a dipping process. The thickness of all of
        the layers is selected in such a manner that substantially
        sufficient free space is provided between the coated lamellas
        for the inflow and outflow of the operating medium vapor. In
        view of the thin adsorbent bed layers on the lamellas, very
        rapid cycle times may be obtained, which in practice, may be
        less than 2 minutes. </p>
      <p>In addition, satisfactory results have been obtained when thin
        metal foils have been coated with the adsorbent bed coating.
        Thin foils are formed as a result of a dipping process wherein a
        complete closed receptacle is made from two semicups. A zeolite
        layer is mounted on a first part of the receptacle, while in a
        second part of the receptacle, space is provided for the
        condensation and evaporation of operating medium. The
        receptacles also called spokes, are described in European patent
        EP 0 151 237, the description of which is incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is
        advantageous to apply an intermediate layer of fiberglass fleece
        to the metal surface of the lamellas before applying the
        adsorbent bed. As a result, durable adsorbent bed layers having
        a relatively large thickness are possible. In addition, the
        fiberglass fleece assures a stable anchoring or bonding of the
        adsorbent bed layer to the metal surface. </p>
      <p>The mechanical and thermal stability of the adsorbent bed layer
        is directly dependant upon its method of preparation (i.e., the
        method of application of the adsorption bed coating).
        Specifically, it has been found that the structure is more
        durable if thin layers are applied. However, if thick layers are
        required, the application of many thinner layers is preferred to
        provide a more durable structure. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the invention, an adsorbent bed
        coating (i.e., flowable emulsion) is prepared by adding an
        adhesive and water to zeolite powder (i.e., powder-like
        adsorbent bed). The coating is then applied to the lamella
        (i.e., metal surface) of the heat exchanger in a variety of
        ways. In particular, dipping, painting and spray methods are
        suitable application methods. </p>
      <p>The thickness of the layer of adsorbent bed coating layers
        depend upon the consistency of the emulsion prior to application
        and the method of application (i.e., dipping, painting, or
        spraying). Preferably, the emulsion is dried after it is applied
        to the heat exchanger. In a preferred embodiment of the
        invention, each emulsion layer is dried and hardened at
        temperatures over 150.degree. C. in order to obtain a durable
        adsorbent bed coating structure. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, a plurality of layers
        may be successively applied to the heat exchanger. However, it
        is preferred that each preceding layer be permitted to dry for
        as long as it takes for the emulsion to harden and for its
        surface to dull. In a preferred embodiment, only then should a
        subsequent adsorbent bed coating be applied to the previous
        layer. Preferably, for each layer, a redrying process in open
        air as well as a final,drying process including hardening in a
        furnace is conducted for each individual emulsion layer. </p>
      <p>In a preferred form of the invention, the adsorbent bed coating
        (flowable emulsion) is prepared by diluting 30 g of a
        commercially available high temperature resistant adhesive
        suitable for ceramic products (for example, Holts Gun Gum) with
        105 g water. Thereafter, 100 g of a zeolite powder with Na-A
        which was previously saturated with water vapor in open air is
        introduced into the high temperature resistant adhesive emulsion
        while stirring constantly. Since the zeolite crystals and the
        adhesive will separate if the mixture is left to stand without
        agitation, substantially constant mixing of the emulsion must be
        assured. </p>
      <p>The surfaces of the heat exchanger that are to be coated are
        preferably oil and dustfree and are thereafter dipped into the
        prepared mixture. After removal of the heat exchanger from the
        emulsion, the heat exchanger is redried in open air at room
        temperature and thereafter heated in a furnace at temperatures
        above 150.degree. C. As a result, the water adsorbed in the
        adsorbent bed coating is evaporated and the adhesive is
        permitted sufficiently harden. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, before applying a second layer of
        high temperature resistant adhesive emulsion, the first layer is
        preferably wet with water. This is preferably performed by
        dipping or spraying the heat exchanger with water. Thereafter,
        care should be taken that before application of the second layer
        of high temperature resistant adhesive, the first layer is dried
        in open air until the surface of the coating is dull. Only after
        this drying process is complete should the second layer of
        emulsion be applied to the heat exchanger. The second layer of
        emulsion should be dried in a manner similar to that of the
        drying of the first emulsion layer. A final drying and the
        hardening process which includes drying in a furnace is
        thereafter performed as previously described. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
