      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Sorption cooling system of the present invention comprises a
        transportable cooling unit and a stationary charging (i.e.
        desorption) station. The transportable cooling unit includes an
        adsorption container containing an adsorption medium, a cooling
        container containing a liquid operating medium, and a heat
        exchanger contained within the cooling container and being
        surrounded by the liquid operating medium. An operating medium
        vapor conduit connects the adsorption container and the cooling
        container, and includes a shut off device which renders the
        operating medium vapor conduit selectively closable. The
        stationary charging station is detachable from the cooling unit,
        and includes a temperature controlled heating box having an
        opening for receiving the adsorption medium container of the
        transportable cooling unit, so that a discharged adsorption
        medium container can be selectively heated to desorb the
        operating fluid therefrom to form vapor which is condensed to
        liquid form and stored in the cooling container. After desorbing
        the operating medium from the adsorption medium using the
        charging station, the shut off device is closed and the cooling
        unit is removed from the charging station and allowed to cool,
        thereby charging the cooling unit for a new use. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to sorption cooling
        apparatus, and more particularly to a periodically-operable
        sorption cooling system having a cooling container and an
        adsorption container. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In the field of the transportable beverage cooling, hitherto,
        only cooling devices which operate in accordance with the
        compression principle, have been widely used. These compressor
        cooling devices essentially consist of a hermetically sealed
        compressor, an air-cooled condenser, a collecting container for
        the liquid CFC, a temperature controlled expansion valve, and a
        condenser. However, the "cold" generated in the evaporator of
        such devices, must be intermediarily stored in a "cold buffer."
      </p>
      <p>In connection with compression cooling devices, commonly used
        "cold buffers" include either a water container with a water
        content of up to 20 liters, or are formed from a large aluminum
        block in order to provide desired cold storage. Notably, large
        aluminum block cold buffers have an advantage over the water
        container type cold buffer, in that the aluminum block type cold
        buffer does not need to be filled up with water before operating
        the compression cooling device. However, each such "cold buffer"
        has its shortcomings and drawbacks. In particular, the largest
        disadvantage of the aluminum block "cold buffer" is that the
        storage capacity is relatively small, so that during "beverage
        tapping" of more than 0.5 liter of beverage, the cooling effect
        of the cooling device is already exhausted. The water storage
        cold buffer is disadvantageous in that after filling it with
        water, the cooling device must be in use for a longer time
        period to precool the filled water storage itself. Moreover, the
        water container must be provided with an additional stirring
        means which pumps the water around the evaporator and cooling
        coils for a better heat exchange. This mechanical stirrer is
        rather susceptible to trouble and very often results in the
        breakdown of the total cooling device. </p>
      <p>Such compression cooling devices described above, are used for
        cooling of beverages, such as beer, lemonades, etc., in party
        tents or otherwise during a party. The use of such compression
        cooling devices by a private person for cooling a beverage (e.g.
        in a rented beer barrel) has hitherto only been possible in a
        limited manner. This is due to the fact that the highly complex
        nature of such compression cooling devices requires that the
        user has a lot of technical know-how for proper operation. For
        the beverage merchant, such compression cooling devices cannot
        be profitably used in view of the high purchase and maintenance
        costs of such cooling devices. </p>
      <p>In contrast to compression type cooling devices, there are a
        class of sorption devices which operate on fundamentally
        different set of thermodynamic principles. </p>
      <p>In connection therewith, sorption devices are understood to
        mean devices wherein a liquid or sold sorption medium absorbs a
        second medium at a higher temperature and in the vapor state, by
        releasing heat. Before the operating medium is absorbed by the
        sorption agent, it evaporates under heat absorption in a cooling
        container. Thus, the evaporation temperatures are in the range
        of between -40.degree. and +40.degree. C., depending on the type
        of operating medium used and the field of use of the sorption
        medium. </p>
      <p>Sorption apparatuses with solid adsorption mediums, referred to
        as "adsorption" apparatuses, operate periodically, that is, an
        adsorption phase is always followed by a desorption phase,
        wherein the operating medium (e.g. water) is again separated or
        driven off from the adsorption medium, e.g. zeolite. During the
        desorption phase, the operating medium cannot be absorbed and
        can therefore also not be evaporated. Hence, during the
        desorption phase, no cooling effect is generated (i.e. no
        absorption of heat is achieved) in the cooling container. </p>
      <p>An example of a periodically operating adsorption cooling
        apparatus is disclosed in German Patent Application DE-OS 34 25
        419. In such apparatus, an ice bank is generated in the cooling
        container during the adsorption phase by a partial evaporation
        of the water operating medium. As disclosed, the adsorption
        cooling apparatus includes an adsorption container which is
        filled with the adsorption medium, zeolite; a cooling container
        which contains the operating medium, water; and a shut off
        device, with the assistance of which, a steam or vapor conduit
        is closable between the adsorption container and the cooling
        container. Cold can be discharged over the surfaces of the
        cooling container for cooling, for example, a cooling bag, while
        heat can be discharged over the container walls of the
        adsorption container. During the desorption phase, the operating
        medium is desorbed from the adsorption medium by supplying
        desorption heat into the adsorption container and is
        subsequently condensed in the cooling container by releasing
        heat. After completion of this desorption process, the shut off
        device is closed and the adsorption container is allowed to
        cool. In this condition, the adsorption apparatus can be stored
        for any given length of time, for future use. </p>
      <p>However, using prior art periodically-operating adsorption
        apparatus, hitherto it has been not possible to cool large
        amounts of liquid (e.g. beverage) down to temperatures between
        +4.degree. and +10.degree. C. independent of any given initial
        temperature thereof. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to
        provide a sorption cooling system which is characterized by a
        simple and cost effective type of structure, which is capable of
        cooling with a very low control effort, large amounts of liquid
        down to temperatures between +4.degree. and +10.degree. C.
        starting from any given initial temperature. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        sorption cooler which employs a single charging station, which
        can be used to recharge discharged tranportable cooling units,
        each of which is detachable from the charging station after
        being recharged by desorption. </p>
      <p>These and other objects of the present invention will become
        apparent hereinafter and in the claims. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>According to one of the broader aspects of the present
        invention, there is provided a periodically-operable sorption
        cooling system comprising a transportable cooling unit and a
        separate stationary charging station which is selectively
        detachable from the cooling unit. In general, a large number of
        the cooling units can be charged (i.e. desorbed) using a single
        charging station. </p>
      <p>In order that the cooling units are easily transportable, they
        have each been formed merely from the technically required parts
        to perform the adsorption phase of a periodically-operable
        sorption cooling process. Thus, each working unit comprises: an
        adsorption container filled with an adsorption medium; a cooling
        container containing the liquid operating medium and a heat
        exchanger installed therein; an operating medium vapor conduit
        connecting the adsorption container with the cooling container;
        and a shut off means which renders the vapor conduit selectively
        closable. </p>
      <p>When the transportable cooling unit is in the "charged"
        condition, the operating medium is separated from (i.e. desorbed
        or driven off) the adsorption medium and is in the form of a
        liquid contained in the cooling container. Also, the shut off
        means is closed and the adsorption and operating medium
        preferably are at an ambient temperature. In this charged
        condition, the cooling unit may then be lent to the customer,
        for example, together with a barrel of beer. In order to cool
        the barrel of beer with the cooling unit, the customer simply
        connects the beverage lines of the beer cooler to the heat
        exchanger of the cooling unit, and then opens the shut off
        means. Upon opening the shut off means, the operating medium can
        evaporate in the cooling container, flow through the operating
        medium vapor conduit to the adsorption medium, and can be
        adsorbed by the same releasing heat of adsorption. Notably, the
        adsorption heat is passed over and/or through the walls of the
        adsorption container and discharged to the ambient air, for
        example. As a result of the evaporation of a portion of the
        operating medium within the cooling container, the temperature
        of the operating medium remaining within the cooling container
        is lowered and a portion thereof freezes, and as a result, a
        beverage flowing through the heat exchanger is cooled. Also, by
        selectively controlling the opening and closing of the shut off
        means, in response to sensed temperatures, the discharge
        temperature of the beverage can be controlled in a desired
        manner. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, instead of air cooling of the adsorption
        container, water cooling thereof may be provided. In such a
        case, the adsorption container will be advantageously coupled
        with a water container, whose water content can absorb the
        adsorption heat released during the adsorption phase of
        operation. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>For purposes of illustration, in the preferred embodiment, the
        operating medium 15 is water and the adsorption medium 25 is a
        zeolite. However, within the principles of the present
        invention, it is believed that other adsorption pairs are
        expected to work with acceptable results. </p>
      <p>The transportable cooling unit 30 illustrated in FIG. 1
        includes an adsorption container assembly 20 having six flat
        adsorption containers 1, each containing a predetermined amount
        of zeolite 25. The adsorption containers 1 are connected with
        each other in vapor communication by an operating medium vapor
        conduit 2. The transportable cooling unit 20, in turn, is also
        connected with the cooling container 3 by the vapor conduit 2.
        Notably, the vapor conduit 2 is closable by a shut off means 4
        as shown in greater detail in FIG. 3. </p>
      <p>Extending from the lower part of the cooling container 3 are
        the feeding and discharge ports 5 and 6, respectively. In the
        preferred embodiment, these ports are part of a beverage heat
        exchanger 14 which is illustrated in FIG. 3, but not in FIG. 1.
        On the outer wall of the cooling container 3, cooling ribs 7 are
        provided which enlarge the heat exchange surface area of the
        cooling container 3 so as to improve the transfer of the latent
        heat released to the ambient air during the condensation of
        desorbed vapor into liquid during the desorption phase. Notably,
        the outer wall and the cooling ribs 7 of cooling container
        function as a condenser, as will be discussed in great detail
        hereinafter. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 2, the stationary charging station 40 is shown from a
        perspective view. The charging station 40 comprises a
        temperature-controllable heating box 8 provided with an opening
        9, wherein the adsorption container assembly 20 of the cooling
        unit is designed to insert therewithin. The
        temperature-controlled heating box 8 includes conventionally
        known heating means 26 such as an electrical heater and
        temperature control means in order to render the heating box 8
        temperature controllable over the operating range of
        temperatures during the desorption (i.e. charging) phase of
        operation. A recess 10 for the vapor conduit 2 is provided at a
        corresponding location in the heating box 8, to permit lid 11 of
        the heating box to close shut after inserting the adsorption
        container assembly 20 therewithin during the desorption (i.e.
        charging) phase of cooler system operation. In this condition,
        the cooling container 3 is mounted over two cooling ventilators
        12 and 13, which force ambient air over the cooling ribs 7
        and/or heat exchanging wall surfaces of the cooling container.
        Notably, the cooling ribs 7 also function as a condensor for
        condensing desorbed water vapor during the desorption (i.e.
        charging) phase. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3, a cross-sectional view of the cooling container 3 is
        illustrated. In the lower part of the cooling container 3 and
        about the "beverage" heat exchanger 14, a reservoir is provided
        containing an amount of water 15. An inflow and outflow is
        provided for the heat exchanger 14 by feeding and discharge
        ports 5 and 6, respectively. Above the quantity of water 15,
        there is an ice layer 16 which forms during the adsorption phase
        as described hereinbefore. A drip separator 17 is provided above
        the ice layer 16 so as to partially separate the cooling
        container 3 and the heat exchanging surfaces thereof with the
        ambient environment, to form a condenser means in that portion
        of the cooling container during the charging phase. </p>
      <p>In the upper portion of the cooling container 3, the discharge
        end of the vapor conduit 2 (illustrated in a broken away view)
        discharges desorbed vapor into the cooling container 3. This
        discharged vapor is allowed to condense around the drip
        separator 17 and drip into the cooling container 3 during the
        desorption phase. In the preferred embodiment, the shut off
        means 4 comprises a metallic bellow 18 and a flat packing 19
        which, in the closed position, is mounted on the discharge end
        of the vapor conduit 2. On the outside of the cooling container
        3, cooling ribs 7 are mounted for enlarging the heat exchanging
        surface of the cooling container, as required during the
        desorption (i.e. charging) phase. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the use of the adsorption medium pair of
        zeolite/water is particularly advantageous in carrying out the
        present invention. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral consisting
        of a periodic three-dimensional crystalline structure consisting
        of silicon- and aluminum oxides. This crystalline structure
        contains small hollow (i.e. open) spaces or cavities wherein
        water molecules can be adsorbed by releasing heat of adsorption.
        Within the crystalline structure, the water molecules are
        subjected to strong field forces which liquify the molecules in
        the crystalline lattice and bind them in a liquified similar
        phase. The strength of the binding forces which act on the water
        molecules is dependent on the amount of water molecules already
        contained in the crystalline structure and the temperature of
        the adsorbing medium (e g. zeolite). In practical applications,
        up to 25 grams of water can be adsorbed per 100 grams of
        zeolite. Zeolites have several other properties which make them
        preferred in the present invention. In particular, zeolites are
        solid substances which do not present any interfering heat
        expansion during the adsorption or desorption reaction. Also,
        the crystalline structure of zeolite is freely accessible from
        all sides, for the water vapor molecules to bind thereto during
        the adsorption phase. Consequentially, the cooling unit of the
        present invention is operable in every possible position and
        orientation. </p>
      <p>The use of water as the operating medium, on the other hand,
        permits the required control effort to be reduced to a minimum.
        During or evaporation of water under vacuum (i.e. low vapor
        pressure) conditions in the cooling container 3, the water
        surface cools to 0.degree. C. and freezes to ice 16 due to the
        continuous evaporation process which occurs during the
        adsorption phase. This layer of ice grows within a short time in
        the cooling container 3 until the generated vapor pressure drop
        above the ice layer stops the growth. </p>
      <p>In the apparatus of the present invention, this ice layer can
        advantageously be used for controlling the beverage discharge
        temperature. During low beverage tapping conditions, the ice
        layer grows, and under very large beverage tapping conditions,
        the ice layer melts. The temperature of the water under the ice
        layer is +4.degree., since water has its highest density at this
        temperature. Since the cooling container is so designed that the
        (beverage) heat exchanger 14 therein is always below the ice
        layer, the tapped beverage from port 6 has a discharge
        temperature of +4.degree. to +9.degree. C., independent from the
        temperature of the beverage entering the heat exchanger from
        port 5. Thus, by using this anomalous effect of water, the
        control unit typically required for the shut off means of
        conventional adsorption cooling systems, can be deleted
        altogether in the sorption cooling system of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>The cooling capacity of the cooling unit at the time of
        beverage tapping, is determined by the amount of the desorbed
        zeolite in the adsorption container as well as the zeolite
        temperature attained prior to the time of beverage tapping.
        Hence, the amount of zeolite can be designed so that one cooling
        unit has a cooling capacity sufficient for cooling a complete
        beverage container (e.g. barrel of beer, lemonade container,
        etc.). </p>
      <p>After returning the discharged cooling unit to the vendor, the
        discharged cooling unit 30 together with the adsorption
        container assembly 20 is placed into the opening 9 of the
        heating box 8 of the changing station 40, and lid 11 is closed,
        with the cooling container 3 being positioned outside the
        heating box 8, above the cooling ventilators 12 and 13. In this
        configuration, "recharging" (i.e. desorption) of the discharged
        cooling unit 30 is achieved. </p>
      <p>During this recharging process with the discharged cooling unit
        30 attached to the charging station 40 as described above, the
        adsorption medium (e.g. zeolite) 25 is heated and the operating
        medium (e.g. water) 15 is evaporated or desorbed from the
        adsorption medium 25 and forms vapor or steam. The desorbed
        vapor passes through the "opened" vapor conduit 2, into the
        cooling container 23 where it is reliquified or condensed by use
        of a suitable heat exchanger e.g. cooling fins 7. Thereafter,
        the condensed operating liquid 15 is allowed to drip into the
        cooling container 3. Typically, the temperature of the heating
        box 8 is between 250.degree. and 350.degree. C. at the end of
        the charging (i.e. desorption) phase. As soon as the adsorption
        medium is heated and the operating medium is desorbed therefrom,
        the shut-off means 4 is closed, and the entire cooling unit 30
        is separated from the charging station 40. With the shut-off
        means 4 closed, the adsorption container assembly 20 is allowed
        to cool off to ambient temperature, but cannot suction off vapor
        from the cooling container 3. Until the next use, the "charged"
        cooling unit 30 can be stored at room temperature. </p>
      <p>A high vacuum tightness is required by the shut-off 4 device,
        particularly when using the zeolite/water sorption substance
        pair. Furthermore, the shut-off device 4 should be so designed
        that it opens automatically and permits the operating medium
        vapor to flow into the cooling container 3, as soon as the vapor
        pressure in the adsorption container assembly 20 is higher than
        the vapor pressure in the cooling container 3. In this manner,
        it is assured that no excess pressure is generated in the
        adsorption container assembly 20 during the desorption (i.e.
        charging) phase, that is, should the shut-off device 4 be
        accidentally closed. Moreover, the cooling unit 30 may be
        additionally provided with an excess pressure relief/safety
        means in either or both of the adsorption container assembly 20
        and the cooling container 3. As illustrated in FIG. 3, the
        excess pressure relief/safety means 21 is provided to the
        cooling container 3 through one of the container walls thereof.
        Preferably, the position of the excess pressure relief/safety
        means 21 is above the layer 16 of ice formation. </p>
      <p>During the desorption phase, when using operating medium with
        boiling temperature points beyond the ambient temperature, it is
        advantageous to provide a suctioning-off device 22 through which
        air or foreign gas can be suctioned off from the cooling
        container 3 with the assistance of vacuum equipment 23 mounted,
        for example, upon heating box 8 as illustrated in FIG. 2.
        Advantageously, this evacuation equipment 22 and 23 may be
        combined with the excess pressure relief/safety means 21. </p>
      <p>In the present invention, the adsorption container assembly 20
        is advantageously designed so that externally supplied
        "desorption heat" can be fed between and over its adsorption
        container walls so that the adsorption heat can be discharged to
        the ambient environment during the adsorption phase.
        Particularly suitable for the adsorption containers 1 are flat
        containers which are connected with each other by way of the
        (vapor) conduit 2 as shown in FIG. 1 and described hereinbefore.
        The adsorption medium 25 in each container advantageously
        contains vapor conduits, through which the vapor operating
        medium passes in order that the operating medium eventually
        becomes evenly distributed within each adsorption container. </p>
      <p>Having described one embodiment of the present invention,
        several modifications thereto come to mind. In particular, it is
        also possible to forego altogether the heat exchange condensor
        formed in the cooling container using cooling fins 7 and heat
        exchanging wall surfaces of the cooling container 3. As an
        alternative, the beverage heat exchanger 14 presented within the
        cooling container, can be used during the desorption phase, to
        condense the desorbed vapor from the zeolite, into liquid. This
        is achieved by permitting the heat exchanger 14 to extend out
        and away from the liquid operating medium during the desorption
        phase, in order to function as a condensor. In the preferred
        embodiment, this feature is achieved by permitting the heat
        exchanging coil 14 to rotate out of the liquid operating medium
        during the desorption phase, and to extend above the liquid
        operation medium. Thus, the heat exchanger 14 so adapted, can
        function to condense the desorbed vapor during desorption phase,
        as follows. The adsorption container 20 is inserted into the
        heating box 8 and the complete system 30 is rotated (with
        respect to gravity) to such an extent that the beverage heat
        exchanger 14 extends at least partially out from the liquid
        operating medium 15. In this configuration, cooling tap water
        may be passed through the beverage heat exchanger 14 during the
        charging phase, so as to assist in condensing the desorbed vapor
        driven off of the adsorption medium. With this system
        configuration, the need for forced air cooling outside the
        charging station 40 is eliminated. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the sorption cooler of the present invention
        are manifest. Since the charging station typically remains with
        the given beverage distributor, it constitutes a single expense.
        All expensive and heavy components like the electrical heater,
        temperature control devices, heating box insulation, and
        additional components like evacuation unit, cooling vent, etc.
        can be mounted on the charging station. In this manner, then,
        the transportable cooling unit is light and cost effective. It
        does not require its own energy connection at the customer
        level. The cooling capacity of the charged cooling unit is
        immediately available to the customer. Moreover, the cooling
        unit of the present invention is characterized by an
        exceptionally high cooling reserve, so that a more lengthy
        beverage tapping operation is now possible using a single
        "charged" cooling unit of the present invention. After depleting
        the cooling capacity of the cooling unit, the cooling unit
        becomes essentially worthless for the customer without having a
        separate charging station. Hence, the customer willingly returns
        the "discharged" cooling unit to the distributor after receiving
        his initially paid deposit on the cooling unit. </p>
      <p>While the particular embodiment shown and described above has
        proven to be useful in many applications involving the periodic
        adsorption cooling art, further modification herein disclosed
        will occur to persons skilled in the art to which the present
        invention pertains and also such modifications are deemed to be
        within the scope and spirit of the present invention defined by
        the dependent claims. </p>
