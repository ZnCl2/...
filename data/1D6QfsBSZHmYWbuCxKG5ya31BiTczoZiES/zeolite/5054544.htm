      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a sorption container for solid
        sorption medium, such as particular zeolites, for example. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>A wide variety of periodically-operating sorption apparatus are
        known, and in general, are characterized by having an adsorption
        phase and desorption phase of operation. In connection with such
        apparatus in particular, but by no means limited thereto,
        "sorption medium" is generally understood to mean substances
        which absorb during the adsorption phase, a more volatile
        operating medium such as water, for example. </p>
      <p>During the adsorption phase of operation of
        periodically-operating sorption apparatus, adsorption heat is
        released from the sorption medium, whereas during the desorption
        phase, desorption heat is supplied to the sorption medium in
        order to drive off or evaporate the operating medium. Zeolite,
        for example, is a known sorption medium which together with
        water as the operating medium, forms a pair of sorption
        substances which can be used in numerous applications in the
        heating and cooling arts. Zeolites are crystalline
        alumino-silicons which are characterized by microscopically
        small hollow spaces wherein water molecules can be stored during
        the adsorption phase, upon releasing heat of adsorption and, as
        a result of their sorption characteristics, offer many
        advantages over other known "sorption mediums". </p>
      <p>German Patent Application DE-OS 35 21 484.4 discloses a
        particular device which uses the sorption characteristics of
        zeolites in order to generate heat and cooling power. Devices of
        this type always require a sorption container which is filled
        with the sorption medium. The provision and release of the heat
        of reaction is achieved through suitable heat exchange surfaces
        provided to the sorption container. The vapor or steam operating
        medium which is desorbed from the sorption medium (e.g. zeolite)
        during the desorption phase, is discharged from the sorption
        container through suitable vapor flow conduits. This discharged
        vapor flows into a condensor where the vapor condenses into
        condensate, which eventually is collected in a collection
        container. During the adsorption phase, water (i.e. condensate)
        collected in the collection container, evaporates, and the cool
        vapor flows back into the sorption container, where it is again
        absorbed by the sorption medium, whereupon heat of adsorption is
        liberated and discharged from the sorption container. </p>
      <p>A plurality of requirements must be simultaneously met for a
        sorption container having solid sorption medium. On the one
        hand, the sorption container should have ideal heat exchange
        characteristics for feeding and discharging the "heat of
        reaction" during the desorption and adsorption phases,
        respectively. On the other hand, the sorption container must
        securely contain and seal off the sorption medium from the outer
        atmosphere, and simultaneously have optimum flow characteristics
        for discharging and feeding the operating medium vapor to the
        sorption medium during the desorption and adsorption phase of
        operation, respectively. Moreover, the sorption container should
        be made cost effective and must be designated specifically for
        transportable equipment. </p>
      <p>However, prior art sorption containers are generally expensive
        to manufacture, are heavy, poorly seal off the sorption medium
        from the outer atmosphere, and have poor heat exchange
        capabilities with respect to the sorption medium. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is a primary object of the subject invention to
        provide an effective sorption container for a solid sorption
        medium, which can be made in a cost effective manner, which is
        characterized by a weight saving and vacuum-proof type of
        construction, and which permits a good heat transfer to and from
        the sorption medium. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF PRESENT INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>According to one of the broader aspects of the present
        invention, there is provided an adsorption container for
        containing solid adsorption medium capable of adsorbing an
        operating medium. In general, the adsorption container comprises
        a flexible metal corrugated hose having an inner space, a
        plurality of waves formed therealong, and an adsorption medium
        filler disposed inside the metal corrugated hose and filling the
        waves. In one embodiment, the metal corrugated hose is an
        annular wave hose, whereas in the second embodiment, the metal
        corrugated hose is a helical wave hose. </p>
      <p>Preferably, a flow conduit is formed through the solid
        adsorption medium inside the hose along the axial direction
        thereof, to allow vapor operating medium to flow through the
        adsorption medium filler. In the preferred embodiment, a metal
        fabric texture is provided to the waves so that the adsorption
        medium is embedded within the metal fabric texture. In order to
        desorb the operating medium from the adsorption medium, a
        heating device can be disposed in the inner space of the metal
        corrugated hose. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, the metal corrugated hose has an area which
        is free of adsorption medium, and this adsorption medium free
        area has sufficient heat exchanging surfaces for condensing
        and/or evaporating the operating medium. In this adsorption
        medium free area, there is provided a shut-off means, which is
        operated (i.e. actuatable) by, for example, deforming the metal
        corrugated hose in either the axial or lateral direction.
        Extending from this length of metal corrugated hose, a smooth
        piece of pipe (from which the waves are typically formed) is
        provided. Preferably, this pipe has a heat exchanging means such
        as heat exchanging fins, for providing improved transmission of
        heat between the operating medium inside the metal corrugated
        hose and the heat carrier medium flowing over the heat
        exchanging means. In such an arrangement, operating medium vapor
        is desorbed from the adsorption medium filler upon application
        of heat thereto and passes through the opened shut-off means.
        Thereafter, this vapor condenses in the smooth part of the pipe
        devoid of adsorption medium, upon removal of heat from the
        vapor, through the heat exchanging means. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the adsorption container of the present
        invention comprises a plurality of metal corrugated hoses
        combined into a hose bundle. </p>

        invention, reference is made to the following detailed

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, there are shown two different types
        of metal corrugated hoses 1 and 1' which are used in
        constructing the sorption container of the present invention. In
        both types of hoses 1 and 1', the swivel-like waves 2 are formed
        into the tubular surface 3 and 3' respectively of the metal
        hoses, and are shaped so that the inner area of the waves are
        adapted for the reception of the sorption medium e.g., zeolite.
        Notably, in both types of hoses, the inner area of the waves is
        preferably larger in its volume than the outer area over which a
        heat carrier medium, generally air (not shown), is fed to the
        sorption container for the transmission of heat, typically
        during both the desorption and absorption phases. </p>
      <p>In the helical wave hose illustrated in FIG. 1, there are
        continuously connected, right-handed helical waves 3 having a
        constant pitch throughout the total length of the hose. In
        contrast thereto, in the annular wave hose shown in FIG. 2,
        there is a plurality of closed waves 3' each having the same
        distance with respect to each other, whose main plane is
        vertical with respect to the hose axis. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown a cross-sectional
        longitudinal view of one embodiment of the sorption container of
        the present invention. The sorption container comprises metal
        corrugated hoses 1A and 1B, each containing zeolite fillers 4
        filling up the waves 2. As shown in FIG. 3, an axially-located
        flow conduit 5 is formed in the fillers 4 so that the operating
        medium vapor may flow therealong and access the sorption medium
        4 without occasioning a vapor pressure drop. In the upper
        corrugated hose 1A, the zeolite filler 4 is additionally
        provided with a fine meshed metal fabric 6 into which zeolite is
        imbedded. This metallic fabric 6 within the zeolite filler
        material 4 serves to increase the stability thereof, and
        simultaneously improves the heat conductivity in the sorption
        medium (i.e. zeolite) itself. </p>
      <p>A heating element (not shown) may also be installed within the
        metal corrugated hoses 1A and 1B along the axial direction
        thereof, so that the sorption medium 4 can be heated as required
        during any particular desorption process. In connection
        therewith, the installation of a metal socket for receiving an
        electrical heating cartridge is advantageous, for example, if
        the sorption medium should be electrically heated. Also, in the
        event that cooling of the adsorption medium is required, a
        cooling element can be placed on the outside of the metal
        corrugated hose along the axial direction thereof, so that
        cooling occurs through the surface of the metal corrugated hose.
      </p>
      <p>Annular wave hoses of the type shown in FIG. 2, are commonly
        made from smooth pipes. The smooth pipes 7A and 7B which are
        used for making the corrugated hoses 1A and 1B respectively, are
        not separated at one end of the corrugated hoses. The smooth
        pipe piece ends 7A and 7B which remain during manufacturing of
        the waves 2, are typically designed with a gradient or bend with
        respect to annular wave hoses 1A and 1B. As shown in FIG. 3,
        these smooth pipe piece ends are also provided on the outer
        surface area thereof, with correspondingly apertured thin-sheet
        metal plates (i.e. heat exchanging fins) 8 and are mechanically
        connected with the smooth pipe ends in a good heat conducting
        manner. Notably, these heat exchanging fins 8 ensure a good heat
        transmission to and from the operating medium within the smooth
        pipe 7A and 7B. To ensure this good mechanical and thermal
        connection, the pipes have been widened, for example, by means
        of a mandrel which is introduced into the pipes until the thin
        sheet metal plates 8 are mechanically connected with the smooth
        pipes 7A and 7B in a good heat exchanging manner. Thus, for
        example, when cool air is fed over the thin sheet metal plates
        8, vapor operating medium desorbed from the zeolite filler 4 is
        condensed inside the smooth pipe pieces 7A and 7B (which
        function as condensors). In turn, the condensate 9 formed along
        the pipe pieces, can run off into a collecting container (not
        shown) when the pipe pieces are disposed in a declined position
        with respect to the corrugated hoses 1A and 1B, as shown in FIG.
        3 in particular. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of
        metal corrugated hoses such as 1A and 1B for example, can be
        arranged into bundle-like configuration. In such an embodiment,
        all of the smooth pipe ends 7A, 7B . . . can be commonly
        equipped with the heat exchanging fins 8 fixedly attached onto
        the smooth pipe ends by widening the pipe pieces. In this
        manner, an air-cooled condenser realized thereby, can be
        provided to this bundle-like configuration, in a weight saving
        manner, while not requiring any additional welding or soldering.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a section
        of another embodiment of the sorption container of the present
        invention. In general, the sorption container hereof comprises
        left and right side portions of the corrugated metal hose 1C. On
        the left side portion of the corrugated hose 1C, there is
        provided solid sorption medium 20 which fills the waves 21 of
        the hose to provide a sorption medium filler. Formed through the
        sorption medium 20, is a flow conduit 22 which allows for the
        passage of vapor operating medium as described hereinabove. As
        shown in FIG. 4, the right side of the corrugated hose 1C, is
        free of sorption medium, and a shut off means and liquid
        operating medium are contained therein instead. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 4, the shut off means comprises an
        apertured disk 23 which, along its outer area, is formed into a
        wave 21A of the corrugated hose 1C, in a vapor tight manner. The
        apertured disk 23 serves as a seal seat for a stanchion 24
        provided with a packing 25. The stanchion 24 is mounted on the
        end cap 26 of the metal corrugated hose by means of a linkage
        27. During a movement of the metal corrugated hose 1C in axial
        direction, the shut off means can be automatically opened or
        closed, as desired. In sorption apparatus under vacuum pressure,
        the shut off means in the rest position remains closed due to
        the flexibility of the corrugated hose. The shut off means can
        be opened by applying an outside force, which causes an
        expansion (i.e. elastic deformation) of the metal corrugated
        hose between the apertured sheet metal disk 23 and end cap 26,
        so that the operating medium can evaporate, flow through flows
        conduit 22, and adsorb into the sorption medium 20. In this
        particular embodiment, a leakage free shut off means is provided
        which can be made in a very cost effective manner. The inner
        region of corrugated hose 1C between the apertured disk 23 and
        the end cap 26, is additionally covered with an absorbent
        material 28 such as metal texture. This absorbent material 28
        uniformly distributes the condensed operating medium in the
        right hand portion of hose 1C, during the desorption phase of
        operation, and simultaneously acts as a drip separator for vapor
        operating medium during the adsorption phase. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous to bend each metal corrugated
        hose in the center by about 180.degree. and to arrange the two
        hose shanks parallel with respect to each other. In this manner,
        one costly locking cap per wave hose can be saved. This is
        particularly advantageous where the sorption container comes in
        contact with hot exhaust gases, since welded or soldered end
        caps would require a high manufacturing effort in this
        aggressive (i.e. hot exhaust gas) medium. </p>
      <p>On the right side portion of the metal corrugated hose 1C,
        during the adsorption process, the heat adsorbed from the liquid
        operating medium to evaporate a portion thereof, rapidly lowers
        the temperature of the remaining amount of liquid operating
        medium in the hose. The cooling power which is generated by this
        evaporation during the adsorption process, can be transmitted
        over the surface of the corrugated hose in a particularly
        efficient manner, for a variety of purposes. </p>
      <p>Metal-corrugated hoses for use in carrying out the present
        invention are described, for example, in the Taschenbuch Nr.301,
        Ausgabe 1984. of Fa. Witzenmann GmbH Metallschlauch-Fabrik
        Pforzheim. In accordance therewith, the base material for
        corrugated hoses are either seamless or longitudinally welded
        relatively thin-walled pipes. In these relatively thin-walled
        pipes, the swivel-like waves 2 can be impressed into smooth
        pipes, by means of special hydraulic tools. Alternatively,
        thin-walled bands of metal can be provided with wave-like
        profiles using a continuous metal forming process, then wound
        about on appropriate hose diameter, and thereafter welded
        together to form a relatively thin-walled pipe with swivel-like
        waves 2. Using this principle of corrugated metal hose
        construction, waves 2 having an increased height dimension can
        be produced, into which additional sorption medium can be filed.
        Also, such constructed metal configurated hoses typically will
        have a better than average resistance to operating medium
        pressure. </p>
      <p>Metal corrugated hoses used in constructing sorption containers
        of the present invention, have the advantage of being absolutely
        sealed tight from external atmosphere, and have a large pressure
        resistance and low space requirements. Marketable production
        sizes for metal corrugated hoses for use in the sorption
        container the present invention, typically are between 3 to 350
        mm inside diameter. The permissible operating pressures using
        such metal corrugated hoses, may reach up to 500 bar. An
        operating temperature threshold of up to about 650.degree. C. is
        assured using metal corrugated hoses of the present invention,
        however such a threshold is dependent on the operating pressure.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the already mentioned advantages of metal
        corrugated hoses of the present invention, an optimal heat
        transmission to and from the sorption medium is made possible.
        The sorption container of the present invention may be adjusted
        to the given heat carrier medium, by selecting appropriate
        dimensions for the wave hose diameter and/or the distance(s)
        between waves 2 of the metal corrugated hose hereof. </p>
      <p>A good heat exchange with the sorption medium is assured in
        view of the high flexibility of the metal corrugated hose of the
        present invention. In particular, in equipment under vacuum, the
        wave flanks shown in FIGS. 1, 3 and 4 are pressed onto the
        sorption medium by the outer excess pressure provided by the air
        pressure outside the hose. This external air pressure causes the
        hose to contract inwardly, pressing the waves flanks against the
        sorption medium filler 4, resulting in a good heat conductivity
        through the sorption medium filler 4 and hose, to the ambient
        atmosphere outside the hose. </p>
      <p>When using a helical wave hose, a heat carrier medium can be
        fed transversely to the metal corrugated hose of the present
        invention. Also, such a hose can be more strongly subjected to
        turbulence in comparison with the annular wave hose. </p>
      <p>A particularly effective application of the metal corrugated
        hose hereof is provided when the portion of the hose having no
        sorption medium present, is contacted with a heat carrier of a
        temperature different than the temperature of the portion of the
        hose filled with the sorption medium. In this manner, for
        example, the sorption medium portion of the hose hereof may be
        used as a condenser or evaporator for the operating medium. </p>
      <p>While the particular embodiment shown and described above has
        proven to be useful in many applications involving the
        adsorption arts, further modifications herein disclosed will
        occur to persons skilled in the art to which the present
        invention pertains and all such modifications are deemed to be
        within the scope and spirit of the present invention defined by
        the appended claims. </p>
