      <p>A plurality of adsorption containers are provided which are
        separated into heater adsorber zones and condenser evaporator
        zones. The zones are successfully rotated through flow segments
        which form a passageway for heat carrier flows. The heater
        adsorption zones contain an adsorption substance from which an
        operating substance is extracted by adsorbing heat from a heat
        carrier flow and is again adsorbed by emitting heat to a further
        heat carrier flow. The operating substance condenses and
        evaporates by means of a heat exchange with further heat
        exchangers. The adsorption devices are suitable as cooling
        devices and heat pumps as well as heat transformers and heat
        exchangers. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In general the present invention deals with adsorption devices
        of the type where there are at least two gas tight closed
        adsorption containers. The containers include heater adsorber
        zones filled with adsorption materials capable of adsorbing and
        deadsorbing an operating substance and condenser evaporator
        zones which condense the operating substance or readsorb it in a
        further adsorption substance. </p>
      <p>Heat may be transferred with adsorption devices from a first
        heat carrier to a second one at a higher temperature. The
        adsorption devices are separated into continuous and periodic
        systems. An operating substance is adsorbed exothermically in an
        adsorption substance in both systems and is again deadsorbed in
        an endothermic reaction. </p>
      <p>Periodic processes are possible only with solid non-pumpable
        adsorption substance. An adsorption substance charged with
        operating substances is provided in a gas tight adsorption zone,
        namely a heater adsorption zone. The operating substance is
        deadsorbed from the adsorption substance by an external heat
        transfer, namely the cooling. In a zone of the adsorption
        container which is cooled from the outside, namely the condenser
        evaporator zone, the operating substance can condense. The
        released heat is transmitted through the walls of the condensor
        evaporator zone to a heat carrier flow. The boiling adsorption
        zone is cooled so as to return the system to its initial state.
        Therefore, the adsorption substance can then adsorb the
        previously extracted operating substance. Adsorption heat is
        released due to the exothermic reaction which is adsorbed by
        heat carrier flows provided outside of the boiling adsorption
        zone. The operating substance evaporates in the condensor
        evaporating zone at lower temperatures by adsorbing heat from a
        further heat carrier flow. </p>
      <p>The operating substance pressure in the adsorption container
        and the operating substance condensation in the adsorption
        substances are only dependent on the temperature level of the
        heat carrier and adapt more or less rapidly to each outside
        change of this temperature level according to their reaction
        kinetics. Known adsorption and operating substances require a
        few hours under unfavorable conditions. </p>
      <p>The control of the heat carrier temperatures is expensive and
        complicated. Continuous refrigeration is not possible with a
        signal adsorption container. A quasi-continuous cooling process
        in only possible with an encasing of a plurality of adsorption
        containers and a phased displaced operating mode. They make the
        installation more expensive and prevent mobile use due to the
        additional mass. The changeover from one mode of operation to
        another, for example, from a heat pumping operation to a simple
        heat exchanger operation or a heat transfer operation is not
        possible. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to construct
        suitable adsorption devices for a plurality of novel, solid
        adsorption substances which permit a continuous operating mode.
        The adsorption devices are designed to make advantageous use of
        the characteristics of the novel adsorption substances and to
        permit the use of all known operating modes within only a single
        design. The controls are greatly simplified when compared to the
        controls of known processes. With this in mind, the devices are
        useable in motor vehicles due to the feasibility of limiting to
        a few the number of adjustment and control members. </p>
      <p>The objects of the present invention are also carried out by
        providing a plurality of gas tight closed adsorption containers
        which contain in one zone, namely the boiling or heater adsorber
        zone, an adsorption substance, and in another zone, an operating
        substance or readsorb in a second adsorption substance. The
        containers are rotated by a mutually rotating axis. The
        adsorption containers are arranged around the rotating axis in a
        manner that all heater adsorber zones are located within a first
        rotational element and all condenser evaporator zones are
        located within a second rotational element which is not
        penetrated by the first rotational element. In this manner, the
        rotational elements are admitted or traversed by separated
        flowing heat carriers which are fed in separate flow segments.
        During a complete rotation around the rotational axis all zones
        pass through the temperature level in the correct succession
        which is required for the total cycle. During through flow of
        the individual flow segments, the heat carrier flows adsorb heat
        from the passing adsorption container zones or emit heat to
        them. </p>
      <p>Thus, it is possible to eliminate a complicated adjustment and
        control required in the process for the heat carrier flows. The
        total heat carrier control is taken over by the rotational
        movement which guides the correct asorption containers through
        the correct flow elements. An adjustment to fluctuating
        temperature levels or volume flows of the heat carrier is taken
        over by the used pair of adsorption substances in a complete
        self-regulating manner by changes in steam pressure of the
        operating substance and by changing the concentration in the
        adsorption substance. </p>
      <p>Due to a particular design and arrangement of the adsorption
        containers, it is possible to further simplify the adsorption
        devices. The adsorption containers are designed as identical
        flat and wedge-like containers with uniform limiting edges for
        preventing an admixing of individual heat carrier flow within
        the rotational elements as well as to prevent a high pressure
        drop for the operating substance within the adsorption container
        and also for the heat carriers outside of the adsorption
        containers. A sealing of the flow segments against each other
        and against the outer space is performed with the assistance of
        proven and known conventional processes from the "rotor"-heat
        exchanger technology. The rotational movement of the adsorption
        container is obtained without additional elements if the
        adsorption container walls are placed against the flow direction
        of the heat carrier. The same effect can be obtained if the
        rotating axis is positioned hermetically and if the flow
        segments are correctly mounted. It is then possible to induce a
        torque by shifting the weight of the operating substance with
        flows in the half of the rotational element torwards the
        rotating axis and at the other half away from the rotational
        axis outwardly. </p>
      <p>Principally, all substances having a lower steam pressure in
        comparison to the used operating substance and which assure a
        sufficient steam pressure reduction for the adsorbed amount of
        the operating substance are suitable as an absorptive substance.
        Suitable are all alkalai and earth alkali salts, the bentonites,
        the silica gels and the activated carbons known for the
        refrigeration technology. The adsorption substances result in
        sufficient adsorption characteristics together with the
        operating substances water, methanol and ammonia. Particularly
        well suited is the adsorption substance is zeolite which permits
        evaporation temperatures around 0 degrees centigrade as well as
        boiling temperatures above 350 degrees centigrade. In
        cooperation with the operating substance water in this manner,
        the obtainable temperatures are above 100 degress centigrade.
        The reaction speeds and the cycle stability are unusally high.
        Further advantageous characteristics are an unlimited
        extraordinary good environmental compatibility and a low
        manufacturing price. The operating substance water freezes at
        temperatures below 0 degrees centigrade. For certain
        applications it is rather disadvantageous. However, when it is
        correctly used the phase transfer solid-liquid can be
        advantageously used in the function of an additional latent heat
        storage. </p>
      <p>Phase transfers by expansion evaporation of the operating
        substance do not result in a volume expansion. The combination
        of the adsorption substance zeolite in the hot plate or heater
        adsorber zones with a further adsorption substance for water in
        the condenser evaporator zones, for example, bentonite, salt or
        activated carbon permits a position and shock independent use of
        the adsorption devices. Therefore, the 0 degree limit is also
        nullified. Similar advantages are true for the use of two
        different metal hydrides as adsorption substances and hydrogen
        as the operating substance. The reaction heat of the adsorption
        reactions are higher in this case, as well as the adsorption
        container pressures. </p>
      <p>In a further embodiment of the invention, adsorption substances
        for water are also applied on the outer faces of the adsorption
        container. This is particularly advantageous for the use of the
        adsorption devices in air conditioners. In order to dehumidify
        air flows, the evaporation temperature of the operating
        substance in the condenser evaporator zones must not be below
        the dew point of the air flow in these cases. The reaction heat
        which is released during the adsorption of the air humidity in
        the adsorption substance is immediately adsorbed by the
        condenser evaporator zone and is fed by the operating substance
        into the heater adsorber zone to a higher temperature.
        Therefore, air flows can be dehumidified, cooled or heated in
        one operating step. </p>
      <p>Pumps and ventilators are customarily used for feeding the heat
        carriers. With suitable transmissions for the required drive
        motors they can also take over the rotating movements of the
        adsorption containers. The possible saving in weight cost
        reduction is particularly advantageous for the use in motor
        vehicles. </p>
      <p>During a full rotation of the adsorption containers around the
        rotating axis all heater adsorptions zones run successfully in
        accordance with the flow segments of the first rotation element
        for the functions of boiling, cooling, adsorbing and heating. At
        the same time in a phase coincidence manner, all condenser
        evaporator zones of the corresponding adsorption container pass
        the flow segments of the second rotation element for the
        functions condensing, cooling, evaporating and heating. The flow
        elements for the functions of cooling and heating are not
        required for the operation in accordance with the invention.
        They are not required in simplified adsorption devices. </p>
      <p>However, if one lets a heat exchanger such as a floating heat
        carrier circulate between these flow segments for heat exchange
        purposes, the obtainable heat ratios of the adsorption devices
        can be considerable increased. The specific heat capacities of
        the adsorption and operating substance as well as of the
        adsorption containers can be advantageously shifted in this
        manner. The result is higher heat or cold flow efficiency with a
        reduced use of boiling heat. </p>
      <p>The rotating movement of the adsorption containers permits,
        with a suitable flow feeding of the heat carriers (for example,
        due to flow deflection or a plurality of passages), sliding
        temperatures in the adsorption containers and also in the heat
        carriers themselves. Therefore, the temperature gradient within
        the flow segments can be advantageously used for a substantial
        cooling or heating of the heat carriers. </p>
      <p>In paticular the heat content of hot combustion gases in the
        flow segments can be used for the function of boiling and/or
        heating and, in this manner, also for the adsorption
        temperatures. With these combustion gases, in that the heat
        carriers flow successively or simultaneously through a plurality
        of flow elements for different functions, subsequently flowing
        through the flow segments of the second rotational element for
        the function of boiling and/or evaporating, the heat content can
        still be considerably better used than in the so-called
        "calorific value devices". Simultaneously, impurities which
        pollute the environment can be better separated in view of the
        substantial cooling. It appears to be advantageous if one heat
        carrier simultaneously flows through a plurality of flow
        segments performing different functions, for example cooling air
        through the flow segments cooling, adsorption, heating,
        evaporating and cooling off. Naturally, it would then not be
        necessary to limit or isolate these flow segments from each
        other. This is a decisive step on the way to a simple,
        economical and light adsorption device. </p>
      <p>It should also be noted that, in the present invention, it is
        possible to control the rotating frequency of the adsorption
        container in accordance with the temperatures of the individual
        heat carrier flows or in accordance with the temperatures of the
        adsorption containers or the content thereof. In the first case
        one obtains, for example, uniform discharge temperatures of
        individual heat carrier flows independent from the changing
        input temperatures or volume flows of the other heat carriers.
        In the second case, an overheating of individual adsorption
        containers is excluded or a particular favorable operating point
        can be maintained for the pair of adsorption substances used. </p>
      <p>Also, it is provided that the temperatures of the discharging
        heat carriers can be obtained by displacing the associated flow
        segments with respect to the others. For example, the discharge
        temperature of the heat carrier flow can be changed from "cold"
        to "warm" by displacing the flow segments for the function of
        evaporating to the position of the flow segment for the function
        of condensing. Thus, in this manner, a change in the mode of
        operation occured for the adsorption device due to this
        displacement, in that a change occured from a cooling device to
        a heat pump. </p>
      <p>This change of mode of operation can also be performed by a
        simple deflection of the heat flows. An adsorption device may be
        used for cooling and also for heating by means of a simple flap
        or valve adjustments in the heat carrier flow conduits.
        Therefore, previously known hot water heating systems and
        compressor air condtioners which are driven with mechanical
        energy in motor vehicles can now be replaced by installing the
        most simple adsorption devices. A dehumidification of the supply
        air can now be performed without any additional effort, and this
        should be kept in mind when observing that drying substances can
        be applied to the outer faces of the adsorption containers. In
        addition to savings in the gas consumption, the vehicle weight
        may also be reduced by eliminating the conventional heating
        system. A further weight and cost saving may occur when the flow
        element for the function of boiling also takes over the function
        of a muffler in the exhaust. An additional manifold can then be
        eliminated. </p>
      <p>The adsorption device can be operated as a heat transformer.
        The flow elements for the evaporation and boiling function are
        fed with heat carriers having a mean temperature. For the
        adsorption function, heat carriers with a high temperature are
        available for the flow elements. </p>
      <p>The adsorption devices are also usable as heat exchangers with
        heat-pipe-effect. The heat carriers to be cooled are fed through
        the flow segments for the evaporation and/or boiling function
        and the heat carriers to be heated are fed through the flow
        segments for the adsorption and/or condensing function. </p>
      <p>The adsorption devices are also usable as a regenerative heat
        exchanger. The heat carriers to be cooled are fed through the
        flow segments for the boiling and/or condensing functions and
        the heat carriers to be heated are fed through the flow segments
        for the adsorbing and/or evaporating function. </p>
      <p>When using the adsorption device as a regenerative heat
        exchanger, the mode of operation is similar to known
        "rotor"-heat exchangers. When it is used a a recooperative heat
        exchanger, no impurities of the exhaust flows can enter into the
        air supply flows. </p>
      <p>The adsorption devices may be used particularly advantageously
        in air conditioning installations with heat recovery from the
        exhaust air. In such installations, a simple heat exchange
        between the air supply and the air exhaust is sufficient in
        certain time intervals. The adsorption device may also operate
        as a heating pump or as a cooling device when there is a higher
        demand of heat or cooling by simply connecting an outside heat
        source (for example, oil or gas burners). Many times this change
        will be possible without any additional flap adjusting in the
        ventilation conduits. Only the temperature level of the heat
        carrier determines the mode of operation of the adsorption
        devices. The pair of adsorption substances automatically adjust
        to every change in the adsorption containers. </p>
      <p>There are number of different types of acceptable adsorption
        substances. A number of zeolites are useable such as type A
        zeolite (for example, MG-A, NA-A, CA-A), type X zeolite (for
        example CA-X) and type Y zeolite (for example NA-Y, H-Y)
        activated carbons, silica gels, bentenites, salts such as
        desiccating salts (for example CACL.sub.2, MGCL.sub.2, LIBR) and
        metal hydrides. Materials such as water, methanol, amonia, freon
        or hydrogen are used as an operating substance. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates a sectional view of an adsorption container
        1. It consists of two semicups made in accordance with the
        cupping process and made from metal or glass being welded
        together after filling. The hot plate or heater adsorber zone 2
        contains a first adsorption substance 3. Steam conduits in the
        center permit a better distribution of the operating substance
        steam. The condenser evaporator zone 4 contains a second
        adsorption substance 5. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 2 a plurality of adsorption containers are arranged
        circular-like in a radial direction around an axis of rotation
        6. Therefore, all heater adsorber zones 2 are located within a
        first rotation element a during the rotating movement around the
        rotational axis 6, while all condenser evaporator zones 4 are
        located within a second rotation element b. Flow segments 7 are
        left open in the stationary rotation elements a and b through
        which the heat carriers of different temperatures may flow. All
        flow segments 7 will be passed during a rotation of the
        adsorption containers 1 around rotating axis 6, that is, the
        flow segments 7 for the functions of boiling, adsorbing and
        heating of the heater zones and the flow elements 7 for the
        functions of condensing, cooling, evaporating and heating of
        condenser evaporator zones. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 illustrates a further arrangement possibility of the
        adsorption containers 1 around axis of rotation 6. The design
        and the arrangement of the adsorption container 1 can be
        substantially adapted to the situations in which they are going
        to be used. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 illustrates a sectional view through an adsorption
        device in the operation mode as an air conditioning and heating
        device for motor vehicles. An electric motor 8 with a propeller
        9 is mounted on the axis of rotation 6. This electric motor 8,
        by means of a conventional drive 13, provides the rotating
        movement of the adsorption container 1. The exhaust 10 of the
        internal combustion motor is connected to the flow elements 7
        for the function of boiling. Air conduits with shut-off flaps or
        valves lead from the flow elements 7 for the functions of
        evaporating, heating, condensing and cooling into the inside of
        the motor vehicle. The air temperature for the inside of the
        motor vehicle can be controlled by adjusting the shut-off flaps.
        Since the adsorption device simultaneously "cools" and "heats"
        during operation, both air flows could be simultaneously used.
        In this manner, for example, it is possible to cool the side of
        a space being exposed to sunshine and to heat the side facing
        away from the sunshine. Naturally, all forms of heat recovery in
        the ambient air operation are possible. Particularly
        advantageous is the fact that the heater adsorption zones which
        are in engagement with the exhaust gas are not engaged by the
        supply air flows for the air space of the motor vehicle. </p>
      <p>As depicted in FIG. 1, an adsorption material 12 can be mounted
        in a conventional manner on the outside of each container as a
        drying substance. </p>
      <p>As previously pointed out, the present invention is designed so
        that the ends of each container 1 exchange heat alternately with
        heat emitting and heat adsorbing heat carried flows during a
        rotation of a rotor. The zones are separated from one another so
        that there is not a harmful admixing of the heat carrier flows
        with respect to the rotating containers. This becomes clear when
        viewing FIG. 5. Each container, one is circulated by heat
        carrier medium the heat carrier mediums are separated by a
        border or wall between the flow segments. As depicted, the flow
        segments 7coo, the segment for cooling and 7ads, the segment for
        adsorption are separated by a border. </p>
      <p>This is further depicted in FIG. 2 and 4 where the individual
        segments 7 are provided with abbreviations of the respective
        functions. In addition to the "ads" and "coo" zones "hea"
        designates the heating zone, "eva" designates the evaporation
        zone, "con" designates the condensation zone, and "boi"
        designates the boiling zone. </p>
      <p>As depicted, the flat hermetically sealed containers 1 are
        arranged radially around a shaft 6 like flat spokes of a wide
        wheel. The arrangement rotates slowly around the wheel axis 6.
        Each container 1 consist of two interconnected compartments or
        zones 2 and 4. </p>
      <p>Each compartment contains a certain adsorbent, e.g., zeolite
        and a working fluid which can be absorbed in it, e.g., water.
        The two compartments 2, 4, one close to the rim and one close to
        the shaft 6 are connected by means of a widened section of the
        container. </p>
      <p>The widened section of neighboring containers abut, connect and
        seal with one another and this arrangement results in two sets
        of air channels in the axial direction between the containers.
        The first set is close to the rim and forms a rotational element
        a and the second is close to the shaft 6 and forms a rotational
        element b. </p>
      <p>In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 4 a sector of the channels
        close to the rim is passed by the exhaust gases from the exhaust
        10. A selected sector of the channels close to the shaft 6
        applies the cooling power or, alternatively, heating power to an
        air stream. The interconnected containers rotate and revolve
        while the ducts for air exhaust gases remain stationary. </p>
      <p>In operation, hot exhaust gases from the exhaust 10 pass the
        channels close to the rim and heat the absorbent inside the
        outer part of the sealed containers. While rotating slowly, the
        working fluid in the adsorbent is vaporized (deadsorbed) and
        moves to the cooler shaft-side zone of the container. There the
        vapor condenses and supplies heat to the air stream passing
        through the shaft side channels. Hot air produced in this manner
        can be used for heating. </p>
      <p>As the containers revolve around the central shaft 6, they are
        no longer heated by the exhaust gases. Both zones or
        compartments of each container are cooled to the ambient
        temperature by passing air through the channels. </p>
      <p>The cooling of the run-side containers starts the readsorbtion
        of working fluid. The cool adsorbent takes up gaseous working
        fluid and the vapor pressure in the containers decreases. Due to
        the absence of air, the water in the shaft-side compartment or
        zone of the container evaporates to supply more vapor which is
        also adsorbed. The evaporation takes place at very low
        temperature (e.g. 0.degree. C.=32.degree. F.). The heat of the
        evaporation is supplied by a air stream past through this sector
        of the run-side compartments or zones. The exiting cooled air
        streamed can be used for air conditioning the passengers
        compartment in a motor vehicle. </p>
      <p>The adsorbent adsorbs water vapor and heats up. The heat of
        adsorption is rejected to the air passig through the rotor. </p>
      <p>As the structure keeps rotating, the process inside a specific
        container undergoes the above steps in a repetitive manner. The
        large number of containers insures a continuous supply of heat
        and air conditioning power. </p>
      <p>Thus, the several aforenoted objects and advantages are most
        effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred
        embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein,
        it should be understood that this invention is in no sense
        limited thereby and its scope is to determined by that of the
        appended claims.</p>
