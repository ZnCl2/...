      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A sorption device for heating and cooling gas streams, with a
        sorbent container which contains a sorbent that takes up a
        working fluid which evaporates in an evaporator that contains a
        quantity of working fluid in correspondence with the quantity of
        sorbent, with a sorbent heat exchanger which exchanges the heat
        between a sorbent and a sorbent gas stream, with a working fluid
        heat exchanger which exchanges the heat between working fluid,
        and with a working fluid gas stream, and a closable valve
        between the sorbent container and the evaporator, which valve is
        able to interrupt the flow of the working fluid vapor, with both
        the sorbent heat exchanger and the working fluid heat exchanger
        having at their inlets and outlets connecting elements which can
        be readily attached to, detached from, and exchanged for one
        another on the gas flow channels for supplying and discharging
        gas streams that are to be heated or cooled. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention concerns a sorption device for
        heating and cooling gas streams according to the
        precharacterizing portion of claim 1. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Sorption devices are apparatuses in which a liquid or
        solid sorbent takes up a second fluid which boils at a lower
        temperature, the so-called working fluid, in the form of a vapor
        while releasing heat (sorption). In the course of this process,
        the working fluid evaporates in an evaporator while absorbing
        heat. After the sorbent is saturated, it can again be desorbed
        when heat is added to it (regeneration). At that time, the
        working fluid evaporates from the sorbent. The working fluid
        vapor can be recondensed and can subsequently be vaporized again
        in the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0003] Sorption devices for cooling with solid sorbents are
        known from the European Patent No. EP 0 368 111 and the German
        Patent Application [Offenlegungsschrift] No. DE-OS 34 25 419.
        Sorbent containers that are filled with sorbents draw off the
        working fluid vapor which forms in an evaporator and take it up
        in the sorbent packing while releasing heat. Subsequently, the
        heat of sorption must be dissipated from the sorbent packing.
        The cooling devices can be used for cooling and heating food
        products in thermally insulated boxes. </p>
      <p>[0004] The sorption cooling system known from the European
        Patent No. EP 0 368 11 1 comprises a portable cooling unit and a
        stationary charging station that can be separated from the
        cooling device. The cooling device comprises a sorbent container
        that is filled with a solid sorbent and an evaporator that
        contains a liquid working fluid and a heat exchanger embedded
        therein. The evaporator and the sorbent container are connected
        to each other via a vapor line that can be shut off. Liquid
        media which are cooled to the temperature desired by opening and
        closing the shut-off device flow through a heat exchanger that
        is embedded in the evaporator. After the sorbent is saturated
        with the working fluid, it can be heated in the charging
        station. The working fluid vapor that forms is recondensed in
        the evaporator. The heat of condensation is discharged by means
        of cooling water which must flow through the embedded heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p>[0005] The problem to be solved by this invention is to make
        available a sorption device that is suitable both for the
        heating and, as an alternative, for the cooling especially of
        gas streams. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] This problem is solved by the characterizing features of
        claim 1. The dependent claims disclose additional devices and
        methods in which the sorption device according to this invention
        can be used. </p>
      <p>[0007] Thus, a sorption device according to the present
        invention contains a sorbent inside a sorbent container, a
        valve, and the liquid working fluid inside an evaporator. Via a
        sorbent heat exchanger, heat is added to the sorbent during the
        regeneration phase and removed from the sorbent during the
        sorption phase. Via a working fluid heat exchanger, heat of
        evaporation is added to the working fluid during the sorption
        phase and heat of liquefaction is removed during the
        regeneration phase. According to the present invention, the
        quantities of heat are transferred to and from gas streams which
        in turn are, respectively, fed into and discharged from gas flow
        channels. According to the present invention, at the inlets and
        outlets of both the sorbent heat exchanger and the working fluid
        heat exchanger, there are connecting elements which make
        possible a readily removable and exchangeable connection to the
        gas flow channels for feeding in and discharging the gas streams
        that are to be heated or cooled. In this manner, each sorption
        device can be used either for heating or for cooling a gas
        stream since either the sorbent heat exchanger or the working
        fluid heat exchanger can be connected to the gas flow channel
        desired. According to the present invention, it is also possible
        to provide for switching devices for routing the gas streams.
        The connecting elements and switching devices need not meet any
        special requirements. They should, however, make it possible to
        establish a simple, secure, gas-tight, and rapid connection
        between the flow channels and the heat exchangers. It is useful
        to ensure that the connections or attachments cannot be mistaken
        for one another. </p>
      <p>[0008] If the connecting elements and the gas channels are
        symmetrically arranged, the sorption device needs to be only
        turned upside down or tilted so as to make it possible to switch
        from the heating function to the cooling function. In this case,
        the sorption device and the channels need not be folded,
        crossed, twisted or in any other way adjusted to fit the
        particular installation requirements. </p>
      <p>[0009] Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to
        protect the outlets and the inlets that lead to the gas flow
        channels by an incorporation of separate gas filters. This is
        especially true if the sorption device has to be used and
        exchanged in a poisoned, contaminated or polluted atmosphere.
        The separate gas filters thus offer protection against
        unfiltered gases throughout the time the device is used or
        switched. </p>
      <p>[0010] It may also be useful if the gas flow channels is
        connected to a box and if provision is made so that the sorption
        device can be installed in the box in two different ways or if
        the gas flow channels can be suitably switched within the box.
        Depending on the application (heating or cooling), the desired
        heat exchanger can subsequently be connected to the appropriate
        gas flow channels. At the same time, the box might also contain
        the required air and gas supply units (e.g., fans), filters, and
        energy supply units, and it might be designed in the form of a
        portable or movable suitcase. </p>
      <p>[0011] During the regeneration phase, the sorbent is heated and
        the working fluid vapor is desorbed. This vapor flows through
        the opened or self-opening valve to the evaporator where it
        condenses out. At the end of the regeneration phase, the heat
        supply into the sorbent is interrupted. As a result, the
        desorption of additional working fluid vapor is concluded. When
        the vapor valve closes, the working fluid vapor is prevented
        from flowing back. Subsequently, the desorbed working fluid in
        the form of a liquid is contained in the evaporator. Now the
        sorption device is ready and can be stored for any length of
        time desired. Per kilogram of zeolite, a sorption device
        according to the present invention is able to store 130 watt
        hours of cold and 160 watt hours of heat without loss over any
        length of time desired. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is useful if the sorbent container and possibly also
        the sorbent heat exchanger are provided with a
        temperature-resistant thermal insulation to minimize the
        dissipation of heat into the surrounding air during the
        regeneration process. The regeneration can be carried out in a
        separate regeneration device. It is especially energy-efficient
        if the gas stream that exits from the working fluid heat
        exchanger after having absorbed the heat of liquefaction is
        heated by means of a heater to temperatures of approximately
        300.degree. C. and is subsequently introduced into the sorbent
        heat exchanger. In this manner it is possible to use only one
        single fan and one single gas stream for both heat exchangers
        and to preheat the gas stream with the heat of liquefaction. In
        this manner, the regeneration device can have a simple design,
        it is safe to operate and, at the same time, it saves energy. </p>
      <p>[0013] To initiate the sorption phase, the valve is opened. Now
        working fluid vapor can flow from the evaporator into the
        sorbent container and can be exothermally taken up by the
        sorbent. This cools the working fluid vapor in the evaporator as
        well as the gas stream that flows past inside the heat
        exchanger. To generate the maximum cooling capacity, the sorbent
        must be able to transfer its heat of sorption in a heat
        exchanger to a gas stream. An especially intensive refrigerating
        effect is achieved if the sorbent container has a sufficiently
        large heat exchanging surface for the gas stream that flows
        through it. Preferably, the sorbent is cooled to low
        temperatures so as to make it possible for it to take up the
        maximum quantity of working fluid at sufficiently low
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0014] It is especially useful if the pair of sorbents used are
        zeolite and water. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral which has a
        regular skeletal structure made of silicon and aluminum oxides.
        This skeletal structure comprises cavities in which water
        molecules can be taken up while releasing heat. Within the
        skeletal structure, the water molecules are subjected to strong
        field forces which bind the molecules in the lattice and liquefy
        them. The strength of the binding forces that act upon the water
        molecules is dependent on the quantity of water that is already
        contained in the skeletal structure and on the temperature of
        the zeolite. For practical applications, up to 25 grams of water
        can be taken up per 100 grams of zeolite. Zeolites are solid
        substances which do not expand as a result of heat during the
        sorption and desorption reaction. The skeletal structure can be
        readily accessed from all sides by the water vapor molecules.
        The sorption devices can therefore be used in any position. </p>
      <p>[0015] The use of water as a working fluid makes it possible to
        reduce the required control means to a minimum. As the water is
        vaporized in vacuo, the surface of the water cools to 0.degree.
        C. and freezes to form ice as the evaporation process continues.
        This layer of ice grows rapidly until the resulting drop in
        pressure automatically reduces its growth. Thus, the layer of
        ice can be advantageously used to control the gas temperature.
        If only a small quantity of heat is transferred to the gas
        stream, the layer of ice grows, if a very large quantity of heat
        is transferred, the layer of ice melts. If the gas temperature
        is to be reduced to less than 0.degree. C., substances that
        lower the freezing point can be mixed into the aqueous working
        fluid. </p>
      <p>[0016] But it is also possible to use any other pairs of
        sorbents, as long as one of the sorbents is solid and remains
        solid even during the sorption reaction. Solid sorbents,
        however, are poor heat conductors and poor heat exchangers.
        Since the heat exchange between the gas stream and the sorbent
        heat exchanger is in the same order of magnitude, it is
        recommended that only heat exchangers without fins, such as
        those with a cylindrical, platelike or tubelike configuration,
        be used. Since especially zeolite granules are poor heat
        conductors, the sorbent containers should be designed so as to
        ensure that the average heat conducting path for the transformed
        quantities of heat is no greater than 2 cm. </p>
      <p>[0017] A few solid sorbents, such as zeolite, are sufficiently
        stable to compensate for excess pressure on the outside of
        thin-walled containers. Additional reinforcements or
        thick-walled heat exchanging surfaces are therefore not
        necessary. Since the sorption device is under a vacuum when the
        working fluid used is water and since for the entire life of the
        device, gases should not be able to penetrate into the system,
        the valve should preferably be made of vacuum sealing
        components. For manual actuation, feedthroughs that are sealed
        by means of metal bellows have been shown to be useful. </p>
      <p>[0018] For economical operations, zeolite temperatures in a
        range from 250 to 350.degree. C. for the regeneration phase and
        from 40 to 80.degree. C. for the sorption phase are recommended.
        Regeneration can be especially advantageously carried out by
        means of a stream of hot air at an air temperature of more than
        300.degree. C. If the zeolite packing layer is thin, the
        regeneration phase can be concluded within one hour. Special
        care should be taken to ensure that the condensation
        temperatures are kept below 100.degree. C., which can be
        accomplished by an adequate flow of gas through the working
        fluid heat exchanger. If the temperatures were to be higher, the
        pressure inside the container would be increased to a level
        higher than the air pressure outside the container. </p>
      <p>[0019] The sorption device is especially suitable for use in
        mobile applications, i.e., in situations in which no operating
        energy for air-conditioning or heating systems is available.
        This includes battery-operated automobiles and small airplanes,
        protective tents, EMS stretchers with protective covers, and
        protective clothing of all types. Depending on the season and
        the location in which the device is used, either ventilation,
        cooling or heating is required. A sorption device according to
        the present invention as one single unit is able to meet all
        three requirements. Especially when used in protective clothing,
        the sorption device should be light weight and wearable without
        much restricting the freedom of movement. Depending on the
        particular application, for example, it might be integrated into
        the air flow channels of the protective clothing on the person's
        back or chest. </p>
      <p>[0020] A certain additional protection against flying splinters
        or other projectiles can be ensured by appropriately adapting
        the sorbent container and/or the working fluid container to the
        shape of a person's body. </p>
      <p>[0021] A special advantage can be obtained if discharged humid
        air, in particular the expired air from protective masks, is
        introduced into the working fluid heat exchanger. The water
        vapor content of the humid air can thus be liquefied in the
        sorbent heat exchanger and can subsequently transfer a
        considerable quantity of the heat of evaporation required to the
        working fluid. The sorbent receives the working fluid vapor at a
        higher pressure and is thus able to readily transfer the heat of
        sorption at a higher temperature via the sorbent heat exchanger
        to the exiting gas stream which heats the protective clothing
        article. </p>
      <p>[0022] A considerable advantage may also be obtained if the
        working fluid heat exchanger separates the gas streams into a
        minimum of two separate streams, the temperature at the exit
        opening and/or the volume streams of which are to be conditioned
        in different ways. In this manner, for example, the breathing
        air that is introduced into a protective clothing article can be
        made to have a temperature or humidity different from the air
        that controls the microclimate existing between the cover of the
        protective clothing article and the surface of the wearer's
        body. To be able to accommodate such functions, the sorption
        device according to the present invention may optionally be
        equipped with two valves or two containers for the working
        fluid. </p>
      <p>[0023] During the cooling of a gas stream flowing through the
        working fluid heat exchanger, it is possible for a considerable
        quantity of condensate to be formed. This condensate should be
        discharged from the heat exchanger as safely and as effectively
        as possible. Since, as a rule, the pressure prevailing in the
        gas stream is slightly greater than the pressure prevailing in
        the surrounding medium, the accumulated condensate quantity can
        be discharged into the surrounding air via small openings. It is
        especially useful if the condensate is introduced into the
        sorbent heat exchanger and vaporized on the surfaces of the heat
        exchanger. In this manner, it is possible to reduce the gas
        stream that discharges the heat of sorption. A transfer of the
        condensate from the working fluid heat exchanger into the
        sorbent heat exchanger can also be accomplished by means of
        separate conduits or even by means of hygroscopic materials
        (wicks). </p>
      <p>[0024] The temperatures of the gas streams exiting from the
        heat exchangers can be controlled by the settings of the valve
        as known from prior art. In addition to the temperatures, the
        moisture content of the gas streams can be used as a directly
        controlled variable for the valve setting. </p>
      <p>[0025] The states of the exiting gas streams can, however, also
        be controlled in a different way which is independent of the
        valve setting. For example, to increase or decrease the
        temperature of the gas stream exiting from the working fluid
        heat exchanger, the flow of the gas through the sorbent heat
        exchanger can be increased or reduced. Since the thermodynamic
        equilibrium is established whenever the valve is opened, a
        reduction of the sorbent temperature, for example, will cause
        the temperature of the working fluid to be reduced, and an
        increase in the temperature of the sorbent will lead to an
        increase in the temperature of evaporation. </p>
      <p>[0026] It is also useful if the valve is designed in the form
        of a check valve. In this case, the regeneration can also be
        carried out when the valve is closed. The working fluid vapor
        exiting from the sorbent automatically opens the check valve and
        condenses in the evaporator. Since the valve was not opened, it
        does not have to be manually closed at the end of the
        regeneration phase. This can be a special advantage in that it
        allows the sorption device to be handled safely. </p>
      <p>[0027] The composition and the state of the cooled or heated
        gases in the sorption device are of no importance. In most
        cases, however, air streams will be used for cooling and
        heating. The conveying elements used will be mainly fans and
        blowers. According to the present invention, however, gases from
        supply stations or compressed-air pipe systems or air discharged
        from turbine engines of airplanes can be used as well. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0032] Sorption device 1 shown as a sectional view in FIG. 1
        comprises a multicomponent container 2 for the sorbent that is
        filled with sorbent 3, a valve 4, and an evaporator 5 which
        contains working fluid 6. The surface of evaporator 5 which also
        comprises several components forms the working fluid heat
        exchanger 7, and the surface of container 2 for the sorbent
        forms the heat exchanging surface of the sorbent heat exchanger
        8. Both the sorbent heat exchanger 8 and the working fluid heat
        exchanger 7 are surrounded by insulated housings 9,10 which
        route gas streams V and S between the two sorber connecting
        elements 11,12 and the two evaporator connecting elements 13,14.
        Connected to connecting element 13 is radial blower 15 which
        draws in gas stream V that is to be cooled --if required, by way
        of filter 16 --and pushes it through the working fluid heat
        exchanger 7 and connecting element 14 into gas flow channel 17
        which comprises a filter element 18. Like the identical filter
        element 19 in the gas flow channel 21, this filter element 18
        protects a given protected zone 20 during an exchange of the
        sorption device against the penetration of noxious substances
        from the surrounding air. Gas stream S which exits the protected
        zone 20 via the flexible flow channel 21 cools sorbent 3 by
        means of the sorbent heat exchanger 8 until it exits from the
        sorption device by way of connecting element 12. </p>
      <p>[0033] While cooling to below the dew point, gas stream V is
        able to discharge water which is collected in the condensate
        bottom 22, from which it is distributed via a condensate conduit
        23 to the sorbent heat exchanger 8 by means of the existing
        difference in pressure. On the surface of the sorbent heat
        exchanger 8, the condensate is able to evaporate again and helps
        to further cool sorbent 3. The vapor that forms is discharged
        from gas stream S from the sorption device by way of connecting
        element 12. </p>
      <p>[0034] FIG. 1b comprises the same components as FIG. 1a but
        shows a view that is not sectioned and without the connections
        [to the gas flow channels] and with the difference that sorption
        device 1 is turned upside down so as to heat protected zone 20
        rather than to cool it as shown in Figure 1a. Radial blower 15
        stands ready to be connected to connecting element 11 and to
        draw in surrounding air during the heating operation, which air,
        after having passed through the sorbent heat exchanger 8 and
        thus being heated, is transported via connecting element 12 and
        gas flow channel 17 into protected zone 20. The gas stream that
        exists protected zone 20 via gas flow channel 21 is transported
        to the working fluid heat exchanger 7 via connecting element 13
        and exits the sorption device via connecting element 14 after
        having discharged heat to the working fluid. </p>
      <p>[0035] The way in which the gas stream flows through protected
        zone 20 as shown in FIGS. 1a and 1b is useful if only one single
        blower is to be responsible both for supplying the heat of
        evaporation and for dissipating the heat of sorption. It may,
        however, also be beneficial to exhaust the cooled or heated gas
        stream from protected zone 20 directly into the surrounding air.
        In this case, it will be necessary to provide an additional air
        or gas supply unit which supplies the second heat exchanger with
        a stream of gas. </p>
      <p>[0036] FIG. 2 finally shows sorption device 1 described above
        during a regeneration phase. Radial blower 15 pushes surrounding
        air through connecting element 13 into the working fluid heat
        exchanger 7, next through connecting element 14 into a heating
        duct 24 which contains an electric heating element 25,
        subsequently from there through connecting element 11 into the
        sorbent heat exchanger 8, and finally through connecting element
        12 back into the surrounding air. Thus, one single radial blower
        15 transports one single gas stream through the sorption device,
        which gas stream absorbs the heat of condensation in the working
        fluid heat exchanger 7 and is heated in heating element 25 to a
        temperature higher than 350.degree. C. and subsequently
        dissipates the heat in the sorption device heat exchanger 8 to
        the sorbent. Thus, one single thermostat 26 which is located in
        the air stream downstream of heating element 25 ensures that the
        sorbent is heated to the required temperature and that, at the
        same time, the heat of condensation is safely discharged from
        the evaporator so as to prevent a dangerous increase in the
        pressure within the sorption device. </p>
