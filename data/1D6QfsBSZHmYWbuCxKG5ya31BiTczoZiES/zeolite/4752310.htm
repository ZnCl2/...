      <p>The invention describes portable cooling and heating devices
        and their process of operation in accordance with the adsorption
        principle utilizing the adsorption substance pair of
        zeolite-water. The devices operate without substance and heat
        exchange from the environment, in that the evaporation heat
        originates from the solidifying heat of a non-evaporating amount
        of water and that the released adsorption heat is stored in the
        form of tangible heat of the zeolite filler. The ice which had
        been generated during the adsorption process is suitable for
        human consumption. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to a process and portable devices for
        changing temperatures in accordance with the adsorption
        principle wherein operating agents are evaporated from a
        predetermined amount of operating agents being adsorbed in an
        adsorption agent by releasing the adsorption heat. </p>
      <p>Processes and transportable devices for cooling and heat
        generation in accordance with the absorption principle are
        known. An easily evaporating operating agent is absorbed by a
        more difficult absorption agent. Useable cold is generated
        during the evaporation of the operating agent, while also
        useable absorption heat is released in the absorption agent
        during the absorption. Shut off devices within the steam chamber
        prevent an absorption outside of the operation. The cold or heat
        generation is initiated by opening the shut off devices. For
        reactivating the devices, the absorption agent is heated and the
        escaping operating agent is condensed. Devices in accordance
        with this process permit either the heating or cooling of goods,
        for example, foodstuffs or drinks. </p>
      <p>All devices thereby depend on a heat exchange with the
        environment. For example, if an article should be heated with
        the released absorption heat, the evaporation heat for the
        operating agent must be simultaneously received from the
        environment. If, in the reversed situation, the goods should be
        cooled, then the absorption heat must be discharged to the
        environment. Very expensive heat exchangers are provided for
        this heat exchange which render the portable systems heavy,
        expensive and inert due to low heat transfer coefficients.
        Therefore, disposable devices which are suitable for a one time
        use become uneconomical. Adiabatic processes without heat
        exchange with the environment are not possible with the known
        pairs of absorption substances. </p>
      <p>The requirements for the pairs of absorption substances are
        numerous. Only a few pair of substances have a sufficiently wide
        field of solution and the thermodynamic basic prerequisite for a
        sufficient temperature distance between the evaporation and the
        absorption. Furthermore, they should be easily regeneratable,
        non-corrosive, non-toxic and stable. Compatibility with the
        environment must be assured, in particular, with disposable
        devices. An accidental contact with foodstuff should not result
        in any damage. Portable devices should be lightweight in
        construction. Therefore, the container walls must be thinly
        constructed. Hence, high operating agent steam pressures are not
        suitable. The reaction kinetic must occur rather rapidly.
        Hitherto, no pair of substances could be mentioned which would
        meet these requirements. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
        processes and portable cooling and heating devices with which a
        rapid and effective cooling and/or heating of goods is made
        possible without having a heat or substance exchange with the
        environment of the device. </p>
      <p>This object of the invention is solved in that an operating
        agent is used in the process in accordance with the adsorption
        principle which receives its evaporation heat from the
        solidification heat of the amount of operating agent which does
        not evaporate, and that an adsorption agent is used which can
        store the released adsorption heat in form of specific heat in
        the adsorption agent itself. </p>
      <p>This is made possible by using water as the operating agent and
        zeolite as the adsorption agent. The water and the zeolite are
        present in two containers within the evacuated cooling and
        heating device and are separated by a shut off device. Upon
        opening of the shutoff device, steam flows into the zeolite
        filler and is adsorbed while simultaneously releasing heat.
        Further water evaporates from the water filler by cooling and
        subsequent icing of the remaining water filler. The zeolite
        filler can adsorb water as long as its increasing temperature is
        in a thermodynamic balance with the already adsorbed amount of
        water under the steam pressure of the ice. Therefore, the
        adsorption heat is adiabatically storable in the form of
        specific heat of the zeolite filler, the absorbed amount of
        water and the container material. For example, 100 g zeolite
        Na-X have adsorbed 7,5 g water in the balanced stage at a
        temperature of 140.degree. C. and a steam pressure of 600 hPA.
        About 42 g water having 25.degree. C. cool down to 0.degree. C.
        and may be completely frozen with the generated evaporation or
        sublimation cold. This evaporation process occurs completely
        adiabatic. Therefore, without a heat exchange with the
        environment one can simultaneously provide heat and cooling. </p>
      <p>The combination of zeolite-water meets all requirements for an
        optimum pair of adsorption substances. The unusually wide spread
        field of charge permits also high temperature differences with
        relatively low amounts of zeolite. Zeolites are edible and can
        be economically synthesized. The adsorption process is
        non-sensitive to position and shocks and a volume change is
        disregarded. The zeolite types Na-A, Mg-A, Ca-A, Na-X, Na-Y and
        H-Y show no decomposition even after a frequent regeneration. </p>
      <p>The type H-Y is pH-neutral even in watery solution. When making
        ice, contamination of the water filler has no influence on the
        edibility of the ice. Synthetic zeolites are commercially
        available in powder or granulate form. Powder-like zeolites may
        be processed into blanks by means of binder agents which are
        adapted to the cooling or heating devices. Specifically designed
        blanks may be used for reinforcing the container walls, for
        example, thus permitting a simplified container construction or
        the saving of container material. Expensive pressure tanks are
        not required when using water as the operating agent. </p>
      <p>Zeolites heat partially from room temperature to above
        160.degree. C. during the adiabatic adsorption process. However,
        for many heating requirements, temperatures of about 80.degree.
        C. are sufficient. Zeolites can adsorb more water with lower
        temperatures. If additional heat storage masses are heat
        conductively coupled to the zeolite filler, a part of this
        adsorption heat can be transferred to these heat storage masses.
        Since the temperatures in the zeolite filler are therefore
        lower, more steam can be adsorbed and more adsorption heat can
        be made available. Additional heat storage masses are
        advantageously liquids like, for example, coffee, tea, soups
        which can be taken in a hot stage from the device. Small
        gas-tight closed water capsules are suitable for disposable
        devices for making ice, for example, which are uniformly
        distributed in the zeolite filler and adsorb a part of the
        adsorption heat, thus reducing the required amount of zeolite. </p>
      <p>Also, the evaporation enthalpy may be partially extracted from
        other substances, for example, drinks. In this manner, the
        container with the drink is heat conductively coupled to the
        water container. </p>
      <p>The ice which is generated during the adsorption process is
        edible. Since zeolites are also edible, no danger exists for the
        user even with improper handling. The reaction speed of the pair
        of substances is so high that the water filler solidifies to ice
        in a few seconds in suitable containers and can be taken out of
        these containers. A refilling with fresh water and a
        reactivation of the zeolite filler is possible, but in light of
        the low material value, it would be impractical. Usually such
        devices for making ice are designed as disposable systems. Water
        fillers which are dimensioned too large only partially freeze or
        are not cooled to the freezing point. If further substances are
        admixed to the water filler, for example, lemonade substances,
        fruit juices, alcohols, ice cream mixtures, etc., the fillers
        may be served strongly cooled or frozen, after opening the
        cooling device. </p>
      <p>The shut off devices are advantageously designed as steam
        valves for cooling and heating devices which are constructed for
        reactivating the zeolite filler. Smaller water valves are
        sufficient in disposable systems. These water valves must be so
        designed that they permit a discharge of the total water filler
        from the water container into the zeolite container. </p>
      <p>The zeolite filler should be so arranged within the zeolite
        container that is does not come into contact with the incoming
        water. Particularly thick ice layers may be made in that the
        water, which flows slowly into the zeolite container, flows onto
        already frozen ice layers and thereby freezes. </p>
      <p>In a particular embodiment of the invention the water container
        is shaped as a drinking container. After opening the one-way
        system, the ice may remain in the drinking container and may be
        poured over by the drinks to be cooled. In a further embodiment
        of the invention the drinking container assumes the function of
        the shut off device. For this purpose, the container is pushed
        against a face of the zeolite container with a specific
        mechanism in such a manner that the container opening is closed.
      </p>
      <p>All cooling and heating devices must be evacuated during the
        manufacturing. For this purpose, the zeolite filler is heated by
        means of a heating source to a temperature between 250.degree.
        C. and 700.degree. C. The steam desorbed from the zeolite
        discharges from the zeolite container through a small closeable
        evacuation opening and thereby takes along the enclosed air.
        Therefore, no specific vacuum pumps are required. In an analog
        manner the water container is separately or simultaneously
        evacuated. During a simultaneous evacuation the container must
        be so arranged that the water filler in the water container is
        brought to a boiling point by the excess heating of the
        discharging steam or by the radiation heat from the hot zeolite
        filler, so that the steam which discharges through the shut off
        device, for example, removes non-condensable gases from the
        water container. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a combined cooling and heating plate in a
        sectional view. A water container 11 is connected to a zeolite
        container 13 containing a zeolite filler 14 by means of a
        magnetically actuable shut off device 12. An absorbable material
        16 fixes the water filler 15 on the correct side of the
        container. The plate with the water container 11 is placed
        upwardly for the purpose of cooling and the magnetically acting
        shut off device 12 is opened. The water filler 15 partially
        evaporates and solidifies. The zeolite filler 14 adsorbs the
        steam and stores the released adsorption heat in form of
        tangible heat. The plate with the zeolite container is placed
        upwardly for the purpose of heating or keeping articles hot. </p>
      <p>For reactivation purposes, the plate with the zeolite container
        side may be placed onto a hot stove plate, for example. Thereby,
        the shut off device 12 permits a flow of the steam desorbed by
        the zeolite filler 14 into the water container 11, even when the
        shut off device is closed. The condensate heat is emitted to the
        environment. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 illustrates a cooling and heating rod which operates in
        accordance with the same principle as the cooling and heating
        plate of FIG. 1. For cooling, the water 21 is immersed into a
        liquid for heating the zeolite container 23 and the magnetic
        valve 22 is opened. For reactivating purposes the zeolite filler
        24 in the zeolite container 23 is heated to about 250.degree. C.
        and the escaping steam is condensed on the water container wall
        21. The absorbable material 26 distributes the condensate
        uniformly. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 illustrates a further embodiment of the invention in the
        form of a combined cooling and heating pouch. The sectional Fig.
        illustrates an insulation box 37 and a cooling and heating
        device in accordance with the invention in lid 38. The lid 38 is
        designed as a reverse lid, so that the cooling water container
        31 or the heating zeolite container 33 point into the inner
        chamber of the insulation box 37, depending on the intended
        purpose. The cooling or heating operation is also activated by
        actuating the shut off device 32 or is interrupted by the shut
        off device. A thermostatically controlled heating device 39 is
        mounted on the outer face of the zeolite container for
        reactivating the zeolite filler 34. To make sure that the
        reactivation of the zeolite filler 34 does not occur when the
        pouch is closed, for safety reasons, the current supply cable
        and the associated operating switch are so disposed that a
        regeneration cannot occur when the pouch is closed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4a illustrates a cooling device for drinks before being
        used. The water container 41a is separated from the zeolite
        container 43a by a steam-tight membrane 42. A hollow space for
        the drink 47a to be cooled is disposed in a recess of water
        container 41a. A support ring 48 on the connecting face of the
        containers is removed to initiate the cooling effect. Thus, the
        outer air pressure pushes the container walls together. Thereby,
        the steam-tight membrane 42 is cut by a cutting knife 49. Now,
        the path for the steam is free. The cooling effect occurs
        immediately. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4b illustrates a heating device for drinks after
        activation in accordance with the same principle. The drink 47b
        to be heated is disposed in the recess of the zeolite container
        43b. The steam-tight membrane 42 is already separated by the
        cutting knife and has been taken along the steam flow into the
        zeolite container 43b. The water filler 45 is solidified to ice
        and the zeolite filler 44 is hot. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 illustrates a sectional and plan view of a further
        inventive cooling and heating device. The zeolite container 53
        and the water container 51 have the shape of a double jacket
        with cup-like recesses 54a and 57b for the direct reception of
        liquids or containers, like cans, for example. The zeolite
        container 53 is encompassed by a heatable sleeve 59 for
        reactivating the zeolite filler 54. A leakage free shut off
        device 52 prevents the adsorption of steam from the water filler
        55 in the zeolite filler 54 in the closed stage, but permits an
        unhindered backflow of the steam desorbed from the zeolite
        filler 54 into the water container 51. The cooling and heating
        device may be used either for cooling only or for heating, or
        for a simultaneous cooling and heating. In all modes of
        operation is it irrelevant whether the given other cup-like
        recess 57a or 57b is filled or is empty. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 is a portable device before and after the adsorption
        reaction for making edible ice or for cooling liquids. The water
        filler 65 is disposed in the cup-like water container 61. The
        water container 61 and the zeolite filler 64 are disposed within
        the zeolite container 63. The zeolite filler 64 consists of a
        solid zeolite blank which reinforces the zeolite container wall.
        Additional heat storage elements 66 are imbedded into the blank.
        They consist of water filled metal capsules, for example. The
        cup-like water container 61 is pushed with its opening against a
        sealing ring 67 in the lid of the zeolite container by means of
        a trigger device 68. The outer air pressure supplies the
        required pressure, whereby the bottom and the lid of the zeolite
        container 63 are slightly arched inwardly. Further substances
        may be admixed to the water filler 65 in water container 61, for
        example, milk products or basic lemonade substances. In order to
        initiate the adsorption reaction, the bottom of the zeolite
        container is mechanically deformed by means of a tongue until
        the trigger device 68 yields to the pressure of the steam in the
        water container 61 and separates the container from the sealing
        ring 67. Thus, the path for the steam to the zeolite filler 64
        is free. Within a few seconds the water filler 65 is frozen into
        ice and the zeolite filler 64 is hot. The lid of the zeolite
        container 63 is removed and the ice filler together with the
        water container 61 are removed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 illustrates a further embodiment of a device for making
        ice before and after the adsorption reaction. The zeolite
        container 73 contains the zeolite filler 74 as well as the water
        container 71 with the water filler 75. A further container 77
        extends into the zeolite filler 74 which contains a heat storage
        mass, for example, water, coffee, etc. A plug device 78 extends
        through the bottom of container 77 and into the flexible water
        container 71. An opening is pierced into the lower sheath of the
        water container 71 with this plug device 78 for making ice.
        Thereupon, the water filler 75 discharges into the zeolite free
        part of the zeolite container 73 and freezes into ice in a few
        seconds. The zeolite filler 74 feeds a part of the released
        adsorption heat to the heat storage mass in container 77. After
        the ice is formed, the lower part of the zeolite container 73
        together with the ice filler is separated from the remaining
        part of the device. </p>
      <p>Thus, the several of afforenoted objects and advantages are
        most effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred
        embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein,
        it should be understood that this invention is in no sense
        limited and its scope is to be determined by that of the
        appended claims.</p>
