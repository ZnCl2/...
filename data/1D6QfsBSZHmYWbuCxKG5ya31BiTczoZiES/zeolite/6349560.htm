              Liquid in a Container</font></b> </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Method and apparatus for the cooling of a liquid (4) within a
        container (3) by means of a liquid cooler (1), which absorbs a
        working agent vapor through a sorbent (14) from an evaporator
        (8), which is in thermal contact with the liquid (4) to be
        cooled, and wherein during the regeneration of the sorbent (14),
        the working agent vapor flows back into the evaporator (8) and
        during condensation, releases its condensation heat to a liquid
        (4) in the container (3). </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention concerns a liquid container and a method for the
        cooling of a liquid in a container by means of a sorption
        device. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Sorption apparatuses are apparatuses in which a liquid or solid
        sorbent absorbs a second, higher-boiling agent, the working
        agent, in the form of a vapor, with the release of heat. The
        working agent thereby evaporates in an evaporator with the
        absorption of heat. After the sorbent is saturated, it can be
        desorbed, once more, by supplying heat. The working agent
        thereby evaporates from the sorbent. The working agent vapor can
        be reliquified and subsequently evaporated, once again, in the
        evaporator. </p>
      <p>Sorption apparatuses for cooling with solid sorbents are known
        from EP 0 368 111 and DE-OS 34 25 419. Sorbent containers,
        filled with sorbents, thus draw off the working agent vapor that
        is formed in an evaporator and absorb it in the sorbent charging
        with the release of heat. The sorption heat must thus be
        conducted away from the sorbent charging. The cooling
        apparatuses can be used for cooling and keeping warm foods in
        thermally insulated boxes. </p>
      <p>The sorption cooling system known from EP 0 368 111 consists of
        a portable cooling unit and a stationary charging station, which
        can be separated from it. The cooling unit consists of an
        adsorption container, filled with a solid sorbent, and an
        evaporator, which contains a liquid working agent and a heat
        exchanger embedded therein. The evaporator and the adsorption
        container are connected to one another via a vapor conduit,
        which can be sealed off. Liquid media, which are cooled by the
        temperature-regulated opening and closing of the sealing-off
        device to the desired temperature level, flow through a heat
        exchanger embedded in the evaporator. After the adsorption agent
        is saturated with the working agent, it can be heated in a
        charging station. The working agent vapor thus flowing off is
        reliquified in the evaporator. The condensation heat is thereby
        conducted off through cooling water, which must flow through the
        embedded heat exchanger. The sorption cooling system is
        expensive to produce because of the embedded heat exchanger and
        the temperature regulation and too complicated to be used
        practically by the untrained layperson. </p>
      <p>The goal of the invention is to provide a more easily handled
        and cheaper apparatus in comparison to the state of the art. </p>
      <p>The goal is attained by the characterizing features of the
        independent claims. The dependent claims indicate other
        inventive method steps and apparatuses. </p>
      <p>A sorption apparatus in accordance with the invention
        accordingly contains a sorbent within a sorbent container, a
        vapor conduit, which can be sealed off, and a liquid working
        agent within an evaporator. The evaporator is in good thermal
        contact with a liquid, which is held in a container. The
        components are firmly connected to one another and remain this
        way even during all of the processing steps. </p>
      <p>During the regeneration phase, the sorbent is heated and the
        working agent vapor desorbed. It flows through the sealable
        vapor conduit to the evaporator and condenses out there. The
        condensation heat is absorbed by the liquid in the container
        with an increase in temperature. At the end of the regeneration,
        the supply of heat to the sorbent is interrupted. The desorption
        of additional working agent vapor ends in this way. The desorbed
        working agent is found in liquid form in the evaporator. The
        vapor conduit is sealed off. The sorbent cools to ambient
        temperature by the release of heat via the walls of the sorbent
        container. </p>
      <p>To introduce the cooling phase, the sealed-off vapor conduit is
        opened. The working agent vapor can then flow from the
        evaporator into the sorbent container and be exothermally
        absorbed by the sorbent. The evaporating working agent quantity
        in the evaporator and the liquid surrounding it are cooled. In
        order to produce the maximum amount of cooling in a short time,
        the sorbent must be actively cooled. A particularly intensive
        cooling effect is attained if the absorption container is
        surrounded by a sufficiently large water mass which absorbs the
        sorption heat, or a smaller quantity of water can evaporate with
        the absorption of heat by the sorbent container wall.
        Advantageously, the container walls should be cooled to
        temperatures of less than 50.degree. C. Then sufficiently low
        temperatures are possible in the evaporator. </p>
      <p>Only the liquid volume that is found around and below the
        evaporator is cooled, in accordance with the invention. The
        upper liquid volume remains close to the starting temperature
        because of the lower density and the lower heat conduction of
        liquids. By suitably positioning and shaping the evaporator, the
        liquid volume to be cooled can be preselected. In actual
        practice, a more rapid cooling of the lower liquid quantity,
        which is then removed first, is attained in this way. The upper
        liquid quantity is first cooled, when it drops into the area of
        the evaporator, by tapping the cooled quantity. </p>
      <p>In general, the container is cleaned before it is refilled. For
        this purpose, cleaning and rinsing liquid is conducted into the
        container and, as a rule, again drained when the container is
        tilted. The evaporator is shaped in such a way that the
        container can be emptied in all cleaning processes without
        problem and without leaving behind any rinsing agent residue.
        The evaporator walls, which are in contact with the liquid, are
        smooth and without retention indentations. Lens-shaped and
        cylindrical configurations have proved useful. </p>
      <p>The interior space of the evaporator should be shaped in such a
        way that the aqueous filling, which is removed by evaporation,
        wets the entire surface of the wall for as long as possible, so
        as to utilize the entire heat exchanger surface. In accordance
        with the invention, retention devices, such as hygroscopic
        surface coatings or bowl-shaped components are used for this
        purpose. </p>
      <p>The use of zeolite/water as the adsorption substance is
        particularly advantageous. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral,
        which consists of a regular framework structure of silicon and
        aluminum oxides. This framework structure contains small
        cavities, in which water molecules can be adsorbed with the
        release of heat. Within the framework structure, the water
        molecules are exposed to strong field forces which liquefy the
        molecules in the lattice and bind them in a phase similar to a
        liquid. The strength of the binding forces acting on the water
        molecules is dependent on the water quantity already contained
        in the framework structure and the temperature of the zeolite.
        For practical use, up to 25 g water can be adsorbed per 100 g
        zeolite. The cooling volume which can be produced is thereby
        sufficient to cool 1 L water 14K. Zeolites are solid substances
        without a disturbing heat expansion in the sorption or
        desorption reaction. The framework structure is freely
        accessible for the water vapor molecules from all sides. The
        apparatuses can therefore be used in any position. </p>
      <p>The use of water as the working agent permits the reduction of
        the required regulation expenditure to a minimum. Upon
        evaporating water under a vacuum, the water surface cools to
        0.degree. C. and freezes to ice with continued evaporation. This
        ice layer grows rapidly until the pressure decline, which occurs
        due to the ice layer, stops the growth. The ice layer can be
        used advantageously to regulate the liquid temperature. With a
        low heat supply, the ice layer grows until a very large supply
        of heat melts it. By the natural formation of ice, the heat
        transfer from the liquid to the evaporator is reduced, so that
        the liquid does not cool below 0.degree. C. and usually, remains
        at 4-5.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Substances that lower the freezing point can also be admixed to
        the aqueous evaporator content if the tapping temperature of the
        liquid is to be lowered below 4.degree. C. or an icing over of
        the evaporator filling is to be prevented. </p>
      <p>Other sorbent pairings, however, can also be used, in which the
        sorbent is solid and also remains solid during the sorption
        reaction. Solid sorbents have low thermal conductivity and poor
        heat transfer. Since the heat transfer of gaseous media (air,
        waste gases) to the sorbent container lies within the same order
        of magnitude, heat exchangers without ribs, such as plates,
        tubes, or even corrugated tubing, are recommended, in principle.
        Some solid sorbents, such as zeolites, are also stable enough to
        compensate for outside excess pressures on thin-walled heat
        exchanger surfaces. Additional reinforcements or thick-walled
        heat exchanger surfaces are therefore unnecessary. Since with
        the use of water as the working agent the sorption apparatus is
        under vacuum and no gases should penetrate into the system
        during the entire period of functioning, the known vacuum-tight
        components are to be preferred for the sealing-off device. For
        manual actuation, ducts which are sealed off by means of metal
        bellows have proven particularly useful. </p>
      <p>The absorption container which is being heated during the
        exothermal absorption reaction should be thermally decoupled
        from the container, so as to avoid a reheating of the liquid.
        Advantageously, the sorbent container can be placed below the
        container or above the container. In the first case, it can be
        cooled by immersion into a basin filled with water, and for the
        regeneration, it can be placed on an electrically heated heating
        plate. In the second case, warm air rising from the absorption
        container cannot sweep the container and reheat the already
        cooled liquid. </p>
      <p>For an economical mode of operation, sorbent temperatures of
        200-300.degree. C. are recommended during the regeneration and
        of 40-80.degree. C. during the absorption. Since zeolite
        granules especially have low thermal conductivity, the
        absorption container must be laid out in such a way that the
        heat conduction path for the reacted heat quantities does not
        exceed about 3 cm. All apparatuses which attain the required
        temperature level and do not unnecessarily heat the liquid in
        the container are suitable as heat sources for the regeneration.
        Electrically heated plates or cartridges, which are adapted to
        the configuration of the sorbent containers are advantageous.
        The heating can, for example, also be arranged for several
        liquid coolers in one pallet, so as to utilize
        production-influenced storage times for the regeneration after
        the filling of the containers. Heating apparatuses which heat
        the sorbent charging via radiant or inductive heat (eddy
        currents) are also advantageous. Of course, it is also possible
        to permanently connect the heating device with the absorption
        container and also to leave the device on it when transporting a
        portable liquid cooler. </p>
      <p>It may also be advantageous to optimize the configuration of
        the sorbent container for the release of heat during the
        absorption phase. In the case of the release of heat to the
        surrounding air, large, flow-conducive heat exchanger surfaces
        are preferred, whereas in the case of evaporative or water
        cooling, holding basins or water-storing surface coverings (for
        example, paper banderoles with advertisements). </p>
      <p>No special demands are made on the size and configuration of
        the containers. Thus, all containers common at present (for
        example, vats, containers, cans, open containers, foil sacks,
        multilayer packagings, plastic containers, canisters, hobbocks,
        bottles, jugs, and so forth) which are suitable for flowable
        filling materials can be used, as long as the sorption apparatus
        can be coupled for proper operation. </p>
      <p>Three liquid coolers in accordance with the invention are
        depicted in the drawing. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In all three figures, a liquid cooler 1, in accordance with the
        invention, is shown combined with beverage containers. In the
        lower outlet of the containers 3, there are taps 2, through
        which the cooled beverages 4 in the containers 3 can be removed.
        The containers 3 have a fitting 5 in the upper area, with an
        ascending tube 6 extending to the bottom of the container. The
        beverage container is cleaned and filled, according to known
        methods, via the fitting 5 and the ascending tube 6, without the
        sorption apparatus requiring any special attention. Thermal
        insulation 7, which prevents reheating of the cooled beverages,
        is applied to the bottoms of the containers 3. The evaporators
        8, with aqueous working agents 15, are located in the containers
        3. A sealable vapor conduit 9 leads from the containers to the
        sorbent containers 10, which are located outside the containers
        3 and which are filled with granulated zeolite-sorbent 14. Each
        of the sealable vapor conduits 9 contains a metal bellows 11,
        through which a manually actuatable connecting rod 12 can open
        and close a valve disk 13 at the end of the vapor conduit 9 in
        the evaporator 8. The connecting rod 12 is thereby adjusted in
        such a way that with a nondeflected metal bellows 11, the valve
        disk 13 is drawn onto the opening of the vapor conduit 9. A
        backflow of water vapor from the evaporator 8 into the sorbent
        container 10 is stopped until the metal bellows 11 is deflected
        and the valve disk 13 is lifted. During the regeneration phase,
        in which water vapor flows back into the evaporator 8, the valve
        disk 13 automatically clears the path for the vapor flow. </p>
      <p>The liquid cooler 1, according to FIG. 1, contains a
        lens-shaped evaporator 8 in the lower third of the container 3.
        The evaporator 8 is filled to approximately the halfway point
        with water (liquid working agent 15). A penetration site 28 is
        formed in the middle of the evaporator, through which the
        ascending tube 6 extends to the bottom of the container. The
        penetration site 28 permits sufficient distance to the ascending
        tube 6 to ensure a sufficient flow of rinsing agent during the
        cleaning process. Stabilization and heat conduction ribs 16 made
        of copper are placed in the evaporator 8 against the excess
        pressure of the beverage 4. Through heat conduction, the upper
        evaporator half which is not wetted with water is also cooled.
        In this way, the entire evaporator surface is available as a
        cooling surface for the beverage 4. This is cooled only below
        and lateral to the evaporator 8 during the cooling phase. The
        upper liquid of the container remains uncooled until it drops
        into the area of the evaporator 8 by tapping the cooled liquid
        above the tap 2. On the side facing the container, the
        absorption container 10 has a hollow 17 filled with water. This
        quantity of water can conduct the absorbed heat away from the
        sorbent 14. The underside of the sorbent container 10 has a
        surrounding recess 18, with which the liquid cooler 1 can be
        placed in the upper bung ring 19 of a second container when they
        are stacked. </p>
      <p>The liquid cooler 1 according to FIG. 2 differs from the cooler
        according to FIG. 1 only in the setup of the evaporator 8. This
        is integrated here annularly into the lower container wall. This
        evaporator form can also have additional heat conduction ribs.
        In comparison to the version from FIG. 1, this model can be
        cleaned in a simpler manner. A heating plate 20 is shown, in
        sectional representation also, with electric heating elements
        21, below the absorption container 10. The liquid cooler 1 is
        placed on it for the regeneration and the sorbent 14 is heated.
      </p>
      <p>The liquid cooler 1 according to FIG. 3 has an absorption
        container 10 located above the container 3. This is situated
        annularly around the fitting 5 and provided with annular
        retention devices 22. A heating hood 23, also equipped with
        electrical heating elements 21 and an insulation cover 24, is
        stuck into these retention devices during the regeneration
        phase. The sorbent 14 can be quickly heated by means of this
        configuration, since at the same time, the heat conduction path
        within the sorbent container 10 is shortened by the retention
        devices 22. During the absorption process, the retention devices
        22 are filled with water. This water and additional water, which
        arrives at a banderole 30, wrapped around the sorbent container
        10, removes the absorbed heat by evaporation. </p>
      <p>The evaporator 8 has a cylindrical form and is situated
        vertically in the middle of the container. The ascending tube 6
        is in sections and in the lower region it is also part of the
        cover of the evaporator. In the upper part, the ascending tube 6
        can be stuck on the evaporator via a sealing element 26. In this
        evaporator version, the beverage 4 is thus additionally cooled
        while it flows through the ascending tube 6 if it is tapped via
        the ascending tube 6 and the fitting 5. The evaporator 8 itself
        contains copper pans 25 in the interior area, in which the
        aqueous working agent 15 is distributed over the entire
        evaporation cover. A flow path for the water vapor is left free
        between the lower ascending tube part and the copper pans 25. </p>
      <p>The liquid cooler 1 shown in FIG. 3 also includes a suction
        conduit 27 that empties into the evaporator 8. The suction
        conduit 27 is normally closed but is opened to evacuate the
        sorbent container 10 through the conduit when required. </p>
      <p>All evaporator and sorbent container models shown in the
        drawings can be combined with one another and can be used on all
        cleaning and filling units in current use. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, the liquid coolers 1 are
        regenerated by applying the heating devices after refilling with
        beverages. The water vapor desorbed during the heating of the
        sorbent 14 flows through the opening valve disk 13 into the
        evaporator 8 and condenses on the walls. The beverages absorb
        the condensation heat and are heated. The heating is
        approximately as great as the subsequent cooling--that is, as a
        rule, about 20-25 K. Beer, for example, is drawn off at
        relatively low temperatures of 4-5.degree. C. The subsequent
        heating by the regeneration process therefore corresponds to the
        heating to the ambient temperature, which follows in any case. </p>
      <p>To start the sorption process, the connecting rod 12 is
        deflected and fixed. Water vapor flows from the evaporator 8 to
        the sorbent charging 14. The beverages cool off on the outside
        surfaces of the evaporator. The cooling rates of the beverage 4
        are about 1 K/min--that is, approximately 20 min after the
        opening of the valve disk 13, the first beverage can be tapped
        at about 5.degree. C. The entire beverage contents, cooled, can
        be tapped within 2 h. </p>
