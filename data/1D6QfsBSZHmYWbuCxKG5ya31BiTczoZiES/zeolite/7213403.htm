      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This application claims priority from Application No. DE
        103 03 292.4, filed on Jan. 28, 2003. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention relates to a cooling container
        with an adsorption cooling apparatus and a method for the
        operation thereof. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Adsorption devices are apparatuses in which a solid
        sorbent material sorbs a second material, the working fluid,
        that boils at a lower temperature in the form of steam while
        liberating heat (sorption phase). In the course of this process,
        the working fluid evaporates in an evaporator while absorbing
        heat. After the sorbent material is saturated, it can be
        desorbed by means of heat input (desorption phase). In the
        course of this process, the working fluid evaporates from the
        adsorbing agent. The working fluid steam can be recondensed and
        can subsequently evaporate again in the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0004] Adsorption apparatuses for cooling with solid sorbent
        materials are known from EP 0 368 111 and from DE-OS 34 25 419.
        Sorber containers filled with sorbent materials draw off the
        working fluid steam which develops in an evaporator and sorb it
        while liberating heat. This heat of sorption must be eliminated
        from the sorbent materials with which the sorber container is
        filled. The cooling apparatuses can be used for cooling food and
        for keeping it warm in thermally insulated boxes. </p>
      <p>[0005] The sorption cooling system known from EP 0 368 111
        comprises a portable cooling unit and a stationary charging
        station that can be separated from said cooling unit. The
        cooling unit comprises a sorption container filled with a solid
        sorbent material and an evaporator which contains a liquid
        working material and a heat exchanger that is embedded therein.
        The evaporator and the sorption container are connected to each
        other by means of a steam line that can be shut off. Liquid
        media which are cooled to the temperature level desired by the
        temperature-controlled opening and shutting off of the shut-off
        device flow through a heat exchanger that is embedded in the
        evaporator. Once the sorbent material is saturated with the
        working fluid, it can be heated in the charging station. The
        steam draining from the working fluid is recondensed in the
        evaporator. The heat of condensation is dissipated by cooling
        water which must flow through the embedded heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>[0006] The problem to be solved by the present invention is to
        make available a cooling container with an adsorption cooling
        apparatus which cools the container content over a relatively
        long period of time to a low temperature level without an
        external energy source and the cooling energy of which can be
        charged at a later time and can subsequently be stored without
        loss for a random length of time. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0007] The adsorption cooling apparatus according to the
        present invention thus comprises a sorbent material inside a
        sorber container, a valve, and a liquid working material inside
        the evaporator. During the desorption phase, heat is added to
        the sorbent material and abstracted during the sorption phase.
        During the sorption phase, heat of evaporation is added to the
        working fluid and during the desorption phase, heat of
        condensation is abstracted. The quantities of heat are
        transferred to air streams which are transported by means of
        electrically operated blowers across appropriately designed
        heated surfaces. </p>
      <p>[0008] During the desorption phase, working fluid steam is
        desorbed. This steam flows through the opened or self-opening
        valve to the evaporator where it condenses out. The transported
        quantities of air should be large enough to ensure that the heat
        of condensation can be carried off at a relatively low
        temperature level. At the end of this phase, the heat input into
        the sorbent material is stopped. The desorption of additional
        working fluid steam ends. Closing the valve prevents the working
        fluid steam from flowing back. The desorbed working fluid is
        subsequently present in liquid form in the evaporator. In this
        ready-to-use state, the adsorption cooling apparatus can be
        stored for a random length of time. </p>
      <p>[0009] It is useful to line the sorber container with a
        temperature-stable thermal insulation so as to minimize heat
        losses to the environment during the desorption process. </p>
      <p>[0010] To initiate the adsorption phase, the valve is opened.
        Working fluid steam can now flow from the evaporator into the
        sorber container and be exothermally sorbed by the sorbent
        material. Because of the evaporation of a partial quantity, the
        quantity of working fluid in the evaporator as well as the air
        stream passing the heat exchanger are cooled. To generate the
        maximum cooling energy, the sorbent material must be able to
        dissipate its heat of sorption in a heat exchanger to the
        environment. An especially intensive cooling effect is obtained
        when the sorber container has a sufficiently large heat
        exchanger surface for the air stream that circulates around said
        sorber container. It is useful if the sorbent material can be
        cooled to ambient temperatures so as to be able to evaporate the
        maximum quantity of the working fluid at sufficiently low
        temperatures of evaporation. </p>
      <p>[0011] The sorbent material used according to the present
        invention is zeolite. Per kilogram of zeolite, an adsorption
        cooling apparatus can store refrigeration energy corresponding
        to approximately 130 watt-hours without losses and over a random
        length of time. After the valve is opened, this cooling energy
        is immediately available. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral which
        has a regular lattice structure of silicon and aluminum oxides.
        This lattice structure contains cavities in which water
        molecules can be sorbed while releasing heat. Within the lattice
        structure, the water molecules are exposed to strong field
        forces, the strength of which depends on the quantity of water
        already contained in the lattice structure and on the
        temperature of the zeolite. For practical applications, up to 25
        grams of water per 100 grams of zeolite can be sorbed. Zeolites
        are solid materials without interfering heat expansion during
        the sorption and desorption reaction. The lattice structure is
        openly accessible on all sides for water vapor molecules.
        Therefore, adsorption devices can be used in any situation. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is, however, also possible to use other sorbent
        material combinations in which the sorbent material is solid and
        remains solid during the sorption reaction. Solid sorbent
        materials, however, are marked by a low thermal conduction and
        an unsatisfactory heat transfer. Since the heat transfer from an
        air stream to the sorbent material heat exchanger is also in
        approximately the same order of magnitude, it is recommended
        that heat exchangers without ribs, for example, cylindrical,
        plate or tubular geometries, be used. Since especially zeolite
        granules have a low thermal conductivity, the sorber containers
        should be designed to ensure that the average thermal conduction
        path for the quantities of heat transformed does not exceed 2
        cm. </p>
      <p>[0013] A few solid sorbent materials, such as zeolite, are
        sufficiently stable to support excessive external pressures
        without a change in volume even if the container walls are thin.
        Additional reinforcements or heat exchanger surfaces with thick
        walls are therefore not needed. Since the sorption device is
        under a vacuum when water is used as the working fluid and since
        no gases should enter the system during its operating time,
        vacuum sealed components should be used. For manual actuation of
        the valve, lead-throughs that are sealed by means of metal
        bellows have proven to be useful. </p>
      <p>[0014] For an efficient operation, zeolite temperatures of
        250.degree. C. to 350.degree. C. for the regeneration phase and
        30.degree. C. to 50.degree. C. for the sorption phase are
        recommended. It is of special advantage if the regeneration is
        carried out by means of a hot air stream at air temperatures
        higher than 300.degree. C. If the zeolite filling is present in
        a thin layer, the regeneration can be concluded within one hour.
        Care should be taken to ensure that the condensation
        temperatures remain under 100.degree. C. by ensuring that a
        sufficient air stream circulates around the evaporator. At
        higher temperatures, the vapor pressure inside the container
        would be higher than the air pressure outside, which would
        necessarily cause container structures with thin walls to be
        inflated. </p>
      <p>[0015] The use of water as the working fluid makes it possible
        to reduce the control mechanism design to a minimum. On
        evaporation of water under a vacuum, the surface of the water
        cools down to 0.degree. C. and freezes to form ice as the
        evaporation continues. The layer of ice can be advantageously
        used to control the air temperature. When only a small quantity
        of heat is emitted from the air stream, the layer of ice
        increases, if the quantity of heat emitted is high, the layer of
        ice melts. If the boiling temperature of the liquid is to be
        lowered to below 0.degree. C., it is also possible to mix
        substances that lower the freezing point to the aqueous working
        liquid. </p>
      <p>[0016] The adsorption cooling apparatus is especially suitable
        for mobile use for which no external energy supply is available.
        According to the present invention, the energy required to
        operate the blower is stored in an accumulator. During the
        desorption phase, this accumulator can be recharged by means of
        a charging device. To save electrical energy, the blowers are
        only operated when the cooling temperature desired inside the
        cooling container has been exceeded. Once the cooling
        temperature has been reached or falls below the desired cooling
        temperature, the blower which blows air over the sorber
        container is also turned off. </p>
      <p>[0017] The temperatures of the air streams exiting from the
        evaporator heat exchanger can be controlled by means of known
        methods via a throttling function of the valve. </p>
      <p>[0018] According to the present invention, the air temperature
        can also be controlled independently of the throttle function.
        For example, to lower the exit temperature of the air stream
        exiting from the evaporator, the air stream through the sorption
        heat exchanger can be increased. Since the thermodynamic
        equilibrium is invariably established when the valve is open, a
        decrease of the sorbent fluid temperature will entail a decrease
        of the temperature of evaporation. The air stream exiting from
        the evaporator therefore necessarily turns colder. </p>
      <p>[0019] It is also useful to design the valve as a check valve.
        In this case, the regeneration can even be carried out when the
        valve is closed. To condense in the evaporator, the working
        fluid steam flowing off the sorbent material automatically opens
        the check valve. Since the valve does not need to be opened for
        the desorption phase, it also does not need to be actively
        closed at the end of the regeneration phase. This a considerable
        advantage ensures accurate and simple handling. </p>
      <p>[0020] A preferred form of the adsorption cooling apparatus
        according to the present invention, as well as other
        embodiments, objects, features and advantages of this invention
        will be apparent from the following detailed description of
        illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in
        conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p>[0021] The drawing in <b>FIG. 1</b> shows a diagrammatic
        sectional view of a cooling container with an adsorption cooling
        apparatus according to the present invention. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0022] On the ceiling of the inside of a traveling insulated
        cooling container 1, an evaporator 2 is located, which
        evaporator is connected to a sorber container 5 via a working
        fluid steam line 3 and a check valve 4. Both sorber container 5
        and evaporator 2 are plate like heat exchanger configurations.
        The sorber heat exchanger comprises three plates 6 which contain
        the sorbent material zeolite 7. The zeolite filling is
        introduced in the form of prefabricated molded plates into which
        the distribution structure required for the flow of the working
        fluid steam is incorporated. Between plates 6, two electrical
        heating elements 8 are located, via which the air gap between
        plates 6 and thus plates 6 as such can be heated. Sorber
        container 5 is enclosed in a thermally insulated flow cabinet 9
        through which a sorber blower 10 transports ambient air after
        the desorption phase and, at times, during the sorption phase.
        Sorber blower 10 as well as an evaporator blower 12 are fed by
        an accumulator 11 during the sorption phase. During the sorption
        phase, evaporator blower 12 circulates the air to be cooled
        inside cooling container 1 along the paths marked by arrows over
        evaporator 2 which is screened against the internal chamber by
        means of an air baffle plate 14. A temperature sensor 15
        controls the temperature of the internal chamber. Evaporator 2
        is constructed of two flat profile plates 13 in the inside
        chamber of which supporting elements and a non-woven fabric that
        distributes the working fluid, water, ensure that the profile
        plates 13 do not implode and that the working fluid can
        evaporate evenly. A safety device 17 signals to a control (not
        shown) whether door 18 is open or closed. </p>
      <p>[0023] The operation of the cooling container can be divided
        into a desorption phase and a sorption phase. </p>
      <p>[0024] During the desorption phase, the two electrical heating
        elements 8 are operating. As the zeolite temperatures increase,
        more and more water vapor evaporates from zeolite 7. The
        increasing vapor pressure opens check valve 4, and the working
        fluid steam enters evaporator 2 where it condenses. The heat of
        condensation is dissipated to the air stream which is
        transported by evaporator blower 12 over profile plates 13. To
        ensure that the temperature inside the cooling container does
        not increase too much, door 18 of the container must be open
        during the desorption phase. This is controlled by safety device
        17. If the door is closed and temperature sensor 15 senses that
        the temperature in the container has exceeded an upper threshold
        value, electrical heating elements 8 are safety-disconnected or
        turned off. During the desorption phase, cooling container 1 is
        connected to the stationary power supply via which electrical
        heating elements 8 are supplied. At the same time, accumulator
        11 is charged. At the end of the desorption phase, heating of
        the zeolite filling is stopped and sorber blower 10 is turned
        on. As a result, sorber container 5 cools down to ambient
        temperature. But steam from evaporator 2 cannot flow back
        through the automatically closed check valve 4. </p>
      <p>[0025] Only in the sorption phase can this steam flow back when
        valve 4 is opened by valve actuating element 16. Now evaporator
        2 cools down since the working fluid, water, evaporates. The
        steam flows into sorber container 5 where it is sorbed by
        zeolite 7 while releasing heat. This heat of sorption is
        dissipated into the ambient air by sorber blower 10. Since
        during the sorption phase, cooling container 1 is generally not
        connected to the electrical power system, both sorber blower 10
        and evaporator blower 12 are operated via accumulator 11. To
        save electrical energy, both sorber blower 10 and evaporator
        blower 12 are stopped as soon as temperature sensor 15 senses
        that the internal temperature in the cooling container has
        fallen below the preset temperature in the cooling chamber.
        Thus, it is ensured that especially at the beginning of the
        cooling phase during which cooling container 5 often must also
        be preliminarily cooled, the maximum cooling energy is
        available. Check valve 4 can remain open until cooling container
        1 is again connected to the electrical power supply so that it
        can be recharged. </p>
      <p>[0026] Although the illustrative embodiments of the present
        invention have been described herein with reference to the
        accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention
        is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various
        other changes and modifications may be effected therein by one
        skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of
        the invention. </p>
