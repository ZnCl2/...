        <p><b><font size="+1">Manually Operable Vacuum Pump</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>27 February 1996</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A manually operable vacuum pump having a housing including
        first and second pump chambers whose volume is altered by
        movement of a displaceable piston which is moved by means of a
        piston rod attached thereto and fed through one of the first and
        second pump chambers. The first and second pump chambers are
        configured such that gas which is fed into the vacuum pump is
        compressed in two steps, primarily in the first pump chamber and
        secondarily in the second pump chamber to provide a suitable
        endvacuum. Thereafter, the gas is expelled from the second pump
        chamber through the second end cap. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to vacuum pumps, and more
        particularly relates to vacuum pumps for removing air from
        relatively small containers. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Electrically driven vacuum pumps are known in the prior art.
        However, these vacuum pumps tend to be relatively expensive and
        are not capable of operation without a source of electric power.
        In addition to electric vacuum pumps, manually operable (i.e.
        manually driven) vacuum pumps are known, specifically for
        laboratory use. Manually operable vacuum pumps commonly utilize
        a single step process to achieve a suitable endvacuum.
        Typically, the manually operable vacuum pumps produce an
        endvacuum of approximately 0.3 Psi absolute. </p>
      <p>German patent number DE 4,138,114 discloses a sorption cooling
        system including sorption medium which, under vacuum conditions,
        adsorbs steam from a water reservoir. As a result of the
        adsorption of steam, the liquid which remains in the water
        reservoir cools and may even solidify to form ice. Typically, in
        order for the water to cool to 0.degree. C. and solidify, a
        vacuum pressure of approximately 0.08 Psi should be present
        within the sorption cooling system. Ideally, a manually operable
        vacuum pump should easily and quickly provide a suitable vacuum
        pressure throughout the entire sorption cooling system. However,
        presently known manually driven vacuum systems are incapable of
        easily and efficiently removing air from a connected sorption
        cooling system or other device. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object to the present invention to provide a manually
        operable vacuum pump which is inexpensive, simple to use, easily
        transportable and is capable of providing an endvacuum of
        approximately 0.08 Psi. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        manually operable vacuum pump which overcomes the inherent
        disadvantages of known manually operable vacuum pumps. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, a
        manually operable vacuum pump preferably includes a housing
        having first and second pump chambers. The housing includes
        walls which have interior and exterior surfaces wherein the
        interior surface of the housing walls at least partially define
        the first and second vacuum pump chambers. The first and second
        vacuum pump chambers are also respectively defined by first and
        second end caps and a displaceable piston which is contained
        within the housing. The first and second pump chambers define
        first and second chamber volumes respectively. </p>
      <p>The first chamber volume of the first pump chamber and the
        second chamber volume of the second pump chamber may be altered
        in accordance with movement of the displaceable piston. The
        displaceable piston is coupled to a piston rod which is fed
        through the first or second pump chamber and the first or second
        end cap. </p>
      <p>The position of the displaceable piston is altered by moving
        the piston rod which is coupled thereto. The first pump chamber
        is preferably in selectable fluid communication with the second
        pump chamber such that gas that is provided to the vacuum pump
        is compressed in two stages, primarily in the first pump chamber
        and secondarily in the second pump chamber to provide a suitable
        endvacuum. Therefore, the gas is expelled from the second pump
        chamber through the second end cap. </p>
      <p>A preferred form of the manually operable vacuum pump and
        method for utilizing the same, as well as other embodiments,
        objects, features and advantages of this invention, will be
        apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative
        embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the
        accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 1A and 1B of the drawings, a manually
        operable vacuum pump constructed in accordance with the present
        invention will now be described. The vacuum pump of the present
        invention is designed such that a two-step compression process
        is employed so as to provide a desired end pressure of the
        vacuum pump. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, vacuum pump 20
        includes a pump housing 19 having a generally cylindrical pipe 1
        with a substantially hollow interior region. Piston 2 is
        slideably mounted within the interior region of the cylindrical
        pipe. Coupled to the piston 2 is a piston rod 3 which is
        utilized to move the piston throughout the interior region of
        the cylindrical pipe. The pump housing 19 includes first and
        second end caps 5, 4 and first and second 0-rings 7, 6. The
        first and second end caps 5,4 and first and second O-rings 7,6
        are respectively attached to first and second ends 21,22 of the
        cylindrical pipe in a vacuum tight manner so as to substantially
        air-tight seal the interior region of the cylindrical pipe. The
        cylindrical pipe, first end cap and piston define a first pump
        chamber within the interior region of the cylindrical pipe.
        Additionally, the cylindrical pipe, second end cap and piston
        define a second pump chamber within the interior region of the
        cylindrical pipe. The first and second end caps 5,4 preferably
        respectively includes a suction valve 12 and an exhaust valve
        13. The suction valve 12 is preferably a one way valve which
        permits the introduction of gas through the first end cap 5, but
        which substantially prevents the removal of gas from the first
        pump chamber through the first end cap. The exhaust valve 13 is
        also preferably a one-way valve which permits the expulsion of
        gas from the second pump chamber through the second end cap but
        substantially prevents the introduction of gas into the second
        pump chamber through the second end cap. </p>
      <p>As previously mentioned the piston 2 of the vacuum pump
        substantially divides the interior region of the vacuum pump
        defined by the cylindrical pipe and first and second end caps
        into first and second pump chambers 23,24 having respective
        first and second pump chamber volumes. The first and second pump
        chamber volumes are preferably in selectable fluid communication
        with each other. The piston 2 utilized in the present invention
        preferably includes an O-ring 8, first sealing face 9, second
        sealing face 10 and bore 11. As previously mentioned, as piston
        2 is slideably moved by piston rod 3, the first and second pump
        chamber volumes are altered. Referring specifically to FIG. 1A,
        as piston rod 3 is moved in the direction indicated by arrow A
        (i.e. toward the second end cap of the vacuum pump), the volume
        of the first chamber 23 increases in size while, simultaneously,
        the volume of the second chamber 24 decreases. Likewise,
        referring to FIG. 1B, as piston rod 3 is moved in the direction
        indicated by arrow B, the volume of the first chamber 23
        decreases while, simultaneously, the volume of the second
        chamber 24 increases. </p>
      <p>The piston rod 3 is preferably slideably mounted through first
        end cap 5 such that an end 3a of the piston rod, which is
        unattached to the piston, remains outside the interior region of
        the vacuum pump. Coupled to the end 3a of the piston rod is a
        handle 17 for assisting in the manipulation of the position of
        the piston within the interior region of the vacuum pump.
        Alternatively, a foot pedal can be substituted for the handle so
        that the piston can be manipulated by movements of a user's
        foot. The piston rod 3 is preferably air-tight slideably mounted
        to the first end cap 5 by means of O-ring 16 which is contained
        within the first end cap 5 and which contacts the piston rod 3.
      </p>
      <p>The vacuum pump of the present invention is configured such
        that when the piston 2 is moved in the direction indicated by
        arrow A as shown in FIG. 1A, the O-ring 8 engages the first
        sealing face 9 so as to substantially eliminate fluid
        communication between the first and second pump chambers 23,24.
        However, when the piston 2 is moved in the direction indicated
        by arrow B as shown in FIG. 1B, O-ring 8 is separated from the
        first sealing face 9. This is preferably caused by friction
        between the O-ring 8 and the interior of cylindrical pipe 1 so
        that the O-ring is pushed onto second sealing face 10. In this
        orientation, fluid communication between the first and second
        pump chambers 23,24 is accomplished via bore 11 through piston
        2. As a result of the above-identified configuration, when the
        volume of the first pump chamber is reduced, gas can exit the
        first pump chamber and enter the second pump chamber. During
        this process wherein gas is provided from the first pump chamber
        to the second pump chamber, the pressure within the first and
        second pump chambers is substantially the same because the
        suction valve 12 in the first end cap and the exhaust valve 13
        in the second end cap are substantially closed. </p>
      <p>When the piston 2 is moved in the direction indicated by arrow
        A as shown in FIG. 1A, the volume of the first pump chamber is
        increased. As a result, suction valve 12 is opened and provides
        gas through suction socket 14 as shown by arrow C of FIG. 1A.
        The suction valve 12 preferably includes a relatively fine air
        filter for removing foreign matter particles from the gas before
        it enters the first pump chamber. As a further result of the
        movement of the piston 2 in the direction indicated by arrow A,
        the gas in the second pump chamber is compressed until a
        sufficient pressure is achieved to open exhaust valve 13 and
        release the gas as indicated by arrow D of FIG. 1A. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1A and 1B, when the displaceable piston 2 is
        moved in the direction indicated by arrow B such that the piston
        is substantially incapable of being moved closer to the first
        end cap, the second chamber volume is traditionally denoted as a
        "chamber volume" (V.sub.o). However, when the displaceable
        piston 2 is moved in the direction indicated by arrow A such
        that the piston is substantially incapable of being moved
        farther away from the first end cap, the second chamber volume
        is traditionally denoted as a "clearance volume" (V.sub.c).
        Stated another way, the second chamber volume is representative
        of the chamber volume (V.sub.o) when the piston is moved to its
        closest position to the first end cap and the second chamber
        volume is representative of the clearance volume (V.sub.c) when
        the piston is moved to its closest position to the second end
        cap. The present invention is specifically designed such that
        the pressure (p.sub.c) in the clearance volume and the pressure
        (p.sub.o) in the chamber volume follow the well-known equation
        p.sub.c V.sub.c =p.sub.o V.sub.o known as the ideal gas law.
        Therefore, if the piston rod is provided into the first pump
        chamber such that the piston is proximate to the second end cap,
        and if the clearance volume pressure p.sub.c is substantially
        atmospheric pressure, the pressure p.sub.c in the clearance
        volume will decrease as the piston is pulled toward the first
        end cap. In order to provide a pressure which is less than 0.08
        Psi in a device that is coupled to suction socket 14, the ratio
        between the clearance volume and the chamber volume needs to be
        given a value which is dependant on the initial pressure.
        Therefore, if p.sub.c is measured to be 14.5 Psi and if p.sub.o
        is desired to be approximately 0.08 Psi, the ratio p.sub.c
        /p.sub.o is 181. As a result, if V.sub.o is measured to be 181
        in.sup. 3, then V.sub.c should be at most 1 in.sup.3. </p>
      <p>As explained above, in order to provide a required or desired
        endpressure, a two step compression of the vacuum pump in
        accordance with the present invention is preferable. In
        accordance with the operation of the invention, piston 2 is
        moved within the pump housing in such a manner that it separates
        the housing into first and second pump chambers such that as the
        position of the piston changes, the volume of respective first
        and second pump chambers are simultaneously varied. During each
        piston stroke (movement as indicated by arrow B shown in FIG.
        1B) gas volume from the first pump chamber is fed into the
        second pump chamber. Therefore, it is advantageous to include a
        flow conduit with a check valve (designated by O-ring 8 and
        sealing surfaces 9,10) integral with the piston. During the
        subsequent return movement of the piston,(movement as indicated
        by arrow A shown in FIG. 1A) the gas in the second chamber is
        compressed and exhausted. Simultaneously gas is provided to the
        first chamber through suction valve 12 from a pre-positioned
        connected container or from the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>As previously described, in order to alter the position of
        piston 2, piston rod 3 is coupled to piston 2 and fed in a
        vacuum tight manner through the first pump chamber and the first
        end cap 5. Preferably, the first end cap is securely coupled to
        the cylindrical pipe. Since the piston does not also operate as
        the first end cap, this configuration has the distinct safety
        advantage such that when the vacuum line of the container is
        vented, the piston is not catapulted out of the cylindrical
        pipe. If the piston was permitted to exit the pump housing and
        the system was vented in a relatively quick manner, the piston
        and piston rod could possibly be ejected from the housing which
        could result in injuries to an operator or bystander. In
        addition, if the piston rod was fed through the second chamber,
        the piston together with the piston rod would be forcibly pushed
        out of the housing during venting of the vacuum which could also
        result in a dangerous situation. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the operation of the present invention,
        since the first pump chamber has a lower pressure then the
        second pump chamber, particular care must be taken to
        hermetically seal the piston rod in the chamber housing. This is
        advantageously done with sealing elements, known in the art, in
        particular, gas pressure springs. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, a
        particularly efficient structure of vacuum pump is provided
        wherein easy action check valves are installed at the input as
        well as the output of the pump. These check valves are
        specifically intake valve 12 and exhaust valve 13. Care should
        be taken that the least amount of clearance volume is required
        for opening the valves. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous if the exhaust valve 13 of the
        vacuum pump is capable to couple to pressure hoses for
        connecting to a variety of devices. Therefore, the vacuum pump
        can also be used as a pressure pump. Specifically, the vacuum
        pump can be utilized during recreation activities such as
        camping as an air pump for filling rafts, balls and bicycle
        wheels. In view of this expanded range of use of the vacuum pump
        of the present invention, any increased expense in manufacturing
        the pump is justified as compared to that of conventional
        pressure pumps. </p>
      <p>It is advantageous to equip the suction opening (intake valve
        12) of the first chamber with a fine air filter 15 which can be
        easily cleaned. This fine air filter prevents the introduction
        of particles into the vacuum pump which would clog the valves
        and aggravate the frictionless operation of the piston. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention and as described, the
        piston is equipped with a valve which connects the first pump
        chamber to the second pump chamber. Here too, check valves may
        be used. It is advantageous to utilize an O-ring, which releases
        or closes the flow path depending on the direction of movement
        of the piston. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, the piston diameter
        is preferably not larger than 50 mm. Since the manually operated
        vacuum pump must overcome a relatively high differential
        pressure, but at the same time provide a force which is not too
        high for operation by the user. However, the suction volume of
        the pump should be relatively high so as to sufficiently and
        quickly remove gas from the container being evacuated with the
        least amount of actuations. It is therefore advantageous to
        actuate the pump in accordance with the invention by foot
        because a greater amount of force is provided and therefore, a
        larger cross section of the piston can be used. As a result with
        the same suction volume, the piston stroke can be reduced. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, the vacuum pump can
        be utilized for evacuation of sorption systems wherein gases are
        removed by the vacuum pump so that water may be easily brought
        to evaporation in a vacuum. Suitable sorption systems and
        sorption substance containers and adapters are known from German
        patent applications DE 4,243,816 and DE 4,243,817. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
