              the Innovative Zeolite/Water Adsorption Technology</b></big></p>
      </center>
      <p>Zeo-Tech has developed a new energy conversion process for the
        efficient generation and storage of heat and/or cooling power.
        Driven by a heat source, this process is solely based on the
        material zeolite and water and is therefore fully compatible
        with the most stringent environmental regulations. Up to 160%
        efficient. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Fundamentals of the Zeolite/Water Adsorption
            Technology</font></b> </p>
      <p>The natural mineral Zeolite has the property to attract
        (adsorb) water vapor and to incorporate it in its internal
        crystal lattice while releasing heat at the same time. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="adsorp.gif" height="164" width="780"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If this process proceeds in an evacuated (airless) environment
        the attraction of water by the zeolite is so forceful that the
        internal pressure drops dramatically. The remaining water in an
        attached vessel evaporates, cools down and freezes immediately
        due to the heat of evaporation. The resulting ice can be used
        for cooling and air conditioning while the simultaneously
        produced heat of adsorption within the zeolite tank can be
        utilized for heating. If a valve is included between the two
        vessels, the heat or cold production can be interrupted for any
        periods without loss of energy. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="desorp.gif" height="160" width="762"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The first phase of this process proceeds up to the point when
        the zeolite is saturated with water. The reverse process is
        initiated by heating the zeolite at high temperatures in the
        second phase. The adsorbed water molecules are forced to
        evaporate (desorption). Condensation takes place in the water
        tank (condensor). The sequence of adsorption/desorption
        processes is completely reversible and can be repeated
        indefinitely. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="sankey.gif" height="303" width="850"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A nearly continuous cooling power is accomplished if two or
        more of these sorption devices are operated in a phase-shifted
        manner. The regeneration can be performed with electric energy
        or – preferably from the perspective of primary energy usage –
        with heat from combustion processes or even with solar
        collectors. </p>
      <p>As shown in the figure, the driving energy source is heat (100
        %) which picks up an additional 30 % of net cooling power and
        thus provides a usable net heating power of 130 % as the overall
        result of the conversion cycle. If this system is applied in
        dual use mode for heating as well as cooling in parallel, the
        overall net effect amounts to 160 % of the expended heat input
        (100 %), provided as heat output (130 %) and cooling power (30
        %). </p>
      <p>Even with electrical heating, a sorption system provides
        considerable energy savings and a corresponding reduction of
        carbon dioxide production. <br>
        With other input heat sources the energy saving potential is
        much higher, with corresponding environmental benefits. Even the
        single use mode, utilizing only heating or only cooling power,
        is comparable or better (with respect to energy utilization)
        than any conventional technology. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Zeolite</font></b> </p>
      <p>The name zeolite is a general term for a stonelike material
        which consist of crystalline metal-alumo-silicates with a large
        internal surface area of up to 1000 m²/g, strong electrostatic
        fields in the crystal lattice and with a volumetric density of
        about 0.8 kg/dm³. The word zeolite is of greek origin and means
        – directly translated – »boiling rock« which describes the
        effect which is to be seen if water is poured over dry zeolite.
        In 1925 the process of water and methanol separation using
        zeolites was observed for the first time. And due to this
        separation action (sieve action) the name "molecular sieve" was
        later attributed to zeolites. </p>
      <p>Zeolites are non-poisonous, inflammable, are naturally
        available in abundance and are therefore compatible with the
        environment. More than 40 natural and 100 synthetic zeolites are
        known. </p>
      <p>The most important property of a number of zeolites is their
        ability for reversible adsorption of water. Even after several
        thousand adsorption/desorption cycles the structural changes of
        the crystal latice are insignificant if the process parameters
        pressure and temperature do not exceed certain limits. – The
        application diversity of zeolites is tremendous: they are
        applied as molecular sieves, as adsorbents, as catalyst in
        cracking of hydrocarbons in the pretro-chemical industry, as
        filler component in paper production and as ion exchange
        material in detergents </p>
      <p>Currently the chemical industry produces more than 1.4 million
        tons of synthetic zeolite annually and it can be expected that
        the world wide demand and consequently the production will
        further increase. The price, e.g. for laundry detergent zeolite
        is between 1.00 and 8.00 DM/kg, depending on the type and
        consistency of material delivered. The price for specialized
        zeolites is higher. </p>
      <p>The basic building blocks of zeolites are tetrahedras
        consisting of four oxygen anions and one centrally positioned
        silicon or aluminum cation.Zeolites are classified according to
        the various tetrahedral frameworks formed by these basic
        building blocks. The structure of the synthetic zeolites of
        types A, X and Y which have gained importance in industrial
        processes, are shown in the figure. The aluminum and silicon
        atoms are positioned at the junctions while the oxygen atoms
        form the bridges between the tetrahedras. The difference in
        electro-chemical charges between the aluminum and silicon atoms
        per one aluminum atom results in a non-compensated negative
        charge. The balance is restored by metal cations which occupy
        preferred positions. Because of the strong local electrical
        dipole moment in the lattice framework, zeolites adsorb all
        polar and non-polar molecules that will fit into their specific
        framework. This adsorption process is accompanied by release of
        heat, the »heat of adsorption«. Theoretical and experimental
        studies have determined quantitative heat of adsorption values
        for zeolite based thermal processes. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Ice-Quick Demonstrator</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Ice-Quick is a small device to demonstrate the adsorption
        technology with the sorption pair water/zeolite. It consists of
        a zeolite filled cartridge, connected via an adaptor to a
        plastic cup, which contains some water, and which is evacuated
        by means of a hand-vacuum pump. </p>
      <p>After approx. 10…20 strokes with the hand-vacuum pump the
        inside pressure is reduced below the vapour pressure of the
        water at ambient temperature, and the water start to boil. Air
        gases go out of the water and starts to bubble on the bottom of
        the glass. (The more air is removed out of the system, the
        better the adsorption of water vapour. The vapour above the
        water surface is adsorbed in the cristalline structure of the
        zeolite. As a result, the remaining liquid water cools down.)
        After a few more strokes the water calms down and finally begins
        to freeze. After some time the water is completely frozen: 50 g
        of water at a temperature of 10 °C can be cooled down and frozen
        within 30 sec with 500 g of zeolite. The average specific
        cooling power results to 390 W/kgZeo. </p>
      <p>This process can be repeated 8…10 times with arbitrary
        intervals until the zeolite is saturated. The zeolite has always
        to be cooled down to the ambient in between processes for the
        adsorption to function properly. For desorption (regeneration)
        the zeolite has to be heated up to 250 °C for a short time. When
        the zeolite is cooled down again to 20 °C it is ready for
        further ice production. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Solar Powered Refrigerator</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Developing countries have a great need for cooling of food and
        medical supplies. Refrigerators are very expensive and require a
        electric power source. While reliable electric power supply is
        only available in the industrialized centers of developing
        countries, solar power is available and – especially in the
        southern areas – is reliable. Up to now, solar power has not
        been used for cooling. </p>
      <p>Zeolite/water sorption systems can now provide a reliable and
        economic solution for these cooling needs. </p>
      <p>The equipment consists of a refrigerator (in this case a 55
        liter box-shaped cooler), powered by solar energy, with a
        built-in evaporator, one or more zeolite containers and a
        parabolic, concentrating solar collector, developed by E.G.
        Solar. </p>
      <p>The cooling system is designed such that it can be produced
        locally without need for expensive electrical tools; maintenance
        and repair can be performed locally due to the simple design. </p>
      <p>The investment for the cooling device is much lower than a
        solar driven compressor system of the same size which is powered
        by electric solar cells (costs about DM 3,000.--) </p>
      <p>The solar collector can also be used for cooking. </p>
      <center>
        <hr width="62%">
        <p><b><font size="+1">Standard-Cooling</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Standard-Colling system is used – as described above – for
        the trolleys, for beverage dispensers and for food
        refrigerators. It consists of two adsorbers, one condenser and
        one evaporator (and some addi- tional compenents which are not
        shown in the right figure). </p>
      <p>The two adsorbers with 8 kg zeolite granulate each operate in
        alternating fashion. Via heat exchanger loops the heat available
        after desorption and also the heat produced during adsorption is
        removed. Adsorber and evaporator are coupled by one-way valves
        which are opened or closed depending on the pressure in the two
        vessels. The desorbed water vapour flows to the condenser and
        (after condensation) through a capillary pipe (which also
        contributes to the heat removal) back to the evaporator. The
        water charge in the eva- porator is about 5 ltrs. For
        optimisation of the evaporation the surface area in the
        evaporator is enlarged considerably by constructive means. The
        »cooling power« is transferred by a heat transfer medium pumped
        in a closed cycle through flexible hoses between evaporator and
        the cabinet to be refrigerated, where the cooling effect is
        achieved through a heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Monitoring and control of the system are performed by a
        programmable electronic controller. For a heating power of 6.6
        kW maximum the cooling power of this system, which is available
        as protoype, amounts to about 2.8 kW. This covers a cooling
        temperature range of down to 0 °C. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Characteristics of the zeolite heatpump with integrated
        ice-storage: </p>
      <p>Significant energy savings – referring to the state of the art
        technologies (e.g. condensing boiler): approx. 25 % ; at hot
        water temperatures of 60 to 70 ºC </p>
      <p>Approx. 75 % less heat from the ambient needed compared to an
        electrical heat pump </p>
      <p>Ambient heat can easily be provided, for example with CPC
        collectors also in the autumn and in the winter ; possible
        ambient heat sources are: heat recovery systems </p>
      <p>Flue gas can be cooled down below 0 ºC, therefore a significant
        cleaning of the flue gas due to condensation of harmful
        substances is more easily possible than with conventional
        condensing boilers </p>
      <p>Add-on capability: gas-fired air-conditioner; supply of
        considerable electrical power for the functioning of the
        air-conditioner is not needed </p>
      <p>Zeolite heatpump with integrated ice-storage is very easy to
        maintain and a long system lifetime </p>
      <p>Cost savings due to the use of small ambient heat exchangers </p>
      <p>Zeo-Tech GmbH is going to build and optimise a zeolite heatpump
        with integrated ice-storage for a typical one-family house with
        a rated heating power of approx. 10 kW. </p>
