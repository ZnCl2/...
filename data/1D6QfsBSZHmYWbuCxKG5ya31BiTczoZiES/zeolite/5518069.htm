      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Apparatus and method for storing and providing heat or cold
        whereby during a desorption phase, steam-like operating medium
        is desorbed as a result of a temperature increase of sorption
        medium. The steam-like operating medium condenses in an
        operating medium container. After the desorption phase, an
        additional amount of heat is provided and the liquid operating
        medium as well as the sorption medium are maintained at a
        relatively high temperature. Afterward, the heat is withdrawn
        and the sorption medium is permitted to receive steam-like
        operating medium and release sorption heat. When cold is to be
        generated, the liquid operating medium and the sorption medium
        are permitted to cool off to an ambient temperature and not
        further heated. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to sorption apparatus for heating and
        cooling, and more particularly to an energy conversion apparatus
        wherein energy is converted by the sorption of operating medium
        by a sorption agent. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b> </p>
      <p>Devices which operate in accordance with sorption methods and
        which make use of the absorption and release of heat are
        commonly referred to as sorption apparatus. Sorption apparatus
        are preferable as compared to traditional compression cooling
        machines in that sorption apparatus can be thermally driven
        (i.e., that at least the sorption medium is maintained at a
        relatively high temperature level at the conclusion of the
        desorption phase thereby providing for a considerable amount of
        stored heat energy). In these devices, heat energy is stored in
        the sorption medium for later use in conjunction with the
        sorption heat which is released during the sorption process.
        Alternately, cold can be produced during the sorption phase when
        vaporized operating medium is absorbed from the operating medium
        container. </p>
      <p>German Patent No. 3413 349.6 discloses a device for using
        stored heat. In this reference, off peak electricity is provided
        to the apparatus during a desorption phase of operation at
        night. During the day, heat energy is withdrawn from the
        apparatus and used to heat a desired area. </p>
      <p>It is foreseen that in the future, legislation regarding
        exhaust gases from automobiles will become so prevalent and
        severe that only a small percentage of newly registered motor
        vehicles will be permitted to generate and emit exhaust gases.
        Therefore, in many cities, electric cars will be the preferred
        mode of transportation. Similar to traditional gasoline powered
        vehicles, the interior of the electric cars will have to be
        heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. Heating of
        vehicle compartments in this manner uses a considerable amount
        of electric power. Therefore, it is not currently practical to
        heat an electro-vehicle with energy from the vehicle's battery
        due to the need for electric power to be used for
        transportation. An alternative to an electrical heating device
        is a heating device which utilizes fossil fuels. However, if it
        is desired to heat without exhaust gases, this is not a
        solution. </p>
      <p>The cooling of the passenger compartment of an electro-vehicle
        is no less problematic if a battery operated compressor is to be
        used. The expense and size of electromotors, compressors,
        evaporators, liquefiers and, in particular, the addition of
        batteries for use only in the heating and cooling system are far
        more costly and take up far more additional space as compared to
        that required for a conventional vehicular air conditioning
        system. It should also be mentioned that it is not possible to
        heat the interior of a vehicle with the use of a conventional
        air conditioning system. Therefore, separate heating and cooling
        systems are required which result in additional weight to the
        vehicle. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a combined
        storage unit and method for both heating and cooling of an
        enclosed space. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a
        heating and cooling apparatus which consists of environmentally
        safe materials. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide
        sorption apparatus and method for cooling and/or heating which
        overcomes the inherent disadvantages of known sorption heating
        and cooling devices. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, sorption
        apparatus for heating and cooling includes sorption medium
        enclosed within a sorption medium container which is encased by
        an insulating container. As used hereinafter, the term sorption
        includes adsorption as well as absorption. An electric heater is
        also included to provide a supply of heat during a desorption
        phase. An air blower may be included in order to provide an air
        flow in the space between the insulating container and the
        sorption medium containers so that heat can be discharged from
        the sorption medium. </p>
      <p>The sorption apparatus further includes an operating medium
        container coupled to the sorption medium container by an
        operating medium steam line. The operating medium steam line
        includes a shut off device which in its closed position prevents
        operating medium, which is stored in the operating medium
        container, from flowing into the sorption medium container. The
        operating medium container is thermally insulated by a thermal
        insulating hood. An air blower can be included to provide an air
        flow in the space between the thermal insulating hood and the
        operating medium container. A control and regulating unit can
        also be included for comparing the temperature of the operating
        medium with the temperature of the sorption medium and for
        altering the position of the shut off device and the intensity
        of the electric heater. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features, and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be
        read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>

        apparatus for cooling and heating of the present invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1 of the drawings, sorption apparatus for
        cooling and heating constructed in accordance with the present
        invention will now be described. As used hereinafter, the term
        sorption is meant to include both adsorption and absorption of
        an operating medium. The sorption apparatus 20 shown in FIG. 1
        is preferably used in conjunction with an electric car and
        includes sorption medium 1 contained within a sorption medium
        container 2 which is enclosed within an insulating container 4.
        An electric heater 3 is preferably included and extends from the
        exterior of the sorption medium container into the interior of
        the sorption medium container and is surrounded by sorption
        medium. The electric heater supplies heat during a desorption
        phase of operation. An air blower 5 may be included in order to
        provide an air flow in the space between the insulating
        container and the sorption medium container so that heat can be
        discharged from the sorption medium. </p>
      <p>The sorption apparatus 20 further includes an operating medium
        container 7 coupled to the sorption medium container 2 by an
        operating medium steam line 6. The operating medium steam line
        includes a shut-off device 8 which in its closed position
        prevents the operating medium, which is stored within the
        operating medium container, from flowing into the sorption
        medium container. The operating medium container is heat
        insulated by a thermal insulating hood 10. An air blower 11 is
        preferably included to provide an air flow in the space between
        the thermal insulating hood and the operating medium container.
        A control and regulating unit 12 can also be included for
        comparing the temperature of the operating medium with the
        temperature of the sorption medium. Based upon the detected
        temperatures, the control and regulating unit alters the
        position of the shut off device. In addition the control and
        regulating unit varies the amount of heat generated by the
        electric heater. Therefore, the control and regulating unit
        manipulates the amount of operating medium that is absorbed and
        desorbed by the sorption medium. </p>
      <p>The sorption apparatus of the present invention operates in two
        partial phases. In a first partial phase called the desorption
        phase, heat is applied to the sorption medium which causes the
        operating medium to be expelled from the sorption medium. The
        addition of heat causes the operating medium to convert to a
        steam-like operating medium. The steam-like operating medium can
        be subsequently liquified by removing the applied heat energy
        from the operating medium. The liquified operating medium can
        thereafter be stored for later use during the second partial
        phase called the sorption phase. </p>
      <p>In the second partial phase, the operating medium absorbs heat
        and again transforms into a vapor operating medium. Thereafter
        if the shut off device is open, the sorption medium absorbs the
        operating medium and binds it. As a result, the sorption medium
        removes heat energy from the operating medium and the sorption
        medium is heated. As a result of the transfer of heat energy
        from the operating medium to the sorption medium, the operating
        medium will again take on a liquid form. The temperature of the
        operating medium which is not vaporized and which remains in
        liquid form in the operating medium container will decrease
        because the evaporation of operating medium absorbs heat from
        the liquid operating medium. The sorption phase can continue
        until the sorption medium is saturated. The state of saturation
        essentially depends upon the temperature of the sorption medium
        and the evaporation temperature of the operating medium. </p>
      <p>The control and regulating unit 12 manipulates the electric
        heater 3 in order to heat the sorption medium 1 until it reaches
        its desorption temperature. When the desorption temperature is
        attained, the operating medium is driven from the sorption
        medium. As a result, the operating medium is forced through both
        the operating medium steam line 6 and the opened shut off device
        8 into the operating medium container 7. The vaporized operating
        medium will preferably condensate along the walls of the
        operating medium container 7. Therefore, when a substance such
        as water is utilized as the operating medium, the condensation
        within the operating medium container will occur at a relatively
        high temperature (up to 100.degree. C.) and a great deal of heat
        energy will be maintained. </p>
      <p>Air blower 11 is utilized to cool the operating medium if the
        condensation pressure within the operating medium container 7
        rises above atmospheric pressure. After completion of the
        desorption phase, internal heat that may have been lost due to
        the insulating containers can be replaced by electric heater 3.
      </p>
      <p>The thermal energy required for the operation of the sorption
        apparatus of the present invention is preferably provided to the
        sorption medium 1 in conjunction with the charging or
        re-charging of the power supply/battery of an electro-car within
        which the sorption apparatus is preferably contained. </p>
      <p>In order to provide the generated heat to the passenger
        compartment of the vehicle to which the sorption apparatus is
        attached, air blower 5 forces recirculated air from the
        passenger compartment over the sorption medium container 2 and
        provides it to the passenger compartment. The sorption medium 1
        serves to heat the air provided by air blower 5 by transferring
        heat energy from the sorption medium, through the sorption
        medium container, to the air. As a result, the temperature of
        the sorption medium decreases. Therefore, the sorption medium
        will absorb additional steam-like operating medium 9 which
        transports additional heat energy. The rate of flow of the
        operating medium may be controlled by the shut off device 8.
        During absorption of the steamlike operating medium, the heat
        energy released during condensation of the operating medium in
        addition to the heat energy released during sorption will be
        used to heat the air flow provided by the air blower. As a
        result, the operating medium still remaining in the operating
        medium container will be further cooled. </p>
      <p>As soon as the temperature of the operating medium 9 falls
        below the temperature of the exhaust air, ambient air can be
        directed over the surfaces of the operating medium container 7
        by air blower 11. If a sufficient ambient heat source is not
        available, the operating medium may solidify in the operating
        medium container 7, therefore providing latent heat. </p>
      <p>The operation of the present invention with regard to providing
        cold is similar to that of generating and providing heat. In
        this regard, the air fed by air blower 11 is merely directed
        into the inner compartment which is being cooled while the air
        which is provided by air blower 5 is discharged into the
        environment. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the sorption apparatus of the present
        invention, one device can alternately generate and supply both
        heat and cold. In order to obtain an optimum supply of heat or
        cold, only a slight variation of the basic method must be made
        after the initial desorption phase is complete. As previously
        stated, both the heating and cooling methods contain a
        desorption phase wherein the sorption medium is heated by a
        supply of heat. As a result, operating medium which had
        previously been absorbed, (i.e., operating medium steam) is
        driven out of the sorption medium. Advantageously, this
        operating medium steam is recondensed and stored in the
        operating medium container. As a result, new operating medium
        need not be supplied into the apparatus after each desorption
        phase. </p>
      <p>As stated above, the method steps of the heating and cooling
        process differ from each other after the desorption phase is
        complete. When only heat is to be provided, the sorption medium
        is preferably maintained at the maximum temperature in order to
        provide the maximum amount of heat for later use. This is
        preferably achieved by storing the sorption medium in a
        thermally insulated device and if need be, compensating any heat
        loss by additional heating. Thereafter, the vaporized operating
        medium is preferably reliquefied at its maximum condensation
        temperature. If water is used as the operating medium, the
        condensation temperature can be as high as 100.degree. C. Up to
        this temperature, the sorption apparatus system is still in the
        vacuum range. Therefore, very bulky and heavy high pressure
        devices are not required. It is preferable that thermal
        insulation of the liquid sorption medium be provided during long
        periods of heat storage. Again, if need be, any heat loss can be
        compensated for by supplying additional heat with an electric
        heater. The shut off device which is located between the
        sorption medium container and the operating medium container may
        stay open, since the sorption medium will not cool. </p>
      <p>When heat is provided to a passenger compartment by the
        sorption apparatus as in the preferred embodiment, the
        temperature of the sorption medium is initially reduced. In
        conjunction with this decrease in temperature, operating medium
        steam is absorbed in the sorption medium. In order to generate
        the steam-like operating medium, liquid operating medium must
        evaporate within the operating medium container. Evaporation
        heat is provided from the feasible heat of the liquid operating
        medium which is stored at a high temperature within the
        operating medium container. Due to an additional heat reduction
        caused by the sorption medium, the evaporation temperature of
        the operating medium will be reduced to a temperature below an
        ambient temperature. Various types of waste heat from
        households, factories or vehicles are suitable for use as an
        ambient temperature level in the sorption apparatus of the
        present invention. At this point, heat from the sorption
        apparatus may be used for the further evaporation of the
        operating medium. Only a liquid or gas like operating medium
        should be used in conjunction with the evaporation devices and
        coupled by means of a heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>If the ambient temperature level falls below the solidification
        temperature of the operating medium, the solidification
        temperature of the operating medium can be manipulated by adding
        additional substances so that it will be below the ambient
        temperature level. </p>
      <p>A large heat capacity of the total system can be achieved by
        using greater amounts of operating medium. When a correctly
        selected amount of operating medium is chosen, the evaporation
        temperature will always be above a defined temperature level. </p>
      <p>When using a suitable operating medium, (for example, water)
        the heat of solidification of the operating medium itself may
        serve as the heat source for the evaporation or sublimination of
        the steam-like operating medium. The heat energy required for
        providing a usable level of heat is provided in the following
        order. First, the heat of the sorption medium is accessed,
        secondly, the heat of the stored operating medium is utilized,
        thirdly, the pure absorption heat which is generated during the
        reaction of the operating medium with the sorption medium is
        used, fourth, additional heat can be brought in from the
        sorption apparatus by a heater and fifth, the solidifying heat
        of the operating medium itself is utilized. </p>
      <p>When only cooling is required of the sorption apparatus, the
        amount of stored heat is of no interest. Therefore, it is
        recommended that after the desorption phase, a further storage
        of heat within the sorption apparatus not be performed. As time
        passes, the sorption medium as well as the liquid operating
        medium will cool off to the ambient temperature level despite
        the thermal insulation. If this occurs, it is preferable to use
        the control and regulating unit to completely close the shut off
        device and keep it turned off so that operating medium will not
        flow between the containers. Otherwise, the sorption medium
        whose temperature is falling would draw operating medium steam.
        This would ultimately heat the sorption medium. </p>
      <p>In order to generate cold, the shut off device is preferably
        opened by the control and regulating unit so that steam-like
        operating medium can flow into the sorption medium container and
        combine with the sorption medium. The previously cooled sorption
        medium is thereby heated and the temperature of the still
        liquefied operating medium is reduced. The cold which is
        generated by the evaporation of the operating medium from the
        operating medium container may be transmitted to any given heat
        carrier medium by heat exchanger devices. In the preferred
        embodiment, direct evaporators are utilized which cool ambient
        air by dehumidifying the same. In the alternative, heat carrier
        circulators which transfer the generated cold by water
        circulation or air circulation to a distantly situated cooling
        area can be used. </p>
      <p>In order to utilize the entire heating and cooling capacity of
        the sorption medium, it is recommended to cool the sorption
        medium during the sorption phase. In the preferred embodiment,
        ambient air is taken in by air blowers for this purpose and
        pushed through suitable heat exchangers. However, liquid heat
        carriers which have improved heat transfer capability and which
        can easily transport heat over long distances are also suitable.
      </p>
      <p>The control and regulating unit of the present invention can be
        designed so that the evaporation temperature of the operating
        medium is set by opening or closing the shut off device. </p>
      <p>Normally, the sorption medium container and the operating
        medium container of the sorption apparatus are constructed and
        coupled in an air-tight manner in order to create a vacuum-type
        environment inside the sorption apparatus. However, it may be
        advantageous to use non-vacuum systems, wherein the operating
        and sorption medium containers of the sorption apparatus can be
        evacuated by means of an additional air pump. The airpump may be
        a vacuum pump which is coupled to the sorption medium container.
        The vacuum pump 21 preferably decreases the internal pressure
        within the sorption medium container. As a result, the steamlike
        operating medium can freely flow to and within the sorption
        medium filler. It is only necessary to remove all air from the
        sorption medium to such an extent that the given steam-like
        operating medium pressure falls below the operating medium
        pressure when the system is not air tight. Since non-airtight
        systems do not have strict requirements with respect to the
        vacuum tightness, it is also possible to easily separate the
        sorption medium from the sorption apparatus in order to desorb
        the sorption medium at a remote location. This could result in
        quicker and more energy efficient desorption of the sorption
        medium. This is particularly advantageous if the charged
        sorption medium filler is so heavy that the sorption apparatus
        could not be carried by one person. </p>
      <p>It has also been shown to be advantageous to desorb the
        sorption medium by using a separate electric heating device.
        Therefore, desorption of the sorption medium can occur at
        different voltages and temperature by simple manipulation of
        electrical heat resistors. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the sorption apparatus of the
        present invention may be advantageously integrated into a motor
        vehicle. This could be a vehicle powered by an internal
        combustion engine as well as battery operated vehicle. The size
        of the sorption apparatus has to be selected in such a way so
        that during a predetermined maximum operating time, the
        generatable heat or the generatable cold is sufficient to
        properly alter the temperature of the passenger compartment of
        the vehicle to which the device is affixed. </p>
      <p>When the sorption apparatus is to be used in conjunction with
        an internal combustion vehicle, it may be advantageous to attach
        the sorption apparatus only when heating and cooling of the
        passenger compartment is needed. </p>
      <p>If the sorption apparatus has an additional pump as previously
        mentioned, the pump can be operated using the 12 or 24 V battery
        of the vehicle. A blower which directs the heated or cooled air
        within the vehicle may also be powered by the vehicle's battery.
      </p>
      <p>The heat of sorption which is to be discharged from the
        sorption medium can be expelled by using a small circulating
        pump and a heat exchanger which can be extended through an
        opened side window. </p>
      <p>Desorption utilizing a household power supply is advantageous
        for battery operated vehicles. For example, desorption of the
        sorption medium may take place while the vehicle's battery is
        being charged. Since the vehicle remains connected to the power
        supply until the next trip, any required compensation of the
        thermal heat losses can be maintained by additional heating even
        after the desorption phase has been completed. Since the
        desorption process did not access power from the car battery,
        the vehicle's battery will be fully charged at the beginning of
        a journey. </p>
      <p>When a drive is started and the apparatus is utilized wherein a
        long period of time must be bridged between trips without
        coupling to an electrical heater, it is advantageous to keep the
        shut off device closed as long as possible and initially only
        emit the heat from the sorption medium. If the heat from the
        sorption medium is no longer sufficient to heat the inner
        compartment of the vehicle, the shut off device may be gradually
        opened in order to release the heat stored in the operating
        medium. Since a return trip usually encompasses the same amount
        of time as the first leg of a journey, the sorption container
        will be cooled to almost ambient temperature by the end of the
        return trip. Therefore, heat will not be lost from the sorption
        medium even if there is a relatively long waiting time between
        trips. During the waiting time, the liquid operating medium will
        also cool off. By opening the shut off device, a considerable
        amount of heat will be released in the sorption medium for the
        return trip. However, this amount of heat is about as large as
        the noticeable amount of heat previously stored in the hot
        sorption medium. </p>
      <p>It is particularly advantageous to use zeolite as the sorption
        medium and water as the operating medium. Zeolite exhibits a
        very high affinity for water with a relatively high sorption
        heat. Moreover, water has a very high specific heat of
        evaporation and a high solidification enthalpy. Together, the
        water and zeolite are particularly suitable for mobile storage
        and cold generators. </p>
      <p>Zeolites may be heated to very high temperatures without
        exhibiting decomposition phenomenons. This enables very high
        storage temperatures with a great component of noticeable heat.
        Also, water can be stored at 100.degree. C. without designing
        the systems for excess pressure. Furthermore, zeolites are not
        harmful to the environment and can be reused without
        complications. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the
        invention.<br>
