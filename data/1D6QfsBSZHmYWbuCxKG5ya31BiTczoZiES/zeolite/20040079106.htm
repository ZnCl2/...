        wherein the condenser (4) is coupled to a buffer reservoir (14)
        that buffers at least a part of the condensation heat of the
        working medium vapor and that also can again dissipate the
        stored heat into the surroundings even during the adsorption
        phase. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The invention relates to a periodically operating
        adsorption cooling apparatus with a buffer reservoir and a
        method for its operation. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Adsorption cooling apparatuses are devices in which a
        solid adsorbent adsorbs a vapor phase working medium with
        release of heat at an intermediate temperature (adsorption
        phase). In the process, the working medium evaporates in an
        evaporator with uptake of heat at a lower temperature. After the
        adsorption phase, the working medium can again be desorbed by
        the addition of heat at a higher temperature level (desorption
        phase). In the process, the working medium evaporates from the
        adsorbent and flows into a condenser. In the condenser, the
        working medium is condensed again and then evaporated anew in
        the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0003] Adsorption cooling apparatuses with solid adsorbents are
        known from EP 0 368 111 and DE-OS 34 25 419. In the process,
        adsorbent containers, filled with adsorbents, draw in working
        medium vapor which is produced in an evaporator, and they adsorb
        it in the adsorbent filling with release of heat. The adsorption
        heat in the process must be removed from the adsorbent filling.
        The cooling apparatuses can be used in thermally insulated
        containers for cooling and keeping warm foodstuffs. These
        cooling apparatuses contain a shutoff device between the
        evaporator and the adsorbent. This allows evaporation and
        adsorption of the working medium at a later time. </p>
      <p>[0004] The adsorption cooling apparatus which is known from EP
        0 368 111 consists of a transportable cooling unit and a
        stationary charging station that can be separated from the
        cooling unit. The cooling unit contains an adsorption container,
        which is filled with a solid adsorbent, and an evaporator with a
        liquid working medium. Here, too, the evaporator and the
        adsorption container are connected by a vapor line that can be
        shut off. Liquid media, which are cooled to the desired
        temperature level by the temperature-regulated opening and
        closing of the shutoff device, flow through a heat exchanger
        embedded in the evaporator. After the adsorbent has become
        saturated with working medium, it can be heated in the charging
        station. The working medium vapor that flows out in the process
        is condensed again in the evaporator. The condensation heat is
        removed via the cooling water that flows through the embedded
        heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>[0005] The shutoff devices serve, on the one hand, the function
        of uncoupling the evaporator from the remaining cooling
        apparatus during the desorption phase, in order to prevent hot
        working medium vapor from flowing into the cold evaporator, and
        on the other hand, they serve the function of regulating the
        cold production of the adsorption phase in the evaporator or
        shifting it to a later time. Without a shutoff device, the
        evaporator always becomes hot during the desorption phase, and
        thus the medium to be cooled that is in contact with it becomes
        warm. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0006] The problem of the present invention is to protect, in
        an adsorption cooling apparatus without a shutoff device the
        medium to be cooled in the desorption phase from impermissible
        heating. </p>
      <p>[0007] This problem is solved by an adsorption cooling
        apparatus of the type having an intermittently heated adsorbent
        container containing an adsorbent that exothermically adsorbs a
        working medium during an adsorption phase and with addition of
        heat again desorbs during a subsequent desorption phase at
        higher temperatures and with a condenser that leads condensed
        working medium through a connection line to the evaporator which
        is in turn connected with the adsorbent through a working medium
        vapor line and which takes up heat from the medium to be cooled
        during the adsorption phase, wherein the condenser is coupled to
        a buffer reservoir that buffers at least a part of the
        condensation heat of the working medium vapor and that can again
        dissipate the stored heat into the surroundings even during the
        adsorption phase. </p>
      <p>[0008] The coupling of the condenser to a buffer reservoir
        allows a distinctly more rapid desorption and thus a higher
        desorption capacity, because the condensation heat, for example,
        can be removed more effectively due to the starting of
        convection. The desorption phase can thus be distinctly
        shortened compared to the adsorption phase. The medium to be
        cooled is exposed for a shorter period to the high condensation
        temperatures. In a buffer reservoir of appropriate dimensions,
        the desorption phase can be reduced to a few minutes, while the
        adsorption phase can last several hours to several days. During
        this long adsorption phase, the buffer reservoir can slowly
        dissipate through small heat exchange surfaces the heat load
        that was absorbed at high power. </p>
      <p>[0009] In principle, one can use as a buffer reservoir any of
        the reservoir media known from the heat reservoir industry, such
        as liquids, phase change materials (PCM), and solids. Water is
        cost-effective, and it also allows a high heat transfer
        capacity. In the process, the condenser can be integrated
        directly into a water reservoir. The buffered heat is then
        removed through the external surface of the tank during the slow
        adsorption phase without an additional heat exchanger, and
        released into the surrounding air. </p>
      <p>[0010] It is particularly advantageous for the evaporator to be
        arranged, with reference to the medium to be cooled, in such a
        manner that it releases relatively little heat during the
        desorption phase. This is achieved, for example, by allowing a
        relatively small amount of medium to be cooled to be in contact
        with the evaporator, or by omitting any circulation during the
        desorption phase. If the medium to be cooled is gaseous, as is
        the case, for example, in refrigerators, it is advantageous for
        the evaporator to be placed under the ceiling of the
        refrigerator. Because hot air is lighter than cold air, the cold
        air mass remains in the lower portion of the refrigerator, while
        only the air quantity surrounding the evaporator becomes warm.
        Any goods stored in the refrigerator then remain cold during the
        relatively short desorption phase. This effect can be further
        increased by cold storing media and/or radiation screens that
        are arranged under the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0011] For high desorption capacities, high heat conductivity
        in the adsorbent and good heat transfer from the source of heat
        are required. It can be particularly advantageous for the heat
        capacity of the adsorbent, during the desorption phase, to be
        substantially greater than the heat losses to the surroundings.
        In this case, one can omit thermal insulation on the adsorbent
        container casing facing the surroundings. The adsorption heat is
        then released through the casing during the adsorption phase
        without additional measures. </p>
      <p>[0012] It is particularly advantageous to use the adsorption
        pair zeolite/water. Zeolite is a crystalline mineral which
        consists of a regular lattice structure made of silicon and
        aluminum oxides. This lattice structure contains small vacancies
        in which water molecules can be adsorbed with the release of
        heat. Within the lattice, the water molecules are exposed to
        strong field forces that bind the molecules in the lattice in a
        liquid-like phase. The strength of the binding forces which act
        on the water molecule is a function of the preadsorbed quantity
        of water and the temperature of the zeolites. For practical use,
        up to 25 g of water can be adsorbed per 100 g of zeolite.
        Zeolites are solid substances without troublesome heat expansion
        during the adsorption or desorption reaction. The lattice is
        freely accessible from all sides to the water vapor molecules.
        The apparatuses are therefore operational in any position. </p>
      <p>[0013] The use of water as working medium makes it possible to
        reduce the required regulation effort to a minimum. During the
        evaporation of water under a vacuum, the water surface cools to
        0.degree. C. and, during continued evaporation, it freezes to
        ice. The ice layer can be used advantageously for regulating the
        temperature of the medium to be cooled. If there is little
        addition of heat, the ice layer grows, whereas, if a large
        amount of heat is added, it disappears as a result of melting.
        Due to the formation of ice, heat transfer is reduced from the
        medium to be cooled into the evaporator, so that the medium
        cannot be cooled below 0.degree. C. If evaporation is continued,
        the entire water reserve can turn to ice in the evaporator. The
        sublimation temperature of the ice layer then decreases to less
        than 0.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0014] It is also possible to add substances that lower the
        freezing point to the aqueous evaporator contents, if the
        temperature of the medium to be cooled is to be lowered below
        0.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0015] Other adsorbent pairs can also be used where the
        adsorbent is solid and remains solid even during the adsorption
        reaction. Solid adsorbents have low heat conductivity and
        limited heat transfer. Because the heat transfer from the
        adsorbent container to the surrounding air that takes up heat is
        of the same order of magnitude, heat exchangers without ribs are
        recommended in principle, for example, plates, pipes and
        corrugated metal tubes. Some solid adsorbents, such as zeolites,
        are sufficiently sturdy to compensate even for external excess
        pressures on thin-walled heat exchanger surfaces. Additional
        reinforcements or thick-walled heat exchanger surfaces are
        therefore not necessary. </p>
      <p>[0016] Moreover, solid adsorbents can be processed into molded
        bodies. A single molded body, or a few molded bodies, can form a
        complete cost-effective adsorbent filling. </p>
      <p>[0017] For an economical operating procedure with zeolite/water
        systems, it is recommended to use desorption final temperatures
        of 200-300.degree. C. and adsorption final temperatures of
        40-80.degree. C. Because zeolite granulates have a particularly
        low heat conductivity, the adsorbent containers should be
        designed so that the heat conductivity path for the processed
        quantities of heat does not exceed 3 cm. </p>
      <p>[0018] As a heat source for the desorption phase, any of the
        known devices are suitable, provided that the temperature level
        required for the desorption reaction is achieved with them.
        Electrically heated plates or cartridges whose geometry is
        adapted to the adsorbent container are advantageous. Also
        suitable are heating devices which heat the adsorbent filling by
        radiation or induction (eddy current). The heating surface used
        during heating of the adsorbent with a flame can also be used as
        a heat exchanger surface for heat release during the adsorption
        phase. It is thus possible to omit the conventional double
        installation of heat exchanger surfaces. </p>
      <p>[0019] It can also be advantageous to adapt the geometry of the
        adsorbent container specifically to heat release during the
        adsorption phase. In the case of heat release into the
        surrounding air, it is preferred to use large heat exchanger
        surfaces that promote flow. </p>
      <p>[0020] The working medium condenses predominantly in the
        condenser. The condensate must be led from there to the
        evaporator. If the adsorption cooling apparatus is simply
        constructed, then the condensate must be able to flow back into
        the evaporator without additional help. This is always easy to
        achieve if the condenser and thus also the heat buffer are in a
        higher position than the evaporator. The condensate can then
        surely flow back during the desorption phase by gravity. In
        cooling apparatuses where this is not possible, it can be
        advantageous for the condensate to be stored in the condenser or
        in a collection tank, to be drawn upward into the evaporator at
        the beginning of the adsorption phase, when the vapor pressure
        in the evaporator decreases. </p>
      <p>[0021] Expensive electronic regulation must be omitted in
        cost-effective cooling apparatuses. However, since adsorption
        apparatuses necessarily produce a highly variable cooling power,
        it is advantageous for the cooling power to be limited in a
        simple manner. According to the invention, the cross section of
        the working medium vapor line to the adsorbent is decreased for
        that purpose. This can also be achieved, for example, by
        expansion elements that decrease the cross section of the pipe
        to the adsorbent with decreasing temperature. Bimetal elements
        that are incorporated in the evaporator are a particularly
        cost-effective way of narrowing the outlet of the evaporator
        with decreasing evaporation temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0022] Because the evaporator, as a function of the system, is
        raised to the termperature level of condensation with each
        desorption, and because, at the beginning of the adsorption
        phase, it must again be cooled to the lower temperature level of
        evaporation by evaporation of a portion of the working medium,
        it is advantageous to keep the thermal mass of the evaporator
        low and to set the quantity of liquid working medium such that,
        to the extent possible, the entire working medium is evaporated
        at the end of the adsorption phase. Toward the end of
        adsorption, the quantity of working medium in the evaporator
        becomes increasingly smaller, and, consequently the wetting of
        the heat exchanger surface to allow the uptake of heat from the
        medium to be cooled becomes increasingly more difficult.
        According to the invention, the evaporator contains wetting
        agents for this operational state that distribute the remaining
        working medium homogeneously over the internal evaporation
        surface. For this purpose, nonwoven glass fiber materials have
        been shown to be satisfactory; they are applied as a thin layer
        on the corresponding evaporator surfaces. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0027] A refrigerator 1, represented in FIG. 1, consists of a
        thermally insulated hollow body 2, which is closed at its front
        side by a door 3 and which cools and stores in the internal
        space foodstuffs and drink bottles 11 at cold temperature. The
        medium to be cooled by the evaporator in this application is the
        air in the internal space of the refrigerator. </p>
      <p>[0028] An evaporator 4 is arranged under the ceiling of the
        refrigerator 1, from which the working medium water 5
        evaporates. The evaporator 4 is connected through a working
        medium vapor line 9 to an adsorbent container 12 and through an
        additional connection line 10 with a condenser 13. The
        evaporator 4 is covered on its bottom internal side with an
        absorbent fiber nonwoven material 6 that distributes the working
        medium water homogeneously over the heat uptake surface. It
        contains several cooling ribs 7 on the outside that take up heat
        from the medium to be cooled, air. A layer of elements 8 that
        store cold is located under the cooling ribs 7; the elements
        contain water and they also can freeze. In front of the opening
        of the working medium vapor line 9 is arranged a bimetal element
        23 that narrows the outlet opening to the adsorbent container as
        the evaporator temperature decreases. The condenser 13, which is
        provided with heat exchanger ribs 15, is located in the lower
        area of a buffer reservoir 14 that is filled with water 16. The
        adsorbent container 12 consists of two metal adsorber jackets 17
        with an electrical heating 18 in the middle embedded. The
        adsorber jackets 17 each contain an adsorbent filling 19 that is
        constructed from molded zeolite bodies. </p>
      <p>[0029] A regulator 20 controls the operation of heating 18 as a
        function of the temperature of the refrigerator air and the
        temperature of the adsorbent fitting 19. The input quantities
        for the regulator 20 are the air temperatures in the
        refrigerator, which are determined by a temperature sensor 21,
        and the zeolite temperature, which is reported by a zeolite
        temperature sensor 22. </p>
      <p>[0030] The function of the refrigerator according to the
        invention can be subdivided into a relatively short desorption
        phase and a distinctly longer adsorption phase. </p>
      <p>[0031] The desorption phase starts with heating of the
        adsorbent filling 19. The temperature sensor 21 reports to the
        regulator 20 exceeding the preselected temperature of the
        refrigerator air. Electrical heating 18 is then operated until
        the zeolite temperature sensor 22 observes that the desorption
        final temperature has been reached. During the heating phase,
        water vapor is expelled from the adsorbent filling 19 which
        continues to become warmer, and the vapor flows through the
        working medium vapor line 9, the evaporator 4, and the
        connecting line 10 into the condenser 13. In the latter, the
        vapor is condensed as a result of the release of heat to the
        buffer water 16 through the heat exchanger ribs 15. The
        condensate collects in the bottom area of the condenser 13. A
        small part of the water vapor condenses in the evaporator 4
        until the latter's temperature has risen to the temperature
        level of the condenser 13. The masses of air around the
        evaporator 4 also become warmer. Since this quantity of air is
        lighter than the cold air in the lower refrigerator area, no
        mixing occurs. In addition, the cold storing element 8 prevents
        any noticeable warming of the drink bottles 11 in the
        refrigerator (for example, as a result of heat radiation). </p>
      <p>[0032] The adsorbent container jackets 17, which are in contact
        with the surrounding air, release heat during the desorption
        phase. However, since this phase is kept short according to the
        invention and the heat losses are low relative to the high heat
        capacity, thermal insulation of the external adsorbent container
        jackets 17 can be omitted. In addition, a relatively strong
        temperature gradient forms inside the adsorbent filling 19.
        Thus, temperatures of up to 400.degree. C. can be measured near
        the electrical heating 18, while the zeolite in contact with the
        external adsorption container sheaths 17 is heated only to
        temperatures of 140.degree. C. The heat losses to the
        surroundings from this low temperature level are distinctly
        lower. In addition, these temperatures occur only at the end of
        the desorption phase. Once the final desorption temperature has
        been reached, heating is switched off. At this time, the buffer
        reservoir has reached its highest temperature. This now
        decreases continuously during the following adsorption phase
        because heat slowly flows into the surroundings through the
        container walls. </p>
      <p>[0033] Heat also continues to flow through the non-thermally
        insulated adsorption container jackets 17 into the surrounding
        air that flows by. The temperature of the adsorbent filling 19
        decreases as a result, and the working medium vapor flows back
        into the adsorbent container 12. The vapor pressure in the
        evaporator then decreases until the condensate is drawn upward
        out of the condenser. At that time the entire quantity of liquid
        working medium is located in the evaporator 4. If cooling of the
        adsorbent filling 19 is continued, this water mass will also
        evaporate in the evaporator 4 during the course of the
        adsorption phase with the uptake of heat of evaporation. At
        evaporation temperatures below the freezing point, the remaining
        water quantity will gradually turn into ice. The bimetal element
        23 that narrows the inflow opening in the working medium vapor
        line 9 prevents potential cooling to temperatures much below the
        freezing point. The end of the adsorption phase is reached when
        the regulator 20 records an excessively high air temperature in
        the refrigerator. The desorption phase then starts from the
        beginning by heating the adsorbent filling 19. </p>
      <p>[0034] In the adsorption refrigerator represented in FIG. 2,
        the buffer reservoir 30 is located above the evaporator 32. From
        the adsorbent container 33, the working medium vapor line 34
        runs through the buffer reservoir 30 to be able to effectively
        remove the condensation heat from its volume of water 35. The
        part of the working medium vapor line 34 that can release heat
        to the value of water 35 accordingly has the same function as
        the condenser. The working medium vapor line 34 is arranged at a
        slant, so that the condensate 39 can readily flow off during the
        desorption phase by gravity without any additional measures,
        directly into the evaporator 32. The adsorption container 33 in
        this variant consists of an internal heating cartridge 38 and an
        adsorbent filling 37, which is surrounded by a cylindrical
        adsorber jacket 36. The latter also does not need any thermal
        insulation, because the heat losses are low due to the short
        desorption phases and the large temperature gradient inside the
        adsorbent filling 37. </p>
      <p>[0035] The operational procedure of the cooling apparatus
        according to FIG. 2 is identical to that described above for the
        apparatus according to FIG. 1. The only difference is that the
        condensate 39 does not remain in the condenser, but rather can
        readily flow off during the desorption phase into the evaporator
        32. </p>
      <p>[0036] Although the illustrative embodiments of the present
        invention have been described herein with reference to the
        accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention
        is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various
        other changes and modifications may be effected therein by one
        skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of
        the invention. </p>
