        <p><b><font size="+1">Apparatus for Cooling a Medium within a
              Container</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>15 August 1995</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Apparatus for cooling a medium within a container includes a
        container having a chamber with a medium to be cooled located
        therein. The container being capable of transferring heat energy
        from an interior surface of the container wall to an exterior
        surface. The apparatus also includes an evaporation unit having
        liquid operating medium which is in contact with the exterior
        surface of the container and a sorption medium container
        containing sorption medium coupled to the evaporation unit. The
        sorption medium unit being capable of adsorbing and desorbing
        operating medium vapor provided by the operating medium. When
        the liquid operating medium evaporates and is adsorbed by the
        sorption medium, additional operating medium evaporates causing
        the operating medium temperature to decrease. When the
        temperature of the liquid operating medium falls below the
        temperature of the liquid medium within the container, heat
        energy is transferred through the container wall from the liquid
        medium to the operating medium, causing the temperature of the
        container medium to decrease. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
        cooling a medium within a container. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Cooling methods and apparatus, such as German Patent No. DE 31
        25119, which operate in accordance with the sorption principle
        are generally known. In such devices and methods, a liquid is
        evaporated from an aqueous solution and the vapor is adsorbed by
        a sorption medium. As a result, the portion of the aqueous
        solution which remains in liquid form cools, while the sorption
        medium filler is heated. This method is generally performed in
        closed systems, whereby a vacuum pressure is provided and
        maintained so as to let the aqueous solution continue to
        evaporate even at relatively cool temperatures. The cooling
        devices which operate in accordance with the sorption principle
        are relatively inflexible in their application because they
        preferably operate in a closed system. Therefore, the medium
        being cooled must always be air tight connected to the cooling
        apparatus. </p>
      <p>German Patent No. DE 40 03 107 discloses an icemaker which
        operates in accordance with the sorption principle. This patent
        teaches freezing an aqueous liquid in an icing container by
        utilizing a vacuum sorption container that has a solid sorption
        substance therein and to which a vacuum pump is connected. This
        icemaker is used for making ice from water, which can then be
        provided to a separate drinking glass for cooling of the liquid
        medium therein. Hence, a direct cooling of the container which
        stores the liquid is not disclosed by this patent. </p>
      <p>The discharge of cooling devices that are filled with gaseous
        chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFC's) is routinely performed by means
        of a cartridge that contains activated carbon which absorbs the
        chlorinated hydrocarbon gas. More commonly used methods operate
        in accordance with a cold evaporation method wherein the device
        to be discharged is evacuated by means of a customary cold
        medium condenser. The condensed and liquified cold medium is
        then provided into a container for transport. The prior art
        systems are disadvantageous because they tend to include a
        bulky, complicated structure which is also relatively heavy. </p>
      <p>In view of the above, it is desirable to provide a cooling
        device which does not exhibit the disadvantages associated with
        chlorinated hydrocarbon-cooling devices as well as to overcome
        the present inability of cooling a medium within a container
        without the use of a device which operates in accordance with
        the cold evaporation process. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a cooling
        method and relatively compact device wherein a large cooling
        capacity with relatively low effort of volume may be obtained in
        a short time period. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide
        apparatus and method for cooling a medium within a container
        which overcomes the inherent disadvantages of known cooling
        apparatus and methods. </p>
      <p>In accordance with one form of the present invention, apparatus
        for cooling a medium within a container includes a container
        having an interior chamber with a medium to be cooled located
        therein. The chamber being defined by the walls of the container
        which are capable of transferring heat energy from an interior
        surface of the container wall to an exterior surface of the
        container wall. </p>
      <p>The apparatus also includes an evaporation unit having a liquid
        operating medium therein. The liquid operating medium is in
        contact with the exterior surface of the container so that heat
        energy can be transferred from the medium located within the
        container, through the container wall, to the liquid operating
        medium. A sorption medium container, having sorption medium
        therein, is coupled to the evaporation unit. The sorption medium
        is capable of adsorbing and desorbing operating medium vapor
        generated by the liquid operating medium. When the operating
        medium evaporates and is adsorbed by the sorption medium,
        additional liquid operating medium will evaporate to maintain a
        relatively constant internal pressure. The additional
        evaporation causes more heat energy to leave the liquid
        operating medium thereby reducing the temperature of the
        operating medium. When the temperature of the operating medium
        falls below the temperature of the medium which is within the
        container, heat energy is transferred through the container wall
        from the liquid medium to the operating medium, causing the
        temperature of the liquid medium to decrease. </p>
      <p>The method of the present invention for utilizing a cooling
        apparatus having an evaporation unit and a sorption container
        for cooling a liquid medium located within the chamber of a
        container includes generating a vacuum pressure within the
        cooling apparatus, providing operating medium vapor from the
        evaporation unit to the sorption medium container and absorbing
        the same. Thereafter, heat energy is released from the liquid
        medium through the container wall to the operating medium. </p>
      <p>These and other objects, features and advantages of this
        invention will be apparent from the following detailed
        description of the illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to
        be read in connection with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, apparatus for cooling a medium within
        a container constructed in accordance with the present invention
        will now be described. The cooling apparatus includes a liquid
        medium container 1 with a filling valve 2. The container
        includes a hollow exterior chamber 3 containing an
        absorption-like material 4. The hollow exterior chamber 3 has an
        opening which permits the chamber to be accessible as shown in
        FIG. 1. Preferably, the liquid medium container 1 is connected
        to an adsorption medium container 6 by means of a sealing ring
        5. The adsorption medium container 6, having adsorption medium 7
        therein, has a vacuum pump 9 coupled thereto by vacuum line 8.
        As a result, a vacuum pressure can be generated within the
        adsorption medium container 6. The adsorption medium container 6
        is provided with an opening 10 in one wall of the container.
        Preferably, the liquid medium container 1 and adsorption medium
        container 6 are operatively air-tight coupled by sealing ring 5
        so that the opening of the hollow exterior chamber 3 and opening
        10 of the adsorption medium container 6 may communicate as shown
        in FIG. 1. In a preferred embodiment, the opening 10 is covered
        with an air-tight material before use in order to prevent the
        adsorption medium 7 from receiving liquid vapor before being
        coupled to the container 1 by sealing ring 5. The
        absorption-like material 4 contained within hollow exterior
        chamber 3 is preferably saturated with water before being
        coupled to container 1 by sealing ring 5. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2 of the drawings, an alternative form of
        the present invention is shown. The cooling apparatus of FIG. 2
        includes vacuum pump 9 coupled to adsorption medium container 6
        by means of vacuum line 8. The adsorption medium container 6 has
        adsorption medium 7 and an electric heater 11 therein. The
        adsorption container 6 is coupled to a flexible evaporator unit
        13 by operating medium vapor line 12. Preferably, the operating
        medium vapor line 12 is made of a flexible material so that line
        12 can be easily manipulated when connected to evaporator unit
        13. Flexible evaporator unit 13 contains an absorption-like
        material 14, such as a sponge-like material, which is in good
        heat contact with a portion of the exterior surface of a
        container or beverage can 15. Preferably, the flexible
        evaporator unit 13 is securely attached to the exterior surface
        of the can 15 so that air does not flow therebetween. This can
        be accomplished by providing a vacuum pressure with vacuum pump
        9 so that the beverage can 15 is pulled against the
        absorption-like material 14. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 3 of the drawings, an alternate form of
        the cooling device of the present invention is disclosed. The
        cooling apparatus shown in FIG. 3 includes a liquid medium
        container 1 having a filling valve 2 for providing a liquid
        medium to the container 1 for cooling. The liquid medium
        container 1 is at least partly located within evaporation unit
        16. The evaporation unit 16 is equipped with a removable lid 17
        having a hole therethrough permitting the neck of the container
        1 to extend outside of the evaporation unit. Adsorption medium
        container 6 having adsorption medium 7 therein is coupled to the
        evaporation unit 16 by flexible operating medium vapor line 12.
        Additionally, a vacuum pump 9 is coupled to the adsorption
        medium container by means of vacuum line 8. Due to the vacuum
        pressure created by vacuum pump 9, removable lid 17 is pressed
        air tight on the neck of the liquid medium container 1. The
        evaporation unit 16 has water 18 therein which surrounds and
        contacts portions of the exterior surface of the liquid medium
        container 1 which are located within the evaporation container.
      </p>
      <p>The operation of the cooling apparatus of the present invention
        will now be described with reference to FIG. 1. Before attaching
        the liquid medium container 1 to the adsorption medium container
        6 with sealing ring 5, the hollow exterior chamber 3 having
        adsorption-like material 4 therein is saturated with water or
        other suitable operating medium. Then, the container 1 may be
        filled with the liquid which is to be cooled by opening filling
        valve 2 and pouring the liquid therein. Thereafter, container 1
        is attached to the adsorption medium container 6 so that opening
        10 is adjacent to and can communicate with exterior hollow
        chamber 3. Then, vacuum pump 9 will create vacuum pressure in
        the adsorption medium container 6 causing water to evaporate
        from the absorption-like material 4. As a result and according
        to the sorption principle, this will cause the temperature of
        the water which remains in the absorption-like material to
        decrease. This decrease in temperature will be transferred
        through the container wall which contacts the absorption-like
        material to the liquid within the container. As a result, the
        temperature of the liquid within the liquid medium container 1
        will decrease. </p>
      <p>The operation of the cooling device shown in FIG. 2 operates in
        a manner similar to FIG. 1 except that a heating device 11 is
        included in the adsorption medium container. Since the cooling
        device is a closed system, the heating device 11 permits
        regeneration of the cooling capacity by expelling the operating
        medium that was absorbed by the absorption medium and forcing
        the operating medium into absorption-like material 14 for
        another cooling cycle. </p>
      <p>The cooling device of FIG. 3 operates similarly to FIGS. 1 and
        2 except that the evaporation container is filled with water or
        other operating medium 18 which surrounds and contacts the
        container 1 which is partially contained therein. When the
        vacuum pump is turned on, a vacuum pressure is created that
        causes evaporation of water 18, which in turn, reduces the
        temperature of water 18. As a result, the cold which has been
        generated is transmitted through the walls of container 1 to the
        liquid to be cooled. </p>
      <p>The present invention permits a liquid medium to be cooled in
        the same container that it is stored in without the addition of
        ice or chemicals because heat energy is transferred through the
        walls of the container to the cooling device. It should also be
        understood that the term container, as used in the present
        invention, includes all receptacles which are suitable for
        receiving a liquid, solid or gas-like medium. For example the
        container may not only be a beverage can, beverage bottle,
        trough or pot, but it may also include pipeline systems, wherein
        liquid or gas-like media are contained or flow therein. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the term "container" also includes heating pipe
        networks, wherein hot water normally flows and supplies heat
        energy to radiators. However, there may come a time when a
        section of pipe is in need of repair. If this is true, the flow
        of water is stopped so that it becomes stagnant. Thereafter, a
        portion of the heated water may be cooled and frozen By removal
        of heat energy through the surface of the pipe. The frozen
        heating water then prevents the further flow of the heating
        water so that the section of heating pipe in need of repair can
        be repaired without emptying all of the water from the system. </p>
      <p>The present invention also contemplates the use of containers
        which are specifically designed and modified for cooling a
        liquid in accordance with the present invention. For example,
        recesses may be provided on the inside or the outside surface of
        the container and filled with an aqueous solution which can
        evaporate as shown in FIG. 1. It is also possible to design the
        container in such a manner that it can be inserted into the
        evaporation unit without the need for any additional devices so
        that when a vacuum is applied, the system is airtight sealed.
        This is advantageous when a cooling container is filled with the
        liquid to be cooled after it has been connected to the cooling
        device. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, relatively good heat
        transfer between the container wall and the aqueous solution can
        be obtained because the container is immersed, at least
        partially, into the aqueous liquid of the evaporator unit. It
        may also be advantageous to bring the container wall in contact
        with an absorption-like material that is wet with an aqueous
        liquid which serves as the operating medium. Particularly
        advantageous are materials which can be pulled over the outside
        of the container wall to fit securely thereover and which are
        subsequently saturated with water. </p>
      <p>It may also be advantageous to at least partially construct the
        evaporator unit of flexible materials which adapt to the surface
        contours of the container, specifically during vacuum pressure.
        As a result, an airtight evaporator unit is provided can
        directly contact and conform to the surface contours of portions
        of the container wall. It is particularly advantageous to couple
        the flexible portion of the evaporator unit with the
        absorption-like material so that the absorption-like material
        will directly contact the container wall and provide cooling
        power. The evaporator unit may be held against the container
        wall by an artificial vacuum pressure. An example of a device
        which could be utilized to create such a vacuum pressure is a
        suction cup which is commonly used when handling panes of glass.
        In addition, care has to be taken to insure that there are
        sufficient flow conduits for the transfer of liquid operating
        medium vapor from the evaporator unit to the adsorption medium.
      </p>
      <p>In the present invention, the vapor flowing from the
        evaporation unit is absorbed in the sorption medium filler. In
        particular, zeolites are suitable for use as the sorption filler
        medium since they can store up to 36% by weight of water and
        also release heat. Zeolites are in use in many areas of the
        sorption technology industry and, due to increasing synthetic
        production, they have become relatively economical. Furthermore,
        zeolites are advantageous because they have a regenerative
        quality in that they can release the adsorbed water if a supply
        of heat is provided. In order to maintain the required
        evaporation vacuum pressure, it is preferable to mount the
        sorption medium filler within a single sorption medium
        container. </p>
      <p>The vacuum line 12 which is utilized to connect the adsorption
        medium container to the evaporation unit, may consist of a
        flexible hose, such the ones customarily used in connection with
        household vacuum cleaners. However, it is important that the
        hose cross section be large enough to permit the desired
        evaporation rate. </p>
      <p>The sorption medium container of the present invention may also
        include a heating device such as an electrical heat conductor
        for heating the sorption medium within the container in order to
        desorb the operating medium which was previously adsorbed. It is
        also advantageous to design the sorption medium container in
        such a manner that the sorption medium filler can be removed
        from the container and replaced with fresh sorption medium. For
        defined application cases, it appears to be advantageous to
        mount the sorption medium filler into a disposable container
        which can be separated and disposed of after use. </p>
      <p>It appears to also be advantageous to design the sorption
        medium container so that the desorption heat supplied to the
        sorption medium expelled to the environment through the sorption
        medium container wall. Particularly suitable are flat containers
        or pipes with a relatively small diameter. </p>
      <p>The sorption medium filler should be mounted within the
        sorption medium container in such a manner that the operating
        medium vapor which flows therein from the evaporator unit can
        reach all portions of the sorption medium without a substantial
        loss in pressure. </p>
      <p>During the sorption of operating medium vapor by the sorption
        medium, heat is provided which results in a heating of the
        sorption medium. As is known, adsorption medium at an elevated
        temperature can absorb noticeably less vapor than cool
        adsorption medium at the same steam pressure. Therefore, care
        should be taken to appropriately discharge the heat to the
        environment or to suitable heat absorbing media. In the
        alternative, the amount of adsorption medium filler can be
        selected to be sufficiently large so that the desired amount of
        cold can be generated without the need for substantial emission
        of the adsorption heat to the environment. </p>
      <p>If a cooling device constructed in accordance with the present
        invention is not manufactured as a closed unitary system wherein
        the correspondingly required vacuum pressure is provided during
        assembly of the unit, it is required to evacuate the adsorption
        medium filler by means of a vacuum pump in order to produce the
        desired cold effect. For this purpose, a suitable vacuum pump is
        connected to the adsorption medium container in order to
        evacuate air and other non-condensable gases from the cooling
        device. Preferably, the internal vacuum pressure has to be
        generated in such a manner that the gases can be removed from
        all regions of the adsorption medium container. In contrast to
        the large diameter vacuum line which connects the evaporator
        unit to the adsorption medium container, the discharge vacuum
        line which couples the adsorption medium to the vacuum pump can
        have a relatively small diameter. </p>
      <p>All commercially available vacuum pumps whose end pressure is
        somewhat lower than the evaporation pressure of the aqueous
        liquid at the desired evaporation temperature are suitable. For
        example, pure water has a steam pressure of 6.1 mbar at
        0.degree. C. In order to evaporate pure water at this
        temperature, the vacuum pump needs an end pressure of about 5
        mbar. </p>
      <p>Particularly suitable are oilfree vacuum pumps which, without
        discharging oil mists, can be installed completely independent
        of their location with respect to the cooling device. In this
        manner, a relatively simply constructed and economical system is
        available for providing cold beverages. In addition to the
        above-described cold medium bottle and vacuum pump, the present
        invention only requires an adsorption cartridge and flexible
        adapter in order to generate cold medium within a storage or
        dispensing bottle. </p>
      <p>It is also particularly advantageous if all structural parts
        are separable from each other. In this manner, the evaporator
        unit, the adsorption medium container and the vacuum pump can be
        combined in any given manner. With a plurality of small
        adsorption medium containers, chlorinated hydrocarbons (CFC's)
        can be discharged from large cold medium plants. By a simple
        exchange of the evaporator unit, any given cold medium bottle
        may be coupled to the adsorption medium container. </p>
      <p>Commonly used vacuum pumps have a 110 V connection. However, it
        is advantageous to utilize pumps which can be operated with 12-V
        or 24-V connections so that the cooling device can be used in a
        passenger car or truck. It is also possible to utilize manually
        operated vacuum pumps so long as the pump creates a sufficient
        vacuum pressure. As a result, camp grounds and other recreation
        areas can be equipped with the inventive cooling device. </p>
      <p>When utilizing water as the operating medium, an ambient
        pressure of below 6.1 mbar is required for water to freeze.
        Therefore, only after the entire water volume is frozen can the
        temperature of the ice fall below 0.degree. C. during a
        continued steam sublimation. If a cooling of the medium within
        the container below 0.degree. C. is desired without freezing the
        water operating medium, it is recommended to add corresponding
        antifreeze agents to the operating medium. In addition, well
        known substances which lower the freezing temperature of the
        operating medium including salt are suitable. However, when
        utilizing antifreeze agents, care should be taken that the
        partial vapor pressure of liquid operating medium is below the
        vapor pressure of pure water operating medium. </p>
      <p>Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have
        been described herein with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that various other
        changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled
        in the art without departing from the cope or spirit of the
        invention. </p>
