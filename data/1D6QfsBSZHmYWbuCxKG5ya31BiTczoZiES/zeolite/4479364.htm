      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention involves sorption apparatus and its method of
        use. The basic thermodynamic principles of sorption units have
        been known since the last century and have developed from very
        simple periodically operating refrigerators to the continuously
        operating absorber-type refrigerators. The recovery of
        fluorinated hydrocarbons and the resulting progress in
        compressor technology produced compression-type refrigeration
        machines after World War II. This completely replaced the
        periodically operating refrigeration machines and left only a
        few fields of application for the continuously operating
        refrigeration machines, i.e. camping refrigerators or cold water
        coolers. The increasing energy cost resulting from the 1973/1974
        energy crisis led to the installation of compression-type
        refrigeration machines with electric drives for heating systems,
        similar to the househould-refrigerator type. Since the total
        efficiency of such heating systems including the efficiency rate
        of power plants, is higher only in individual cases compared
        with the efficiency of updated modern conventional heating
        systems, the idea of continuously operating sorption units with
        direct primary energy supply (fuel oil, fuel gas, coal) was
        again utilized. The advantage of continuously operating sorption
        units lies in the increase of the total performance figure and
        efficiency which can be reached by eliminating the energy losses
        of power plants. </p>
      <p>Since both systems, the compression-type refrigeration machine
        and the continuously operating sorption unit, are initially
        designed for continuous refrigeration, they prove to be
        unsatisfactory in many respects for use in heating systems. </p>
      <p>The basic difference between heat pumps and refrigeration
        machines is in their field of application. Refrigeration
        machines are designed for a continous chilling operation at an
        almost constant cooling level. Since recycling of the waste heat
        from these types of machines was only planned in exceptional
        cases, its quantity and temperature were not of interest. This
        is quite different with heat pumps where the waste heat becomes
        "useful" heat. At low ambient temperatures, this useful heat
        should be available at a higher output temperature and in higher
        quantities. But under those conditions, the temperature of the
        heat source, which was the chilling temperature for
        refrigeration machines, is especially low. Therefore, this means
        that there is a large difference between effective temperature
        and heat source temperature, when the demand for useful heat is
        high. In addition, both temperatures are independent of each
        other and subject to extreme fluctuations not only because of
        changing weather conditions but also because of consumer
        behavior. Therefore, generally when there is sufficient heat
        available from the heat source there is no demand for it and
        when the heat source is exhausted of available heat it is during
        a period of increased heat demand. Under these operating
        conditions, there will be a drastic drop in the performance
        figures of continuously operating apparatus. The result is a
        reduced effective heat generation which must be compensated for
        either by installing additional heat storage capacity and/or
        switching over to an auxiliary heating system. Due to the low
        temperature of the heat sources and the continuing need for
        economic performance figures, the temperature of the useful heat
        in all present heat pump systems have been restricted to values
        below 60.degree. C. This restriction has required the
        installation of low-temperature heating systems, which is only
        economical in new buildings. This is only possible in
        exceptional cases in connection with old or reconstructed or
        renovated buildings. </p>
      <p>All available commercial sorption heat pumps are continuously
        operating units filled with the toxic and inflammable material
        combination of ammonia/water. The maximum legal allowable
        ammonia concentration requires certain switching arrangements
        which are unfavorable for the performance of heat pumps. Other
        more harmless material combinations used in the sorption
        refrigeration technology have been found to be too inefficient
        for use in heat pumps. If one takes into account the high energy
        consumption for solvent pumps and their additional quite high
        susceptibility to wear, the performance figures than can be
        obtained with these machines according to their manufacturers
        are acceptable. However, during practical use, with low heat
        source temperatures, fluctuating heat demands or in case of
        periodic operation, these performance figures cannot be
        attained. In addition, this type of unit is designed for an
        average useful heat demand and an additional heat source must be
        provided for cases of increased heat demand. This produces a
        doubling of investment costs and floor space because the
        required auxiliary equipment must be designed for maximum heat
        demand. </p>
      <p>For an optimum utilization of the heat offered by the heat
        source on one hand and satisfaction of the heat demand as well
        as during periods where primary energy is available at more
        economic rates on the other hand, German Pat. No. DE-OS 25 23
        429 suggests to store the heat from the heat source in a special
        heat retaining mass and later on transfer it to a heat reservoir
        with the aid of a compressor-type heat pump with electric drive,
        taking advantage of the lower night-tariff rates. Generally,
        these proposals cannot always be realized. This is due to
        required large storage capacities and the low temperature of the
        useful heat together with the necessary temperature difference
        in the heat exchangers of the heat reservoir. Thus, an effective
        temperature spreading in the heat retaining mass is almost
        impossible. </p>
      <p>One type of heat reservoir that has been functioning
        satisfactority for decades is the so-called
        "Nachtstromwarmespericher" (heat reservoir taking up electrical
        energy during the night-tariff periods) which is being heated up
        during the low-tariff periods in the night. Here a heat
        retaining mass is being heated up to more than 600.degree. C.
        during low-load/low-tariff periods. The required useful heat
        will then be taken from the specific heat of the heat-retaining
        mass during high-tariff periods (days). However, the necessary
        high storage temperatures will result in extensive heat losses
        despite thicker insulation layers. A heat pump effect is
        impossible. </p>
      <p>European Pat. No. EP-OS 00 262 557 describes a periodically
        operating sorption-type heat reservoir with the objective to
        store the motive energy for the heat pump at sufficiently high
        temperatures. However, the design of this heat reservoir remains
        open and storage of heat coming from a heat source is not
        provided. For a "quasi-continuous operation" the abundant
        provision of two separate sorption storage units is required. </p>
      <p>The objective of all known refrigeration machines is to keep
        the temperature in the chilling section constant without any
        external manipulations. But also for units which are designed
        for waste heat recycling from condensors or boiler absorbers,
        the cooling temperature controllers are designed for maximum
        refrigeration. </p>
      <p>German Pat. No. DE-PS 596 308 describes a device for hot water
        preparation by condensation or else adsorption in a periodically
        operating adsorption-refrigeration unit. However, here the
        thermostat-controllers let warm water run off unused in order
        not to impair the chilling effect. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>With the above background in mind, it is a primary objective of
        the present invention to design a type of sorption unit and to
        develop methods for its operation which allows it to be used as
        a heat pump and for heat storage at the same time. The
        temperature of the heat from a heat source is raised to the
        higher temperature of useful heat with the aid of the heat pump
        effect and is also made storage along with the desorption heat
        required as motive energy for the pump. Discharge of the useful
        heat is controlled independently of the operating phases of the
        sorption unit. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        heating system with a heat-discharge control that can take over
        the function of conventional filament controls and thus also
        replace the frequently installed mixing valves. This results in
        additional simplification and cost-reduction for the
        installation. </p>
      <p>A heat discharge controller is provided and which via an
        operating/controlling device/element controls the evaporation
        pressure of the heat exchange medium. This reduces controlling
        efforts to a minimum. If the sorption medium temperature rises
        due to sorption, or during the desorption phase by heating up,
        or else during periods of low heat demand, the liquid level of
        the heat exchange medium drops due to pressure increase in the
        heat exchanger unit or even disappears completely. Then the
        condenser temperature also drops because less work medium vapor
        enters into the condenser. Because of this, in case of
        re-starting or increasing heat discharge to the consumer, the
        pressure in the heat exchanger unit 11 drops until the heat
        discharge controller again balances the pressure out by
        refilling the heat exchange medium (of the heat exchanger unit).
      </p>
      <p>The heat exchanger unit 11 is connected to the condenser 20 by
        means of a vapor line. This provides an advantage in that the
        useful heat from the boiler adsorber can be transmitted from the
        condenser to the consumer during the cooling down and sorption
        phase. An additional heat exchanger at the consumer end as well
        as a separate controller for the discharge of the useful heat
        are not required. During the sorption phase, the boiler adsorber
        will be separated from the condenser. </p>
      <p>Since during this phase the sorption pressure is lower than the
        condenser pressure, a check valve is provided as a shut-off
        device 13. The installation of a check valve (nonreturn flap) is
        adequate. However, should during the desorption phase and with
        uncontrolled desorption heat charging, the pressure inside the
        boiler adsorber exceed the condenser pressure which is monitored
        by the heat discharge controller, because there is no demand for
        heat, a shut-off device 13 must be installed in the vapor line
        between boiler adsorber 10 and condenser 20. This then overtakes
        the discharge control for the useful heat. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that the boiler adsorber consist of
        more than one identical boiler adsorber unit (10,10a) which can
        be operated independently. This provides a number of additional
        advantages. Splitting up the boiler adsorber unit into several
        boiler adsorber packages/units, allows easy handling and
        transportation of light and handy units to the place of
        installation, easy assembly and flexible accomodation to local
        floor space availability. Also, then if a number of identical
        standardized component parts, which can be interlocked/combined
        as desired via vacuum piping, is restricted, every desired
        storage capacity can be built up step by step by using standard
        prefabricated boiler adsorber packages. To keep the weight low
        for easy handling, these boiler adsorber packages can be filled
        with the sorption medium combination after assembly. It is also
        advantageous in that if several boiler adsorber units are
        installed, any desired number of adsorber units can be put on
        stand-by (or all of them can be shut down) depending upon the
        actual heat demand at any operating phase of the unit (i.e.
        during summer times). </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that the present invention employ an
        adsorption medium combination of zeolite/water. Zeolite-types
        which are very suitable for this surface are those which have a
        high water-absorptive capacity together with a high thermal
        stability at a sufficient vapor pressure reduction. It has been
        found effective to provide a zeolite of the NA-Y type, at least
        partially of that type that has undergone an ionic change with
        magnesium ions. It has also been found effective to provide a
        zeolite which includes less than 18 wt. % bonding agent or
        by-products produced by transformation. It is also contemplated
        that the zeolite be formed into a solid body, provided with flow
        channels and/or its surfaces geometrically formed to exactly
        match the heat-exchanging device surfaces 11. The present
        invention also contemplates the use of atmospheric pressure to
        tightly press the heat exchanger unit 11 and/or the walls of the
        boiler adsorber onto the zeolite. </p>
      <p>Commercial zeolites come in the form of powder and granulates.
        Maximum performance figures can be obtained with zeolites with a
        bonding agent concentration of less than 18 wt. %. The poor
        thermal conductivity of the zeolite can be improved by pressing
        the zeolite into solid forms using the lowest possible bonding
        agent concentration. Preferably, the form of the heat exchanger
        surfaces should be copied or else the zeolite form will be
        pressed or else bonded to the heat exchanger surface. In order
        to keep the pressure loss of the incoming and outgoing steam
        (water vapor) as low as possible, suitable flow channels should
        be provided. </p>
      <p>In contrast to other solid sorption substances zeolites do not
        swell up during adsorption. This allows the heat exchanging
        device to be firmly embedded into the zeolite body. Thus, the
        zeolite and heat exhanging device form a solid and stable body
        with no vacuum-tight sheeting being required. It is only
        necessary that heat exchanger and boiler adsorber walls enclose
        the zeolite blocked vacuum-tightly. External overpressure, i.e.
        atmospheric pressure, can then press the heat exchanging device
        tightly onto the zeolite and thus further improve the heat
        transfer. In addition, the combination of zeolite and water has
        the special advantage of being completely non-toxic and not
        inflammable. Compared with steel sheeting it shows no corrosion.
        As long as the temperature of the useful heat remains below
        100.degree. C., the entire unit will be under vacuum. Expensive
        pressure vessels, alarm systems and excess-pressure protection
        are not required. In order to obtain a higher performance
        figure, the super-heated work medium vapors from the boiler
        adsorber must be passing over sorption medium sections which are
        not directly heated up with primary energy and are, therefore,
        cooler prior to passing the shut-off device. In this manner the
        work medium vapors cool down while the sorption medium is being
        degassed. The result will be noticeably higher performance
        figures. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that the vapor chamber 14 be part of
        the boiler adsorber 10 and, via liquid slide valves 18,19 can be
        blocked off from the evaporation unit 30 and from which the
        liquid brine can be emptied. Thus, it is advantageous that
        expensive and voluminous steam shut-off devices or valves are
        not required. The liquid slide valves at the vapor chamber can,
        in addition, be economically designed as check valves or else as
        float valves. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that a liquid brine flow controller 37
        be provided to control the liquid brine flow through the vapor
        chamber 14. This liquid brine flow controller is especially
        advantageous in that charging of heat from the heat source can
        take place completely independently from the delivery/discharge
        of useful heat. For the effective performance figure only, the
        temperature of the heat source at the end of the sorption phase
        is decisive, not the temperatures prior to this phase.
        Therefore, large temperature fluctuations at the heat source do
        not have any influence on the instantaneous thermal efficiency
        of the temperature of the useful heat. A sudden temperature rise
        in the liquid brine and a pressure rise in the work medium, i.e.
        by incoming hot waste water from a cooling process, only
        actuates the liquid brine flow controller. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that at least one heat exchanger 39 be
        provided in the brine circulation 35. The split-design of the
        evaporation unit into a vapor chamber in which the actual
        evaporation takes place and into at least one heat-absorbing
        heat exchanger unit has the advantage of short work medium vapor
        ways without any restrictions as to the selection of the heat
        source used. At least one heat exchanger can always be installed
        near the heat source or take over the functions of a heat
        collector itself (solar-absorber, absorber-roof, etc.). Thus, in
        case ambient air is used as heat source it is not necessary to
        lead it over voluminous and energy consuming wind tunnels to the
        evaporator. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that the liquid brine be a mixture of
        liquid work medium and an additive which reduces the freezing
        (solidification) point. This makes possible the charging of heat
        into the sorption unit even at heat source temperatures below
        0.degree. C. It is also contemplated that the mixture contain a
        salt or base, the cations of which are identical with the
        cations of the zeolite. In this manner, on one hand an extremely
        low vapor pressure for the admixed medium is provided and, on
        the other hand, a uniformity of the metal cations in the zeolite
        and in the liquid brine. So in case the liquid brine comes in
        contact with the zeolite, there will be no harmful ion exchange.
      </p>
      <p>Another objective is to provide a branch pipe section 33 with a
        shut-off device in the brine circulation 35 in which at least
        part of the liquid brine can be stored, the branch pipe section
        controlling the work medium concentration of the liquid brine
        and being filled up to maximum with liquid brine, at
        temperatures above the freezing/solidification point of the pure
        work medium and being almost completely empty at the lowest
        liquid brine temperatures. This is advantageous in that the
        evaporation pressure in the vapor chamber at temperatures above
        freezing (solidication) point will not unnecessarily be further
        reduced by too high a concentration of anti-freeze agent. A
        portion of the liquid brine is stored in a branch pipe section
        with shut-off device of the liquid brine circulation system,
        while liquid work medium from the storage tank is being added to
        the brine circulation system via the refilling device. Also, in
        the same manner the work medium evaporating in the vapor chamber
        will be replaced through a refilling device 34 for liquid work
        medium in the brine circulation 35. By providing a heat
        exchanger 46 in the work medium line between storage tank 21 and
        refilling device 34, an additional improvement of the
        performance figure can be reached. The liquid work medium is
        cooled in a heat exchanger prior to feeding it into the
        refilling device, i.e. for hot-water preparation. Furthermore,
        by installing at least one heat exchanger 46 in the vapor
        section of the vapor chamber 14, an even more favorable improved
        performance figure is achieved. The heat from the liquid work
        medium is transferred onto the cold work medium vapor inside the
        vapor chamber itself. Then the vapors do not unnecessarily take
        their required portion of specific heat from the useful heat
        available in that section. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that the heat exchanger unit 11 and
        vapor chamber 14 be designed and arranged so that the boiler
        adsorber 10 first cools down in the area/section of the vapor
        chamber 14, and/or that the work medium vapors generated inside
        the vapor chamber 14 pass first over already cooled down
        sections of sorption medium. This makes it possible to pass the
        work medium vapors generated inside the vapor chamber prior to
        absorption over sorption medium sections which under the
        prevailing operating conditions are already saturated, however,
        they will be cooled down further by the colder work medium
        vapors and continue sorbing. Therefore, it is not only possible
        to generate the heat quantity required to super heat the work
        medium vapors in an energetically favorable way, but also to
        improve the heat transfer from the sorption medium to the heat
        exchanger unit by by-passing vapors besides diminishing
        temperature differences. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that a water jet pump 22 be connected
        to condenser 20. This is advantageous in that the entire
        sorption unit can be pumped empty with the water jet pump.
        Disturbing gases, which hinder the adsorption of work medium
        vapors by the sorption medium, will be entrained and compressed
        by the work medium vapors entering the condenser. The condenser
        temperature is here, contrary to the one of refrigeration
        machines which discharge their waste heat at lower temperatures
        and pressures, still high enough to allow a removal of the
        disturbing gases with the water jet pump. </p>
      <p>It is also an objective to provide a metal plate which is
        pressed vacuum tightly against an opening in the boiler adsorber
        wall by atmospheric pressure. In case of excess pressure inside
        the boiler adsorber, the metal plate acts as an excess pressure
        relief valve. The opening (in the boiler adsorber wall) can
        advantageously also be used for boiler adsorber filling and
        inspection. </p>
      <p>During the desorption phase in the present system, it is
        possible to transmit useful heat from the specific heat of the
        sorption medium 12 through the heat exchanger unit 11. In this
        manner, the heating efficiency of the useful heat becomes
        independent of the heating efficiency of the desorption heat.
        This can also be done during the sorption phase so that in case
        heat is not available from the heat source, the supply of useful
        heat is still guaranteed. </p>
      <p>It is also possible with the present system to store heat from
        the heat source as specific heat of the sorption medium 12. If
        an oversupply of heat from the heat source was available, the
        excess heat can be stored immediately at the temperature of the
        useful heat. Also, prior to or during the desorption phase, a
        heat discharge controller 41 can let heat exchange medium flow
        back from the heat exchanger unit 11. This further improves the
        performance figure because the heat exchange medium is not
        unnecessarily being evaporated by the desorption heat. </p>
      <p>Also, at the end of the desorption phase, with the shut-off
        device 13 closed, work medium vapors from the boiler adsorber 10
        can flow into the boiler adsorber 10a via the blockable work
        medium vapor line 44. With this in mind, at the end of the
        desorption phase or at the beginning of the cooling down phase,
        the work medium can be condensed in the liquid brine and the
        heat quantity removed from the boiler adsorber 10 will be
        transmitted to the boiler adsorber 10a through the evaporation
        unit 30. These factors result in a wider degassing range and
        thus a higher performance figure. This indirectly also increases
        the storage capacity because despite an identical desorption
        heat consumption the quantity of useful heat is increasing. An
        alternative is to not add the desorption heat at the end of the
        desorption phase so that the temperature of the sorption medium
        is being reduced while simultaneously the degassing range is
        widening. Heat losses through the insulation layer are
        considerably reduced. Hence a thinner insulation layer can be
        applied, which reduces investment cost and space requirements as
        well. This specific advantage is also gained by permitting the
        work medium vapors generated in the heat exchanger unit 11 to
        flow over the blockable work medium vapor line 42 into the
        boiler adsorber 10a and be sorbed there. The sorption medium is
        cooled down but in addition, the sorption medium can adsorb more
        work medium at the same work medium vapor pressure and thus
        increase the quantity of useful heat generated. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the vapor line from the heat exchanger 11 to the
        condenser 20 can be blocked which produces a different process
        from that immediately described above insofar as here also the
        sorption medium temperature can drop far below the temperature
        of the useful heat. The well known principle of two-stage
        operation can here be reached with most simple means. By this
        method the temperature of the heat from the heat source will be
        brought up to the level of the useful heat temperature in two
        temperature rising steps. Contrary to the known processes, by
        this method the storage capacity and performance figure are also
        noticeably increasing and not decreasing. </p>
      <p>This method can be expanded to a multi-stage operation by
        separating heat exchanger unit 11a from condenser 20 and having
        the work medium vapor flow from unit 11a into a second boiler
        adsorber unit where it is being adsorbed. </p>
      <p>A further modification of the system is to permit the work
        medium vapor coming from heat exchanger unit 11 to enter into
        heat exchanger unit 11a and still be super heated. This results
        in an increase of the performance figure because the transmitted
        heat quantities are part of the desorption heat. </p>
      <p>Also provided for is the possibility of heating the brine
        circulation 35 by low-tariff electrical power during the
        sorption phase. This is in the form of an additional electrical
        backup heating system used during low-tariff periods and the
        useful heat quantity thus available is then only being increased
        by the mere sorption heat quantity. </p>
      <p>The system also provides for utilization of this mere sorption
        heat quantity without any electrical backup heating. This is
        accomplished by having the work medium vapor from heat exchanger
        unit 11 flow into boiler adsorber 10 through the open shut-off
        device 13 where it is being sorbed by the sorption medium 12.
        The operating cost for sorption units can be reduced further by
        taking not only advantage of the night-tariff periods (as
        described earlier) but also of other low-tariff/low-load periods
        of power plants, i.e. weekend-tariffs which might be more
        economical since this type of unit does not have any peak power
        requirements and power plants working of base-load operation can
        also be kept on line on weekends. Despite a higher power demand,
        new power plants will not be required. Pitcoal power plants can
        also be kept on line on weekends and help substitute for heating
        systems that normally use fuel oil as feed stock. </p>
      <p>A further modification involves the cooling down in
        chronological order of boiler adsorber units 10 and 10a, one
        after the other. It is possible to start the sorption phase
        (cooling process) or else to take available heat from the heat
        source at an earlier stage, after the desorption phase, in case
        a boiler adsorber unit had not been kept on stand-by.
        Effective/useable waste heat will not be lost. </p>
      <p>Another special advantage of the present system is the fact
        that heat from a heat source can be charged into the system
        independently of the prevailing operating conditions/phases of
        the sorption unit. Thus, if P.sub.S &lt;P.sub.A, the liquid
        brine flow controller 37 sends the liquid brine through the
        vapor chamber 14. This allows the utilization of all types of
        waste heat from industrial plants, trade establishments and
        houehold without intermediate heat storage even with
        considerably fluctuating temperatures. Also the waste heat from
        waste material combustion furnaces can be used profitably.
        Another possible heat source, which has not yet been used, is
        the automobile. The specific heat of the hot motor block can be
        transmitted without extensive additional investments to the
        sorption unit via the cooling water circulation. For this, after
        having just used the automobile for driving, it will be
        connected to a heat exchanger of the evaporator unit with a snap
        coupling. </p>
      <p>With the present system the consumer can also either take
        useful heat from the condenser or return excess heat to the
        brine circulation. This will be accomplished by supplying brine
        circuit 35 with heat from the consumer 50 during the sorption
        phase. This way, the heating system of the consumer will become
        a cooling system. This means that during summertimes, and if the
        condenser is being by-passed, rooms can be cooled with the same
        radiators that are used for heating during winter periods. Thus,
        a conventional heating system can be changed into a cooling
        system with only a few additional investments. The heat
        discharged by the condenser can then be used profitably, i.e. to
        heat up a swimming pool. If the condenser is not being by-passed
        and the cooling effect is not being used, the same advantages
        can be expected as when the work medium vapor from the heat
        exchanger unit 11 flows into the boiler adsorber 10 through the
        open shut-off device 13 where it is being sorbed by the sorption
        medium 12. </p>
      <p>It is also contemplated that if P.sub.S &gt;P.sub.A, the liquid
        brine flow controller 37 can send the liquid brine through the
        vapor chamber 14, the vapor chamber will be transformed into a
        condenser because work medium from the sorption medium condenses
        into the liquid brine and warms it up. Over the brine
        circulation system, heating and cooling are possible. The heat
        removed from the liquid brine inside vapor chamber 14 can be
        stored outside the evaporation unit 30 in an underground
        collector, icehouse, etc. </p>
      <p>It is also possible with the present system to reach a
        single-step temperature increase of more than 100.degree. C. in
        a unit. This makes it possible to provide in one process step
        simultaneously either ice or hot water, or at different times.
        This is accomplished by having the temperature of the useful
        heat over 100.degree. C. during the sorption phase and the
        evaporation temperature inside the vapor chamber 14 below
        0.degree. C. </p>
      <p>If the desorption heat in the present system is generated by
        the combustion of solid, liquid or gaseous materials/fuels, the
        sorption unit can be used to utilize the waste heat from solid
        waste combustion (i.e. wood, straw, paper, wastes, etc.). The
        total operating time of the burners can, under these provisions,
        be reduced to 1/4 of the normally required burner operating
        time. A combustion furnace for solid materials need only be
        refilled once/day or week whereas the combustion period must not
        be interrupted. During furnace shut-down, the sorption unit
        takes over the useful heat supply. If the useful heat demand
        does not rise (during the combustion period), the burner
        efficiency approximately triples. Therefore, even for minimum
        heat output, larger burners can be installed which operate at a
        higher efficiency rate and have a reduced emission of harmful
        materials. Also, open fireplaces and tile stoves can thus
        effectively be connected to sorption units. </p>
      <p>The processes and methods of the present system can in
        principle all be combined in any desired order. </p>
      <p>With the above objectives among others in mind, references made
        to the attached drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1c shows the basic arrangement of the specific sorption
        unit of the invention. In the upper section of a conventional
        boiler adsorber 10 is sorption medium 12 and a heat exchanging
        device 11. A vapor chamber 14 of the present invention is in the
        lower section of the conventional boiler adsorber 10 and the
        vapor chamber 14 is also a part of the evaporation unit 30.
        Evaporation unit 30 is actually a conventional circulation
        evaporator type with a separate vapor chamber 14 and a heat
        exchanger 38. From here, useful heat can also be supplied to a
        consumer 50. </p>
      <p>A heat discharge controller 41 which actuates the
        operating/controlling device/element 40 monitors the heat
        transmission to the condenser 20 completely independently of the
        operation conditions of the boiler adsorber 10. An additional
        shut-off device 13 is provided over which heat from a heat
        source can be charged into the boiler adsorber 10 via the heat
        exchanger 38 also during the sorption phase. An additional
        transfer point 60 at the consumer 50, shown as a dotted line in
        FIG. 1c, is therefore not necessary. For the operation of the
        sorption unit, a storage tank 21, a refilling device 34, and a
        brine pump 36 are also provided. </p>
      <p>In order to simplify operation of the system depicted in
        schematic form 1a-1c, only the absolutely necessary equipment
        parts are depicted for each respective operating step, or having
        been used during the three consecutive operating phases,
        starting with the desorption phase, 1a. </p>
      <p>The three operating phases of the sorption unit are as follows
        (FIG. 1): </p>
      <p>1. Desorption Phase (FIG. 1a) </p>
      <p>During this phase the work medium is expelled from the sorption
        medium 12 by a supply of desorption heat at high temperatures
        and then condensed in the condenser 20 at the temperature of the
        useful heat. The condensed work medium will then be stored in
        the storage tank 21. As soon as the final temperature of the
        sorption medium has been reached, the desorption heat supply
        will be interrupted. During this phase, the useful heat will be
        transmitted to the consumer 50 via the condenser 20. </p>
      <p>2. Cooling Down Phase (FIG. 1b) </p>
      <p>Through heat exchangers 11, the stored specific heat of the
        sorption medium 12 will be discharged to the consumer. This will
        be done either via the heat exchange circulation 61, as shown in
        dotted lines, or, again by way of the condenser 20. The heat
        discharge controller 41 monitors the evaporation pressure of the
        work medium in the heat exchanger unit 11 over the
        operating/controlling device/element 40. The sorption medium 12
        will cool down and reduce the work medium vapor pressure in the
        boiler adsorber 10 to a value below the pressure inside the
        condenser 20 at the beginning of this process. </p>
      <p>3. Sorption Phase (FIG. 1c) </p>
      <p>As soon as the work medium vapor pressure in the boiler
        adsorber 10 drops below the work medium vapor pressure in the
        evaporator 30, the sorption phase begins. Work medium from the
        brine circulation 35 evaporates in the vapor chamber 14 at low
        temperatures and flows into the sorption medium 12 where it is
        being sorbed at higher temperatures and thereby sets its
        sorption heat free. The cooled down liquid brine will be warmed
        up again in heat exchanger 38 and then supplied again to the
        vapor chamber 14. But prior to this the work medium, lost by
        evaporation in the vapor chamber 14 is replaced in the refilling
        device 34 from storage tank 21. During this phase the sorption
        heat is transmitted/supplied to the consumer 50 in the same
        manner as during the cooling down phase as described above. </p>
      <p>Supplementary to FIG. 1c, FIG. 2 shows an arrangement where
        more than one boiler adsorber is installed. In this arrangement,
        the heat exchanger units 11, 11a are equipped with an electrical
        heating system 17, 17a. Only the sorption medium sections 16,
        16a upstream of the shut-off devices 13, 13a will not be heated.
        The condenser 20 and a water jet pump 22 are installed on the
        heat discharge side upstream of the storage tank 21. On the
        bottom end of storage tank 21 the heat discharge controller 41
        monitors the flow to the heat exchanger units 11, 11a via the
        operating/controlling device/element 40. From here a work medium
        line runs to the evaporation unit 30 which, includes a brine
        circulation 35 with a branch pipe section with shut-off device
        33, refilling device 34 and the brine pump 36. This circulation
        is connected to the vapor chambers 14, 14a via the liquid flow
        valves 18, 18a and 19, 19a and the liquid brine flow controller
        37. The two boiler adsorber units 10, 10a are connected over the
        two work medium vapor lines 42 and 44. </p>
      <p>The sorption medium 12 is heated up by the electrical heating
        system 17 preferably during low-tariff periods. The work medium
        vapors are set free during this phase and will increase the
        pressure inside the boiler adsorber 10 so that it exceeds the
        condenser pressure. Now shut-off valve 13 will unblock the vapor
        line to condenser 20. During this desorption phase only work
        medium vapors are inside vapor chamber 14, because the liquid
        flow valves 18, 19 have interrupted the brine circulation 35.
        The work medium separated from the sorption medium 12, condensed
        in condenser 20 by supplying its heat to consumer 50, recollects
        in storage tank 21. Water jet pump 22 then removes the
        uncondensible gases from condenser 20. </p>
      <p>At the end of the desorption phase, the shut-off valve 13
        closes the line to the condenser. Then, heat discharge
        controller 41 fills liquid work medium from the storage tank,
        controlled by the heat consumer 50, into heat exchanger 11. Here
        the work medium evaporates cooling the sorption medium 12 down
        from bottom to top. The vapor pressure inside the boiler
        adsorber 10 then drops with the shut-off valve 13 still closed.
        As soon as this pressure has dropped below the evaporation
        pressure of the liquid brine, liquid flow valves 18 and 19
        unblock brine circulation 35 through vapor chamber 14,
        controlled by liquid brine flow controller 37. Here the work
        medium evaporates and gives adsorption heat to the sorption
        medium 12 at a higher temperature or else discharges this heat
        to the condenser 20 by way of heat exchanger unit 11. If
        required, refilling device 34 replaces the water having
        evaporated inside the vapor chamber 14 by filling up brine
        circulation 35 from storage tank 21. </p>
      <p>In order to further increase the storage capacity, sorption
        medium 12 will be cooled down below the effective temperature
        (of the useful heat), by separating the condenser 20 from heat
        exchanger unit 11 and feeding work medium vapors from heat
        exchanger unit 11 via the blockable work medium vapor line 42
        into the boiler adsorber 10a. Because of the higher work medium
        vapor pressure, the adsorption medium 12a in the boiler adsorber
        10a will continue sorbing and the heat thus being set free can
        be supplied, to the consumer 50 via the heat exchanger unit 11a.
        If during the sorption phase there is no possibility of charging
        heat from the heat source via the evaporator unit 30 into the
        system, this heat will be taken from the boiler adsorber 10 -
        heat exchanger system 11, by feeding a partial stream of the
        work medium vapor stream via shut-off valve 13 into the boiler
        adsorber 10 where it is being sorbed by the sorption medium. </p>
