      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A cooling element with a sorbent material (4) which in vacuo
        can sorb a vaporous working medium that evaporates from a fluid
        working medium in an evaporator (29) and with a shut-off means
        which, up to the moment at which the cooling process is
        initiated, prevents the working medium vapor from flowing into
        the sorbent material (4), with the sorbent material (4) being
        sealed into a sorbent-containing pouch (22) which comprises a
        multilayer sheeting material which in turn comprises at least
        one metallic layer or one metallized layer. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates to a cooling sorption
        element with a gas-impermeable sheeting, wherein cold is
        generated by means of evaporation of a working medium and
        subsequent in vacuo sorption of the working medium vapor in a
        sorbent material and to a method for producing and activating
        these cooling elements. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Adsorption devices are apparatuses in which a solid
        adsorbent material sorbs a second medium which boils at a lower
        temperature, the so-called working medium, in the form of a
        vapor while releasing heat (sorption phase). In the course of
        this process, the working fluid evaporates in an evaporator
        while sorbing heat. After the sorbent material is saturated, it
        can be re-desorbed when heat at higher temperatures is added to
        it (desorption phase). At that time, the working medium
        evaporates from the adsorbent material. The working medium vapor
        can be recondensed and can subsequently be re-evaporated in the
        evaporator, etc. </p>
      <p>[0003] Absorption devices are apparatuses in which a liquid
        absorbent material is used. The broader term "sorption devices"
        includes both adsorption and absorption systems. </p>
      <p>[0004] Adsorption apparatuses for cooling with solid sorbent
        materials are known from EP 0 368 111 and from DE-OS 34 25 419.
        Sorbent containers filled with sorbent materials draw off the
        working fluid medium which forms in an evaporator and sorb it
        while releasing heat. This heat of sorption must be dissipated
        from the sorbent. The cooling devices can be used for cooling
        and heating food products in thermally insulated containers. </p>
      <p>[0005] WO 01/10738 A1 describes a self-cooling beverage can in
        which an evaporator is disposed inside and a sorber outside the
        can. Cooling is initiated by opening a vapor passageway between
        the evaporator and the sorber. Via the surfaces of the
        evaporator, the cold generated in said evaporator is transferred
        to the beverage to be cooled inside the can. The heat generated
        in the sorbent material is stored in a heat buffer. Compared to
        a conventional can, this self-cooling beverage can is modified
        considerably and is expensive to manufacture. </p>
      <p>[0006] Additional theoretical embodiments of self-cooling
        assemblies are listed in WO 99/37958 A1. None of these devices
        can be implemented and produced inexpensively. </p>
      <p>[0007] U.S. Pat. No. 6,474,100 also describes a self-cooling
        cooling element disposed on the outer surface of a pouch for
        holding liquids or bulk products. The sorbent material is
        enclosed in a flexible, multilayered sheeting material. Contact
        with the hot sorber filling is reduced to a minimum by
        insulating and flow materials as well as by heat-storage
        materials interposed in between. The temperature compensation
        between the hot sorber filling and the cold evaporator, large
        surfaces of which face each other, has to be reduced by means of
        a complicated insulating system. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0008] The problem to be solved by the present invention is to
        make available inexpensive cooling sorption elements for
        generating cold as well as a method for producing same. </p>
      <p>[0009] During the sorption process, sorbent materials may reach
        temperatures of more than 100.degree. C. The multilayered
        sheeting materials used in the packaging industry are not
        suitable for such high temperatures. Especially the polyethylene
        layers used for sealing soften at a temperature as low as
        80.degree. C. and cause the covering layer to become permeable
        in vacuo. A sealing layer made of polypropylene, on the other
        hand, is able to withstand considerably high temperatures. Its
        melting point is higher than 150.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0010] In combination with high temperatures, sharp edges,
        corners and pointed tips of sorbent granules lead to
        inadmissible leaks. This risk is eliminated according to the
        present invention by using a minimum of one polyester layer
        within the multilayer sheeting material. Polyester sheeting
        materials are especially tear- and puncture-resistant. The
        actual gas barrier is implemented by a layer of a thin metal
        sheeting material or a metallized layer. For this purpose, it
        proved to be useful to employ thin aluminum foil layers with a
        layer thickness of approximately 8 .mu.m. Metallized plastic
        sheeting materials are less impermeable. If the length of
        storage time is short, however, it is possible to use these
        metallized sheeting materials as well, especially since they can
        be produced less expensively than the metal sheeting materials.
      </p>
      <p>[0011] The separate layers of a multilayer sheeting material
        are joined to one another by means of adhesive layers.
        Commercially available adhesives contain solvents which, during
        bonding, are not completely removed from the adhesive layer.
        Over relatively long periods of time, these solvents diffuse
        through the inner-lying layers, in particular the polyethylene
        layer, and have a negative effect on the vacuum inside the
        cooling element. The diffusion increases at higher temperatures,
        such as are observed during the sorption and production process
        of the cooling elements. The adhesives used therefore must also
        be designed to be able to resist high temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0012] According to the present invention, the multilayer
        sheeting materials used have a polyester layer thickness of
        12-50 .mu.m, an aluminum layer thickness of 6-12 .mu.m, and a
        polypropylene layer thickness of 50-100 .mu.m. Such sheeting
        materials are used, e.g., for packaging food products which
        after packaging are sterilized at temperatures of more than
        120.degree. C. so as to preserve them. </p>
      <p>[0013] Even more stable multilayer sheeting materials are
        obtained when an additional polyester layer with a thickness of
        approximately 15 .mu.m is glued between the aluminum layer and
        the polypropylene layer. In this case, sharp-edged or sharply
        pointed sorbent components are unable to advance to the gas
        barrier, i.e., the aluminum layer. </p>
      <p>[0014] Multilayer sheeting materials are available, e.g., from
        the firm of Wipf AG in Volketswil, Switzerland. The use of such
        sheeting materials makes it possible to ensure leakage rates of
        less than 1.times.10.sup.-7 mbar l/sec. Thus, a storage ability
        over several years is ensured, without impairment to the cooling
        ability. </p>
      <p>[0015] In the food industry, the steps of heat-sealing of
        multilayer sheeting materials to form pouches and filling bulk
        materials into such pouches and subsequently evacuating them are
        part of prior art. </p>
      <p>[0016] In said industry, pouches in a very large number of
        sizes and shapes are used. Especially worth mentioning are
        stand-up pouches, pouches with pour openings, pouches with
        cardboard reinforcement, easy-tear pouches, peel pouches for
        easier opening, and pouches with valves. All of these pouches
        with their specific properties can be used to advantage for the
        cooling elements according to the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0017] When filling a solid sorbent material into pouches, dust
        is generated, which dust is deposited on the inside surfaces of
        the sheeting material. Dust on the future sealing surfaces can
        lead to leaks if the layer of dust is excessively thick with
        respect to the polypropylene layer. Polypropylene layer
        thicknesses between 50 and 100 .mu.m suffice to melt fine dust
        particles securely and hermetically into the polypropylene
        layer. </p>
      <p>[0018] The use of sheeting materials according to the present
        invention makes it possible to directly enclose in vacuo hot,
        sharp-edged and dust-releasing sorbent material without
        additional protective intermediate layers and to store it over a
        period of several years, without foreign gases which interfere
        with or even completely prevent the sorption reaction being able
        to advance from the sheeting material as such or through said
        material into the cooling element. </p>
      <p>[0019] The sorbent material preferably used is zeolite. In its
        normal crystal structure, said zeolite can reversibly sorb up to
        36 wt % water. When used according to the present invention, the
        industrially feasible ability to absorb water is in a range from
        20-25%. Zeolites continue to have a remarkable ability to sorb
        water vapor even at relatively high temperatures (above
        100.degree. C.) and therefore are especially suitable for the
        application according to the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0020] Zeolite is a crystalline mineral which contains silicon
        and aluminum oxides in its skeletal structure. This highly
        regular skeletal structure contains cavities in which water
        molecules can be sorbed while releasing heat. Within the
        skeletal structure, the water molecules are subjected to high
        field forces, the strength of which depends on the quantity of
        water contained in the skeletal structure and on the temperature
        of the zeolite. </p>
      <p>[0021] Natural types of zeolite occurring in nature take up
        markedly less water. Per 100 g of natural zeolite, only 7-11 g
        of water are sorbed. This reduced ability to sorb water is
        attributable to the specific crystal structures of said
        zeolites, on the one hand, and to the nonactive impurities of
        the natural product. As a result, the use of synthetic zeolites
        with their higher sorbability is to be preferred for cooling
        elements which, during a relatively long cooling period, are
        also able to release heat of sorption via the outer covering
        layer. According to the present invention, natural zeolites are
        used for cooling elements with a high cooling capacity and/or a
        short cooling time during which the sorbent material remains
        relatively hot. The reason is that at high temperatures of the
        sorbent material, synthetic zeolites no longer have an advantage
        over natural zeolites. Typically, in cases of a retarded release
        of the heat of sorption and, associated with this, high
        temperatures of the sorbent material of more than 100.degree.
        C., both types are able to sorb only 4-5 g of water vapor per
        100 g of dry sorbent material. In this specific case, the use of
        the natural zeolites is economically even preferable since their
        price is considerably lower. </p>
      <p>[0022] Natural zeolites have yet another advantage. The
        nonactive admixtures are typically in a range from 10-30%. Thus,
        they are not actively participating in the generation of cold,
        but they are still heated by the neighboring zeolite crystal. As
        a result, they serve as an additional built-in, inexpensive heat
        buffer. This has the effect that the zeolite filling becomes
        less hot and thus is able to sorb additional water vapor at
        lower temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0023] Natural zeolite granules consist of broken and crushed
        fragments and therefore have sharp-edged and sharply pointed
        geometric shapes which, in vacuo and at increased temperatures,
        can pierce or cut through the outer covering layer. </p>
      <p>[0024] Another disadvantage of natural, but also of
        synthetically produced, zeolites is that, depending on their
        occurrence and the mining techniques used, they contain
        impurities which, in vacuo and especially at higher
        temperatures, release gaseous components that have a negative
        effect on the cooling process. </p>
      <p>[0025] This problem of gas release is solved in that prior to
        producing the cooling element, natural zeolites are heated to at
        least the future temperature of the sorbent material and are
        subsequently subjected to a vacuum. According to the present
        invention, in the course of this procedure, zeolites are able to
        release the interfering impurities. This thermal treatment is
        especially effective if the previously sorbed water can be
        evaporated at the same time. To be able to carry out this
        treatment at increased temperatures and to withstand the
        sharp-edged corners and sharply pointed tips, gas-impermeable
        multilayer sheeting materials with an inner polypropylene layer
        and a minimum of one polyester layer are used according to the
        present invention. </p>
      <p>[0026] Of the approximately 30 different natural zeolites, the
        following can be advantageously used for the cooling elements
        according to the present invention: clinoptilolite, chabazite,
        mordenite and phillipsite. </p>
      <p>[0027] Substances occurring in nature can also be returned to
        nature without worry about environmental regulations. After
        their use in cooling elements, natural zeolites can be used,
        e.g., as soil conditioners, as liquid-binding agents, or to
        improve the quality of the water in stagnant bodies of water. </p>
      <p>[0028] Among the synthetic types of zeolites, the use of types
        A, X and Y in their inexpensive Na form is recommended. </p>
      <p>[0029] In addition to the combination of zeolite and water,
        other solid sorbent material combinations are also possible for
        use in cooling elements according to the present invention.
        Especially worth mentioning are bentonites and salts which,
        together with water as the working medium, constitute suitable
        combinations. Even activated charcoal in combination with
        alcohols can offer an advantageous solution. Since these
        material combinations also work at a reduced pressure, they can
        be sealed into the multilayer sheeting materials according to
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0030] According to the present invention, the quantity of
        sorbent material used should be dimensioned and disposed in such
        a way that the inflowing water vapor needs to overcome only a
        minimum pressure drop within the sorbent material. Especially
        when water is used as the working medium, the pressure drop
        should be less than 5 mbar. Furthermore, the sorbent material
        should have a sufficiently large surface for the inflowing
        working medium vapor to accumulate on. To ensure uniform
        sorption within the sorbent material as well as a low pressure
        drop, it was found that sorbent granules are especially useful.
        The best results were obtained with granule diameters between 3
        and 10 mm. Such granules can be readily packed in pouches made
        of the sheeting material. After evacuation, said pouches form a
        hard, pressure-resistant and dimensionally stable sorbent
        container which retains the shape forced on it during the
        evacuation. Also of advantage are, however, stable,
        shape-retaining zeolite blocks preshaped from zeolite powder,
        with flow passageways already incorporated into them and in
        shapes that conform to the geometry of the desired cooling
        elements. In the area of the future opening for vapor, the
        stable zeolite blocks may have hollow spaces which facilitate
        the cutting of the sheeting material by means of a cutting tool
        and which are able to retain the punched-out piece of sheeting
        material so as to not inhibit the flow through the vapor
        passageway. </p>
      <p>[0031] During the sorption reaction, heat of sorption which
        heats the sorbent material is released. At higher temperatures
        of the sorbent material, the sorbability for water decreases
        markedly. To maintain a high cooling capacity over a longer
        period of time, it is recommended that the sorbent material be
        cooled. </p>
      <p>[0032] On direct contact of the sorbent material with the
        multilayer sheeting material, heat of sorption that forms can be
        dissipated unimpeded through the sheeting material to the
        outside. As a rule, the heat will be dissipated to the
        surrounding air. Another highly effective way to cool the
        sorbent material container is to use fluids, in particular
        water. </p>
      <p>[0033] Since the heat transfer to an air flow from the outside
        of the sorbent-containing pouch is within the same range as the
        heat transfer from sorbent material granules to the inside of
        the pouch, it is recommended that large sheeting material
        surfaces without fluting, such as cylindrical, platelike or
        tubular geometries, be used. Since especially zeolite granules
        have a low heat conductibility, the sorbent containers should be
        designed so that the average heat conduction path within the
        sorbent material does not exceed 5 cm. </p>
      <p>[0034] The cooling elements according to the present invention
        can be classified according to the following fields of
        application: a) Rapid cooling of a liquid (e.g., cooling an 0.75
        L champagne bottle from 25.degree. C. to 8.degree. C. within a
        period of 15 min); b) Long-term cooling of an air flow (e.g.,
        cooling an air flow in a respiratory air cooler); c) Keeping
        beverages and food products cold and/or warm (e.g., keeping a
        meal warm while simultaneously keeping a previously cooled
        beverage cold over a relatively long transport time); and d)
        Delaying the thawing process of a frozen product (e.g., keeping
        an ice cream container cold (below -10.degree. C.) after removal
        from the freezing compartment up to the subsequent consumption
        or during transport). </p>
      <p>[0035] The cooling elements according to the present invention
        can meet the requirements demanded by practically all of these
        different applications. All applications are marked by the fact
        that a cooling element is stored at a given temperature over an
        indefinite period of time. To initiate the cooling effect, the
        shut-off means is activated at the time desired. Beginning at
        this point in time, working medium vapor can flow to and
        accumulate in the sorbent material. The sorbent material adsorbs
        the vapor within its crystal structure. The evaporator cools
        down and can be used as a refrigeration source. In applications
        that require rapid cooling (e.g., cooling of a liquid), the time
        will generally not be long enough to substantially cool the
        sorbent material. The ability to sorb working medium vapor will
        therefore be limited because of the high temperatures of the
        sorbent material unless admixtures serve as heat buffers. </p>
      <p>[0036] With a cooling element having a longer cooling time, the
        sorbent material will be able to dissipate heat via the
        multilayer sheeting material and, depending on the application,
        transfer this heat at a higher temperature level to a product
        that is to be kept warm. </p>
      <p>[0037] In applications in the freezing temperature range,
        sufficiently large flow passageways and possibly additives to
        the working fluid that lower the freezing point will have to be
        considered. </p>
      <p>[0038] To minimize the heat flow from the hot sorbent material
        to the cold evaporator, it is necessary to either provide for
        insulating materials or, as proposed by the present invention,
        to ensure that the two components are spatially sufficiently
        separated. </p>
      <p>[0039] Especially inexpensive cooling elements can be obtained
        if the evaporator is also sealed into a gas-impermeable sheeting
        material. In vacuo, the flow passageways to the sorbent material
        must be retained. For this purpose, the present invention
        provides for spacers which allow the working medium vapor to
        unimpededly dissipate from the working fluid and, at the same
        time, ensure good thermally conducting contact between the cold
        surfaces and the sheeting material. </p>
      <p>[0040] For this purpose it is also of advantage to use flexible
        spacers made of a plastic material, which spacers are adapted to
        the cooling application at hand. A prerequisite, however, is
        that the plastic spacers do not outgas during the storage time
        and thus have a negative effect on the vacuum. It is recommended
        that the plastic used for this purpose be polycarbonate or
        polypropylene since these materials can be heated to high
        temperatures and thus be outgassed prior to or during the
        manufacturing process. It is of special advantage if this
        increase in temperature takes place at the same time that the
        sorbent material is heated during the manufacture of the cooling
        element. </p>
      <p>[0041] Spacers made of a plastic material can be inexpensively
        manufactured using conventional manufacturing methods, such as
        thermoforming, extrusion or blow molding. It is recommended that
        care be taken to ensure that no materials that will outgas at a
        later point in time, such as softening agents, are added during
        the manufacturing process. </p>
      <p>[0042] The cooling elements can also be classified according to
        the shut-off means used: e) The vapor passageway from the
        evaporator to the sorbent material is opened (e.g., by piercing
        a pouch which is made of the sheeting material and which
        encloses the sorbent material); and f) The fluid line from a
        storage tank to the evaporator is opened (e.g., by bursting a
        water-containing pouch and allowing the water to be discharged
        into the evaporator). From there, it evaporates and flows on to
        the sorbent material. </p>
      <p>[0043] In the first example, the multilayer sheeting material
        enclosing the sorbent material can be pierced. For this purpose,
        it is suitable to use sharp-edged cutting tools which cut a
        sufficiently large hole into the sheeting material. The cutting
        tool can be activated both from the side of the sorbent material
        and from the side of the evaporator. Since the sheeting
        materials according to the present invention are flexible, the
        cutting tool is actuated according to the present invention by a
        deformation exerted on the sheeting materials from the outside.
        In this manner, it is possible to design the shut-off means
        inexpensively and actuate them gas-impermeably. </p>
      <p>[0044] In all cases, the cutting tool must be sufficiently
        sharp-edged to cut the sheeting material through the cross
        section required. Suitable for this purpose are, for example,
        cylindrically shaped expanded metals or sharp-edged
        injection-molded components made of a plastic material which, in
        addition, are also able to squeeze or move the sorbent material
        behind the sheeting material so as to securely cut through the
        sheeting material. </p>
      <p>[0045] The same principle obviously also applies to shut-off
        means (scenario f) that need to provide only a small opening for
        the pouch made of the sheeting material and containing the fluid
        working medium. According to the present invention, an
        additional pouch made of the sheeting material and containing
        the appropriate quantity of working medium and having a
        connecting passageway can be molded onto the evaporator sheeting
        material. According to the present invention, the passageway
        disposed between the sorbent material and the fluid working
        medium can be shut off by providing that the sheeting material
        has one or more kinks in this area, thereby compressing the
        polypropylene layers to one another. In combination with the air
        pressure exerted from the outside, this measure leads to a
        sufficient seal between the pouch containing the working medium
        and the evaporator. The kinked passageway thus forms a closed
        fluid valve. To open said passageway, the sheeting material in
        the area of the passageway is simply folded back into its
        original shape, and the working medium is optionally pressed
        into the evaporator by exerting pressure on the pouch containing
        the working medium. </p>
      <p>[0046] Another useful embodiment is obtained by inserting a
        separate pouch containing fluid working medium into the
        evaporator. By means of external pressure on the covering
        material of the evaporator, the pouch containing the working
        medium can be made to burst, thus allowing the fluid working
        medium to flow, e.g., into a nonwoven evaporator. In this case,
        the torn-open leakage site forms the fluid valve. </p>
      <p>[0047] According to other embodiments, the evaporator in
        combination with the sorbent material can be disposed inside the
        sorbent-containing pouch. Only when the fluid valve allows the
        working medium to enter the evaporator is it possible for the
        working medium to evaporate from said evaporator and to flow in
        the form of a vapor into the sorbent material. The advantage of
        this type of shut-off means is that only a relatively small
        cross section must be opened for the fluid working medium to be
        able to flow through. The disadvantage, on the other hand, is
        that the working medium must homogeneously wet the evaporator at
        a sufficiently rapid speed, without being entrained in liquid
        form into the sorber or possibly even turning into ice as it
        exits the opening, which would block the further inflow. </p>
      <p>[0048] As known, it is possible to prevent the working medium,
        here water, from turning to ice by admixing an agent that
        reduces the freezing point. An addition of common salt, e.g.,
        can lower the freezing point down to -17.degree. C. It suffices
        if the freezing point-lowering agent is simply disposed around
        the discharge opening of the water pouch. Only when the water
        exits from the opening is it mixed with the highly concentrated
        freezing point-lowering agent. Thus, the possibility of the
        water solidifying is thereby avoided. Next, the subsequently
        exiting water dilutes the solution and transports the working
        medium into all areas of the evaporator. </p>
      <p>[0049] A homogeneous distribution of the working medium can
        also be implemented by means of a separate, finely branched
        passageway structure which homogeneously distributes the working
        medium after said working medium has passed through the shut-off
        means and before it could be entrained in liquid form by the
        vapor flow. Such a distribution can be inexpensively implemented
        by means of a layer of a finely perforated sheeting material
        which is disposed around the discharge opening. </p>
      <p>[0050] Only in exceptional cases will the working medium be
        present in the evaporator in uncombined form. In most cases, it
        is distributed in an absorptive nonwoven material where it is
        retained by means of hygroscopic forces. Particularly
        inexpensive materials are absorptive papers, such as are used in
        many different varieties in households and industry for
        absorbing liquids. Like the spacers made of a plastic material
        or natural zeolite, the water-storing nonwoven materials should
        not outgas in vacuo or at high temperatures. It was found that
        commercially available microfibers made of polypropylene were
        especially suitable for this purpose. The fibers are designed to
        absorb water and do not emit any gases that can interfere with
        the vacuum. </p>
      <p>[0051] Another solution proposed is the fixation of the working
        fluid in organic binding agents, e.g., in water lock of Grain
        Processing Corp., USA. A combination of several of the measures
        mentioned above may also be useful. </p>
      <p>[0052] According to the present invention, to quickly cool a
        fluid in a fluid container, the outer surface of the fluid
        container is pressed to the evaporator surface of the cooling
        element. This can be very effectively implemented by disposing
        the fluid container directly within the evaporator sheeting
        material. As a result of the negative pressure between the
        multilayer sheeting material and the fluid container, it is
        possible for the spacer to press the nonwoven material at a high
        compressive force onto the surface of the container and thus
        utilize a large portion of the sometimes highly structured
        surface of the container for the transfer of heat. </p>
      <p>[0053] This assembly, however, is to be recommended only if the
        container material as such does not emit any gas and a
        potentially existing closure for the future discharge of the
        beverage is sufficiently leakproof. If this cannot be ensured or
        if the outer surface of the assembly has gassing labels glue to
        it, the fluid container as such is first heat-sealed in vacuo
        into a gas-impermeable outer sheeting material. This
        gas-impermeable packaging can subsequently be directly disposed
        within the evaporator outer cover sheeting. In contrast to the
        multilayer sheeting material which surrounds the sorbent
        material, the outer cover sheeting for the fluid container need
        not be able to withstand high temperatures. Thus, it is possible
        to use, e.g., thin metallized sheeting materials with a more
        readily processible polyethylene layer. </p>
      <p>[0054] Yet another solution according to the present invention
        provides that the evaporator structure be kept flexible and that
        the cold surface of the outer evaporator cover sheeting be
        pressed by means of a separate elastic compression means over a
        large surface of the outer surface of the fluid container.
        Suitable externally disposed elastic compression means are
        stretch or shrink wraps or rubber bands. The advantage of this
        approach is that the fluid container remains partially visible
        and that the cooling element does not need to be opened to pour
        out the fluid. A disadvantage, however, is the inferior heat
        transfer since gaps that impede the transfer of heat can remain
        between the outer surface of the container and the outer
        evaporator covering material. </p>
      <p>[0055] To maintain the necessary vapor passageway cross section
        between the evaporator and the sorbent filling in spite of the
        externally exerted air pressure, this invention provides that
        the vapor passageway be formed and stabilized by multiple layers
        of a plastic network. Thus, a sufficient cross section for the
        flow remains intact between the network structure. When
        polypropylene networks are used, higher temperatures are
        admissible without the risk of a release of gases. Furthermore,
        since the networks have a flexible structure, they adapt
        optimally to any geometry involved. </p>
      <p>[0056] In this context, the term fluid container is meant to
        comprise all known and conventionally used containers, such as
        bottles, cans, pouches, jugs, cardboard packaging, etc., that
        serve to hold liquids, such as beverages, liquid drugs, and
        chemical products. Obviously, the fluid container may also
        contain solid or freely flowable products. The normal shape and
        structure of the fluid container does not need to be changed in
        any way. Thus, all manufacturing and filling devices used so far
        can be used without requiring any changes. </p>
      <p>[0057] The evaporator can have any shape and can be
        manufactured from any materials. An industrial requirement is
        that a sufficiently large opening for allowing the water vapor
        to flow into the sorbent material forms and is maintained during
        the cooling process, that working fluid in a liquid state
        remains in the area to be cooled, that an entrainment of liquid
        components is prevented, and that an excellent thermal
        connection to the object to be cooled is maintained. </p>
      <p>[0058] Of industrial and economic interest are, e.g., cooling
        elements in the shape of trays for the transport of food with
        adjacent hot and cold surfaces. These can preferably be designed
        in the form of bowls into which the food can be placed directly.
        Also useful are cooling elements in which the hot and cold
        surfaces are disposed opposite to each other. Such elements can
        be optimally used to separate warm and cold areas in coolers or
        insulating transport packagings. In these cases, an insulating
        spacer material can be inserted between the hot and the cold
        zone, which spacer material can preferably be disposed inside
        the multilayer sheeting material. Disposing such cooling
        elements in vacuo additionally reduces the heat conduction in a
        highly effective manner. </p>
      <p>[0059] To produce cooling elements according to the present
        invention, for example, a unilaterally open sorbent-containing
        pouch is manufactured from a multilayer sheeting material by
        means of heat sealing. The sorbent-containing pouch is filled
        with a sorbent material which contains a low quantity of working
        medium and does not contain gases that will be released at a
        later time, it is subsequently evacuated to a pressure of less
        than 15 mbar, in particular to less than 5 mbar, and then
        heat-sealed so as to be impermeable to gas. Subsequently, the
        pouch containing the sorbent material and being under a vacuum,
        together with a shut-off means, a spacer and a nonwoven
        evaporator that is saturated with the working medium, is wrapped
        into another outer pouch made of a multilayer sheeting material.
        The outer pouch is subsequently evacuated in a vacuum chamber
        until it reaches the vapor pressure of the working medium and
        subsequently also sealed so as to be impermeable to gas. When
        incorporating the shut-off means, care must be taken to ensure
        that its opening mechanism is not triggered during the flooding
        of the vacuum chamber. </p>
      <p>[0060] As a rule, the pouch made of the sheeting material is
        thermally sealed by pressing hot sealing bars onto the outer
        surfaces of the sheeting material until the polypropylene layers
        lying inside on top of one another are liquefied and are
        heat-sealed to one another. As a rule, sealing is carried out in
        vacuo inside a vacuum chamber. The pouch can, however, also be
        evacuated only on the inside by means of a suction device and
        then be sealed. In addition to the thermal contact method, it
        was found that sealing procedures by means of ultrasound are
        useful as well. </p>
      <p>[0061] According to the present invention, it is possible to
        incorporate the fluid container to be cooled at a later time
        into a cooling element. To keep interfering gases out of the
        cooling element, this fluid container as such can be sealed into
        an evacuated pouch prior to incorporating it into the outer
        pouch. To ensure that no gases that interfere with the vacuum
        are released during the storage period as well as during the
        cooling time during which the temperatures are higher, all
        components contained in the vacuum should have been heated
        during the evacuation process to a temperature of at least
        80.degree. C. or should have been outgassed at even higher
        temperature prior to introducing them into the vacuum. </p>
      <p>[0062] The preferred embodiments of the present invention, as
        well as other objects, features and advantages of this
        invention, will be apparent from the following detailed
        description, which is to be read in conjunction with the

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0078] The sorbent-containing pouch 1 shown as a perspective
        and cross-sectional representation in FIG. 1 comprises a
        multilayer sheeting material 2 that is thermally sealed along
        the edges 3 of the pouch. Located in the evacuated inside of
        said pouch is the desorbed sorbent material 4 which contains
        broken natural zeolite granules. </p>
      <p>[0079] The multilayer sheeting material 2 previously sealed to
        form a pouch was filled with bulk granules that had been heated
        to 140-200.degree. C. in a circulating air oven and was
        subsequently evacuated in a vacuum chamber to a pressure of less
        than 5 mbar. Both gases and water vapor were drained from the
        zeolites crystal structure by pumping. The sorbent-containing
        pouch 1 was sealed by means of sealing tongs so as to be
        impermeable to gas and the vacuum chamber was re-aerated. The
        sorbent-containing pouch 1 was cooled by submerging it in a
        water bath. After cooling, the water vapor pressure inside the
        pouch is below 1 mbar absolute. Residual gases are not
        measurable and will not outgas later from the multilayer
        sheeting material since on filling the pouch with the hot
        granules, said sheeting material was heated to above 100.degree.
        C. as well, thereby releasing potentially existing gases. When
        heated to a similar temperature level during the subsequent
        sorption process, no other interfering gases will be released. </p>
      <p>[0080] FIG. 1a shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of the
        multilayer sheeting material 2. It comprises, from the inside
        out, an 80 .mu.m thick polypropylene layer 5 on which an 8 .mu.m
        thick aluminum layer 7 is glued by means of adhesive 6. By means
        of a second adhesive layer 8, a long-wearing 30 .mu.m thick
        polyester layer 9 is attached. The choice of the layers and
        adhesives used is made on the basis of the requirements that in
        vacuo (i.e., in a vacuum) and at temperatures above 100.degree.
        C., the layers do not release interfering gases, the sealed
        seams do not rupture and the sharp-edged zeolite-containing
        sorbent material 4 cannot puncture the sheeting material.
        According to the present invention, an additional polyester
        layer can be glued in between the polypropylene layer 5 and the
        aluminum layer 7. </p>
      <p>[0081] FIG. 2 shows a perspective and cross-sectional
        representation of an evaporator. Said evaporator comprises a
        spacer 11 which is manufactured from a flexible extrusion-molded
        polycarbonate part and which has a multilayer sheeting material
        13 disposed on its smooth outer surface 12 and open flow
        passageways 15 for the working medium vapor on its structured
        inner surface 14. Interspersed between a second multilayer
        sheeting material 16 which covers the cold surface of the
        evaporator and the spacer 11 is a fibrous nonwoven material 17
        which is saturated with the fluid working medium. The nonwoven
        material 17 comprises microfibers made of polypropylene. The two
        multilayer sheeting materials 16 and 13 are thermally sealed to
        each other along seam 10 having a sealed seam width of at least
        5 mm. </p>
      <p>[0082] FIG. 3 shows a different embodiment of spacer 18. Said
        spacer is manufactured from a 1 mm thick polypropylene plate 21,
        into which spacer nubs 19 are thermoformed by means of a
        thermoforming method, which spacer nubs ensure that there is a
        space relative to a nonwoven material 20, thus allowing water
        vapor that evaporates from the nonwoven material 20-unimpededly
        flow in the passageway between the nonwoven material 20 and the
        polypropylene plate 21. </p>
      <p>[0083] FIGS. 4 and 4a-4d show a cooling element which holds a
        beverage can 24 with a volume of 0.5 L in the upper portion and
        a sorbent-containing pouch 22 with 400 g of natural
        clinoptilolite in the lower portion. The beverage can 24 and the
        sorbent-containing pouch 22 have been sealed in vacuo into an
        outer pouch 23. The outer pouch 23 is manufactured from a piece
        of a multilayer sheeting material which was folded over once and
        sealed along the lower cross seam 26 and along the long seam 27.
        After inserting the sorbent-containing pouch 22, a piercing tool
        25 and the beverage can 24 surrounded by evaporator 29 into the
        outer pouch, said outer pouch 23 was subjected in a vacuum
        chamber to a pressure below the vapor pressure of the working
        medium and subsequently also sealed along the upper edge 28. To
        ensure that during the flooding of the vacuum chamber, the
        piercing tool 25 does not penetrate the sheeting material of the
        sorbent-containing pouch 22 at the piercing site 30 as a result
        of the contraction of the outer pouch 23, two spacers 31 made of
        expanded polypropylene are attached by means of adhesive tapes
        32 to the outside of the outer pouch 23. The spacers 31 ensure
        that, in spite of the negative pressure, the piercing tool 25
        does not pierce the sorbent-containing pouch 22. The flow
        passageway is opened only once the spacers 31 have been removed
        by tearing off the adhesive tapes 32 and once the piercing tool
        25, as shown in FIG. 4d, has penetrated the sorbent-containing
        pouch 22 and has punched out the piercing site 30. The piercing
        tool 25 is manufactured from a small piece of expanded metal
        that has been molded to form a cylinder. On its upper end, it
        touches the beverage can 24; its lateral support is ensured by a
        fixing plate 33 with passageways, which fixing plate at the same
        time keeps the vapor path from evaporator 29 through the
        piercing tool 25 into the sorbent material 34 open once the
        spacers 31 have been removed. </p>
      <p>[0084] FIG. 4c shows the construction of the evaporator 29
        along cross section VV (seen in FIG. 4). Wrapped around the
        beverage can 24 is a paper sleeve 35 which is saturated with 30
        g of water and which is pressed to the outer wall of the
        beverage can 24 by means of a spacer 36, similar to spacer 11 in
        FIG. 3. Spacer 36 in turn is pressed against the beverage can 24
        by means of the outer pouch 23 on which the outside air pressure
        is exerted. This ensures an optimum thermal contact between the
        evaporating water and the content of the can. </p>
      <p>[0085] FIG. 4b shows the cross section along line SS in FIG. 4.
        As explained in the description in connection with FIG. 1, the
        sorbent material 34, in this case natural zeolite, is packaged
        in the sorbent-containing pouch 22. The sorbent-containing pouch
        22 is surrounded by the sheeting material of the outer pouch 23.
        Said sheeting material also comprises a barrier layer made of
        aluminum as well as a sealable layer made of polyethylene or
        polypropylene. As long as it is ensured that no gases exit from
        the surface or the cover seal of the beverage can 24 into the
        evaporator region, the beverage can 24 need not be surrounded by
        an additional gas-impermeable evacuated sheeting material. </p>
      <p>[0086] During the manufacture of the cooling element, care
        should be taken to ensure that all media located within the
        vacuum system do not emit any gas or only harmless quantities of
        gas. Preferably, the sorbent-containing pouch 22 is first placed
        into the cover pouch 23. Subsequently, the spacers 31 are
        attached to the outside by means of adhesive tapes 32. </p>
      <p>[0087] The paper sleeve 35 is wrapped around the lateral
        surface of the beverage can 24 and saturated with water as the
        working medium. Relative to the weight of the sorbent material,
        the water amounts to 7.5%. This is followed by the spacer 36
        made of polypropylene and the fixing plate 33 into which the
        piercing tool 25 is inserted. The fixing plate 33 and the spacer
        36 can be easily affixed to the beverage can 24 by means of
        shrink wrap (not shown in the drawing). </p>
      <p>[0088] The thus prepared beverage can 24 is pushed into the
        outer pouch 23 until the two spacers 31 touch the fixing plate
        33. The outer pouch 23 together with its contents is then
        evacuated in a vacuum chamber until a small quantity of water
        vapor flows from the working medium, here water. This working
        medium vapor flow outgases the working medium as such and also
        entrains all other gases from the outer pouch 23. After it has
        been ensured that all interfering gases have been evacuated by
        pumping, the outer pouch 23 is thermally sealed along the upper
        edge 28 by means of sealing bars. </p>
      <p>[0089] After aerating the vacuum chamber, the finished cooling
        element can be removed. To ensure that even after a relatively
        long storage time, the cooling element is gas-impermeably sealed
        and no foreign gases were released, the element can again be
        placed into a vacuum chamber for evacuation. If the cooling
        element is properly functioning, the outer pouch 23 will bulge
        only once the pressure in the chamber drops below the pressure
        of the water vapor. </p>
      <p>[0090] To activate the cooling element, it is necessary to
        remove the two spacers 31 which, because of the negative
        pressure, are securely clamped between the sorbent-containing
        pouch 22 and the fixing plate 33. Thanks to the flexible spacer
        material, the sheeting material of the outer pouch 23 and of the
        sorbent-containing pouch 22 is not damaged in spite of the
        presence of sharp-edged zeolite granules. As a result of the
        negative inside pressure, the piercing tool 25 will immediately
        penetrate the piercing site 30 of the sorbent-containing pouch
        22, punch out a portion of the sheeting material and open up the
        vapor passageway for the waiting water vapor. Within a few
        minutes, the water in the paper sleeve 35 will cool to
        approximately 0.degree. C., and the sorbent material 34 will be
        heated to more than 100.degree. C. After approximately 10 min,
        the contents of the beverage can 24 will have cooled by
        approximately 18 K, and the sorbent material 34 will be
        uniformly hot. The beverage inside the can can be cooled more
        rapidly by occasionally shaking the beverage can 24. The outer
        pouch 23 can be torn open by means of a notch on the sealed seam
        along long seam 27, and the cold beverage can 24 can be removed
        from the evaporator 29. The sorbent granules used can be
        utilized to improve the quality of the soil or stagnant water
        or, together with the sheeting material, can be disposed of with
        the residual waste. </p>
      <p>[0091] Approximately 18 g of the water saturating the paper
        sleeve 35 have been evaporated and sorbed by the sorbent
        material 34. Given a weight of the zeolite filling of 400 g,
        this corresponds to a loading of only 4.5%. But since, within
        the short cooling time, the zeolite filling is not able to
        release much heat, a noticeable drop in temperature, and thus an
        additional water adsorption associated therewith, is not
        possible. For this reason, a natural zeolite is highly suitable
        for use in the cooling element described here. </p>
      <p>[0092] FIGS. 5 and 5a show a flat cooling element which, in
        addition to the cold from evaporator 42, also allows heat form
        the sorbent material to be utilized. A flat sorbent-containing
        pouch 40 comprises a zeolite plate 41 made of synthetic zeolite
        and an evaporator 42 without a shut-off means disposed in
        between. The evaporator 42 comprises an anhydrous nonwoven
        material 43 and a spacer 44 having a construction identical to
        the spacer of FIG. 2. The zeolite plate 41 has been formed from
        powdered Na-A zeolite with an added binding agent. Disposed in
        the lower part of said zeolite plate are flow passageways 45
        which make it possible for the water vapor flow to move from the
        spacer 44 into the sorbent material. The water used as the
        working medium 47 is located in a water pouch 46 which is
        connected by way of a connecting passageway 48 with the
        evaporator 42 and which, at the same time, is an integral part
        of the sorbent-containing pouch 40. Disposed in the area in
        which the connecting passageway 48 opens out into the evaporator
        42 is a piece of sheeting material 50 which ensures that
        inflowing water is directed into the nonwoven material 43 and
        does not reach the flow passageways of the spacer 44 while still
        in a liquid state. In addition, in the area of the mouth of the
        connecting passageway 48, 0.5 g of common salt has been
        incorporated into the nonwoven material 43. According to the
        present invention, a single pouch of a multilayer sheeting
        material is used; this pouch encloses and forms the sorbent
        material, the evaporator 42, the connecting passageway 48, the
        water as the working medium, here water, 47, and the shut-off
        means. The shut-off means is implemented in that the connecting
        passageway 48 is kinked at an angle of 180.degree. upward from
        its originally plane position. Thus, during the storage time,
        the water pouch 46 which, during manufacturing, is in the
        position shown as a broken line in FIG. 5 is disposed on the
        evaporator 42. As a result of the sharp fold 49 in the area of
        which the two superimposed polypropylene layers are tightly
        squeezed against each other, a very inexpensive shut-off means
        has been created, which shut-off means (by folding the water
        pouch 46 back into its original position (position shown as a
        broken line in FIG. 5 and position in FIG. 5a)) can be easily
        opened without the need for an additional tool simply be
        exerting pressure on the outside of the water pouch 46. </p>
      <p>[0093] To manufacture the cooling element, the zeolite plate 41
        is heated in a circulating air oven to temperatures between
        150.degree. C. and 200.degree. C. The hot zeolite plate 41,
        together with the evaporator components that have been heated to
        approximately 80.degree. C., is subsequently introduced into the
        partially pre-manufactured sorbent-containing pouch 40. The
        sorbent-containing pouch 40 is subsequently sealed so that only
        the connecting passageway to the water pouch 46 and the water
        pouch itself have a suction opening to a vacuum chamber. By
        evacuating the vacuum chamber to less than 5 mbar, the pressure
        within the sorbent-containing pouch 40 is reduced as well. This
        causes residual water to evaporate from the zeolite, the vapor
        flow of which residual water eliminates air and gases released
        from the hot components through the connecting passageway 48.
        Thereupon, the passageway can be folded. The water pouch 46 can
        now be filled with outgassed water and can subsequently be
        sealed so as to be impermeable to gas. </p>
      <p>[0094] To activate the cooling element, the water pouch 46 is
        simply folded back into its original position and thus the fold
        49 is straightened out. Driven by the water vapor pressure in
        the water pouch 46, water now flows through the connecting
        passageway 48 into the nonwoven material 43. This water
        dissolves the salt crystals located in said material, which
        lowers the freezing point to nearly -17.degree. C. The water
        that follows directs the salt solution into the nonwoven
        material, from which it can evaporate. The vapor is deflected
        via the passageways that are kept open by the spacers 44 and
        directed into the zeolite plate 41 and exothermally sorbed. The
        heat of sorption heats the zeolite plate 41 to more than
        100.degree. C. The nonwoven material 43 is cooled by the cold of
        evaporation to temperatures below the freezing point. Thus, in
        the area of the zeolite plate 41, the cooling element can be
        used, for example, to keep food warm, and in the area of the
        evaporator 42, it can be used to keep beverages cold. After use,
        it can be disposed of with the residual waste. </p>
      <p>[0095] Although not shown in the drawing, it should be noted
        that the evaporator 42 of the cooling element seen in FIG. 5 can
        be shaped in the form of a cylinder which is suitable for
        holding a can or a bottle. To ensure good thermal contact
        between the outer surface of the bottle and the
        sorbent-containing pouch, the two can be compressed to each
        other by means of stretch wraps or rubber bands. </p>
      <p>[0096] The bottle and the cooling element can also be very
        efficiently brought into contact with each other by placing both
        into an additional pouch which is subsequently evacuated. In
        this case, the heat transfer from the evaporator to the bottle
        is considerably improved as a result of the air pressure exerted
        on the pouch. </p>
      <p>[0097] FIG. 6 shows additional components of a cooling element
        according to the present invention for rapidly cooling a bottle
        53 that is filled with a beverage. The bottle 53 which is shown
        in cross section is again surrounded by a cylindrically moldable
        spacer 54, which presses a nonwoven material 52 onto the
        cylindrical portion of the bottle, and by a fixing element 55
        for holding a cutting tool 56. The bottle 53 itself can first be
        sealed into a gas-impermeable evacuated sheeting material (not
        shown) to ensure that gases diffusing from the cork 61 of the
        bottle 53 cannot interfere with the vacuum needed for proper
        functioning of the cooling element. A sorbent-containing pouch
        57 comprises 6 disk-shaped zeolite plates 58, a top view of one
        of which plates is shown in FIG. 6a. Disposed in the center of
        the plates are vapor passageway holes 59, via which the water
        vapor is transported to the radial passageways 60. From the
        radial passageways, the vapor can subsequently advance rapidly
        into all areas of the sorbent material by way of narrow gaps
        which inevitably remain between the plates. The uppermost plate
        58 has a larger vapor passageway hole to accommodate the cutting
        tool 56 and the multilayer sheeting material that is punched
        out. </p>
      <p>[0098] The other components necessary for the proper
        functioning of the cooling element according to the present
        invention are not shown in the drawing. These components follow
        from and are identical to those in the drawings and descriptions
        of FIGS. 4-4d. </p>
      <p>[0099] FIG. 7 shows another compact configuration of a cooling
        element for cooling a bottle 62. Molded into the
        sorbent-containing pouch 63 is a depression in which the neck 64
        of the bottle and the shut-off means 65 are disposed. The
        sorbent-containing pouch 63 preferably has the diameter of the
        bottle 62, including the evaporator which is not shown in the
        drawing. The shut-off means is a cutting tool 65 which can
        perforate the multilayer sheeting material of the
        sorbent-containing pouch 63 only after manually increased axial
        pressure has been exerted. Again, for clarity's sake, the
        remaining components are not shown in the drawing. These
        components as well as the manufacturing and cooling method
        follow from the description in connection with FIGS. 4-4d. </p>
      <p>[0100] FIG. 8 shows a shut-off means with a cutting die 80 that
        can perforate a sorbent-containing pouch 81. The
        sorbent-containing pouch 81 contains a zeolite filling 82 in the
        form of beads. Disposed on one end of the cylindrically shaped
        cutting die 80 is a knife edge 83 which is designed to pierce
        the sheeting material of the sorbent-containing pouch 81. To
        safeguard against accidental cutting, a protective sheeting
        material 84 is placed between the knife edge 83 and the
        sorbent-containing pouch 81, the properties of which protective
        sheeting material are such that they ensure that the cutting die
        80 pierces the sorbent-containing pouch 81 only when additional
        external forces are exerted in the direction of arrow A on the
        other end of the cutting die 80, thereby eliminating the
        possibility that the external air pressure alone activates the
        cutting die. Disposed on this other end is a cap 85 which
        projects beyond the diameter of the cutting die 80 and which
        supports the outer pouch 86. The diameter of cap 85 is slightly
        larger than the punched-out hole 88 in a passageway for the
        working fluid vapor, which passageway is disposed between the
        sorbent-containing pouch 81 and the outer pouch 86. To maintain
        the necessary vapor cross section, the passageway is constructed
        of a plurality of layers of a network 87 of polypropylene
        filaments. As a result of this multilayer construction, the flow
        diameter for the working fluid vapor within the network
        structure remains sufficiently large, although the difference
        between the pressure of the working fluid vapor and the external
        air pressure is acting on the vapor passageway. By exerting
        pressure on the outer pouch 86 in the direction of arrow A, the
        protective sheeting material 84, together with the
        sorbent-containing pouch, is pierced by the knife edge 83 of the
        cutting die 80. The zeolite filling 82 that follows pushes the
        punched-out portions into the inside of the cutting die cylinder
        and thus opens up the passageway for the vapor. The cutting die
        80 can be pushed in until its cap 85 comes to rest on the
        perforated edges of the networks 87. The flexible outer pouch 86
        folds without becoming permeable. </p>
      <p>[0101] Although the preferred embodiments of the present
        invention have been described with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not
        limited to those precise embodiments, and that other changes and
        modifications may be made by one skilled in the art without
        departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. </p>
