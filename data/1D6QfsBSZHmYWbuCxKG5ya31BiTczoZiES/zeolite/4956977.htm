      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Background of the Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to an adsorption apparatus with heat
        pumping effect used as an electro-heating storage. </p>
      <p>In order to smooth the severely fluctuating current use,
        electro-heat storages are employed. When rates for electrical
        current are economically favorable, typically a storage
        material, like ceramic, cast iron, oil or water is heated, for
        example, during the charge phase. The stored heat is fed to the
        consumer via suitable heat removing systems during the
        subsequent discharging phase. Night time current storages are in
        use for heating individual rooms and central heat storages which
        supply a plurality of consumers from one location through a heat
        distribution system. In order to keep the space requirement for
        the electro-heat storages as low as possible, the storage
        materials are partially heated to a temperature above
        900.degree. C. Undesirable heat losses must be prevented with
        expensive insulation measures. A heat pumping effect with a
        corresponding energy saving is not possible with these devices.
      </p>
      <p>Zeolites are solid alumini-silicates with a uniform crystal
        structure. Adsorption zeolites have the characteristics of being
        able to adsorb a considerable amount of water in its crystal
        structure. Heat is released during this adsorption. In order to
        again desorb the water, heat must be used. </p>
      <p>Heat storage installations with the adsorption pair of
        zeolite/water are suggested in German laid open patent
        applications P 32 07 656 and P 32 12 608. When the rates for
        electrical current are low steam is desorbed from the absorption
        zeolith and liquified in a condenser. The condensated steam is
        again evaporated at a later time by absorbing ambient heat and
        adsorbed in the adsorption substance by releasing heat at high
        temperatures. The control of such installations is only possible
        by a plurality of valves or check valves with corresponding
        control units. This control effort is not economical with small
        electro-heat storages despite a 30% saving of energy. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Summary of the Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p>It is, therefore, an object of the invention to use periodic
        adsorption processes as electro-heat storages and to save energy
        by means of available pump effect. </p>
      <p>The adsorption electro-heat storage in accordance with the
        invention consists of the conventional parts electro heating,
        heat removal system and control, on the one hand, and the
        adsorption part, on the other hand. The adsorption part consists
        of two containers which are connected by means of a steam line;
        namely the adsorption substance container which in the
        conventional part of the electro-heat storage replaces the
        storage material and the collecting container for condensate. A
        steam line leads from the containers to a condenser and a water
        cycle leads to a heat collector. The water cycle contains a
        pump. The mode of operation is divided into two phases; </p>
      <p>(a) charging phase - the adsorption substance container is
        heated to 200.degree.-300.degree. C. by means of the
        electro-heater. Thereby, steam is desorbed from the adsorption
        substance which is liquified in the condenser and flows as a
        condensate into the collecting container. The condensation heat
        is discharged as an operating heat at temperatures up to
        100.degree. C.; </p>
      <p>(b) discharge phase - the electro-heater is out of operation.
        Heat is removed from the adsorption substance container through
        the conventional heat removal system. Condensate evaporates in
        the collecting container during lower steam pressures and cools
        the remaining water. The steam is exothermically adsorbed by the
        adsorption substance at high temperatures. The adsorption heat
        can be removed through the heat removal system if so desired.
        The pump of the water cycle feeds cooled residue condensate
        through the heat collector. So that the water cycle does not
        dissipate heat to the heat collector, a control unit actuates
        the pump only when the temperature in the heat collector is
        higher than the condensation temperature in the collecting
        container. Moreover, the operation of the pump may be made
        dependent from other criteria through this control unit. For
        example, the pump may only be operated after a certain
        temperature had been exceeded in the heat collector. </p>
      <p>This process can be advantageously used for safety against
        frost or for maintaining a certain temperature of the exhaust
        heat (for example, waste water, cooling air). </p>
      <p>The possibility exists in conventional electro-heat storages
        for room heating to aftercharge the heating storage with current
        during the daytime on extremely cold days. Since during these
        very cold days the heat reception through the heat collector may
        be limited, an aftercharge is advantageously transmitted to the
        system through an electrical heater in the collecting container.
        Thereby, the heat dissipation capacity from the adsorption
        electro-heating storage increases by about 30% with respect to
        the aftercharge capacity, since the adsorption of the steam in
        the adsorption substance releases the chemically stored
        adsorption heat. </p>
      <p>The adsorption electro-heat storage in accordance with the
        invention can be advantageously integrated into a tile hearth.
        In this case, hot combustion gases take over the desorption
        operation from case to case. In this manner, the tile hearth can
        store more heat and recover additional heat through the heat
        collector. The cooling time of the tiled hearth is prolonged. </p>
      <p>A further advantageous possibility of use is the coupling of an
        adsorption electro-heat storage with a hot water storage. The
        adsorption part recovers additional heat through the heat
        pumping effect from the air or the waste water and permits a
        small structural size of the water storage. The use of night
        current is also advantageous for the utility company during the
        summer time. </p>
      <p>Adsorption apparatuses operate at least partially under vacuum
        conditions. A sufficient tightness of the system is the basic
        requirement for a smooth operation. It is therefore suggested to
        assemble the adsorption part as a compact, finished apparatus
        part by the manufacturer. When using the heat collector as an
        outside absorber, it must be pushed through the building wall to
        the outside, while the remainder of the device components remain
        within the building. For this purpose, a wall box is built into
        the building wall which is closed with a suitable insulation
        element during the installation of the device. This insulation
        element fixed the heat collector to the outside and leaves room
        on the inside for the flexible condensation lines to the
        collecting container. </p>
      <p>In a further advantageous development the insulation element is
        provided with a ventilation system which feeds hot exhaust air
        from the building to the outside positioned heat collector for
        recovery. </p>
      <p>The zeolite types Na-A, Mg-A, Na-Y, H-Y and Na-X have been
        shown to be useful as adsorption substances. They have very good
        adsorption characteristics for water in addition to a sufficient
        temperature and cycle stability. </p>
      <p>The condensate in the collecting container may freeze due to
        the evaporation operation. The latent heat which is thereby
        released can be additionally used for the adsorption heat in the
        adsorption substance during increased temperatures. In a
        sufficiently large dimensioned collecting container, the total
        evaporation enthalphy may be supplied by the latent conversion
        heat. The ice which is generated in the discharge phase is again
        molten during the condensation heat. About 1.3 Kilogram water is
        required per Kilogram of adsorption substance. </p>
      <p>If no conversion heat is to be used and when heat is coupled in
        through the heat collector from the environment at temperatures
        below 0.degree. C., an antifreeze agent may be added to the
        water. Suitable substances are salts or lyes which have a low
        steam pressure. </p>
      <p>If only ambient heat is collected above 0.degree. C., no
        antifreeze agents are required. The heat collector may be
        installed above the maximum water level in the collecting
        container, so that the heat collector does not freeze during the
        frosty weather. The water would then return into the collecting
        container when the pump is in the rest position. A water syphon
        in the water cycle prevents a condensation of steam in the heat
        collector during the charge phases and also prevents a loss of
        heat to the outside. </p>
      <p>The described adsorption electro-heat storage does not contain
        any valves and requires only a small control effort for the
        control of the pump. The costs for power are lower by about 30%
        with respect to the conventional systems. The electrical
        connecting line is reduced by about one third. </p>
      <p>Ventilation heat losses can be reduced by a simple heat
        recovery of the exhaust air. Since all components of a
        conventional electro-heat storage can be used, with the
        exception of the storage material, only a small amount of
        additional cost is incurred. A heat pumping installation with
        heat recovery possibilities is obtained from a pure heat storage
        device with a favorable control. During the discharge phase the
        new system is always ready to absorb ambient heat, in contrast
        to other heat pumping systems, no matter how high the
        temperatures and amounts are. Even the smallest heat amounts can
        be used without limitation. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows an adsorption substance container 1 on which a
        small collecting container 2 is connected. From there, a steam
        line 3 leads to a condenser (4) and two flexible liquid lines 5
        leads to a heat collector 6. The associated water cycle contains
        a pump 7. The operation is divided into two phases: </p>
      <p>a. Charge Phase </p>
      <p>The adsorption substance container is heated to a temperature
        of 250.degree.-300.degree. C. by means of electric heating rods
        8. During this time water is evaporated from the adsorption
        substance. The steam can condense in condensator 4 and dissipate
        heat to the room air. The condensate flows into the collecting
        container 2 and remains there until the discharge phase. </p>
      <p>b. Discharge Phase </p>
      <p>The adsorption substance container is cooled by the air flow.
        During a lowering of the adsorption substance temperature there
        is also a lowering of the steam pressure in the containers.
        Water from the collecting container gets cold and the adsorption
        substance hot. Whenever the water temperature in the collecting
        container 2 falls below the outer temperature pump 7 pumps water
        through the heat collector. The cold water absorbs heat from the
        outer air and transfers it to the evaporating water in the
        collecting container 2. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows a combination of an adsorption electro-heat
        storage with a hot water storage. Condenser 24 is mounted within
        the hot water storage 28. During the charging phase the
        condenser dissipates the condensation heat to the water storage
        28. During the discharge phase the operating heat is transferred
        from the adsorption substance container 21 through a
        water-steam-system to the water. When the storage water is too
        cold, the valve 29 opens. Water flows from container 30 to the
        evaporator 31 and evaporates therein. The steam dissipates the
        condensation heat in the liquefier 32. The condensate again
        collects in container 30. </p>
      <p>Thus, the several aforementioned objects and advantages are
        most effectively attained. Although several somewhat preferred
        embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein,
        it should be understood that this invention is in no sense
        limited thereby and its scope to be determined by that of the
        appended claims.</p>
