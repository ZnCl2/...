      </b><br>
      Washington (AFP) - The US Navy believes it has finally worked out
      the solution to a problem that has intrigued scientists for
      decades: how to take seawater and use it as fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The development of a liquid hydrocarbon fuel is being hailed as "a
      game-changer" because it would signficantly shorten the supply
      chain, a weak link that makes any force easier to attack.<br>
      <br>
      The US has a fleet of 15 military oil tankers, and only aircraft
      carriers and some submarines are equipped with nuclear propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      All other vessels must frequently abandon their mission for a few
      hours to navigate in parallel with the tanker, a delicate
      operation, especially in bad weather.<br>
      <br>
      The ultimate goal is to eventually get away from the dependence on
      oil altogether, which would also mean the navy is no longer
      hostage to potential shortages of oil or fluctuations in its cost.<br>
      <br>
      Vice Admiral Philip Cullom declared: "It's a huge milestone for
      us."<br>
      <br>
      "We are in very challenging times where we really do have to think
      in pretty innovative ways to look at how we create energy, how we
      value energy and how we consume it.<br>
      <br>
      "We need to challenge the results of the assumptions that are the
      result of the last six decades of constant access to cheap,
      unlimited amounts of fuel," added Cullom.<br>
      <br>
      "Basically, we've treated energy like air, something that's always
      there and that we don't worry about too much. But the reality is
      that we do have to worry about it."<br>
      <br>
      US experts have found out how to extract carbon dioxide and
      hydrogen gas from seawater.<br>
      <br>
      Then, using a catalytic converter, they transformed them into a
      fuel by a gas-to-liquids process. They hope the fuel will not only
      be able to power ships, but also planes.<br>
      <br>
      That means instead of relying on tankers, ships will be able to
      produce fuel at sea.<br>
      <br>
      <b>- 'Game-changing' technology -</b><br>
      <br>
      The predicted cost of jet fuel using the technology is in the
      range of three to six dollars per gallon, say experts at the US
      Naval Research Laboratory, who have already flown a model airplane
      with fuel produced from seawater.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b>Dr. Heather Willauer</b><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="willauer.jpg" height="331"
          width="464"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Dr Heather Willauer, an research chemist who has spent nearly a
      decade on the project, can hardly hide her enthusiasm.<br>
      <br>
      "For the first time we've been able to develop a technology to get
      CO2 and hydrogen from seawater simultaneously, that's a big
      breakthrough," she said, adding that the fuel "doesn't look or
      smell very different."<br>
      <br>
      Now that they have demonstrated it can work, the next step is to
      produce it in industrial quantities. But before that, in
      partnership with several universities, the experts want to improve
      the amount of CO2 and hydrogen they can capture.<br>
      <br>
      "We've demonstrated the feasibility, we want to improve the
      process efficiency," explained Willauer.<br>
      <br>
      Collum is just as excited.<br>
      <br>
      "For us in the military, in the Navy, we have some pretty unusual
      and different kinds of challenges," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "We don't necessarily go to a gas station to get our fuel, our gas
      station comes to us in terms of an oiler, a replenishment ship.<br>
      <br>
      "Developing a game-changing technology like this, seawater to
      fuel, really is something that reinvents a lot of the way we can
      do business when you think about logistics, readiness."<br>
      <br>
      A crucial benefit, says Collum, is that the fuel can be used in
      the same engines already fitted in ships and aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      "If you don't want to re-engineer every ship, every type of
      engine, every aircraft, that's why we need what we call drop-in
      replacement fuels that look, smell and essentially are the same as
      any kind of petroleum-based fuels."<br>
      <br>
      Drawbacks? Only one, it seems: researchers warn it will be at
      least a decade before US ships are able to produce their own fuel
      on board.<br>

      </b><b>1. Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to the field of catalysts for
      hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. In particular, the present
      invention relates to supported catalysts for hydrogenation of
      carbon dioxide wherein the catalyst support is coated with a
      material capable of catalyzing a reverse water-gas shift reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0002] 2. Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Increasing awareness of the environmental impact of carbon
      dioxide (C02) emissions has lead to an immense increase in
      research and development efforts to bind C02. Proposals range from
      capturing C02 directly from the flue gas emitted by heavy industry
      or from the atmosphere by binding it in inorganic oxides. Avalos-
      Rendon, et al., Journal of Physical Chemistry A 113, 6919 (2009)
      and Nikulshina, V., et al., Chemical Engineering Journal 146 (2),
      244 (2009). One approach is to reduce the C02 over catalysts, to
      convert it to more valuable hydrocarbons using photochemical,
      electrochemical or thermochemical processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Electrochemical and photochemical C02 conversion is still
      in its infancy and at present has major drawbacks. Photocatalysts
      tend to require a sacrificial electron donor. Collin, J. P. and
      Sauvage, J. P., Coordination Chemistry Reviews 93 (2), 245 (1989)
      and Fujita, E., Hayashi, Y., Kita, S., and Brunschwig, B. S.,
      Carbon Dioxide Utilization for Global Sustainability 153, 271
      (2004). Further, neither photocatalytic nor electrocatalytic
      conversion of C02 yield long chain hydrocarbons nor do they show
      very high C02 conversion efficiencies. Noda, H. et al., Bulletin
      of the Chemical Society of Japan 63 (9), 2459 (1990).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Thermochemical C02 conversion, in contrast, has been known
      for several decades and is presently the most proven and
      successful approach to producing hydrocarbons (HC) above methane
      at high conversion yields. Russell, W. W. and Miller, G. H.,
      Journal of the American Chemical Society 72 (6), 2446 (1950) and
      Dorner, R. W., Hardy, D. R., Williams, F. W., and Willauer, H. D.,
      Applied Catalysis A: General (2009). This research is primarily
      driven by the U.S. military's significant demand for jet fuel and
      the associated target of increasing energy independence and
      battlefield readiness as well as reducing C02 emissions, in light
      of the impending introduction of the cap-and-trade system. One can
      envisage a process leading to jet fuel, where the needed carbon
      source is obtained by harvesting C02 dissolved in the ocean
      (primarily in the form of bicarbonate) and hydrogen through the
      electrolysis of water. Willauer, H.D., et al., Energy &amp; Fuel
      23, 1770 (2009) and Willauer, H.D., et al., "Effects of Pressure
      on the Recovery of C02 by phase Transition from a Seawater System
      by Means of Multilayer Gas Permeable Membranes", J Phys Chem A, in
      press (2009). C02 and H2 can subsequently be reacted over a
      heterogeneous catalyst to form hydrocarbons of desired chain
      length and type.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A key problem with this scenario is the low conversion
      yield of C02 hydrogenation processes. Thus, a significant increase
      in the conversion yield of C02 hydrogenation catalysts will
      enhance the feasibility of the above-mentioned process.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The target of achieving a high yield, high selectivity
      process for C02 hydrogenation to jet fuel can be achieved by use
      of a two step synthesis process, involving initial C02/H2
      conversion to olefins and subsequent oligomerization over a solid
      acid catalyst to jet fuel. Even when using syngas (CO/H2), direct
      synthesis of jet fuel is limited by Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF)
      kinetics to a selectivity of around 50%. However, this type of
      selectivity can only be achieved when employing a catalyst that
      exhibits an extremely high chain growth probability of 0.9, which
      in C02 hydrogenation has not been observed before. Van der Laan,
      G. P. and Beenackers, A., Catalysis Reviews-Science and
      Engineering 41 (3-4), 255 (1999). Consequently, a two-step process
      is advantageous in comparison to the direct route to jet-fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A conversion of 41.4% of C02/H2 over a K/Mn/Fe catalyst
      supported on alumina and an olefin/paraffin ratio of 4.2 has been
      reported. Dorner, R. W., Hardy, D. R., Williams, F. W., and
      Willauer, H. D., Applied Catalysis A: General (2009). Initial
      tests on a cobalt-based catalyst yielded predominantly methane
      (CH4), with no carbon monoxide (CO) detected in the product
      effluent. Dorner, R. W. et al., Energy Fuels 23 (8), 4190 (2009).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The conversion of C02 to long chain hydrocarbons has been
      established to go through a 2-stage reaction mechanism over iron
      catalysts, with initial conversion of C02 to CO on the iron's
      magnetite phase (Lox, E. S. and Froment, G. F., Industrial &amp;
      Engineering Chemistry Research 32 (1), 71 (1993)), followed by
      chain growth as observed in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis on iron
      carbide surface species. Riedel, T., et al., Industrial &amp;
      Engineering Chemistry Research 40 (5), 1355 (2001); Bukur, D. B.,
      et al., Journal of Catalysis 155 (2), 366 (1995); Herranz, T. et
      al., Applied Catalysis a-General 311, 66 (2006); and Li, S. Z. et
      al., Journal of Catalysis 206 (2), 202 (2002).<br>
      <br>
      [00010] In cobalt-systems however, the predominant reaction seems
      to be C02 conversion directly to methane due to cobalt's limited
      water-gas shift (WGS) activity. Based on this model, the approach
      within entails the development of a bifunctional catalyst that
      includes both reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) activity as well as
      FT chain growth activity on the catalyst's surface. The addition
      of a second, separate reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalyst to a
      cobalt Fischer-Tropsch catalyst within the same reactor would not
      suffice in achieving C02 conversion to long chain HC, as due to
      thermodynamic restrictions the carbon monoxide's partial pressure
      within the reactor would remain too low and insufficient to
      establish an FT regime. Riedel, T. et al., Applied Catalysis
      A-General 186 (1-2), 201 (1999).<br>
      <br>
      [00011] It is known, that the RWGS reaction can take place over
      promoted ceria at modest temperatures, with an equilibrium

      and an equimolar C02: H2 feed. Pettigrew, D. J., Trimm, D. L., and
      Cant, N. W., Catalysis Letters 28 (2-4), 313 (1994). However, if
      one replaced palladium with iron, a lower equilibrium constant can
      be expected, as iron catalyses the RWGS to a lesser extent than
      palladium does. Hilaire, S. et al., Applied Catalysis A-General
      258 (2), 269 (2004).The RWGS takes advantage of ceria' s oxygen
      storage ability, involving the redox process over the
      Ce&lt;4+&gt;/Ce&lt;3+&gt; couple. It has been proposed that the
      reaction proceeds via reduction of Ce02 by hydrogen to Ce203,
      producing water in the process. Subsequently C02 can then be
      expected to re-oxidize Ce203, restoring the initial Ce02 species
      and yielding CO. Pettigrew, D. J., Trimm, D. L., and Cant, N. W.,
      Catalysis Letters 28 (2-4), 313 (1994). Rates are however
      partially limited by H20 re-oxidizing Ce203. Hilaire, S. et al.,
      Applied Catalysis A-General 258 (2), 269 (2004). The addition of
      base metals to ceria is known to be beneficial for the RWGS, by
      reducing the activation energy and increasing the reducibility of
      ceria. Li, K., Fu, Q., and Flytzani-Slephanopoulos, M., Applied
      Catalysis B -Environmental 27 (3), 179 (2000).<br>

      [00012] In WO 96/06064 Al a process for methanol production is
      described, which comprises a step of converting part of the carbon
      dioxide contained in a feed mixture with hydrogen to carbon
      monoxide, in the presence of a catalyst that can be used for the
      WGS reaction; exemplified by Zn- Cr/alumina and Mo03/alumina.<br>
      <br>
      [00013] WO 2005/026093 Al discloses a process for producing DME,
      which comprises a step of reacting carbon dioxide with hydrogen in
      a RWGS reactor to provide carbon monoxide, in the presence of a
      supported catalyst selected from ZnO; MnOx (x=l~2); an alkaline
      earth metal oxide and NiO. [00014] EP 1445232 A2 discloses a
      (reverse) water gas shift reaction for production of carbon
      monoxide by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide at high temperatures,
      in the presence of a Mn- Zr oxide catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [00015] A drawback of the known process as disclosed in US
      2003/0113244 Al is the selectivity of the catalyst employed; that
      is no long chain hydrocarbons are formed. Energy intense
      conversion of C02 to CO has to occur prior to upgrading, in a
      separate reactor. [00016] The object of the present invention is
      therefore to provide a catalyst that shows improved selectivity
      and yield in reducing carbon dioxide with hydrogen, with only very
      little methane formation, and with good catalyst stability.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00029] For illustrative purposes, the principles of the present
      invention are described by referencing various exemplary
      embodiments. Although certain embodiments of the invention are
      specifically described herein, one of ordinary skill in the art
      will readily recognize that the same principles are equally
      applicable to, and can be employed in other systems and methods.
      Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present
      invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is

      these steps may be performed in any order as may be appreciated by
      one skilled in the art; the novel method is therefore not limited
      to the particular arrangement of steps disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [00030] It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended
      claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural
      references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
      Furthermore, the terms "a" (or "an"), "one or more" and "at least

      <br>
      [00031] With the catalyst and process according to the present
      invention, carbon dioxide can be hydrogenated into carbon monoxide
      with high selectivity, the catalyst showing good stability over
      time and under variations in processing conditions. Also,
      formation of methane is suppressed; typically, only small amounts
      of methane are found in the product mixture formed by the process
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [00032] Fischer-Tropsch based reactions are the reactions that
      produce hydrocarbons and water from a carbon source, such as
      carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and hydrogen:<br>
      <br>
      CO+2H2-&gt; -(CH)2- + H20<br>
      C02+3H2-&gt;-(CH)2- + 2H20<br>
      <br>
      [00033] In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a
      catalyst support, which may be used to support various materials
      or catalysts for use in reactions for converting carbon dioxide
      and hydrogen to hydrocarbons. The catalyst support of the
      invention comprises a catalyst support material and another
      material associated with the catalyst support material such as a
      coating, deposit, impregnation or a material applied by any other
      suitable mode of application of a of a material capable of
      catalyzing a reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [00034] The catalyst used in the process according to the
      invention includes an inert carrier or catalyst support material,
      of certain particle size and geometry. Suitable supports include
      those materials having good stability at the reaction conditions
      to be applied in the process of the invention, and are known by a
      person skilled in the art of catalysis. Preferably, the support
      material is at least one member selected from the group consisting
      of alumina, magnesia, silica, titania, zirconia, sulfated Zr02,
      W03Zr02, zeolites such as, for example, H-Beta zeolites, silicas
      such as Sylopol(R), A1F3, fluorided A1203, bentonite, and
      Si02/Al203, as well as carbon-based supports, molecular sieves
      such as mesoporous molecular sieves containing amorphous silica,
      e.g. MCM- 41 and MCM-48, and combinations thereof. Gamma-alumina
      is a preferred catalyst support material.<br>
      <br>
      [00035] C02 conversion levels reported on catalysts dispersed over
      supports made only from these materials have been low since these
      supports only act as a stabilizer for the dispersed catalyst.
      Lanthanide oxides or (oxy)carbonate, e.g. La203 may also be used
      as support, but also contributes to catalyst activity.<br>
      <br>
      [00036] The active material associated with the catalyst support
      material is a material which is capable of catalyzing a reverse
      water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) reaction. Suitable materials
      include, but are not limited to, one or more oxides or carbides of
      transition metals or lanthanides. Ceria is the preferred active
      material for use in the catalyst support of the present invention.
      [00037] Associating the catalyst support with an active material
      capable of catalyzing a reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)
      reaction provides both a support and an introduced catalytic
      activity of the material associated wtih the support, in the form
      of reverse water-gas shift catalytic activity. It is known that to
      achieve C02 hydrogenation to long-chain hydrocarbons, C02 needs to
      initially be converted to CO, which is subsequently converted to
      aforementioned hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The
      addition of a material which catalyzes a reverse water-gas shift
      reaction (RWGS) reaction facilitates the reverse water-gas shift
      reaction (i.e. C02 + H2 &lt;-&gt; CO + H20) and thus leads to an
      overall higher C02 conversion relative to a conventional support
      containing the same dispersed C02 hydrogenation catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [00038] Any suitable method may be employed to associate the
      active material with the catalyst support material. Suitable
      methods include, but are not limited to, an incipient wetness
      impregnation method, atomic layer deposition, sol-gel, salt
      reduction, precipitation, chemical vapor deposition and
      dispersion. As a result, the association between the active
      material and the catalyst support material may be as a coating, it
      may be impregnated, a deposition layer, the active material may be
      bound or attached to the catalyst support material or the active
      material be in any other physical form capable of being produced
      by the foregoing methods.<br>
      <br>
      [00039] Calcining the catalyst support and active material at
      elevated temperatures (i.e. 800 [deg.]C) may lead to the formation
      of larger crystallites of the active material, which may be
      advantageous relative to smaller crystallites, as the smaller
      crystallites appear to be covered to a larger degree by the active
      carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalyst which is subsequently
      deposited on the catalyst support of the invention. Calcining of
      the combined active material and catalyst support of the present
      invention at lower temperatures (i.e. 500 [deg.]C) led to an
      improvement over an uncoated alumina support in hydrogenation of
      carbon dioxide. Calcining can be carried out at any suitable
      temperature in the range of 150 to 1300 [deg.]C, preferably in the
      range of 450 to 900 [deg.]C and most preferably in the range of
      500 to 850 [deg.]C. Calcining is typically carried out over a
      period of 10 to 300 minutes, but the duration of calcination can
      be longer.<br>
      <br>
      [00040] Another metal can be added to the active material to
      increase the support's reverse water-gas-shift reaction, such as a
      transition metal and/or a lanthanide. [00041] The amount of
      support material present in the catalyst used in the process
      according to the present invention may vary within broad ranges; a
      suitable range is from 40 to 95 mass% (based on total mass of
      catalyst composition). Preferably, the support forms from 50 to 90
      mass%, more preferably from 60 to 85 mass% of total catalyst
      composition. In case of lanthanide oxides, the lanthanide content
      may vary from 0.1 to 95 mass %.<br>
      <br>
      [00042] The content of the active material may vary within broad
      ranges. A certain minimum active material content is needed to
      reach a desired level of catalyst activity. A suitable range of
      active material is from 1 to 95 mass% (elemental metal based on
      total mass of catalyst composition). Preferably, the elemental
      metal content is from 5 to 50 mass%, a more preferred range is
      from 10 to 20 mass%.<br>
      <br>
      [00043] Forming a stable combination of active material and
      catalyst support prior to depositing the C02 hydrogenation
      catalyst provides a significantly enhanced C02 conversion in
      subsequent conversion reactions conducted over a supported
      catalyst fabricated in this manner. Ceria is a preferred active
      material for the support since it enhances formation of CO as an
      intermediate in the conversion of C02 to hydrocarbons.
      Comparatively, the addition of ceria directly to the C02
      hydrogenation catalyst, rather than as, for example, a coating on
      the catalyst substrate, actually diminishes the C02 conversion
      levels of the catalyst material by forming a surface layer over
      the catalyst. Thus, the ceria needs to be part of the support in
      order to provide the effect demonstrated by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [00044] The present invention also relates to a method for making
      a catalyst support for use in hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. In
      the method, an active material capable of catalyzing a reverse
      water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is associated with a catalyst
      support material, the combination of active material and catalyst
      support material is optionally calcined, and a catalyst for the
      hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is deposited on the calcined
      active material and catalyst support material. The method may be
      carried out as discussed above, e.g. by application of a coating
      to a catalyst support material and optionally calcining the coated
      catalyst support material. A suitable catalyst component may
      subsequently be deposited on the catalyst support to form a
      catalyst for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [00045] The catalyst component that is used in the process of the
      invention may be prepared by any conventional catalyst synthesis
      method as known in the art. Generally such process includes the
      steps of making aqueous solutions of the desired metal components,
      for example from their nitrate or other soluble salt;<br>
      impregnating the solutions onto a support material; forming a
      solid catalyst precursor by precipitation (or impregnation)
      followed by removing water and drying; and then calcining the
      precursor composition by a thermal treatment in the presence of
      oxygen. [00046] The process of the invention shows good catalyst
      stability, also at temperatures of above about 600 [deg.]C;
      meaning that the composition of the product mixture varies little
      over time. The reaction can be performed over a wide pressure
      range, from atmospheric conditions up to e.g. 6 MPa.<br>
      <br>
      [00047] Within the context of the present application, a catalyst
      that substantially consists of metal oxide, carbide or hydroxide
      and other specific elements is understood to mean that the
      specified metals in elemental form, or in the form of their
      oxides, carbides or hydroxides form the active sites of the
      catalyst composition. The catalyst may further comprise other
      components, including a support, a binder material, or other
      components including usual impurities, as known to the skilled
      person.<br>
      <br>
      [00048] In the process according to the invention, any suitable
      catalyst for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide may be employed. The
      catalyst is immobilized on the coated support of the present
      invention. In one embodiment, the catalyst contains one or more
      metals in elemental form, or in the form of their oxides, carbides
      or hydroxides, wherein the metals are selected from the group
      consisting of Fe, K, Mn, Pd, Co, Cr, Ni, La, Ce, W, Pt, Cu, Na, Cs
      and various mixtures thereof. One suitable catalyst is a mixture
      of iron, manganese and potassium.<br>
      <br>
      [00049] The metal content of the catalyst material may vary within
      broad ranges. A certain minimum metal content is needed to reach a
      desired level of catalyst activity, but a high content will
      increase the chance of particle (active site) agglomeration, and
      reduce efficiency of the catalyst. A suitable range is from 1 to
      50 mass% (elemental metal based on total mass of catalyst
      composition). Preferably, the elemental metal content is from 5 to
      30 mass%, a more preferred range is from 10 to 20 mass%.<br>
      <br>
      [00050] The amount of each metal component present in the catalyst
      used in the process according to the present invention may vary
      within broad limits; a suitable range is from 0.1 to 50 mass %
      (metal content based on total mass of catalyst composition).
      Preferably, said metal content is from 0.2 to 30 mass %, more
      preferably the range is from 0.3 to 20 mass %.<br>
      <br>
      [00051] Preferably, the catalyst used in the process according to
      the invention further comprises at least one alkali or alkaline
      earth metal, because this further increases surface basicity, and
      thus improves the catalyst's yield and selectivity. More
      preferably, said alkali or alkaline earth metal is selected from
      the group consisting of Li, Na, K, Cs and Sr. The advantage of
      such catalysts is that side-reactions in the process of the
      invention are effectively suppressed, especially the methanation
      reaction. If the catalyst comprises a support material, an
      additional advantage of these metals being present is that the
      catalyst is more robust, i.e. has better mechanical stability.
      [00052] The amount of each alkali or alkaline earth metal
      component present in the catalyst used in the process according to
      the present invention may vary within broad ranges; a suitable
      range is from 0.1 to 50 mass% (metal content based on total mass
      of catalyst composition). Preferably, said metal content is from
      0.2 to 30 mass%, more preferably the range is from 0.3 to 20
      mass%.<br>
      <br>
      [00053] The catalyst may be applied in the process of the
      invention in various geometric forms, for example as spherical
      pellets.<br>
      <br>
      [00054] In the process according to the invention the step of
      contacting the gaseous feed mixture containing carbon dioxide and
      hydrogen with a catalyst can be performed over a wide temperature
      range. As the reaction is endothermic, a high temperature will
      promote conversion, but too high temperature may also induce
      unwanted reactions; therefore this step is preferably performed at
      a temperature ranging from 100 to 500[deg.]C, more preferably from
      200 to 450[deg.]C, even more preferred from 250 to 350[deg.]C.<br>
      <br>
      [00055] The step of contacting the gaseous feed mixture containing
      carbon dioxide and hydrogen with a catalyst according to the
      process of the invention can be performed over a wide pressure
      range. A higher pressure tends to enable lower reaction
      temperatures, but very high pressures are not practical; therefore
      this step is preferably performed at a pressure ranging from 0.1
      to 6 MPa, more preferably from 0.5 to 5 MPa, or from 1 to 3.5 MPa.<br>
      <br>
      [00056] The contact time in the step of contacting the gaseous
      feed mixture containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen with a
      catalyst according to the process of the invention may vary
      widely, but is preferable from 0.5 to 6 seconds, more preferably
      from 1.5 to 5 seconds, or from 2 to 4 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [00057] The process according to the invention can be performed in
      conventional reactors and apparatuses; which are, for example,
      also used in methane reforming reactions. The skilled man will be
      able to select a suitable reactor set-up depending on specific
      conditions and circumstances. Suitable types of reactors include
      continuous fixed bed reactors or a continuous stirred tank
      reactor, but are not limited to such reactors. In view of the high
      reaction temperature, and catalytic activity of some metals like
      Ni in methanation reactions, use of a material comprising Ni or
      other active metals for making reactors walls etc. is preferable
      avoided. For this reason it is preferred to apply e.g. glass
      linings for relevant reactor parts. [00058] In the process
      according to the present invention, carbon dioxide is selectively
      converted into carbon monoxide by a reverse water gas shift
      reaction in the presence of a specific catalyst. The resulting
      product of this C02 hydrogenation process is a gas mixture
      containing carbon monoxide and water, and non- converted carbon
      dioxide and hydrogen. This can, in case of excess hydrogen, also
      be represented by the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      [00059] The water formed in this reaction is generally removed
      from the product stream, because this will drive the equilibrium
      reaction in the desired direction, and because water may interfere
      with subsequent reactions of the syngas. Water can be removed from
      the product stream using any suitable method known in the art,
      e.g. by condensation and liquid/gas separation.<br>
      <br>
      [00060] The amount of hydro gen in the feed gas, that is the value
      for n in the above reaction scheme, may vary widely, for example
      from n=l to n=5, to result in a syngas composition, e.g. expressed
      as its H2/CO ratio or as the stoichiometric number (SN), which can
      consequently vary within wide limits. The advantage thereof is
      that the syngas composition can be adjusted and controlled to
      match the desired use requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [00061] Preferably, SN of the produced syngas mixture is from 0.1
      to 4.0; more preferably SN is from 0.5 to 3.5 or even from 1.0 to
      3.0. Such syngas product streams can be further employed as feed
      stock in different syngas conversion processes, like methanol
      formation, olefin synthesis, reduction of iron oxide in steel
      production, oxosynthesis, or (hydro)carbonylation reactions.
      [00062] The molar ratios of C02 and H2 may be varied in the
      reactor to influence the composition of the resulting in a syngas
      composition. For example, the feed gas may contain C02 and H2 in
      molar ratio of about 1 :3 (n=3 in above equation), resulting in a
      syngas composition with H2/CO or SN of about 2; which can be
      advantageously used in olefin or methanol synthesis processes.<br>
      <br>
      [00063] The carbon dioxide in the gaseous feed mixture used in the
      process of the invention can originate from various sources.
      Preferably, the carbon dioxide comes from a waste gas stream, e.g.
      from a plant on the same site, like for example from ammonia
      synthesis, optionally with (non-catalytic) adjustment of the gas
      composition, or after recovering the carbon dioxide from a gas
      stream or from the environment. Recycling such carbon dioxide as
      starting material in the process of the invention thus contributes
      to reducing the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere
      (from a chemical production site). The carbon dioxide used as feed
      may also at least partly have been removed from the effluent gas
      of the RWGS reaction itself. [00064] The gaseous feed mixture
      comprising carbon dioxide and hydrogen used in the process of the
      invention may further contain other gases, provided that these do
      not negatively affect the reaction. Examples of such other gases
      include steam or an alkane, like methane, propane or iso-butane.
      An advantage of such a process according to the invention is that
      the carbon dioxide hydrogenation reaction can be combined and even
      integrated with for example steam reforming of methane or with dry
      reforming of methane (also called C02 reforming). An additional
      advantage hereof is that water formed by C02 hydrogenation can
      react with methane to produce more hydrogen; even such that the
      water level in the final product is very low.<br>
      <br>
      [00065] The invention thus also relates to an integrated process
      for making syngas comprising a hydrocarbon, esp. methane,
      reforming step and a RWGS step as defined in the above.
      Preferably, the hydrogen to carbon dioxide ratio in the feed
      mixture is at least 2 in this combined process according to the
      invention, because such excess hydrogen in the gas streams
      prevents coke formation, which could otherwise de -activate the
      catalyst; and thus this process results in good catalyst
      stability.<br>
      <br>
      [00066] The invention further relates to the use of the syngas
      mixture obtained with the process according to the invention as
      feed material for a process of making a chemical product; like
      methanol production, olefin and alkane synthesis (e.g. via
      Fischer-Tropsch reaction), aromatics production, oxosynthesis,
      carbonylation of methanol or carbonylation of olefins.<br>
      [00067] The invention therefore further relates to a process for
      making a chemical product using a syngas mixture as an
      intermediate or as feed material, which process comprises a step
      wherein carbon dioxide is hydrogenated according to the invention.
      Examples of such a process include methanol production, olefin and
      hydrocarbon synthesis, aromatics production, oxosynthesis,
      carbonylation of methanol, or carbonylation of olefins.<br>
      <br>
      [00068] The invention will be illustrated by the following
      non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1 Catalyst Support Preparation</b><br>
      <br>
      [00069] Gamma alumina was used as support material. An incipient
      wetness impregnation method was used for catalyst preparation.
      Ce(N03)3.6H20 and alumina were added to a flask containing
      deionized water at the concentrations required to obtain the
      desired weight ratio of 12/100 Ce/Al. These impregnated samples
      were then dried at 373K in ambient air. Finally, the support was
      calcined at 1073K for 4 hours, under static air conditions.
      Subsequently, the active C02 hydrogenation catalyst was dispersed
      over the support by co-incipient wetness impregnation (co-IWI).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the support' s operation and use</b><br>
      <br>
      [00070] The reaction setup wherein the supported catalyst from
      Example 1 was employed is shown in Figure 1. C02 hydrogenation
      reactions were conducted in a 1 L continuously stirred tank
      reactor. In a typical experiment, about 20 g of calcined catalyst
      were dispersed in approximately 400 ml of mineral oil (Aldrich)
      and subsequently reduced in-situ using CO at 290[deg.]C for 48
      hours. Two mass flow controllers regulated by a multi- gas
      controller, were used to adjust the flow rate of C02 and H2.
      Hydrogenation of C02 was conducted at 290[deg.]C, 200 psig and a
      GHSV of 1400 h&lt;"1&gt; at a H2:C02 ratio of 3: 1. The effluent
      gases were analyzed online. The pressure in the reactor was kept
      constant.<br>
      <br>
      [00071] The results showed that use of a Ceria-coated
      gamma-alumina as the support for the dispersed C02 hydrogenation
      catalyst will increase C02 conversion yield by at least 25% in
      comparison to dispersed C02 hydrogenated catalyst over uncoated
      gamma-alumina supports. This increase in yield is extremely high
      for any process in the petrochemical industry.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      [00072] Rather than calcining the catalyst at 800 [deg.]C, the
      catalyst, prepared via an identical synthesis route was calcined
      at 500 [deg.]C. A 12 wt% Ce/alumina support was prepared using
      IWI, which was followed by calcination for 4 hours at 500 [deg.]C.
      The temperature at which the treatment occurs plays a pivotal role
      in modifying the ceria' s morphology. While ceria nano-particles
      calcined at lower temperatures are smaller in diameter and show
      more lattice defects/oxygen vacancies, making them more active for
      the WGS activity, calcination at a higher temperature results in
      larger ceria particles, which concurrently leads to less oxygen
      vacancies. Smaller ceria particles have also been reported to be
      more easily reduced than larger ones. SEM images of Ce/Al203
      particles prepared at the different calcination temperatures show
      different particle sizes, with the ceria particles calcined at 500
      [deg.]C having particle sizes ranging from 200-400 nm, and the
      ceria particles calcined at 800 [deg.]C having particle sizes
      ranging from 500-800nm (see Figures 2 and 3). The XRD pattern of
      the ceria coated alumina show clear and distinct diffraction peaks
      associated with the Ce02 fluorite lattice, corroborating the
      presence of large, crystalline particles on top of the alumina
      support (see Figure 4).<br>
      <br>
      [00073] Ceria is also known to act as a good growth substrate for
      metal clusters. Oxygen vacancies within the ceria lattice result
      in the localization of charge over the cations surrounding the
      vacancy, which in turn serve as nucleation sites for metal
      clusters. Having obtained the modified alumina support, the same
      Fe/Mn/K loading, namely 17 wt%, 12 wt% and 8 wt% respectively as
      was deposited on the support. However, due to the reduction in
      surface area of about 50% (from approximately 200m&lt;2&gt;/g to
      100m&lt;2&gt;/g) upon ceria deposition, the amount of
      hydrogenation catalyst deposited on the surface was adjusted to
      provide the same amount of catalyst per surface area to allow an
      appropriate comparison between the samples. Ce02 precipitation
      onto alumina is known to significantly reduce the support's
      surface area and pore volume, due to plugging of the pores by the
      ceria particles. The catalysts prepared had identical K, Mn, Fe
      and Ce loadings, with the only variation between them being the
      different calcination temperature of the Ce-impregnated support
      (denoted FeMnKCeA1500 and FeMnKCeA1800 for supports calcined at
      500 [deg.]C and 800 [deg.]C, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      [00074] Both the FeMnKCeA1500 and FeMnKCeA1800 were tested for
      their activity in C02 hydrogenation, to establish the effect the
      calcination temperature has on C02 conversion ability. Based on
      the increased WGS activity of smaller ceria particles, one may
      expect that the FeMnKCeA1500 would outperform the<br>
      FeMnKCeA1800 catalyst, showing that smaller nanoparticles
      containing more defects perform better in the RWGS reaction. Both
      catalysts showed a marked improvement in C02 conversion in
      comparison to the ceria- free catalyst, with C02 conversion
      increasing from 41.4% to 47.5% over the FeMnKCeA1500 catalyst and
      C02 conversion of 50.4% over the FeMnKCeA1800. Furthermore,
      besides the increase in C02 conversion a reduction in methane
      formation was observed over both the FeMnKCeA1500 catalyst and the
      FeMnKCeA1800 catalyst, in comparison to the ceria-free catalyst.
      Both catalysts also showed an increase in CO production relative
      to the ceria-free catalyst. All catalyst show comparable
      olefin/paraffin ratios as well as an equivalent affinity for the
      formation of the C2-C5+ fraction as shown in Table 1 below.<br>
      <br>
      [00076] The lower C02 conversion over the FeMnKCeA1500 catalyst in
      comparison to the FeMnKCeA1800 catalyst can be explained on the
      basis that coverage of the active sites for chain growth by other
      co-catalysts per unit surface area available has resulted in a
      diminished activity. FeMnKCeA1500 has a lower concentration of
      ceria surface species in comparison to FeMnKCeA1800 (by approx.
      42%) as was deduced from XPS analyses (see Figure 5). It can be
      concluded that upon precipitation of Fe, Mn and K onto the treated
      support, these metals form on top of the ceria grains resulting in
      a reduced availability of the active ceria sites for the RWGS.
      [00077] The reduced C02 conversion of FeMnKCe500 in comparison to
      FeMnKCe800 can be explained by the better dispersion of the C02
      hydrogenation catalyst over the smaller ceria particles. As the
      number of defect sites on the ceria surface increases and thus the
      number of sites for Fe/Mn/K particle crystallization also
      increases, the C02 hydrogenation catalyst will be better dispersed
      over the ceria calcined at the lower temperature, resulting in a
      reduced surface availability of the ceria for the RWGS reaction to
      occur (see Figure 6 for a schematic diagram of the catalytic
      system). Even though surface ceria is reduced by approximately 42%
      in FeMnKCeA1500 compared to FeMnKCeA1800 (see Table 2), the
      activity is only diminished by about 32%. This is indicative of
      the smaller ceria particles being indeed more active for the RWGS,
      showing an elevated reducibility and thus leading to a higher
      concentration of active sites per surface area for the RWGS.<br>
      <br>
      [00078] These examples have shown a significant improvement of C02
      hydrogenation ability over the iron- based catalyst through the
      addition of ceria. A truly bifunctional catalyst has been created
      that converts C02/H2 to valuable HC by carefully adjusting the
      synthesis procedures. The present catalyst incorporates both RWGS
      activity and chain-growth to yield high C02 conversion levels. The
      addition of ceria prior to the deposition of the C02 hydrogenation
      catalyst results in an approximately 22% increase in C02
      conversion, while the product selectivity is not detrimentally
      affected. It has also been shown that the calcination temperature
      prior to the deposition of Fe/Mn/K and the correlated ceria
      particle size may be used to tailor the catalyst' s activity.<br>
      Experimental Methods used in the Examples<br>
      <br>
      [00079] 20g of calcined catalyst were dispersed in approximately
      400 ml of mineral oil (Aldrich) in a 1L three-phase slurry
      continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Testing apparatus and
      conditions are reported in Dorner, R. W., Hardy, D. R., Williams,
      F. W., and Willauer, H. D., Applied Catalysis A: General (2009)..
      Time- on-stream (TOS) for the catalyst was 100 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [00080] BET surface areas were measured using a Micromeritics
      ASAP2010 accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. An
      appropriate amount (-0.25 g) of catalyst sample was taken and
      slowly heated to 200 [deg.]C for 10 h under vacuum (~50 m Torr).
      The sample was then transferred to the adsorption unit, and the N2
      adsorption was measured at the boiling temperature of nitrogen (T
      = -196 [deg.]C). <br>
      <br>
      [00081] Powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed
      on all spent catalyst materials. The catalyst was washed in
      heptane before XRD measurements were taken to remove the mineral
      oil from the solids. The catalyst was subsequently recovered by
      conventional filtering procedures. The data were collected on a D8
      Siemens Bruker diffractometer with a general area detector
      employing the Bragg-Brentano geometry and the CuKal wavelength.
      The data were collected in the 20-50[deg.] 2[Theta] range with a
      step increment of 0.01[deg.] and the time for each step was 2
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [00082] XPS measurements were performed on all spent catalyst
      materials and were used to assess the surface species and
      quantities present on the powder particles. The XPS studies were
      carried out using a K- Alpha machine (Thermo Scientific, UK) and
      the Unifit software (Hesse, R., Chasse, T., and Szargan, R.,
      Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry 375 (7), 856 (2003)) for
      data analysis, using the instrument specific powder sample holder.
      The system's base pressure was less than 5 x 10&lt;~9&gt; mbar,
      however the pressure in the analysis chamber during data
      collection and analysis was 2 x 10&lt;~7&gt; mbar due to the use
      of the low-energy electron flood gun for charge neutralization. A
      monochromated Al Ka (hv = 1486.6 eV) was used as the x-ray source.
      The instrument is regularly calibrated to the binding energies
      (BE) of Au, Cu and Ag peaks. The C Is, O Is and Al 2p BE are used
      as internal standards. The Al/C signal ratio (3/2) is almost
      constant for all samples, ensuring comparability of collected
      data. All atomic percentages obtained by XPS in this work are
      converted to weight percentages for comparability sake. [00083]
      Structural and chemical characterization was performed with a
      field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) - Model LEO
      DSM 982, LEO. The SEM was operated at an accelerating voltage of 5
      kV and the working distance varied from 3 to 8mm. The powder was
      placed under the SEM detector as a loosely scattered powder stuck
      to conducting tape. All particle sizes quoted in this paper are
      average particle sizes representative of the total sample.<br>
