    <blockquote>
      <p><b>With</b> an ordinary horseshoe magnet, a bit of soft iron,
        and a common shingle-nail, a practical inventor, who for years
        has been pondering over the power lying dormant in the magnet,
        now demonstrates as his discovery a fact of the utmost
        importance in magnetic science, which has hitherto escaped the
        observation of both scientists and practical electricians,
        namely, the existence of a neutral line in the magnetic field
        --- a line where the polarity of an induced magnet ceases, and
        beyond which it changes. With equally simple appliances he shows
        the practical utilization of his discovery in such a way as to
        produce a magnetic motor, thus opening up a bewildering prospect
        of the possibilities before us in revolutionizing the present
        methods of motive power through the substitution of a
        wonderfully cheap and safe agent. By his achievement Mr. Wesley
        W. Gary has quite upset the theories of magnetic philosophy
        hitherto prevailing, and lifted magnetism out from among the
        static forces where science has placed it, to the position of a
        dynamic power. The Gary Magnetic Motor, the result of Mr. Gary's
        long years of study, in a word, a simple contrivance which
        furnishes its own power, and will run until worn out by the
        force of friction, coming dangerously near to that awful
        bugbear, perpetual motion. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote>The old way of looking at magnetism has been to regard
      it as a force like that of gravity, the expenditure of an amount
      of energy equal to its attraction being required to overcome it;
      consequently its power could not be availed of. Accepting this
      theory, it would be as idle to attempt to make use of the
      permanent magnet as a motive power as to try to lift oneself by
      one's bootstraps. But Mr. Gary, ignoring theories, toiled away at
      his experiments with extraordinary patience and perseverance, and
      at last made the discovery which seems to necessitate
      reconstruction of the accepted philosophy. To understand the
      operation of the Gary Magnetic Motor, it is necessary first to
      comprehend thoroughly the principle underlying it --- the
      existence of the neutral line and the change in polarity, which
      Mr. Gary demonstrates by his horseshoe magnet, his bit of soft
      iron, and his common shingle-nail. This is illustrated in Figure
      1. The latter A represents a compound magnet; B, a piece of soft
      iron made fast to a lever with a pivoted joint in the center, the
      iron becoming a magnet by induction when in the magnetic field of
      the permanent magnet; C, a small nail that drops off when the
      iron, or induced magnet, is on the neutral line. By pressing the
      finger on the lever at D the iron is raised above the neutral
      line. Now let the nail be applied to the end of the induced magnet
      at E; it clings to it, and the point is turned inward toward the
      pole of the magnet directly below it, thus indicating that the
      induced magnet is of opposite polarity from the permanent one. Now
      let the iron be gradually lowered toward the magnet; the nail
      drops off at the neutral line, and now its point is turned
      outward, or away from the magnetic pole below. In this way Mr.
      Gary proves that the polarity of an induced magnet is changed by
      passing over the neutral line without coming into contact. In the
      experiment strips of paper are placed under the soft iron, or
      induced magnet, as shown in the figure, to prevent contact.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The neutral line is shown to extend completely around
      the magnet; and a piece of soft iron placed on this line will
      entirely cut off the attraction of the magnet from anything
      beyond. The action of this cutting off is illustrated in Figure 2.
      The letters A and B represent the one a balanced magnet and the
      other a stationary magnet. The magnet A is balanced on a joint,
      and the two magnets are placed with opposite poles facing each
      other. The letter C is a piece of thin or sheet iron, as the case
      may be, made fast to a lever with a joint in the center, and so
      adjusted that the iron will move on the neutral line in front of
      the poles of the stationary magnet. By pressing the finger on the
      lever at D the iron is raised, thus withdrawing the cut-off so
      that the magnet A is attracted and drawn upward by the magnet B.
      Remove the finger, and the cut-off drops between the poles, and in
      consequence, the magnet A drops again. The same movement of
      magnets can be obtained by placing a piece of iron across the
      poles of the magnet B after the magnet A has been drawn near to
      it. The magnet A will thereupon immediately fall away; but the
      iron can only be balanced, and the balance not disturbed, by the
      action of the magnets upon each other when the iron is on the
      neutral line, and does not move nearer or father away from the
      magnet B.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It may not be found easy to demonstrate these principles
      at the first trials. But it should be borne in mind that it took
      the inventor himself four years after he had discovered the
      principle to adjust the delicate balance so as to get a machine
      which would go. Now, however, that he has thought out the entire
      problem, and frankly tells the world how he has solved it, any
      person at all skillful and patient, and with a little knowledge of
      mechanics, may soon succeed in demonstrating it for himself.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The principle underlying the motor and the method by
      which a motion is obtained now being explained, let us examine the
      inventor's working models. The beam movement is the simplest, and
      by it, it is claimed, the most power can be obtained from the
      magnets. This is illustrated in Figure 3. The letter A represents
      a stationary magnet, and B the soft iron, or induced magnet,
      fastened to a lever with a joint in the center, and so balanced
      that the stationary magnet will not quite draw it over the neutral
      line. The letter C represents a beam constructed of a double
      magnet, clamped together in the center and balanced on a joint.
      One end is set opposite the stationary magnet, with like poles
      separating each other. The beam is so balanced that when the soft
      iron B on the magnet A is below the neutral line, it (the beam) is
      repelled down to the lower dotted line indicated by the letter D.
      The beam strikes the lever E with the pin F attached, and drives
      it (the lever) against the pin G, which is attached to the soft
      iron B, which is thus driven above the neutral line, where its
      polarity changes. The soft iron now attracts the beam magnet C to
      the upper dotted line, whereupon it (the soft iron) is again drawn
      down over the neutral line, and its polarity again changing, the
      beam magnet C is again repelled to the lower line, continuing so
      to move until it is stopped or worn out. This simply illustrates
      the beam movement. To gain a large amount of power the inventor
      would place groups of compound stationary magnets above and below
      the beam at each side, and the soft iron magnets, in this case
      four in number, connected by rods passing down between the poles
      of the stationary magnets. A "Pitman" connecting the beam with a
      flywheel to change the reciprocating into a rotary motion would be
      the means of transmitting the power. With magnets of great size an
      enormous power, he claims, could be obtained in this way.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>One of the daintiest and prettiest of Mr. Gary's models
      is that illustrating the action of a rotary motor. There is a
      peculiar fascination in watching the action of this neat little
      contrivance. It is shown in Figure 4. The letter A represents an
      upright magnet hung on a perpendicular shaft; B, the horizontal
      magnets; C, the soft iron which is fastened to the lever D; E, the
      pivoted joint on which the lever is balanced; and F, the
      thumb-screw for adjusting the movement of the soft iron. This soft
      iron is so balanced that as the north pole of the upright magnet A
      swings around opposite and above the south pole of the horizontal
      magnets B, it drops below the neutral line and changes its
      polarity. As the magnet A turns around until its north pole is
      opposite and above the north pole of the magnets B, the soft iron
      is drawn upward and over the neutral line, so that its polarity is
      changed again. At this point the polarity in the soft iron C is
      like that of the permanent magnets A and B. To start the engine
      the magnet A is turned around to the last-named position, the
      poles opposite like poles of the magnet B; then one pole of the
      magnet A is pushed a little forward and over the soft iron. This
      rotary magnet is repelled by the magnets B, and also by the soft
      iron; it turns around until the unlike poles of the permanent
      magnets become opposite; as they attract each other the soft iron
      drops below the neutral line, the polarity changes and becomes
      opposite to that of the magnets B and like that of the magnet A;
      the momentum gained carries the pole of A a little forward of B
      and over the soft iron, which, now being of like polarity, repels
      it around to the starting point, completing the revolution. The
      magnets A and B now compound or unite their forces, and the soft
      iron is again drawn up over the neutral line; its polarity is
      changed, and another revolution is made without any other force
      applied than the force of the magnets. The motion will continue
      until some outside force is applied to stop it, or until the
      machine is worn out.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The result is the same as would be obtained were the
      magnets B removed and the soft iron coiled with wire, and battery
      force applied sufficient to give it the same power that it gets
      from the magnets B, and a current-changer applied to change the
      polarity. The power required to work the current-changer in this
      case would be in excess of the power demanded to move the soft
      iron over the neutral line, since no power is required from the
      revolving magnet under these circumstances, it being moved by the
      magnets compounding when like poles are opposite each other, three
      magnets thus attracting the iron. When opposite poles are near
      together, they attract each other and let the iron drop below the
      line. The soft iron, with its lever, is finely balanced at the
      joint, and has small springs applied and adjusted so as to balance
      it against the power of the magnets. In this working model the
      soft iron vibrates less than a fiftieth of an inch.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>This rotary motion is intended for use in small engines
      where light power is required, such as propelling sewing machines,
      for dental work, show windows, etc.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>When Wesley Gary was a boy of nine years, the electric
      telegraph was in its infancy and the marvel of the day; and his
      father, who was a clergyman in Cortland County, New York, used to
      take up matters of general interest and make them the subject of
      an occasional lecture, among other things, giving much attention
      to the explanation of this new invention. To illustrate his
      remarks on the subject he employed an electromagnetic machine.
      This and his father's talk naturally excited the boy's curiosity,
      and he used to ponder much on the relations of electricity and
      magnetism, until he formed a shadowy idea that somehow they must
      become a great power in the world. He never lost his interest in
      the subject, though his rude experiments were interrupted for a
      while by the work of his young manhood. When the choice of a
      calling was demanded, he at first had a vague feeling that he
      would like to be an artist. "But", he says, "my friends would have
      thought that almost as useless and unpractical as to seek for
      perpetual motion." At last he went into the woods a-lumbering, and
      took contracts to clear large tracts of woodland in Western and
      Central New York, floating the timber down the canals to Troy. He
      followed this business for several years, when he was forced to
      abandon it by a serious attack of inflammatory rheumatism, brought
      about through exposure in the woods. And this, unfortunate as it
      must have seemed at the time, proved the turning-point in his
      life. His family physicians insisted that he must look for some
      other means of livelihood than lumbering. To the query, "What
      shall I do?" it was suggested that he might take to preaching,
      following in the footsteps of his father, and of a brother who had
      adopted the profession. But this he said he could never do; he
      would do his best to practice, but he couldn't preach. "Invent
      something, then," said the doctor. "There is no doubt in my mind
      that you were meant for an inventor." This was said in all
      seriousness, and Mr. Gary was at length persuaded that the doctor
      knew him better than he did himself. His thoughts naturally
      recurring to the experiments and dreams of his youth, he
      determined to devote all his energies to the problem. He felt more
      and more confident, as he dwelt on the matter, that a great force
      lay imprisoned within the magnet; that some time it must be
      unlocked and set to doing the world's work; that the key was
      hidden somewhere, and that he might find it as well as some one
      else.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>At Huntington, Pennsylvania, Mr. Gary made his first
      practical demonstration, and allowed his discovery to be examined
      and the fact published. He has long been satisfied, from his
      experiments, that if he could devise a "cut-off", the means of
      neutralizing the attractive power of a stationary magnet on
      another raised above it and adjusted on a pivot, unlike poles
      opposite, and so arrange this cut-off as to work automatically, he
      could produce motion in a balanced magnet. To this end he
      persistently experimented, and it was only about four years ago
      that he made the discovery, the key to his problem, which is the
      basis of his present motor, and upsets our philosophy. In
      experimenting one day with a piece of soft iron upon a magnet he
      made the discovery of the neutral line and the change of polarity.
      At first he gave little attention to the discovery of the change
      of polarity, not then recognizing its significance, being absorbed
      entirely by the possibilities the discovery of the neutral line
      opened up to him. Here was the point for his cut-off. For a while
      he experimented entirely with batteries, but in September, 1874,
      he succeeded in obtaining a movement independent of the battery.
      This was done on the principle illustrated in Figure 2. The
      balanced magnet, with opposite poles to the stationary magnet, was
      weighted so that the poles would fall down when not attracted by
      the stationary magnet. When it was attracted up to the stationary
      magnet, a spring was touched by the movement, and thus the lever
      with the soft iron was made to descend between the two magnets on
      the neutral line, and so cutting of the mutual attraction. Then
      the balanced magnet, responding to the force of gravitation,
      descended, and, when down, struck another spring, by means of
      which the cut-off was lifted back to its original position, and
      consequently the force of attraction between the magnets was again
      brought into play. In June, the following year, Mr. Gary exhibited
      this continuous movement to a number of gentlemen, protecting
      himself by covering the cut-of with copper, so as to disguise the
      real material used, and prevent anyone from robbing him of his
      discovery. The publication in the local newspaper of the
      performance of the little machine, which was copied far and wide,
      excited much interest. But the inventor was by no means satisfied.
      He had succeeded in securing a continuous motion, but not in a
      practical motor. He had invented a unique plaything, but not a
      machine that would do a man's work. So he made further experiments
      in one direction and another, using for a long time the battery;
      and it was not until some time after he moved to Boston (which was
      about two years ago) that he was convinced that the point in the
      change of polarity, with which he was so little impressed when he
      first hit upon them along with his discovery of the neutral line,
      were the true ones to work upon. Thereafter his progress was most
      rapid, and in a little while he had constructed working models,
      not only to his own satisfaction, but to that of those experts who
      had the fairness to give them a critical and thorough examination,
      clearly demonstrating his ability to secure motion and power, as
      they had never before been secured, from self-feeding and
      self-acting machines. His claim, as he formally puts it, is this:
      "I have discovered that a straight piece of iron placed across the
      poles of a magnet, and near to their end, changes its polarity
      while in the magnetic field and before it comes in contact with
      the magnet, the fact being, however, that actual contact is
      guarded against. The conditions are that the thickness of the iron
      magnet must be proportioned to the power of the magnet, and that
      the neutral line, or line of change in the polarity of the iron,
      is nearer or more distant from the magnet according to the power
      of the latter and the thickness of the former. My whole discovery
      is based upon this change of polarity in the iron, with or without
      a battery." Power can be increased to any extent, or diminished,
      by the addition or withdrawal of magnets.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Mr. Gary is 41 years old, having been born in 1837.
      During the years devoted to working out his problem he has
      supported himself by the proceeds from the sale of a few useful
      inventions made from time to time when he was forced to turn aside
      from his experiments to raise funds. From the sale of one of these
      inventions --- a simple little thing --- he realized something
      like $10,000.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The announcement of the invention of the magnetic motor
      came at a moment when the electric light excitement was at its
      height. The holders of gas stocks were in a state of anxiety, and
      those who had given attention to the study of the principle of the
      new light expressed the belief that it was only the question of
      the cost of power used to generate the electricity for the light
      that stood in the way of its general introduction and substitution
      for gas. A prominent electrician, who was one day examining Mr.
      Gary's principle, asked if in the change of polarity he had
      obtained electric sparks. He said that he had, and the former then
      suggested that the principle be used in the construction of a
      magneto-electric machine, and that it might turn out to be
      superior to anything then in use. Acting on this suggestion, Mr.
      Gary set to work, and within a week had perfected a machine which
      apparently proved a marvel of efficiency and simplicity. In all
      previous machines electricity is generated by revolving a piece of
      soft iron in front of the poles of a permanent magnet. But to do
      this at a rate of speed high enough to produce sparks in such
      rapid succession as to keep up a steady current of electricity
      suitable for the light, considerable power is required. In Mr.
      Gary's machine, however, the piece of soft iron, or armature,
      coiled with wire, has only to be moved across the neutral line to
      secure the same result. Every time the polarity changes, a spark
      is produced. The slightest vibration is enough to secure this, and
      with each vibration two sparks are produced, just as with each
      revolution in the other method. An enormous volume can be secured
      with an expenditure of force so diminutive that a caged squirrel
      might furnish it. With the employment of one of the smallest of
      the magnetic motors, power may be supplied and electricity
      generated at no expense beyond the cost of the machine.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The announcement of the invention of the magnetic motor
      was naturally received with incredulity, although the recent
      achievements in mechanical science had prepared the public for
      almost anything, and it could not be very much astonished at
      whatever might come next. Some admitted that there might be
      something in it; others shrugged their shoulders and said, "Wait
      and see', while the scientific referred all questioners to the
      laws of magnetic science; and believers in book authority
      responded, "It can't be so, because the law says it can't." A few
      scientists, however, came forward, curious to see, and examined
      Mr. Gary's models; and when reports went out of the conversion of
      two or three of the most eminent among them, interest generally
      was awakened, and professors from Harvard and the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology called, examined, and were impressed. More
      promptly than the scientists, capitalists moved; and before
      science had openly acknowledged the discovery and the principle of
      the invention, men of money were after Mr. Gary for the right to
      use the motor for various purposes: one wished to use it for
      clocks, another for sewing machines, others for dental engines,
      and so on.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is as yet too soon to speculate upon what may result
      from the discovery; but since it produces power in two ways, both
      directly by magnets and indirectly by the generation of unlimited
      electricity, it would seem that it really might become available
      in time for all purposes to which electricity might long ago have
      been devoted except for the great expense involved. Within one
      year after the invention of the telephone it was in practical use
      all over the world, from the United States to Japan. And it is not
      incredible that in 1880 one may be holding a magnetic motor in his
      pocket, running the watch which requires no winding up, and,
      seated in a railway car, be whirling across the continent behind a
      locomotive impelled by the same agency.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>The primary object of my invention is to facilitate and
      greatly lessen the expense of generating or developing electrical
      currents by dynamo machines, and instruments, by so improving
      their construction and modes of action that they may be operated
      by a very small amount of power and at high rates of speed.
      <p>With this end in view, the invention consists broadly, in so
        constructing the machine or instrument that the soft iron
        armature or core used with the induction coil, is operated
        constantly in one and the same magnetic field, and caused to be
        polarized and depolarized or to change its polarity without
        departing from such field. </p>
      <p>Many machines have been hitherto constructed for the purpose of
        developing electrical currents, through the medium of a soft
        iron armature coiled with wire and subjected to and magnetized
        by the inductive influence of a permanent magnet, the armature
        or the magnet being moved, one in relation to the other, in such
        manner as to cause the armature to change or lose its polarity
        rapidly and at frequent intervals. </p>
      <p>In order to secure this reversal or loss of polarity in the
        armature without having it actually touch the magnet it has been
        hitherto considered necessary that the armature should be
        carried into and out of the magnetic field or field of
        attraction of the magnet; or else from the field of one pole
        into that of the other. This operation required the movement of
        the armature a long distance, necessitating the expenditure of a
        large amount of power, limited the frequency of the polar
        changes, and precluded the full utilization of the magnetic
        influence. </p>
      <p>My invention derives its value mainly from the fact that I do
        not carry the armature out of the magnetic field, but operate it
        wholly therein, and secure by a very slight movement the same or
        better results than those secured in existing machines.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>My invention is based upon the fact hitherto unknown,
      that there exists in the magnetic field or field of attraction of
      every magnet, at a greater or less distance from the magnet, what
      I term a neutral line at which soft iron will not be polarized, or
      magnetized, by the inductive action of the magnet.
      <p>The location of the neutral line as regards its distance from
        the magnet differs in different cases, the line approaching the
        magnet in proportion to the increase in strength of the magnet
        and receding as the size or cubic contents of the armature is
        increased.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The location of the line may be readily determined by
      applying a coil and galvanometer to the iron and moving it to and
      from the magnet; or by applying a dipping needle to the armature
      and noting the point at which the needle assumes a horizontal
      position or by allowing a tack or other small piece of iron to
      adhere to the armature and noting the point at which the tack is
      released by the same.
      <p>I have discovered that iron placed on this line although
        subject to a strong attractive influence on the part of the
        magnet, remains unpolarized, but that upon moving it from the
        line in either direction it instantly assumes a polarity. I have
        also discovered that the polarity of the iron differs on
        opposite sides of the line and changes on crossing the same, so
        that if the iron placed in close proximity to the magnet and
        polarized, by induction, be carried outward, it will lose
        polarity on reaching the neutral line, and then assume a reverse
        polarity as it passes from the line outward. </p>
      <p>By availing myself of this fact and arranging the armature to
        vibrate from the neutral line inward, or from the neutral line
        outward, or to work across the line, and in connection with a
        commutator, I secure the required changes in the polarity of the
        armature and produce the same results by a very short movement
        that are now secured by the longer one. </p>
      <p>In constructing machines and instruments on my plan, the
        details may be constructed and arranged in any manner desired
        provided the armature has the above described action in relation
        to the magnet. </p>
      <p>The best results are secured by using a horse-shoe magnet,
        compound if desired, extending the armature across its two poles
        on one side, and then arranging the armature to move only
        between the neutral line and the magnet. </p>
      <p>In the accompanying drawings, Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, represent
        the relation of the neutral line to the magnet and magnetic
        field, and also the depolarization and change of polarity of the
        armature. </p>
      <p>Figure 5 represents a perspective view of one form of
        magneto-electric machine constructed on my plan. </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings, A, represents a base frame provided
        with uprights, <i>a</i>, and sustaining in a fixed position a
        horizontal permanent magnet B, of the ordinary compound
        horse-shoe type. C, represents a flat horizontal armature of
        soft iron lying above and extending across both poles of the
        magnet and secured rigidly to one end of a horizontal vibrating
        lever D, which is sustained by a transverse shaft <i>b</i>,
        mounted in the standards <i>a</i>. This lever is provided with
        an upright arm c, the upper end of which is slotted to receive
        and is vibrated by an eccentric, <i>d</i>, mounted on a shaft,
        <i>c</i>, the end of which is provided with a small pinion <i>f</i>,
        and driven at a high speed by a large gear wheel E, as shown.
        This arrangement causes the rotation of wheel E to vibrate the
        lever and move the armature to and from the magnet with great
        rapidity. Around the armature, which is preferably reduced and
        rounded at the middle, there is wound an ordinary wire induction
        coil G. </p>
      <p>In order to balance or sustain the armature against the
        attractive influence of the magnet and avoid the necessity of
        employing a driving power sufficient to overcome the same, I
        place below the vibrating lever two or more springs H, of
        different heights, arranged to come into action successively
        against the under side of the lever and offer an increasing
        resistance as the armature approaches the magnet-and becomes
        subject to an increasing attraction. </p>
      <p>Under this arrangement it is only necessary, in order to
        vibrate the armature, to apply a very slight amount of power, an
        amount sufficient to overcome the friction and the inertia of
        the moving parts. </p>
      <p>In adjusting the machine it is preferred to vibrate the
        armature, from the neutral line, the position shown in Fig. 2,
        inward toward the magnet, to the position shown, in Figure 4, in
        which case the armature will be polarized as it leaves the line
        and depolarized as it again reaches the line. Owing to the fact
        that the armature requires a very slight movement, in some cases
        not exceeding the fiftieth part of an inch; and the fact that it
        is balanced or sustained against the attractive influence of the
        magnet, I am able to drive the machine at a very high speed by
        the application of very little power; and owing to the fact that
        the armature is operated only in close proximity to the magnet
        where the attraction and inductive action are very powerful, I
        produce in the wire induced currents of great quantity and
        intensity. </p>
      <p>If for any special reason it may be considered desirable so to
        do, the parts may be adjusted to vibrate the armature from the
        neutral line outward without passing beyond the magnetic field.
        Or if desired, the parts may so adjusted that the armature shall
        vibrate to and from the magnet across the neutral line, without
        passing from the magnetic field. In such case there will be two
        direct currents or impulses induced during the outward, and two
        during the inward movement or the armature. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of producing a continuous current, a commutator
        or current changer of any suitable or ordinary construction may
        be used. This commutator may be actuated in any suitable manner,
        one simple arrangement being shown in the drawing, in which the
        rear end of the lever is arranged to vibrate an arm, J, the end
        of which is provided with two conducting fingers, K and L, to
        which the ends of the coil are connected. The fingers play
        across three metal plates, M, N and O, which are connected, the
        first two with the conductor P, and the other with conductor O,
        as shown, the arrangement being such that the course of the
        current is changed as the current in the coil reverses, so as to
        produce a continuous current in the conductors P and O. It is to
        be noted that in all cases the construction of the machine is to
        be such as to utilize the depolarization of the armature at the
        neutral line; that the armature is to remain within the magnetic
        field; and that it is unnecessary to move the armature through
        the entire field. The arrangement of the vibrating armature
        across both poles of the magnet as shown, enables me to make
        constant use of both poles and the entire armature, thus
        utilizing the full power and effect of the magnet. The best
        results are secured when the armature consists as shown in the
        drawing, of two plates or pieces riveted together. </p>
      <p>As before stated, the form, construction, and arrangement of
        the parts may be modified as desired, provided the armature
        operates within the magnetic field, and provided also, the
        current produced by the depolarization of the armature at the
        neutral line is made available for use. </p>
      <p>Having thus described my invention what I claim is: </p>
      <p>The herein described method of producing induced electrical
        currents, consisting in vibrating an iron armature coiled with
        wire, to and from the neutral line in the field of a permanent

        the magnetic field. </p>

    </blockquote>
    <p> </p>
    <blockquote>Be it known that I, Wesley W. Gary, of Huntington, in
      the county of Huntington and State of Pennsylvania, have invented
      certain Improvements in Electric Motors, of which the following is
      a specification.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>My invention consists in the use of a reciprocating
      electromagnet, the poles of which are changed at each movement,
      between two permanent magnets arranged with their reverse poles
      opposite each other; in a peculiar arrangement of devices for
      reversing the current, and in other details hereinafter describe.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The object of my invention is to apply and fully
      utilize, in an electric motor, the power of permanent magnets, and
      to develop from them the greater part of the power, so that motors
      of great power may be actuated by means of small electromagnets,
      and a correspondingly small expenditure of battery power. This end
      I attain by arranging two permanent magnets at a short distance
      apart, with the negative pole of each opposite the positive pole
      of the other, and then arranging between them an electromagnet
      attached to the driving mechanism, and connected with an automatic
      pole changing device, so that the electromagnet is attracted and
      repelled by the two permanent magnets alternately, one attracting
      it at the same time that it is repelled by the other. In this way
      I am enabled to employ constantly and directly the full power of
      the electromagnet and both permanent magnets. As it makes no
      difference in the power o the motor whether the force to move the
      vibrating magnet emanates from permanent or the electromagnet, it
      is obvious that the same results may be obtained by the use of
      strong permanent magnets in connection with a weak electromagnet
      as are obtained by the use of weak permanent magnets and a strong
      electromagnet, so that on my plan I am enabled to construct motors
      of large size and power, and operate them with small batteries at
      a trifling cost. By increasing the power of the permanent magnets
      the power of the motor may be increased to any extent required
      without increasing the amount of battery power required, thus
      producing a large motor, which may be operated with the same
      battery power as a small one. In practice, however, it will be
      found best to increase the size and power of the electromagnet and
      its battery in proportion to the increased power of the permanent
      magnets, but the most satisfactory and economical results are
      obtained when the strength or power of the permanent magnets
      exceeds that of the electromagnet many times.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The form and position of the electromagnet and the fixed
      magnets, the construction of the current-changing device, the
      arrangement of devices for transmitting the power and motion from
      the vibrating electromagnet, and the other details may be varied
      at will, as they form no essential or important part of the
      invention.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is preferred to employ horseshoe magnets, and to
      arrange them in parallel planes; but they may be made in other
      forms, and arranged in different relative positions. The permanent
      magnets may each be made in a single solid piece, or of a series
      of thin magnets clamped together, the latter being preferred.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 represents a top
      plan view of one form of my motor; Figure 2, a side elevation of
      the same; Figure 3, a detail view, illustrating the construction
      of the current changer.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>A and B represent two horizontal permanent magnets,
      arranged one above the other, a small distance apart, with the
      positive pole of each opposite the negative pole of the other. C
      represents an electromagnet, secured to one end of a pivoted
      vibrating beam, D, which has its opposite end connected by a
      pitman, E, to a crank pin on a wheel, F, which is mounted on a
      main driving-shaft, G, as shown, so that the vibration of the
      magnet and beam will set the shaft in motion. The ends of the
      electromagnet C are flattened and extended between the permanent
      magnets A and B, and the parts so arranged that it is free to
      vibrate and carry the end of beam D up and down.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The magnet C is connected with a battery of any suitable
      kind; but between the magnet and the battery there is interposed a
      current charger, H, which reverses the current of electricity and
      changes the polarity of the magnet at the end of each vibration of
      movement, in consequence of which the magnet C is alternately
      repelled by the magnet A and attracted by magnet B, and then
      attracted by A and repelled by B, so that it is kept constantly
      moving up and down between them. The vibration of the
      electromagnet operates the beam D, which, in turn, through the
      pitman and crank, operates the shaft on which the wheel is
      mounted.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The current changer consists of a pivoted vibrating arm,
      H, having one end forked and operated by a tappet, <i>c</i>,
      attached to the beam D, and the other end provided with two spring
      conducting fingers, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, which are connected
      with opposite ends of the helix, and arranged to play over three
      metal plates, <i>f</i>, <i>f</i>, and <i>g</i>, the two former
      connected with the negative and the latter with the positive pole
      of the battery. The fingers always connect with the opposite poles
      of the battery, and each finger alternates from the positive to a
      negative plate, in such manner that the current of electricity has
      its course through the helix of the electromagnet reversed at each
      movement of the fingers.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In order that the permanent magnets may be adjusted in
      case of necessity, and that, when they are composed o a series of
      thin plates or magnets, plates may be added to or removed from the
      series in order to vary the strength of the magnets, they are
      mounted on vertical screws <i>h</i>, and secured by the nuts <i>i</i>,
      in the manner shown.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In practice I find that, in order to prevent the
      permanent magnets from affecting and partially neutralizing each
      other, the faces or poles of the electromagnet should be made as
      wide or wider than those of the permanent magnets.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is also important that the poles of the electromagnet
      shall be flattened on the sides, in order that the entire faces
      may approach close to the faces or poles of the fixed magnets,
      which should be flattened in like manner.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I am aware that motors consisting of an outside circular
      series of permanent magnets and a central rotating series of
      electromagnets, the polarity of which is changed as they pass the
      others, is old; but my arrangement differs therefrom, and is
      superior thereto, in this, that I apply the power to move the
      magnet directly in the line or path o movement, while in the
      rotary machines, the power is applied at a tangent, and
      consequently at a great disadvantage.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>I am aware that it is old to arrange a vibrating
      armature between two electromagnets which were either polarized
      alternately, or else their polarity reversed at each movement of
      the armature; but they differ in my engine, in that they derive
      their power wholly from the electromagnets, while in my engine the
      power is derived mainly from the permanent magnets, and also in
      that they require the use of two electromagnets, while in my
      engine one only is used.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>My combination possesses the advantages of requiring but
      little battery power in proportion to the amount of power
      developed by the engine, and of permitting the vibrating parts to
      be made light, so that the engine may be operated with rapidity.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is obvious that, instead of having a single
      electromagnet and one pair of permanent magnets at one end of the
      beam, there may be a similar combination used at each end or two
      or more combinations used at either end. It is also obvious that,
      instead of using the electromagnet of the horseshoe form, a
      straight one may be arranged transversely between the two
      permanent magnets.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Having thus described my invention, what I claim is:</blockquote>
    <blockquote>1) The combination, in an electric motor, of two
      permanent magnets, A and B, and an electromagnet, C, connected
      with a pole-changing device, and arranged to vibrate between the
      permanent magnets, substantially as shown and described.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>2) The combination of two permanent magnets, arranged
      with their reverse poles opposite to, but separated from, each

      The following two emails describe the two photos posted to the JLN
      discussion list, where Al Francoeur claims to have duplicated the
      basic Wesley Gary neutral magnetic line effect.<br>

      Subject: Wesley Magnet Motor reproduction picture's.<br>
      <br>
      Hello Tim and All<br>
      <br>
      After hard searching, here are the only two picture's of my Wesley
      permanent magnet motor that I could find, but they may be a little
      dark from the scanner.<br>
      <br>
      They are taken when it was under construction using wood and
      horseshoe neodymium magnets that I already have, and other
      material's from the hardware store, and machine shop. I also used
      (roller blade) easy turning greaseless stainless steel bearing's
      to minimize friction on all pivot point's, and allot of sweat
      (labor of love) while building it.<br>
      <br>
      It is the simplest version of the Wesley magnet motor that you can
      ask for, and it does indeed prove to be very interesting. It did
      not cost me much to build and if you build one, it should not cost
      you much either.<br>
      <br>
      I used 1/2" x 1/2 x 13&amp;7/8" long iron bar for the balanced arm
      that holds the shield, and various carburetor spring's with
      different tensions, as the picture shows.<br>
      <br>
      You will have to make adjustments for your version, so make yours
      so as you can adjust the balancing of all the parts. At the same
      time on my version, the counter balance on the main rocker is
      heavier than the horseshoe magnet.<br>
      <br>
      The repelling force from the magnet's are more than enough to
      raise the counter weight to its full highest point against
      gravity. Gravity then pulls the counter weight down, and at the
      same time, the horseshoe magnet attracts to the now dropped shield
      for the next cycle.<br>
      <br>
      These picture's were taken a while ago and they show one of my
      other motor/generator impulse machine's, also, it shows some of
      the parts of my Interference Disc machine unassembled against the
      wall beside the large capacitor's, my disc machine is now mostly
      assembled.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center">&nbsp;<img alt="" src="garyalf1.jpg"
          height="585" width="397">&nbsp; <img alt=""
          src="garyalf2.jpg" height="396" width="413"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      My Wesley magnet motor in this picture shows the arm that
      transfers the rocking motion that activates the shield. If you
      build one, you can use stacked button magnet's, or rod neo
      magnet's with a keeper bar in the back so as to make your
      horseshoe magnet's.<br>
      <br>
      Could someone please upload these two picture's into the vault.
      Thank you very much.<br>
      <br>
      Happy New Year to Everyone.<br>
