      <br>
      The activity of Konstantin Korotkov, deputy director of the St.
      Petersburg Research Institute of Physical Culture and
      world-renowned authority on Kirlian photography, was recently
      highlighted by Life.ru. Korotkov is the developer of the
      gas-discharge visualization (GDV) technique in Kirlian
      photography.<br>
      <br>
      Kirlian photography takes its name from Soviet electrician Semyon
      Kirlian, who discovered the process in 1939. It was the subject of
      extensive research in the 1970s in the Soviet Unionand the West.
      It is commonly described as photographing an object’s aura.
      According to a website associated with Korotkov, he “confirmed
      earlier observations… that the stimulated electro-photonic glow
      around human fingertips contained astonishingly coherent and
      comprehensive information about the human state – both
      physiological and psychological.”<br>
      <br>
      In other words, the GDV technique, which was developed in the late
      1990s, can be used for diagnostic and assessment purposes. It is
      already used to measure stress and monitor the progress of medical
      treatments. In its most sophisticated form, the GDV technique is
      incorporated with computer imaging.<br>
      <br>
      Now scientists have taken GDV photographs of a person as he was
      dying. In the photos, it could be seen that the area of the belly
      lost its life force (the purported soul) first, followed by the
      head. The heart and groin were the last to lose their life force,
      in that order.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists using the GDV technique say that the aura of those who
      die unexpectedly or violently differs from those who experience a
      calm death. The souls of the former remain in a state of confusion
      for several days and return frequently to their bodies, especially
      at night. Korotkov ascribes that phenomenon to unused energy
      retained by the soul. He suggests that the GDV technique will also
      have applications for distinguishing genuine psychics from frauds.<br>

      <b>The theory of Gas Discharge Visualisation (GDV) method </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main source of image formation is a gas discharge occurring
      close to the surface of the object under study. One can single out
      two main discharge types, related to formation of Kirlian images:
      an avalanche type, developing in a narrow clearance limited by a
      non-conductor, and the type sliding along the non-conductor
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      The term "GDV-ography" was introduced for identification of a
      graghical registration method, and "GDV-grams (images)" - for the
      description of the image itself (by analogy with widely used terms
      encephalogram, cardiogram, etc.). The obtained data made it
      possible to formulate the definition of the method: Biological
      Emission and Optical Radiation, induced by electro-magnetic field,
      amplified by Gas Discharge with Visualisation due to computer data
      processing (BEO GDV).<br>
      <br>
      As opposed to popular methods of medical visualisation, medical
      decision (diagnostic statement) in GDV-method is made not by means
      of anatomic structures study, but on the basis of conformal
      transformations and mathematical evaluation of multi-parameter
      images, whose parameters depend on psychophysiological state of
      the organism. At the same time basic physical processes tend to be
      the same both for biological (BO) and non-organic objects.
      Functional singularities of BO are manifested mainly in
      variability and dynamics of gas discharge images.<br>
      <br>
      Gas discharge visualisation (GDV) principle can be presented as
      follows (see the drawing):<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="shema-1.gif" height="343"
          width="250"><br>

      </div>
      GDV Voltage impulses from a magnetic field generator (5) are sent
      between the object under study (1) and dielecric plate (2), on
      which the object is placed. To ensure this a transparent
      conducting coating is applied on the back surface of the plate
      (2). With high field intensity in the gas medium of the space of
      contact between the object (1) and the plate (2) there develops an
      avalanche and / or sliding gas discharge (GD), whose parameters
      are determined by the object's properties. With the help of
      optical system and camera (3) discharge glow is transformed into
      video-signals that are recorded as separate shots (GDV-grams) or
      AVI-files into memory block (4), connected to a computer
      processor. A computer processor is a specialised software complex
      that enables a researcher to calculate a number of parameters and
      to make certain diagnostic statements (medical decisions) on their
      basis.<br>

      </b><b>DEVICE FOR THE GAS-DISCHARGE VISUALISATION OF AN IMAGE</b><b><br>
      </b><b>WO9927417 </b><b><br>
      </b><b>AU754229</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a device for the gas-discharge
      visualisation of an image, wherein said device comprises an
      electrode which is connected to a high-voltage power supply and is
      used for generating an electric field. This device also includes a
      dielectric for isolating the object to be studied from the
      electrode as well as an optically connected television camera for
      observing the glow of the gas discharge. The dielectric and the
      electrode are made of an optically transparent material and the
      electrode is placed between said dielectric and said television
      camera. The dielectric may include a light guide in the shape of
      optical fibres which are arranged so as to be parallel, from their
      light-receiving end, to the plane on which the object to be
      studied is placed. The electrode is made in the shape of a
      metallic mesh. The television camera may include a photo-receptor
      which is optically connected to the light guide and has a
      fibre-optic input. This device can be used for instantaneously
      inputting and processing Kirlian images in a computer due to the
      improved sensitivity and resolution characteristics of the
      apparatus, thus improving image quality during a gas-discharge
      visualisation.<br>
      <br>
      The invention pertains to the field of electronics and medicine,
      and can be used to obtain, process and analyse electronic images
      using gas discharge luminescence, which occurs when objects are
      placed within a high-tension electric field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Level of Technology </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is known that when an object is placed in a high-intensity
      electrical field, gas discharge luminescence forms around the
      object, which can be visually observed and captured
      photographically The first fundamental discovery in what became a
      series of inventions in this field was made by Mr and Mrs Kirlian
      in the mid-20lh century (USSR Patent #106401, MKI G03 B 41/100,
      1949).<br>
      <br>
      This discovery became known as the Kirlian effect.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the next 20 years (1949-1969), the Kirlians developed
      vanous types of devices for photographing the luminescence
      generated, primarily, by living matter.<br>
      <br>
      The major components of visualisation instruments of this type
      are: electrode(s) which form the field, the dielectric located
      between the electrodes and the object studied, and photosensitive
      material of a photosensitive device.<br>
      <br>
      The primary objectives in developing a new type of such device
      were to increase the sensitivity of the instrument and the quality
      and resolution of the captured images. With these goals in mind,
      various improvements were incorporated, including making the
      electrodes from a transparent conducting material, covered with an
      isolating grid. It was proposed that the electrode be joined with
      an internal mirror placed on the handle, for photographing hard to
      reach objects (for example, see USSR Patents #164906, MKI G03 G
      17/00. <br>
      <br>
      Technological developments over the last several years have led to
      the ability to automate the processing of Kirlian images with the
      use of computers.<br>
      <br>
      However, the image acquisition technology used by the researchers
      has remained unchanged. The researcher obtained the Kirlian image
      on photographic paper, then, with the aid of a television camera,
      the image was computerised, and subsequently processed. This
      approach has significant drawbacks characteristic of all
      photographic devices. First of all, the images require lengthy
      chemical development, a labour-intensive process which does not
      allow for quantitative assessment, since the density of the photo
      depends not only on the brightness of the Kirlian luminescence,
      but also on the parameters of the development process. Secondly,
      additional loss of quality arises when the images are digitised,
      due to the instability of scaling, nonuniform lighting, lens
      characteristics, etc. All these factors significantly limited the
      applicability of Kirlian images to be used for human diagnostic
      purposes (for example, see US Patent 4222658 MKI G03B 19/00,
      1980).<br>
      <br>
      Many researchers tried to capture Kirlian images directly with the
      use of a TV camera, bypassing the photographer paper. This allows
      instantaneous input of the Kirlian images into the computer, and
      to observe rapidly-transpiring process using standard
      software-hardware means.<br>
      <br>
      There is a known device for gas discharge visualisation composed
      of an electrode which forms an electric field, a dielectric and a
      television camera, with the electrode and the TV camera located on
      the opposite sides of the dielectric (for example, see the book by
      K. G. Korotkov, The Kirlian Effect, St. Petersburg, Olga
      Publishers 1995, page 88). The electrode in this device is an
      opaque metallic sheet, covered by a sheet of opaque dialectic
      rubber about 5mm thick, slightly larger in size than an electrode.
      The object of study, for example a human finger, is pressed
      against the rubber, the electrode is charged, and the luminescence
      around the pressed finger is recorded with a TV camera located
      above the object. This device is the most similar to the device
      being submitted.<br>
      <br>
      However the existing device has a number of deficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      1. A loss of a part of the image during the visualisation of
      Kirlian luminescence.<br>
      <br>
      The object of study, most often a human finger, invariably shields
      a section of the image from the camera. Potentially, 2 cameras can
      be used to capture the entire image, but a digital merging of 2
      separate images is so costly and complicated, that it is easier to
      acquire the image using the known device, and then to input the
      image into a computer.<br>
      <br>
      2. Low sensitivity of the existing device.<br>
      <br>
      The sensitivity of contemporary TV cameras is within the 350-400
      nm wavelength of Kirlian luminescence, and is close to the
      threshold. The need to record low-intensity luminescence requires
      setting the TV camera magnification to maximum. However, the
      transient processes of gas discharge luminescence occurring above
      the focal plane of the TV camera, decrease the magnification
      coefficient of the camera, thus reducing the instrument's
      sensitivity. Cameras that use an electronic-optical converter for
      brightness magnification do not solve this problem, since the high
      noise level of the microchannel plate makes it impossible to
      record rapidly changing images occurring during gas charge
      visualisation.<br>
      <br>
      3. Low resolution, caused by the necessity to register
      considerable luminescence by a camera located relatively far from
      the object (no closer than 100mm), does not permit capturing a
      dear image of the brief surface gas discharge process occurring in
      the contact plane of the object being studied with the dielectric:
      All these factors lead to a rapid acquisition of the image, but
      its low quality makes it impossible to extract the necessary
      information during computer processing.<br>
      <br>
      In creating the submitted device, the inventors had to overcome
      certain stereotypical perceptions, formed due to the methodologies
      of obtaining Kiriian images with the use of photography and TV
      cameras:<br>
      1. The necessity of ensuring access to the registering material
      (sensor).<br>
      <br>
      2. Location of the TV camera above the object of study.<br>
      <br>
      3. The impossibility of increasing the sensitivity of the device
      and the quality of the image when optical fibres are implemented.<br>
      <br>
      The standard approach to camera location - above the object - was
      necessitated by several factors. The operator maintains access to
      the TV camera, which allows him to focus the camera on the
      specific details of the object, since practically all known
      approaches to using a TV camera require constant external focus
      adjustments. Use of photosensitive materials also require operator
      access in order to replace the photosensitive material.<br>
      <br>
      The sensitivity of current TV camera photoreceptors is
      approximately equal to that of photographic paper, however the
      standard exposure time needed for to obtain a high quality Kirlian
      image is about .5 seconds, which is 25 times longer than the
      standard duration of photoexposure, which is 0.02 sec. In
      addition, high voltage impulses distort the video mage, but do not
      affect the photographic paper. Increasing the exposure time of the
      TV camera to 1 second in order to obtain the required sensitivity
      is difficult due to technical reasons, since the high voltage
      electrode impulses must be synchronised with the low voltage TV
      camera controls.<br>
      <br>
      These reasons, well known to developers of video technology,
      justified the results obtained by existing devices, and served as
      additional basis for proving the impossibility of creating a
      quality video device for registering Kirlian images.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a gas discharge
      device for visualising an object placed onto a surface, said
      device comprising an electrode connected to a high voltage power
      supply adapted to form an electric field, a dielectric adapted to
      isolate said object from said electrode; and a television camera
      optically adjusted for recording gas discharge luminescence
      wherein said dielectric and said electrode are optically
      transparent with said dielectric providing an optical path formed
      of optical fibres positioned such that the light receiving ends
      thereof are located substantially parallel to said surface and
      said electrode is formed as a metal grid located between said
      dielectric and said television camera.<br>

      Description of Invention The aim of this invention is to increase
      the sensitivity and resolution of the device, which allows to
      improve the image produced during gas discharge visualisation.<br>
      <br>
      This aim is reached by designing a gas discharge visualisation
      device containing an optically transparent electrode, which forms
      the electric field, a dielectric, which isolates the object under
      study, and also a TV camera, which is optically tuned for
      observation of gas discharge luminescence, with the electrode
      being placed between the dielectric and the camera.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferable design option for the device, an optically
      transparent dielectric contains a light transmitter composed of
      optical fibres, placed so as their light receiving ends are
      parallel to the plane on which the object under study is placed
      The electrode is a metallic grid located between the dielectric
      and the TV camera. All the device components are mounted in a
      single enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      This allows for even greater improvement in sensitivity and
      resolution of the instrument.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the TV camera can be outfitted with a photoreceptor,
      optically matched with the fibre-optic input This allows for
      maximum sensitivity and resolution.<br>
      <br>
      The high quality of the image produced during gas discharge
      visualisation in this device permits placing the optically
      transparent electrode between the optically transparent dielectric
      and the TV camera. Due to this layout of the elements of the
      device, there is no need to tune the video camera during
      operation. This is why, in the proposed device, the TV camera is
      initially tuned so that the focal plane matches the surface where
      the gas discharge luminescent occurs, after which, the elements of
      the instrument are fixed relative to each other. Thus the quality
      and the informational properties of the image are improved.<br>
      <br>
      The main unexpected effect of the proposed device was the increase
      in sensitivity and resolution of the instrument during gas
      discharge visualisation This is probably due to the fact that the
      light loss in the image during its travel through the clear
      electrode and the dielectric is less than 30%, whereas the light
      loss of the image in existing devices is no less than 70%. In
      addition, a significant parameter affecting the quality of the
      image is the magnification factor of the video camera. During the
      brief Kirlian processes, bright gas discharges cause significant
      interference when the camera is placed above the object of study,
      since they lead to a decrease in the magnification factor of the
      camera and "muddying" of the image. In the proposed solution,
      emissions are concentrated in the focal plane.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments have shown, that the resolution of the proposed device
      at least twice as high as that of existing instruments, and the
      sensitivity is more than 3 times greater.<br>
      <br>
      This is especially important for accurate analysis of Kirlian
      images, since increasing the current to the electrode in order to
      increase the luminescence could lead to the suppression of the
      normal picture of the energy field, which is unacceptable.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferable design alternative for the proposed device,
      additional concentration of the informational image in the focal
      plane takes place due to the use of fibre-optics in the
      dielectric. The design of the clear electrode as a metal grid
      permits minimising optical loss and increasing the resolution
      capacity regardless of the aperture of the optical fibre used,
      compared to standard transparent electrodes. Reading of optical
      information from the fibre-optic input requires micron level
      precision of tuning of the focal plane, which can be achieved only
      when all the device components are hardwired into a single
      enclosure.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, it was thought that the use of fibre optics as
      dielectrics for the Kirlian affect was impossible due to the high
      probability of electrical penetration. The inventors
      experimentally proved the high stability of fibre-optic
      dielectrics, and also, that using the second design alternative
      for the device improves the image quality during visualisation by
      approximately 40%, expressed as an integral coefficient
      representing the relationship of the sensitivity of the device to
      its resolution capacity.<br>
      <br>
      Locating the TV camera is the same enclosure as the high voltage
      electrode creates problems more of a psychological order rather
      than a technical nature. With the availability of contemporary
      insulation materials, the problems of electrical insulation
      between the camera and the high voltage electrode are easily
      overcome.<br>
      <br>
      The optical fibre magnifies the concentration of the entire light
      stream in the plane, and allows for separating the focal plane and
      the gas discharge visualisation surface, and for scaling and
      projecting the image onto the photoreceptive device of the TV
      camera with minimal losses.<br>
      <br>
      Medical application of the submitted device for obtaining Kirlian
      images of the energy field will permit not only to diagnose the
      various illnesses of the patient, but also to monitor the
      emotional and psychological state of the patient. The high
      resolution -- capability of the device and the maximum sensitivity
      will allow to control- small changes in the patient's condition in
      time.<br>

      Examples of preferred design options for the device.<br>
      <br>
      In the device design option shown in Figure 1, the device is
      composed of a dielectric (1) and an electrode (2), made from
      optically transparent materials, and the TV camera (3) focused
      with the lens (4) on the contact plane (5). The transparent
      dielectric is made from glass, preferably from C3C-23 glass, which
      has an absorption coefficient no greater than 5% with the range of
      wavelengths 350-600 nm, diameter of 60mm, and thickness of 4mm.
      Electrode (2) is a thin lager of lead oxide, no thicker than 1
      micron. TV camera (3) is outfitted with a charging device of 1/3"
      @ format, elements numbering 520 x 580 and a lens angled at 73
      degrees.<br>
      <br>
      In the design option shown in Figure 2, the dielectric (1) is
      composed of a light transmitter (6), a thin transparent dielectric
      layer (7), and the high voltage electrode (2) which is a metal
      grid. TV camera (3), with the aid of lens (4), projects the image
      from the contact surface (5) onto the photosensitive element (8)
      of the TV camera (3). All the elements of the device are hardwired
      into the enclosure (9). The thin transparent dielectric layer (7)
      is clear sticky polyethylene film on 10 microns thick, which
      covers the light receiving end of the light transmitter (6). The
      light transmitter (6) is a fibre-optic disc 50mm in diameter, 5mm
      thick; the optical fibres are made from 10 micron TSIAZhYu237002
      glass. Electrode (2) is a metal (nickel) grid 5 microns thick. 150
      microns in span and wire thickness of 10 microns. Using a metal
      grid as a transparent electrode allows to decrease the light loss
      down to 7% and to achieve maximum ruggedness and reliability of
      the device. The TV camera parameters are identical to those use in
      the previous design option.<br>
      <br>
      In the design option illustrated in Figure 3, the photosensitive
      device (8) contains a fibre-optic input (10), firmly attached to
      the high voltage electrode (2) and optically matched to the light
      transmitter (6). The fibre-optic input (10) is a phocone with a
      conversion coefficient of 6, with the optical fibre glass
      parameters identical to those of the light transmitter (6). The TV
      camera in this design option is outfitted with a charging device
      8, 2/3" format, with the number of elements being 520 x 580.<br>
      <br>
      All of the device components shown in figures 2 and 3 are placed
      in a hard case (9) and can be extemally coated with epoxy resin,
      which makes the construction safe to use and allows for consistent
      acquisition of high quality images.<br>
      <br>
      The device, according to the Invention (Figure 1), operates as
      follows: A 12 kV current with a frequency of about 1000 hZ, for
      example, is passed through the high voltage electrode (2), due to
      capacitous connection, causes gas discharge luminescence (12)
      about the object of study, for example a human finger. The
      luminescence (12) is focused in plane (5), then passes through the
      clear dielectric (1) and electrode (2), and is projected onto the
      TV camera (3).<br>
      <br>
      In the device shown in Figure 2, the image is concentrated on the
      contact surface (5), is then transferred through the thin film
      (7), the light transmitter (6), and, with virtually no loss, to
      the object surface of the light transmitter (6). Thus, there is a
      separation of the contact and the focal planes, which makes for
      dispensing with the 3rd dimension which composes the Kirlian
      image, therefore, improving the clarity of the image.<br>
      <br>
      In the device shown in Figure 3, the image passes directly from
      the output surface of the light transmitter (6) through the thin
      grid of the electrode (2) to the input fibreoptic surface of the
      photosensitive element (8) of the TV camera (3). In this case,
      loss due to image transmission is minimal.<br>
      <br>
      The comparative results, juxtaposing the image quality of the
      submitted device (Figures 1, 2 and 3) with the image quality of
      the existing device are shown in Table 1.<br>

      In order to obtain accurate comparison results, the measurements
      were conducted using the same types of a TV camera and a high

      These results, obtained using the submitted device, verify the
      increase in the quality of images, the resolution capacity, and
      the ability and adequacy of using lower strength current for
      Kirlian visualisation, which is especially important for accurate
      processing of the image of the energy field.<br>
      <br>
      The utilisation of the submitted device will solve the problem of
      instantaneous input and computer processing of the Kirlian images,
      which will allow for diagnosing various illnesses and for
      assessing the psychological and physical state of the patient.
      This device can also be utilised as a "lie detector" or a
      scientific instrument for investigation of human extra-sensory
      potential.<br>

      <b>Device for Measuring Electromagnetic Field Intensity</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2013113462</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to gas-discharge electrical instrumentation
      technology. The device for measuring electromagnetic field
      intensity comprises a measuring instrument for recording the glow
      of a gas discharge and a gas-discharge chamber that is formed
      between electrodes 1 and 2 separated by a dielectric 3. The
      electrode 1 is cylindrical, while the electrode 2 is in the form
      of a disk. The electrodes 1 and 2 are coupled to an electrical
      voltage source, wherein a capacitive element in the form of a pair
      comprising an antenna 5 and a connection to ground 6 is
      incorporated into the line coupling the cylindrical electrode 1 to
      the electrical voltage source. A capacitor 7 with variable
      capacitance is incorporated into the line coupling the cylindrical
      electrode 1 to the antenna 5. The technical result consists in
      providing the possibility of detecting a useful signal in a wide
      frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to gas-discharge electrical
      instrumentation technology and can be used, in particular, for
      obtaining objective data during biolocation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A known device for detecting high-power microwave pulsed
      radiation can be used for establishing the fact of irradiation of
      an object with the specified radiation, which can result in damage
      to the object. Said device comprises a plate made of a conductive
      material and provided with one or more gaps therein. The gaps are
      filled with air or another dielectric. If the plate is subjected
      to pulsed radiation, the electromagnetic field intensity in the
      gaps is increased. If the field intensity exceeds the electrical
      strength of the dielectric in the gap, a gas-discharge breakdown
      occurs through the gap. The light flash that corresponds to the
      discharge is recorded on tape, see WO 9836286 A1.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The disadvantage of this technical solution consists in low
      sensitivity towards electromagnetic field (EMF) amplitude, because
      the EFM intensity must be quite high for the discharge to occur,
      since both sides of the gap have an identical original potential.
      Therefore EMF of moderate intensity is not recorded. In addition,
      the device has low sensitivity towards the incidence angle of the
      electromagnetic wave. When this angle deviates from the
      perpendicular relative to the longitudinal axis of the gaps, the
      sensitivity of the device is reduced to zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It should also be mentioned that said device only records
      the fact of presence or absence of the EMF and does not allow
      determining quantitative characteristics of the field.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another device for measuring electromagnetic field
      intensity is more sensitive, said device comprising a
      gas-discharge chamber that is formed between electrodes separated
      by a dielectric. Both electrodes are cylindrical and are
      positioned coaxially. The cylinders are plugged on one side and
      positioned with the plugged ends facing outward inside a sealed
      dielectric envelope, wherein the ratio of diameters of the
      cylinders lies within the range 0.2&lt;=d/D&lt;=0.5, where d and D
      are diameters of the internal and external electrodes,
      respectively, see SU 1335902 A1.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Due to cylindrical shape of the electrodes, the discharge
      is activated by a wave that falls within the range of 360[deg.],
      the moment of breakdown is recorded by measuring the intensity of
      current. But the discharge in the narrow gap between the cylinders
      occurs when the following condition is fulfilled: Uapplied
      field&gt;Ubreakdown, wherein Ubreakdown=E.d, where E-field
      intensity, d-gap width.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Thus in order to increase field sensitivity it is necessary
      to reduce the gap width, however significant reduction of the gap
      leads to a real possibility of short circuit. Sensitivity of the
      known device is insufficient, because it is limited by the
      geometric shape of the electrodes and the minimal allowed width of
      the gap therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A more sensitive device for measuring electromagnetic
      radiation field intensity comprises a gas-discharge chamber that
      is formed between electrodes separated by a dielectric, where one
      of the electrodes is cylindrical and the other electrode is in the
      form of a disk, vertical symmetry axis of the cylindrical
      electrode is perpendicular to the disk plane, and the ratio of
      diameter "d" of the cylindrical electrode to the diameter "D" of
      the electrode in the form of a disk is in the range
      0.01&lt;=d/D&lt;=0.3, wherein the electrodes are coupled to an
      electrical voltage source, and a capacitive element in the form of
      a pair comprising an antenna and a connection to ground is
      incorporated into the line coupling the cylindrical electrode to
      the electrical voltage source, see RU 2280258 C1.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] This technical solution has been taken as a prototype of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Incorporation of a capacitive element makes it possible to
      detect high-frequency components of a useful signal, because the
      capacitive element allows exciting electromagnetic oscillations in
      the electric circuit that are determined by the resonance
      frequency of the circuit comprising an antenna and a connection to
      ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The disadvantage of the prototype device consists in that
      the abovementioned circuit has a fixed resonance frequency, which
      does not allow detecting a useful signal in a wide range of
      frequencies. Besides, another disadvantage of the prototype
      consists in the absence of a possibility to remotely measure the
      electromagnetic field intensity, including its measurement in
      automatic mode.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      </b><b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] The device comprises a measuring instrument for recording
      the glow of a gas discharge and a gas-discharge chamber that is
      formed between electrodes 1 and 2; electrode 1 is cylindrical, in
      this particular example it is made of titanium, which ensures its
      durability under conditions of a gas discharge. Electrode 1 can
      also be made of tungsten, niobium etc. Diameter of electrode I in
      this particular example is 10 mm. Electrode 2 is in the shape of a
      disk with diameter of 80 mm, which in an embodiment of the
      invention according to claim 1 is a metal plate. In an embodiment
      of the invention according to claim 3 the electrode 2 is made of a
      transparent current-conducting material, in particular a polymer
      material or a ultra-thin transparent metallic film, which is
      applied using spatter or deposition to the dielectric plate 3 that
      separates electrodes 1 and 2. Plate 3 is 3 mm wide and is made of
      quartz. Other dielectrics can be used, including glass. Vertical
      symmetry axis of the cylindrical electrode 1 is perpendicular to
      the plane of the electrode 2 in the form of a disk. The ratio of
      diameter "d" of the cylindrical electrode 1 to diameter "D" of the
      electrode made in the form of a disk is in the range
      0.01&lt;=d/D&lt;=0.3.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The specified ratio of diameters is stipulated by the
      following circumstances. Diameter "d" of electrode 1 can amount to
      2-60 mm. When "d"&lt;2 mm, the effects of non-uniformity of the
      cylinder edge begin to have an influence, which leads to
      redistribution of field intensity due to edge effect at the
      non-uniformities. Having "d" exceed 60 mm is impractical due to
      constructional and techno-economical reasons. Diameter "D" of
      electrode 2 is chosen according to constructional convenience and
      amounts to 30-200 mm. The conditions of development of a discharge
      under air pressure equalling atmospheric pressure or below
      stipulate that a space of at least 20 mm must be left from the
      edge of the upper electrode to the edge of the lower electrode.
      This is stipulated by the following formula that defines the
      relation between the length of surface discharge, specific surface
      capacitance, amplitude and inflection of applied voltage:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      L=k.C&lt;2&gt;.U0&lt;5&gt;.V&lt;0.25 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where C-specific surface capacitance; 2 cm&lt;L&lt;10
      cm-length of surface discharge; U0-applied voltage; V-rate of
      voltage increase; k-coefficient that equals 21.10&lt;13 &gt;for
      positive polarity and 13.10&lt;13 &gt;for negative polarity, and
      depends on the material of the dielectric and the form of the
      applied voltage; the values of constants and, consequently, the
      characteristics of discharge figures are also influenced by the
      inflection of the leading edge and the duration of the voltage
      pulse.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Vertical symmetry axis of the cylindrical electrode 1
      passes through the center of electrode 2, which ensures radial
      uniformity of the field and the absence of preferred directions
      during EMF recording.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Electrodes 1 and 2 are connected to an electrical voltage
      source 4; this particular example uses a generator of pulses "GDV
      Camera" with pulse height of 10-20 kV, duration of 10 [mu]sec and
      ratio of 1000 Hz, which are supplied in bursts with duration of
      0.5 sec, said generator is manufactured by ZAO "BioTechProgress"
      (St. Petersburg, Russia).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A capacitive element, which in this particular example is
      in the form of a pair comprising an antenna 5 and a connection to
      ground 6, is incorporated into the line coupling the electrode 1
      to the electrical voltage source 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Incorporation of a capacitive element makes it possible to
      detect high-frequency components of a useful signal and eliminate
      interference caused by EMF of industrial frequencies, wherein the
      capacitive element in the form of an antenna 5 and a connection to
      ground 6 allows exciting electromagnetic oscillations in the
      electric circuit that are determined by the resonance frequency of
      the circuit comprising antenna 5 and connection to ground 6. A
      capacitor 7 with variable capacitance is incorporated into the
      line coupling the cylindrical electrode 1 to the antenna, which
      allows tuning to EMF of different frequency ranges. This increases
      selectivity of the device. The embodiment of the invention
      according to claim 1 uses a capacitor 7 of variable capacitance
      with mechanical control, the embodiment according to claims 2, 3
      uses a capacitor 7 of variable capacitance with electrical
      control, wherein the device additionally comprises a video camera
      8, in particular KPC400 manufactured by KTO-C Co (Korea), an ADC
      9, such as AD9280 manufactured by Analog Device (USA), a processor
      10, such as ATMEGA64 manufactured by ATMEL (USA), and a
      transceiver 11-MOTOROLA PC850 (USA). The device also comprises one
      or several mobile terminals 12. Mobile phones or computers
      provided with wireless communication means can be used as
      terminals 12. In the example illustrated in FIG. 1 only one
      terminal 12 is shown for the sake of simplicity. This particular
      example uses a mobile Internet server 13 such as USN Zeus
      Supermicro i7300 2*Xeon E7420/8G/no HDD/no ODD manufactured by
      CISCO (USA). Current signal processing unit 14 is embodied as a
      processor such as EPM 7128 manufactured by Alterra (USA).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The output of the video camera S is connected to the first
      input of the ADC 9, the output of the ADC 9 is connected to the
      first input of the processor 10, the first output of the processor
      10 is connected to the first input of the transceiver 11; the
      second output of the processor 10 is connected to the input of the
      electrical voltage source 4, the third output of the processor 10
      is connected to the input of the electrically controlled capacitor
      7 with variable capacitance; the first output of the transceiver
      11 is connected to the second input of the processor 10, the
      second output and the second input of the transceiver 11 are
      connected through mobile communication channels to one or several
      mobile terminals 12, which are connected over a mobile Internet
      channel to the mobile Internet server 13; the input of the current
      signal processing unit 14 is connected to the electrode 2, and the
      output of the current signal processing unit 14 is connected to
      the second input of the ADC 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 the device functions in
      the following way. When the intensity of the EMF between
      electrodes 1 and 2 exceeds the breakdown voltage along the surface
      of the dielectric 3, an avalanche gas discharge is developed. The
      glow and/or current of the discharge is recorded using
      corresponding measuring instruments, for example a photomultiplier
      and/or a microampermeter. The measured values allow evaluating the
      EMF intensity value.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The electrical voltage source 4 allows creating voltage
      between electrodes 1 and 2 near the value of breakdown voltage,
      which results in the occurrence of a breakdown and the development
      of a gas discharge when the amplitude of the external EMF is
      relatively small; to obtain discharge figures, a series of bipolar
      voltage pulses can be supplied to the electrodes. In this case
      each pulse will create corresponding phase of the discharge, and
      the final picture will look like a superposition of images from
      positive and negative discharges (taking into account the
      distortion of electrical field by the positive surface charge left
      after previous discharges).<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Using the capacitor 7 of variable capacitance the
      parameters of the circuit comprising the antenna 5 and the
      connection to ground 6 are changed in order to tune to the
      frequency of the EMF component to be measured. This allows
      detecting a useful signal in a wide frequency range.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 the device functions in
      the following way. The gas-discharge glow enters the video camera
      8 through the transparent plate 3 and electrode 2, whereupon it is
      transformed into digital code by the ADC 9, the signal from the
      ADC 9 is supplied to the processor 10, then the signal from the
      processor 10 is supplied to the transceiver 11 and to one or
      several mobile terminals 12, and further through the
      communications channel to the server 13, where the signal is
      processed and its parameters are determined, said parameters
      reflecting the two-dimensional geometric characteristics of the
      glow structures, as well as brightness characteristics. These
      characteristics depend on the measured intensity of the
      electromagnetic field and reflect the dynamics of its changes in
      the course of prolonged measurements. After processing on the
      server 13 is completed, the signal from the server 13 is supplied
      to the mobile terminal 12, where it can be further utilized by the
      consumer operator. This signal can also be used as a control
      signal for processor 10 through transceiver 11 by changing the
      parameters of operation of the electrical voltage source 4 and the
      variable capacitor 7 in order to increase sensitivity of the
      device and/or tune to the selected frequency range. The control
      signal can be generated automatically from the server 13 in
      accordance with a predefined program, for example a program for
      frequency scanning in specified time context, can be defined by
      the operator at the server 13 depending on the goals of the
      measurements, or defined by the operator from a mobile terminal
      12.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Useful signal from electrode 2 is also recorded as an
      amplitude of high-frequency current by the current signal
      processing unit 14, digital signal from the output of said unit 14
      is supplied to the processor 10, from the processor 10 the signal
      is supplied to the transceiver 11 and to one or several mobile
      terminals 12, and is supplied through a communications channel to
      the server 13, where the signal is processed and the parameters of
      the current are determined. These parameters depend on the
      measured intensity of the electromagnetic field and reflect the
      dynamics of its changes in the course of prolonged measurements.<br>

      <b>Method for Determining the Condition of a Biological Object and
        Device for Making Same &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2011282214 </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to the field of instrumentation and can be
      used for diagnosing the condition of a biological object. The
      technical result consists in an increased measurement precision.
      In order to achieve this result, the invention comprises
      determining the condition of a biological object on the basis of
      fixation and comparison of the structures of gas-discharge light
      emission around the reference object and the biological object
      under study in an electromagnetic field. The light emissions
      around the reference object and the biological object under study
      are converted into digital code. The invention comprises
      determining the quantitative parameters of the light emission and
      the characteristics thereof. The invention also comprises
      determining corresponding spatial points of specified parameters
      for the reference object and the biological object under study.;
      The invention further comprises determining the deviation of
      quantitative parameters that characterize the condition of the
      biological object under study by means of the distance between
      said points. The reference object is implemented as a
      non-biological material. The invention also comprises carrying out
      the fixation of the structure of gas-discharge light emission
      around the reference object and determining the relative deviation
      thereof from an average value.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The inventions relate to the field of physics and can be
      used for determining the functional condition of a biological
      object.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A known method for determining the condition of a
      biological object, in particular a human, comprises fixation and
      comparison of the structure of gas-discharge light emission in an
      electric field around the whole reference object or a part thereof
      (fingertips) at the initial level (outside the vegetovascular
      crisis) and prior to the crisis, see SU 935076 A1.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Reference data used in this method can be embodied not only
      as the initial level of gas-discharge light emission around the
      tested object outside of the crisis condition, but also as the
      level of gas-discharge light emission around an undoubtedly
      healthy biological object that is taken as a reference object.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] During implementation of this method quantitative criteria
      are introduced for evaluating the condition of a biological
      object, allowing to compare the object's condition at different
      points of time or to compare the condition of different objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] However, such method does not provide sufficient accuracy
      and reliability in determining the biological object's condition,
      because it takes into account only one parameter of the glow
      structure, namely the length of the gas-discharge streamer. In
      addition, it should be noted that the process of obtaining the
      information is quite labor-intensive and lengthy: one must obtain
      the photographic images, measure them with common measuring tools
      and then compare the measurement results. Another disadvantage of
      this method consists in the fact that assessment of a biological
      object's condition is performed within a fairly narrow range of
      variations of a one-dimensional geometrical parameter-the streamer
      length (from 15 to 30% as compared to the initial level). In
      addition, the object's condition cannot be assessed if the changes
      of said parameter fall outside the described limits.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Higher precision and reliability of assessment of the
      condition of a biological object within a wide range of values of
      quantitative parameters that characterize the structure of
      gas-discharge light emission around objects in a electromagnetic
      field is provided by a method for determining the condition of a
      biological object by means of fixation and comparison of the
      structure of gas-discharge light emission around the reference
      object and the object under study in an electromagnetic field,
      which comprises converting fixed structures of gas-discharge light
      emission around the reference object and the test object into
      digital code, determining quantitative parameters of said
      structures that reflect their characteristics, determining
      corresponding spatial points of said parameters for the reference
      and the test objects, and then determining the deviation of the
      test object from the reference object according to the distance
      between said points; in addition, the method may comprise
      determining the quantitative parameters of the structures of
      gas-discharge light emission that reflect their spectral,
      brightness and fractal characteristics, wherein the abovementioned
      points in a multidimensional space are determined taking into
      account these parameters as well, see RU 2141250 C1.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] This method has been taken as a prototype of the present
      inventive method.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In the prototype method the reference object is embodied as
      a finger of a person considered to be healthy. However, any
      biological object has a particular dynamics of biological
      parameters that characterize its condition, and this dynamics
      depends on the temporal, climatic, geophysical and other factors
      acting at the place of the experiment. Therefore the prototype
      method uses for comparison a metrological basis that is
      essentially an insufficiently stable biological object, which
      leads to a certain inaccuracy of determination of the condition of
      the biological object under study.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The same patent RU 2141250 C1 describes a device for
      determining the condition of a biological object that comprises an
      electromagnetic pulse generator, a glass plate that has an
      electrode on the lower surface thereof in the form of a thin layer
      of a conductive optically transparent material, an objective lens,
      an optoelectronic digital converter (OEDC), a computer unit in the
      form of a personal computer and an information presentation unit
      in the form of a monitor; one output of the generator is connected
      to the electrode and the second output of the generator is
      connected to a switching device which is in turn connected to the
      reference or the test object, ensuring alternating contact with
      said objects; the output of the objective lens is optically
      connected to the optical input of the OEDC, the output of which is
      connected to the input of the computer unit, the output of which
      is connected to the input of the information presentation unit
      (monitor).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] This device was taken as a prototype of the inventive
      device according to the present patent application.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The prototype device can be used for determining the
      condition of a biological object by means of fixation and
      comparison of the structures of gas-discharge light emission
      around the reference object and the biological object under study
      only when the reference object is embodied as a biological object,
      which, due to the reasons described above in the description of
      corresponding known method, does not provide sufficient and (in
      some cases) necessary accuracy of determination of the biological
      object's condition during fixation and comparison of the
      structures of gas-discharge light emission around the reference
      and the test objects. It should be mentioned that the prototype
      device does not allow using an object made of a non-biological
      material as a metrological basis for such comparison, because it
      does not allow correcting the relative deviation [delta] of a
      value in the series of measured quantitative parameters of
      structures of gas-discharge light emission around the reference
      object from their average value, which is necessary when using a
      reference object made of a non-biological material, since in this
      case the values of [delta] can be significantly larger than the
      allowed value of variability of measured parameters that is
      accepted during the biomedical measurements-not more than 10%.
      When this limit is surpassed, the biomedical measurements are
      considered invalid.<br>
      <br>

      around the reference object is performed multiple times, the
      relative deviation [delta] of a value in the series of measured

      <b>PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] The inventive device for determining the condition of a
      biological object 1 comprises a generator 2 of electromagnetic
      pulses with pulse height of 3-5 kV, duration of 10 [mu]sec and
      ratio of 1000 Hz, which are supplied in bursts with duration of
      0.5 sec. In this particular embodiment the generator of electric
      pulses is embodied as GDV Camera manufactured by company
      Kirlionics Technologies International (St. Petersburg, Russia).
      The lower surface of glass plate 3 has an electrode 4 in the form
      of a layer of conductive optically transparent material, in this
      particular embodiment a layer of SnO2 with thickness of 200 [mu]m
      or a layer of Ag with thickness of 10 [mu]m. Output of objective
      lens 5 is optically connected to the optical input of the EODC 6,
      which is a matrix structure embodied on the basis of a device with
      charge coupling (the so-called CCD structure). The computer unit 7
      is embodied in this particular example as a controller ATmega 16
      manufactured by company ATMEL (USA), the information presentation
      unit 8 is a monitor by LG, FLATRON, L17308, the input of which is
      connected to the first output of the unit 7. Switching device 9 is
      embodied so as to allow alternating connection of the generator 2
      to the reference object 12 or the biological object under study 1
      and can be in the form of a spring-loaded crocodile clip, like in
      the example according to claim 4 (see FIG. 1), which is
      electrically connected to the first output of generator 2. In the
      example according to claim 5 the switching device 9 is embodied as
      an electronic switch (in particular, a trigger) or an
      electromechanical switch (in particular, a relay). In this case
      the switching device is also electrically connected (with its
      first input) to the first output of the generator, and is also
      connected with its second input to the second output of the
      computer unit 7. Similarly to the example in FIG. 1, the switching
      device in turn connects the first output of generator 2 either to
      the tested biological object 1 or to the reference object 12,
      which is embodied as a metal cylinder, in particular made of
      copper or titanium; it is possible to use a vessel with conductive
      liquid as a reference object, in particular a vessel with NaCl
      solution. In this case the electric contact can take place
      directly with the conductive liquid. The device also comprises a
      unit 10 for calculating the relative deviation [delta] of values
      in the series of measured quantitative parameters of the structure
      of gas-discharge light emission around the reference object 12
      from their average value, and a unit 11 of logical decisions.
      Units 10 and 11 in this particular example are embodied as
      controllers ATmega 16 manufactured by company ATMEL (USA). The
      input of unit 10 is connected to the first output of the OEDC 6,
      the second output of which is connected to the first input of the
      computer unit 7, the second input of which is connected to the
      first output of the unit 11 of logical decisions, the second
      output of which is connected to the input of generator 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The inventive method is implemented by means of the
      inventive device in the following way. The reference object 12 is
      brought into contact with the surface of the glass plate 3. Here
      the first output of generator 2 is connected to the reference
      object 12 by means of switching device 9 (a resettable clip shown
      with dotted line in FIG. 1) or an electronic (electromechanical)
      switch (see FIG. 2). Electromagnetic field created by means of
      generator 2 produces gas-discharge light emission around the
      reference object 12. This light emission is transferred by means
      of the objective lens 5 to the OEDC 6, which converts it into
      digital code. From the output of the OEDC 6 the signal goes to the
      input of the computer unit 7, where the quantitative parameters of
      the structure of gas-discharge light emission around the reference
      object 12 are determined. Fixation of the structure of
      gas-discharge light emission around the reference object and the
      measurement of quantitative parameters of this structure are
      performed multiple times. Then the unit 10 is used for calculating
      the relative deviation 6 of values in the series of measured
      quantitative parameters of the structure of gas-discharge light
      emission around the reference object 12 from their average value.
      When [delta]&gt;10%, the unit 10 sends a signal to the unit 11 of
      logical decisions, which controls the generator 2, reducing its
      output voltage and/or increasing the stability of the pulses until
      obtaining [delta]&lt;=10%. Unit 7 is used for determining the
      spatial point of specified parameters for the reference object 12.
      When [delta]&lt;=10%, the reference object 12 is brought out of
      contact with the glass plate 3, the generator 2 is connected to
      the biological object under study 1 and then the biological object
      1 is brought into contact with the glass plate 3. The quantitative
      parameters of the light emission structure, which reflect the
      characteristics of the biological object under study 1, are
      determined, and then the spatial point in the field of said
      parameters is determined by means of unit 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Then the distance between corresponding points (like in the
      prototype) is used for determining the deviation of quantitative
      parameters that characterize the condition of the biological
      object under study from the quantitative parameters that
      characterize the reference object. In this particular example
      (FIG. 3) the axes P1 and P2 correspond to the quantitative
      parameters of the light emission structures that reflect their
      two-dimensional geometrical characteristics, the axis P3
      corresponds to the quantitative parameters that reflect the
      brightness characteristics of the light emission structures, the
      axis P4 reflects their spectral characteristics, and the axis
      P5-their fractal characteristics. Point 13 in a multi-dimensional
      space of axes P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 corresponds to the reference
      object 12. Point 14 in the multi-dimensional space that
      corresponds to the object under study 1 is determined in the same
      way. Then the condition of the object under study is determined on
      the basis of the distance L between points 13 and 14.<br>

      <b>Device for Determining the State of a Biological Subject &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><b>US2010106424</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to physics and can be used for
      determining the functional state of a biological object, for
      example, a human or an animal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A known device for determining the state of a human
      organism comprises an electrode covered with a dielectric layer,
      whereupon a certain thermoplastic material is placed; said
      electrode is connected to a high-voltage pulse generator, see RU,
      94012892, A1. Electric current flows through the circuit formed by
      the electrode-registering material (a thermoplastic polymer), the
      body of the patient and the ground, thus transferring the charge
      from the skin of the patient to the polymer within the area of
      contact of the finger and the polymer. When the finger is removed
      from the circuit, the registering material is removed from the
      electrode and heated to 75-80[deg.] C., whereupon the polymer
      layer becomes deformed at those places where its surface holds
      surplus charge. Visualization of said deformations (the polymer
      layer's relief) produces an image that looks like a set of
      streamers coming out of the border of the area where the finger
      contacts the polymer. Medium length of charge streamers is used as
      a criterion of norm for a given patient. The device allows
      registering the charge streamers from all fingertips one by one.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The general state of the organism can be evaluated by
      comparing the characteristics of streamers from different fingers
      of the individual.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The main disadvantage of the abovementioned device consists
      in that it provides a very inaccurate evaluation of the
      individual's state, since it does not allow obtaining any
      quantitative information on the parameters of the images, making
      it impossible to compare images taken at different points of time.
      Analysis and comparison of the images is performed by an expert on
      the basis of his/her subjective visual assessments.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another known device for determining the state of a
      biological subject is described in RU, 2141250, C. This device is
      taken as a prototype of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Said device comprises a generator, a transparent plate
      provided with an electrode which is embodied as an optically
      transparent layer applied upon said plate, an objective, an
      optoelectronic digital converter, a computer and an information
      display unit embodied as a monitor. The output of the generator is
      connected to the electrode, while the output of the computer is
      connected to the input of the information display unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Said generator supplies electric pulses to the electrode,
      thus creating an electromagnetic field on the surface of said
      transparent plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A reference biological subject-finger of a healthy
      individual-contacts with the surface of said transparent plate.
      The electromagnetic field produces gas discharge glow around said
      reference biological subject. This glow is transferred through the
      objective to the optoelectronic digital converter, where it
      becomes converted to a digital code. The signal from the output of
      the optoelectronic digital converter is supplied to the input of
      the computer, whereupon the quantitative characteristics of
      structure of the gas discharge glow around the reference
      biological subject are determined; the parameters that reflect the
      two-dimensional geometric characteristics of the glow structures
      and the brightness characteristics are determined. The gas
      discharge glow around the reference subject can be represented on
      the monitor of the computer as a two-dimensional colored image.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Then the computer represents the whole assembly of the
      quantitative parameters as a three-dimensional point.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The gas discharge glow around the subject under study is
      represented in the same way, and a three-dimensional point that
      corresponds to the subject under study is also defined. The
      distance between these two points reflects the deviation of state
      of the subject under study from the reference subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The disadvantage of the prototype consists in the
      following.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] At a given point of time, the device allows obtaining
      information from only one point of the biological subject, in
      particular, from one finger. Such information, however, gives only
      a partial evaluation of the subject's state. Therefore, in order
      to obtain larger volume of more detailed information, the data is
      taken from two, three or more fingers one by one (preferable, from
      all ten fingers and ten toes), because every finger or toe is
      associated with some organs or systems (see Korotkov K. G. Human
      Energy Field: study with GDV bioelectrography. SPb, 2001, pp.
      40-45).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Information from a single finger can be taken within 1 to
      10 seconds, depending on the mode chosen by the operator (static
      or dynamic). Total consecutive recording time for all ten fingers,
      including the time required for swapping the fingers, is at least
      3-5 minutes on the average. During this time the state of the
      patient can change, because the electric field pulses excite the
      vegetative nervous sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, and
      the results of the measurements can therefore become severely
      distorted. It is practically impossible to perform simultaneous
      registration and computer transfer of GDV-information taken from
      several fingers, let alone all fingers and toes of the biological
      subject, for the following reasons. A single GDV-image taken from
      one point of a biological subject constitutes a significant amount
      of data (up to 40.0 megabytes), since it has a lot of details in a
      wide spectral optical range, both within the visible and the
      ultraviolet regions. GDV-images are taken with a frequency of at
      least 30 frames per second. Therefore, one point of the biological
      subject provides about 72 gigabytes of data, which is transferred
      to present-day computers at 1.2 GB/sec speed (40.0 MB*30 l/sec).
      When GDV-information is taken from two, let alone three points,
      the volume of data reaches or even exceeds the maximum capacities
      of modern computer equipment available for use. Thus, although
      those skilled in the art of GDV-technique (there are very few such
      people in the world) long ago realized is that the accuracy of
      determination of a biological subject's state can be significantly
      increased by registering information from two or more points (up
      to 20 points), they could not perform such experiments in
      practice, because there were no available computers capable of
      receiving and processing those huge amounts of data; besides, when
      big amounts of data are consecutively transferred through a USB
      port of an ordinary computer (NASA supercomputers are out of the
      question) during registration of the images, there is a strong
      probability of errors in computer operation that could lead to
      loss of data and require repetition of the registrations; that
      would in turn serve to additionally increase the distortion of
      information regarding the state of the biological object.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] It is an object of this invention to provide a solution
      capable of processing massive amounts of data (720 GB or more)
      that are collected when recording information from 10 or more
      points of the biological subject, thus providing a tenfold
      increase of accuracy of the information regarding the biological
      subject's state, while using existing easily available computer
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] According to the invention there is provided a device for
      determining the state of a biological subject, comprising an
      electric pulse generator, a transparent plate provided with an
      electrode which is embodied as an optically transparent conductive
      layer applied upon said plate, an objective, an optoelectronic
      digital converter, a computer and an information display unit, the
      output of said generator being connected to the electrode, and the
      first output of the computer being connected to the input of the
      information display unit, wherein said device is provided with one
      or more additional transparent plates with electrodes applied upon
      them, one or more additional objectives, and one or more
      additional optoelectronic digital converters, the amount of
      additional objectives and optoelectronic digital converters
      equaling the amount of additional transparent plates with
      electrodes applied upon them, and wherein said device is
      additionally provided with a memory unit and a data management and
      exchange unit, and wherein the electrodes of all transparent
      plates are interconnected, the outputs of the optoelectronic
      digital converters are respectively connected to the first,
      second, n-th inputs of the memory unit, the output of said memory
      unit being connected to the first input of the data management and
      exchange unit, whereas the first output of the data management and
      exchange unit is connected to the (n+1)-th input of the memory
      unit, and the second output of said data management and exchange
      unit is connected to the input of the computer, while the second
      output of the computer is connected to the second input of the
      data management and exchange unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The applicant hasn't found any sources of information
      containing data on engineering solutions identical to the present
      invention. In applicant's opinion, this enables to conclude that
      the invention conforms to the criterion "Novelty" (N).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The novel features of the invention provide the device with
      an important new property, which makes it possible to record
      information from any required amount of points in a single step,
      thus ensuring that the subject is participating in the
      measurements during 1 to 10 seconds only. Furthermore, the data
      transfer channel does not become overloaded, because the
      information recorded from the subject first goes to the memory
      unit, whereupon it is extracted by the data management and
      exchange unit and supplied to the computer through a USB port with
      normal transfer rate; this prevents distortion of the information,
      both when it is received from the subject and during its transfer;
      also it becomes possible to employ computer equipment that is
      widely used in practice.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The applicant hasn't found any sources of information
      containing data on the influence of the inventive novel features
      on the technical result produced through realization of said
      features. In applicant's opinion, this enables to conclude that

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] The device for determining the state of a biological
      subject, in this particular embodiment an individual, comprises a
      generator 1 of electric pulses with amplitude of 10-20 kV,
      duration of 10 [mu]sec and pulse ratio of 1000 Hz, wherein the
      pulses are served in 0.5 sec bursts. This particular embodiment
      uses the generator "Corona" manufactured by a Russian company
      "Kirlionics Technologies International" LLC (St. Petersburg). The
      information is taken from n points. The device comprises
      transparent plates 2, 8, 9, 10, . . . , n. The plates are
      respectively provided with electrodes 3, 11, 12, 13, . . . , n,
      embodied as layers of some optically transparent conductive
      material applied to said plates (in this particular embodiment, a
      200 [mu]m deep layer of SnO2 is used). The objectives 4, 14, 15,
      16, . . . , n are positioned under the transparent plates,
      respectively. The objectives are optically conjugated with the
      optoelectronic digital converters 5, 17, 18, 19, . . . , n,
      respectively. The optoelectronic digital converters constitute an
      array structure embodied on the basis of a charge-coupled device
      (CCD-structure).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The output of the generator 1 is connected to the electrode
      3, and the electrodes 3, 11, 12, 13, . . . , n, are
      interconnected. The outputs of the optoelectronic digital
      converters 5, 17, 18, 19, . . . , n are respectively connected to
      the first, second, third, fourth, n-th inputs of the memory unit
      20, which is embodied on the basis of BS62LV4001-TI chip
      manufactured by Texas Instruments (USA). The output of the memory
      unit 20 is connected to the first input of the data management and
      exchange unit 21, which is embodied on the basis of C8051F320 chip
      manufactured by Silicon Labs (USA). The first output of the unit
      21 is connected to the (n+1)-th input of the unit 20. The second
      output of the unit 21 is connected to the input of the computer 6,
      the first output of the computer 6 being connected to the input of
      the information display unit 7 (a monitor). The second output of
      the computer 6 is connected to the second input of the unit 21.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The device operates in the following way. The points under
      study 22, 23, 24, 25, . . . , n (the fingers and/or toes of the
      individual) are simultaneously positioned on the free surfaces of
      the TRANSPARENT plates 2, 8, 9, 10, n, whereupon the generator 1
      supplies voltage pulses to the electrodes 3, 11, 12, 13, . . . ,
      n, thus creating an electromagnetic field with intensity of
      10&lt;6&gt;-10&lt;8 &gt;V/cm. The glow that is produced around the
      fingers enters the objectives 4, 14, 15, 16, . . . , n
      simultaneously, and then it proceeds through the objectives to the
      inputs of the optoelectronic digital converters 5, 17, 18, 19, . .
      . , n, whereupon the digital signals from the outputs of said
      optoelectronic digital converters enter corresponding inputs of
      the memory unit 20 in a single step, where they are saved as
      digital files. At a certain time point, which is defined by the
      operator by a control command that is sent from the data
      management and exchange unit 21, the digital files stored in the
      memory unit 20 are transferred to the computer 6 for subsequent
      processing and analysis in the normal mode, which is determined by
      the technical characteristics of the computer 6 and the data
      management and exchange unit 21. Said digital files can be stored
      in the memory unit 20 until the data management and exchange unit
      21 issues a command to erase them, which guarantees accuracy of
      storage and transfer of large amounts of data regardless of the
      technical characteristics of the data transfer channel between the
      computer 6 and the data management and exchange unit 21.
      Single-step registration of the glow from all plates 2, 8, 9, 10,
      . . . , n ensures accuracy of analysis of the patient in its
      undisturbed state.<br>
