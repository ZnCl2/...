            <blockquote>Carrboro, North Carolina, is killing weeds with
              water instead of chemicals. The town is using a machine
              that superheats water and dispenses it in a carefully
              controlled stream to kill weeds without using toxic
              chemical herbicides. The equipment, which is made in New
              Zealand, is in use in several other countries but is
              almost unknown in the United States.
              <p>Carrboro is testing the equipment to implement the
                town's least toxic Integrated Pest Management policy,
                adopted in March 1999. The policy calls for phasing out
                use of conventional pesticides, including herbicides, on
                town property, but does not apply to the local
                residents, their property or businesses. City leaders
                hope to show how beautiful grounds can be achieved
                without poisoning the environment. </p>
              <p>To date, efforts to reduce pesticide use have
                emphasized alternatives to conventional herbicides. An
                earlier analysis of Carrboro's pest management practices
                showed that more €\pesticides were used on weeds than
                for any other purpose. Weeds are a problem around
                buildings and parking lots, along curbs and gutters and
                in parks. The town is using a comprehensive approach,
                rather seeking a single solution, including a
                biodegradable herbicide made from corn gluten, propane
                flamers which kill plants by singing them, thick mulch
                on plant beds to smother weeds, and now hot water. </p>
              <p>The machine in use in Carrboro produces a steady stream
                of near-boiling water that kills weeds by melting the
                waxy outer coating of their leaves. The self-contained
                machine is mounted on a small truck with hoses connected
                to long-handled applicator wands. A quick spray on
                unwanted weeds kills them; the plants darken almost
                immediately and turn brown within a few hours. The flow
                of water is low and cools quickly. While the results
                look very much like that of a contact herbicide, there
                is no toxic residue and the area is immediately safe for
                play. </p>
              <p>"That's what it is all about," said Allen Spalt,
                Director of the Agricultural Resources Center and a
                member of the Carrboro Board of Aldermen. "We want to
                find ways to reduce pesticide use so that we can
                eliminate the risk of any child being poisoned. Carrboro
                already uses only small amounts of pesticides; we
                believe that this hot water system may be part of the
                solution to reducing use completely." </p>
              <p>The hot water system, on loan to Carrboro until the end
                of June, will be used by town staff, who will also
                demonstrate it for other interested parties. At the
                conclusion of the trials, a final decision will be made
                whether or not the town will purchase the equipment. </p>

              <center><b><font size="+2">"Radio Frequency Puts the Heat
                    on Plant Pests"</font></b></center>
              <p>To prevent influx of pests that could create
                agricultural problems, produce-importing nations enforce
                strict rules --depending on the commodity and the
                infesting insect. The rules often require vulnerable
                produce to be treated in some way that ensures
                destruction of pests. </p>
              <p>For several decades, methyl bromide has been a mainstay
                treatment to kill a wide array of quarantined pests as
                well as those encountered in orchards, packinghouses,
                and food plants. But this potent chemical fumigant is
                being phased out because of evidence linking it to
                damage to Earth's ozone layer. </p>
              <p>Although the effectiveness of using radio waves to kill
                destructive insects in agricultural products has been
                known for 70 years, the technique has never been applied
                on a commercial scale. A recent cooperative effort by
                four ARS research laboratories and two universities aims
                to overcome the technical barriers for the use of radio
                wave heating to control pests on a commercial scale. </p>
              <p>Electromagnetic waves of radio frequency can make
                molecules vibrate and heat up -- like microwaves heat
                food. The trick is to kill pest insects without killing
                the taste or texture of the food they infest. </p>
              <p>Since 2000, a team led by Juming "Jimmy" Tang of
                Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman, involving
                four ARS laboratories and the University of
                California-Davis (UC-Davis), has been working on a
                4-year study to see whether radio waves would be an
                economical, environmentally friendly alternative to
                methyl bromide and other chemicals to effectively rid
                fruits and nuts of live, quarantined insects. </p>
              <p><b>In Texas -- It's Chiefly Citrus ~</b> </p>
              <p>In Weslaco, Texas, ARS entomologist Guy J. Hallman is
                checking out use of radio frequency treatment of citrus
                against the Mexican fruit fly. He's in the Crop Quality
                and Fruit Insect Research Unit at the Kika de la Garza
                Subtropical Agricultural Research Center. Hallman is
                developing a device to simulate what's needed to
                heat-treat citrus fruit with radio waves commercially. </p>
              <p>"We're trying to bridge the gap between the laboratory
                and real world," says Hallman. "Once we know how to
                treat fruit in a commercial situation and how much it
                will cost, any producer, shipper, or packinghouse
                operator can use the information to decide whether radio
                wave pest control is a viable option." </p>
              <p>In Hallman's system, citrus fruit would pass through a
                conveyor between a series of radio frequency heaters. To
                simulate a commercial system in the laboratory, the
                fruit are conveyed in a circulating water bath to keep
                them moving during heating. This would prevent the
                fruit's overheating from extended contact with any one
                area of the bath. And to ensure continuous heating from
                the peel in to the fruit's center --essential to killing
                all fruit flies that might be present-- a bumper would
                dunk any fruit that bobbed above the water surface. This
                prevents dark-black rings from forming around the fruit
                at the water's surface because of an energy
                concentration where the water meets the air. </p>
              <p>A method using just hot air to treat fruit in boxes or
                bins has been tried commercially in Mexico with mixed
                results. It takes hours to complete and puts a strain on
                the fruit's skin, sometimes causing heat damage. Radio
                frequency heating can be done in less than half an hour
                and is less damaging, since the fruit is heated
                uniformly throughout. </p>
              <p>Hallman has focused on grapefruits but is also working
                with other citrus, including oranges and tangerines. The
                larger the fruit, he notes, the harder it is to heat
                uniformly and the more likely to form hot and cold
                spots. </p>
              <p>"This multi-lab project is making a serious effort to
                take a look at things that haven't been looked at with
                radio frequency heating," says Hallman. "I think we
                stand a good chance of finding out how radio frequency
                disinfestation can be done to a large volume of fruits
                or nuts -- and if it can be done on a commercial scale."
                He predicts that by this summer he'll have a good idea
                of what the treatment will cost. </p>
              <p><b>In Washington -- Apples and Cherries ~</b> </p>
              <p>If you're in Wapato, Washington, don't be enticed by
                the apples floating in the tub in James Hansen's
                laboratory. You don't want to go bobbing for them. </p>
              <p>There are several reasons, says Hansen, an entomologist
                with ARS' Yakima Agricultural Research Laboratory. The
                first is that this particular tub is filled with salt
                water. Second, if you were to latch onto one of the
                apples with your teeth, you might bite the proverbial
                worm-- a larva hatched from a codling moth egg. </p>
              <p>And Hansen wants these apples intact -- no tooth marks,
                please. Such a mark might skew the results of tests he
                is conducting on use of radio waves to rid the fruit of
                live, pesky insects like the codling moth before market
                -- or shipment to trading partners like South Korea and
                Japan, where such pests might not already occur. Japan
                is particularly stringent about what phytosanitary
                methods it will accept for disinfesting fresh produce. </p>
              <p>This rule also applies to sweet cherries, a tree fruit
                commodity that generates over $145 million in yearly
                national export sales, notes Hansen. In cooperation with
                the team led by Tang, a professor in biological systems
                engineering at WSU, Hansen plans to "bathe" tubs full of
                apples and cherries with radio waves to determine
                exposure times that will kill codling moth larvae
                without affecting fruit quality. </p>
              <p>From two lines of research, one focusing on the
                insects, the other on fruit quality, and three major
                disciplines -- engineering, entomology, and plant
                physiology -- the collaborators hope to position radio
                wave treatment as a technology that can be readily
                adopted by commercial packinghouses or quarantine
                operations in lieu of methyl bromide. </p>
              <p>"Without suitable alternatives to methyl bromide, we're
                going to be up a creek," ARS horticulturist Stephen R.
                Drake says of the U.S. fruit industry's fight against
                quarantined pests. He is with ARS' Tree Fruit Research
                Laboratory in Wenatchee, Washington. </p>
              <p>"Ideally, you want to treat the fruit with radio
                frequency while it's being packed and designated for a
                particular market," Hansen explains. "Commercial packers
                can't afford to have produce sitting there, so we want
                this treatment to kill the insects as soon as it can." </p>
              <p>Tang, Hansen, Drake, and Lisa Nevens, an ARS
                entomologist at Yakima, first began working on the radio
                frequency project in 1996. </p>
              <p><b>In California -- Tree Nuts and Dried Fruits ~</b> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, in California, entomologist Judy A. Johnson
                is also keenly attuned to the potential of radio
                frequency energy to zap destructive insects. Her primary
                targets? The wiggly larvae of the navel orangeworm,
                Indianmeal moth, and codling moth. These insects are
                among the worst enemies of walnuts, almonds, and
                pistachios and of dried fruits such as figs and raisins.
                Johnson has newly added red flour beetle to her list of
                culprits -- a lesser pest of the nut and fruit crops but
                a major problem in flour mills and food-processing
                plants. </p>
              <p>Johnson is doing the radio frequency work at the ARS
                San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center at
                Parlier, near Fresno, in close association with
                cooperators at WSU and UC-Davis. They have already
                developed a preliminary picture of the target insects'
                ability to endure heat -- their "thermal tolerance." </p>
              <p>The laboratory experiments that Johnson and her ARS and
                university colleagues conducted are the first to
                extensively detail the thermal tolerance of the navel
                orangeworm, Indianmeal moth, and codling moth. </p>
              <p>For one test, Johnson and co-investigators drilled tiny
                holes in over 500 in-the-shell walnuts; enticed the
                slender, whitish navel orangeworms to enter the shells;
                then plugged the holes to block the insects' escape. The
                scientists then tried some novel combinations of radio
                waves and hot forced air, that is, air that's heated and
                blown into the test chamber holding the nuts. Radio
                waves, alone or combined with hot forced air, were used
                to heat the nuts to 55° C (131° F) in about 5 minutes.
                Hot forced air was then used to keep the nuts at 55° C
                for 5 or 10 minutes. </p>
              <p>"All the treatments killed 100 percent of the navel
                orangeworms," reports Johnson. What's more, tests led by
                co-researchers Tang at Pullman and Elizabeth J. Mitcham
                at UC-Davis, showed that the treatments didn't harm the
                quality of the nuts -- even in long-term storage. </p>
              <p>"That's critical," Johnson points out, "because walnuts
                are often stored for a year or more before they show up
                at your supermarket." </p>
              <p>In addition, walnuts are rich in oil, so they're more
                vulnerable to heat damage than some other kinds of nuts,
                such as almonds. "That's why we think that if a
                treatment is okay for walnuts," Johnson continues, "it
                will likely be okay for almonds." </p>
              <p>Indianmeal moths proved to be more susceptible to heat
                than navel orangeworms are. "Indian meal moths are
                silvery, and wedge-shaped. If you open a kitchen
                cupboard where you keep raisins or breakfast cereals and
                a little moth flies out at you," Johnson explains,
                "chances are it's an Indianmeal moth." </p>
              <p>For this experiment, Johnson and her colleagues used
                metal heating blocks, or plates, specially designed by
                Tang for the radio frequency research. They placed
                target insects in the small gap between the plates,
                which were then heated to specific temperatures and held
                at those temperatures for precise periods. </p>
              <p>She and her associates assembled some 15,000 Indianmeal
                moth larvae for the study, exposing them to temperatures
                ranging from 44° C to 52° C (about 111° F to 126° F) for
                2 to 100 minutes. "In general," Johnson comments, "the
                lower the temperature, the longer it took to kill the
                larvae. These readings are the basis for a new,
                math-based model for projecting the rate of kill at
                other time-and-temperature regimens. Because of the
                large number of larvae tested and the range of
                temperatures that we investigated, we're very confident
                of the accuracy of the model's projections." </p>
              <p>Johnson and her cooperators also used the special heat
                plates to discover more about the amount of time and
                heat that it takes to kill navel orangeworms. They
                exposed 15,000 navel orangeworms to temperatures ranging
                from 46° C to 54° C (about 115° F to 129° F) for 1 to
                120 minutes. Using the new data, they created a
                mathematical model of the navel orangeworm's thermal
                tolerances. </p>
              <p>The findings from the Texas, Washington, and California
                experiments are an essential starting point for making
                the radio frequency energy approach a success, Johnson
                says. The scientists have published their findings in

                <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Remember those song
                  birds we used to hear in the fields? The sounds of
                  animals in nature singing a symphony of soft and
                  subtle sounds as all things flow together to create a
                  living and vibrant concerto? Science is now showing
                  that these sounds actually do influence the growth of
                  plants. Researchers have demonstrated that plants
                  respond to sounds in pro-found ways which not only
                  influence their overall health but also increase the
                  speed of growth and the size of the plant.</font>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many people
                    remember hearing in the late 1960's and 1970's about
                    the idea that plants respond to music. There were
                    lots of projects in high schools and colleges which
                    successfully tested the effects of sound on plant
                    growth. It was determined through repetitive testing
                    that plants did respond to music and sound. The
                    first book which brought this idea to most of us
                    was: The Secret Life of Plants, by Peter Tompkins
                    and Christopher Bird (Harper &amp; Row 1973). In
                    this best selling book a number of astounding
                    revelations about plant growth were revealed. The
                    idea that plants were influenced by sound in both
                    positive and negative ways was demonstrated by
                    several world class scientists at that time.</font>

                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we think of
                    plants being affected by sunlight we are really
                    looking at the effect of a portion of the
                    electromagnetic spectrum on plants ­ that portion
                    which includes visible light. It should not surprise
                    us that sound also impacts plant growth because it
                    is, in essence, an extension to other parts of the
                    electromagnetic spectrum.</font> </p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The science was

                    The article confirmed old ideas by placing them in a
                    scientific context. It tells an excellent story
                    about the impact of sound on plant growth, bringing
                    to light what was before considered esoteric or
                    mysterious science. After reading this short article

                    remember reading accounts of plant growth being
                    stimulated by sound waves. At that time, "talking"
                    to plants and playing plants different types of
                    music was used to influence growth. A number of
                    people were using these techniques without being
                    able to completely explain the phenomena. This

                    organic matter with the expectation that it will
                    help stimulate growth? These ideas were the thoughts
                    of some "non-scientists" until French physicist and
                    musician, Joel Sternheimer, discovered the mechanism
                    for how plants respond to the stimulation of sound
                    waves. Sternheimer composes musical note sequences
                    which help plants grow and has applied for an
                    international patent1 covering the concept.</font> </p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sound
                    sequences are not random but are carefully
                    constructed melodies. Each note is chosen to
                    correspond to an amino acid in a protein with the
                    full tune corresponding to the entire protein. What
                    this means is that the sounds sequenced in just the
                    right order results in a tune which is unique and
                    harmonizes with the internal structure of a specific
                    plant type. Each plant type has a different sequence
                    of notes to stimulate its growth. According to New
                    Scientist, "Sternheimer claims that when plants
                    "hear" the appropriate tune, they produce more of
                    that protein. He also writes tunes that inhibit the
                    synthesis of proteins." In other words, desirable
                    plants could be stimulated to grow while undesirable
                    plants (weeds for instance) could be inhibited. This
                    is done with electromagnetic energy, in this case
                    sound waves, pulsed to the right set of frequencies
                    thus effecting the plant at an energetic and
                    submolecular level.</font> </p>

                    translates into audible vibrations of music the
                    quantum vibrations that occur at the molecular level
                    as a protein is being assembled from its constituent
                    amino acids. By using simple physics he is able to
                    compose music which achieves this correlation.
                    Sternheimer indicated to New Scientist that each
                    musical note which he composes for the plant is a
                    multiple of original frequencies that occur when
                    amino acids join the protein chain. He says that
                    playing the right notes stimulates the plant and
                    increases growth. This idea is particularly
                    interesting because it may lead to the eventual
                    obsolescence of fertilizers used to stimulate plant
                    growth. This new method would be cheap and
                    relatively easily provided throughout the world,
                    thereby avoiding many of the problems associated
                    with the extraction, shipping, environmental and
                    economic costs of chemical fertilizers.</font> </p>

                    "The length of a note corresponds to the real time
                    it takes for each amino acid to come after the
                    next," according to Sternheimer, who studied quantum

                    Sternheimer, he claims that tomatoes exposed to his
                    melodies grew two-and-a-half times as large as those
                    which were untreated. Some of the treated plants
                    were sweeter in addition to being significantly
                    larger. The musical sequences stimulated three
                    tomato growth promoters, cytochrome C, and thaumatin
                    (a flavoring compound). According to Sternheimer in
                    the New Scientist, "Six molecules were being played
                    to the tomatoes for a total of three minutes a day."</font>

                    claims to have stopped the mosaic virus by playing
                    note sequences that inhibited enzymes required by
                    the virus. This virus would have harmed the tomato

                    used by the inventor are very short and need only be
                    played one time. For example, the sequence for for
                    cytochrome C lasts just 29 seconds. According to
                    Sternheimer, "on average, you get four amino acids
                    played per second" in this series.</font> </p>
                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventor also
                    issued a warning for those repeating his
                    experiments. He warns to be careful with the sound
                    sequences because they can affect people. "Don't ask
                    a musician to play them," he says. Sternheimer
                    indicated that one of his musicians had difficulty
                    breathing after playing the tune for cytochrome C.</font>

                <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Plant stimulation
                    by sound may have profound implications. The idea

                    has been developed should be exciting for many third
                    world countries. At a time when human progress can
                    be made through simple solutions in agriculture,
                    resources are being wasted in the extraction of
                    mineral and oil compounds for fertilizers. If this
                    method of fertilization were followed the human
                    intellect would prove superior to physical capital

              <p>Rodent repellent liquids are disclosed which are
                comprised of thujone oil in pure form or in the form of
                cedar leaf oil in a suitable low odor liquid carrier
                such as mineral oil. </p>
              <p>FIELD OF INVENTION </p>
              <p>The present invention relates to a liquid having rodent
                repellent characteristics. </p>
              <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </p>
              <p>For many years numerous attempts have been made to keep
                rats and mice away from homes, storage bins and other
                areas. Most commonly, traps or poisons are used to kill
                the vermin. In addition to creating dead animal disposal
                problems, traps and poisons also pose dangers to
                children, pets and animals. Furthermore, traps and
                poisons must be monitored. Sprung traps must be reset
                and consumed poison must be replaced. Also, many people
                have found that for each rat they kill with traps or
                poison there are others in the area who survive. </p>
              <p>Rather than try to kill the rodents which are present,
                a better approach is to deter them from entering the
                area. Certain plant extracts have been found to have
                repellent properties Bottrell in U.S. Pat. No. 1,871,949
                uses oil of peppermint to repell rodents. Cross in U.S.
                Pat. No. 2,159,550 teaches that extracts from the wood
                and fruit of the Areca catechu plant have repellent
                properties. Yet, neither of these materials have had any
                commercial success. </p>
              <p>The art has also recognized that certain plants repel
                rodents. For example, pieces of the wormwood plant
                (Artemsia Absinthium) have been used as moth and rodent
                repellents. But, these pieces are only effective for a
                relatively short period of time, typically a few days. </p>
              <p>The art has generally attributed the repellent
                characteristics of the wormwood and other plants to the
                presence of alkyloids in the plant. Apparently, these
                alkyloids are poisonous. However, I have discovered that
                thujone oil, a natural oil of the wormwood plant and a
                component of cedar leaf oil from the cedar tree, not
                alkyloids, will repel rodents when used in the manner
                here described. </p>
              <p>In my U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,668,294 and 4,654,080 I disclose
                liquid rodent repellents in which thujone oil is
                combined with sodium silicate, lacquer or kerosene.
                Although these products work well they are not suitable
                for warm environments. The flash points of lacquer and
                kerosene are so low that there is a risk of ignition.
                Thus, there is a need for a liquid rodent repellent
                which is non-flammable. </p>
              <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
              <p>I provide a rodent repellent in liquid form by
                combining pure thujone oil or cedar leaf oil which
                contains thujone oil with a low odor liquid carrier.
                Several liquids such as mineral oil, alcohol, kerosene
                or lacquer are suitable. </p>
              <p>I prefer to use a liquid comprised of thujone oil in
                the form of cedar leaf oil and a low odor liquid
                carrier, such as mineral oil, in a mixture having from
                0.5 to 10 ounces carrier per 1 ounce cedar leaf oil. If
                pure thujone oil is used the mixture should contain a
                higher percentage of carrier. </p>
              <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
              <p>I have found that certain compositions of thujone oil
                or cedar leaf oil and a low odor liquid carrier will
                repel rodents for a significant period of time. A
                combination of thujone oil or cedar leaf oil and liquid
                when used like a paint will keep rodents away from the
                painted area for between three and five years. </p>
              <p>To make these products, I first extract the oil from
                the plant source. Thujone oil is extracted from the
                wormwood plant and cedar leaf oil is obtained from the
                cedar tree. Thujone oil is also commercially available
                as it is used in perfume. Both oils have a similar aroma
                and can be used interchangeably. Then the oil is
                combined with a suitable, low odor carrier such as
                mineral oil, alcohol, white kerosene or any of the low
                odor solvents sold by Exxon under the trade name ISOPAR.
              </p>
              <p>I have found that mineral oil is a suitable carrier for
                thujone oil and cedar leaf oil. Cedar leaf oil and
                mineral oil are combined to provide from 0.5 to 10
                ounces mineral oil per ounce of cedar leaf oil. Then,
                the combination is applied to a surface like any
                standard paint. </p>
              <p>Other low odor carriers in addition to mineral oil
                could also be used as a carrier. These solvents must be
                non-reactive with thujone oil and evaporate at room
                temperature or lower. They also must not leave an
                odorous residue which would overpower the odor of
                thujone oil. </p>
              <p>I have conducted several experiments to show the
                effectiveness of my rat and mice repellents. The first
                experiment consisted of three boxes with the entrances
                to each blocked with sheets of screen. The rats were
                placed in the middle box. The box on the left contained
                food and the walls of the box were stained with the rat
                and mice repellent. This repellent was a mixture of 12%
                thujone oil and 88% lacquer. The box on the right
                contained only food and the walls were not stained. At
                the end of five days, the metal screens were lifted. The
                rats would not enter the box with the rat and mice
                repellent, but ate from the box that contained no
                repellent. </p>
              <p>I have also applied my liquid repellent to underfloor
                areas of homes that I identified as rodent nests or
                pathways. A few days later I returned and saw no signs
                of rats or mice. The owners of the homes I treated also
                reported no signs of rodents after treatment. </p>
              <p>In a second experiment, I used two boxes separated by a
                metal screen. A neutral box without repellent on the
                walls housed the rats. The remaining box contained the
                rat and mice repellent and contained the food. After
                five days the metal screen which separated the boxes was
                lifted. The rats would not enter the box stained with
                the rat and mice repellent to get the food. The
                repellent used in this experiment was a mixture of 12%
                thujone oil and 88% lacquer. </p>
              <p>While I have described certain present preferred
                embodiments of my invention, it should be distinctly
                understood that the invention is not limited thereto but
                may be variously embodied within the scope of the
                following claims. </p>

              <p>"All things have their season, and a time to every
                purpose under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to
                die; a time to plant, and a time to reap". (Ecclesiastes
                3:1-2) </p>
              <p>Many biodynamic cultivators plant and harvest with
                respect to lunar phases and planetary aspects, and they
                swear by the results. Almanacs and calendars offer
                traditional lore for the consideration of farmers. Some
                of these practices are ancient and universal, occurring
                with variations in many cultures around the world. </p>
              <p>Many of these beliefs are grounded in fact. The sun,
                moon, and planets are surrounded by magnetospheres which
                trail behind them for millions of miles like wakes
                behind ships. These fields affect life on earth by
                modifying atmospheric electrical field conditions and
                the geomagnetic field. </p>
              <p>In 1938, Dr Harry Marvis announced the discovery that
                stars exercise a daily influence on terrestrial weather.
                Sidereal air pressure, or barometric variations in
                relation to the positions of stars, is sometimes as high
                as 3% of that occurring in common storms. </p>
              <p>The zodiacal signs exert a fruitful or barren influence
                upon Earth through the channel of Luna, according to the
                nature of the sign through which the moon is passing.
                The time to plant is when the Sun and Earth’s horizon
                (the Ascendant or Rising Sign) are in favorable signs
                (Figure 1). The optimal day for planting is when the
                Moon also enters that sign. </p>
              <p>Leafy vegetable crops that grow above ground should be
                planted during a new or waxing moon in Pisces, Taurus,
                Cancer or Scorpio. Trees and crops requiring longer than
                one year to produce should be planted during a full or
                waning moon in Taurus. Subsoil crops (potatoes, peanuts,
                carrots, etc.) should be planted under a waning moon. </p>

              <p>As indicated in Figure 2, seeds that have a short (up
                to 7 days) or extra-long (one month) germination period
                should be sown two days before the new moon, up to 7
                days later. </p>
              <p>During the first week of its cycle, the moon’s light
                increases, and its gravitational pull decreases. The
                relative influence of terrestrial gravity increases at
                that time, stimulating balanced growth of leaves and
                roots. In the second week, lunar gravity increases, and
                its light increases to a maximum. Leaf growth increases
                during that period. During the third week, both
                moonlight and lunar gravity decrease, and root growth is
                enhanced accordingly. Transplant at that time. In the
                fourth week, lunar gravity increases, and moonlight
                decreases. Both leaf and root growth decrease during
                this rest phase. </p>
              <p>Traditional sources suggest that flower seeds should be
                plants during the crescent moon unless seeds are
                desired; in that case, sow just before the Full Moon.
                Seeds planted when Luna is in Capricorn produce rapid
                growth, but poor yields. Seeds planted under an Aquarian
                moon will rot or produce watery fruit. </p>
              <p>Cancer and Scorpio are fruitful signs which prompt
                germination and assure abundant yields. Leaf growth is
                greater when water signs are effective. Root growth is
                best in Earth signs. The Fire signs stimulate the rapid
                growth of seeds and fruit. Air signs promote the growth
                of lowers. </p>
              <p>Prepare the soil, pull weeds, and fight pests during
                the new moon phase in a barren sign (Aries, Gemini,
                Virgo, Sagittarius, or Aquarius). Lay mulch under the
                Full Moon, and turn manure and compost piles during the
                waning moon. Apply it at the new or half moon. Irrigate
                and feed plants when the moon is in a Water sign. </p>
              <p>Harvest under a full or waning moon in a barren sign.
                If timber is cut under the full moon in Leo, it will
                last longer than wood cut at any other time, and it will
                not become worm-eaten. Trees planted under a waxing moon
                will produce more fruit, while trees planted during the
                dark phase of the moon will produce better quality
                fruit. </p>
              <p><b>Astro-Meteorology ~</b> </p>
              <p>Weather prediction by astro-meteorology is a highly
                refined area of sidereal science which has claimed an
                amazing 90%-plus record of accuracy for both short- and
                long-term forecasts of weather patterns. This system is
                an accumulation of tried-and-true observational data
                going back several millennia. </p>
              <p>The subject was widely popularized by Joseph Goodavage
                in his book, Our Threatened Planet (1978, Simon &amp;
                Schuster), in which he represented the work of pioneers
                such as Dr Irving Krick, Dr Andrew Douglass, George
                McCormack and others. According to Goodavage, the sun
                has entered a period of prolonged and violent
                instability with which we must cope. Modern astronomy
                has confirmed Goodavage’s prediction. </p>
              <p>Classical horoscopic weather prediction is based on
                forecasts of the influences of the planets in solstice
                or equinox horoscopes. Each zodiacal sign colors the
                characteristics of the planets occupying that region.
                For instance, a "wet" planet such as Luna indicates
                extra-wet weather when it is located in a water sign;
                much drier conditions are indicated when Luna is in a
                fire sign. </p>
              <p>Half of the total influence of a weather horoscope
                should be judged from the 4th house cusp and planets
                therein, and their aspects. The 4th house governs the
                locale. </p>
              <p>One quarter of the total influence of ingress weather
                charts should be judged from the first house, from its
                occupying planets and their aspects, from the sign on
                its cusp, and from the planet ruling the cusp sign, the
                sign it is in, and its aspects. </p>
              <p>One-eighth of the influence of a weather chart is
                judged from the planet for which the chart is erected.
                Sol = temperature, Luna = moisture, Mercury = air. For
                example, if Sol is in Aries, then Mars, the ruling
                planet of Aries, and its aspects also must be
                considered. </p>
              <p>One-eighth of the influence on weather is to be judged
                by the planets in angular houses, their aspects, and the
                signs they occupy. </p>
              <p>The temperature chart gives an average indication of
                the weather, but indications of storms should be
                compared with both air and moisture charts for that
                time. </p>
              <p>The primary mutual aspects are the conjunction,
                opposition, square and trine, but even the minor aspects
                are effective. Trines and sextiles are not necessarily
                beneficial, but they tend to exert a more gentle
                influence than the inharmonious aspects (square and
                opposition). Interpretation depends on the planetary
                positions in the signs and houses, and the aspects and
                parallels of declination to other planets, and the
                ascendant of the chart and the aspects to it by
                transiting planets. Table 1 lists indicators of weather
                attributes of the planets and signs. </p>
              <p>Table 2 is Dr Adam Clark’s system for predicting the
                weather throughout the lunations forever. It foretells
                the weather that is most likely to occur during each
                phase of the moon. </p>
              <p>The nearer to midnight that the moon changes its phase
                in the full and last quarter, the better the weather
                will be for the seven days following. The time span for
                this calculation of from 10 pm to 2 am. </p>
              <p>The nearer to noon (from 10 am to 2 pm) that the moon
                changes phase, the more wet weather may be expected for
                the next week. These observations are for the summer
                season, though they also are adaptable to spring and
                fall observations. Changing phases of the moon occurring
                from 4 pm to 10 pm may be followed by fair weather,
                depending on the wind, as indicated in Table 2. </p>

                    Growth</font></b>
                <p><b>by Robert Nelson</b></p>
              </center>
              <p>Besides the <a href="../../biodynam.htm">Biodynamic
                  Formulas</a>, there exist several other methods of
                stimulating seed germination and plant growth with
                non-toxic substances. Several other methods are in
                general use by farmers: </p>
              <p><b>(1) Nutrient Presoaking ~</b> Presoak seeds in a
                solution of nutrients that will add to the vigor of the
                seeds. Pure water tends to dissolve out substances
                contained in the seeds’ shells that are needed for the
                germination and growth. One easy method of stimulating
                the germination of seeds is to soak them in an aqueous
                extract of the full-grown plant from the preceding crop.
                Low-voltage direct electrical current can facilitate the
                electrophoresis of nutrients into the seeds, as
                described in the review of <a
                  href="../../articles/elcultur.htm">ElectroCulture</a>.
              </p>
              <p><b>(2) Acid Scarification ~</b> This technique is
                recommended for thick-shell seeds. Place dry seeds in a
                glass container and cover them with concentrated
                sulfuric acid (sp. gr 1.84) for 5 minutes. Pour off the
                acid and wash the seeds very thoroughly with fresh water
                to remove any residual acid. Never add water to the
                acid; it will spatter violently. Always add acid to the
                water. The seeds should be planted immediately while
                wet. </p>
              <p><b>(3) Moist-Chilling ~</b> Also known as
                Vermiculization or Stratification, this technique of
                preconditioning seeds accelerates the after-ripening of
                seeds by exposing them to low temperature (0-10
                degrees), moisture, and air for a period of time. Moist
                chilling is most effective when applied after hot water
                presoaking. Seeds are mixed with two volumes of sand and
                are kept in plastic bags in a refrigerator or outdoors.
                At the end of the after-ripening period some of the
                seeds may begin to germinate while in storage. The seeds
                can be separated from their medium by shaking the
                mixture on a screen. The seeds should be planted
                immediately before they dry out. </p>
              <p><b>(4) Thiourea ~</b> Aqueous solutions (0.5-3%)
                stimulate germination, but inhibit later growth.
                Therefore seeds should be soaked no longer than 12
                hours, and must be thoroughly rinsed with fresh water. </p>
              <p><b>(5) Potassium Nitrate ~</b> Seeds will germinate
                faster when placed in sand moistened with 0.2% aqueous
                potassium nitrate. Rewater with pure water rather than
                additional nitrate solution. </p>
              <p><b>(6) Hydrogen Peroxide ~</b> 30% hydrogen peroxide
                also is effective as a stimulant of germination. Very
                dilute hydrogen peroxide also accelerates later growth
                if used only occasionally. </p>
              <p><b>(7) Gibberillin ~</b> When seeds absorb water, the
                hormone gibberillin appears in the embryo and is
                translocated to the aleurone layer, where it activates
                the metabolism to initiate sprouting. Gibberillin causes
                the rapid growth of beans and bamboo, which contain
                large amounts of the hormone. </p>
              <p>Gibberillin is not, however, appropriate for
                application to all plants. In most cases, gibberillin
                increases the thickness and internodal length of the
                stalk. Sometimes the terminal nodes are weak branching
                is suppressed, and the roots develop poorly. The number
                of flowers increase, and they are larger. Germination
                and flowering are stimulated, but leaf growth and
                chlorophyll production are reduced proportionately. </p>
              <p>Gibberillin is extracted from cucumber seeds, fresh
                cantelope seeds, dried corn kernels, and from pencil
                rod, lupine, and pinto beans. Soak 200 gr of powdered
                seeds for one week in 110 ml of a mixture of acetone (10
                parts), isopropyl alcohol (5 parts) ethanol (2 parts)
                and water (5 parts). Filter the mush and rinse it with
                20 ml acetone and 20 ml isopropyl alcohol. Combine the
                rinse and mother liquor, evaporate the solvent, and
                dissolve the residual gum in alkaline water for
                experimental use. </p>
              <p><b>(8) Auxin ~</b> Auxin is the general name of a group
                of plant hormones that includes indole-acetic-,
                -propionic-, and -butyric-acids. Auxins are active in
                many platn functions, such as stem growth, root
                development, and flowering. </p>
              <p>The sexual expression of plants is strongly influenced
                by the amount of auxin present during the flowering
                phase. Other factors being equal, females develop with
                higher levels of auxin. </p>
              <p>Combine auxin (1:5000 water) with vitamin B-1 (1 ppm)
                to increase the effect of both nutrients, which are
                available in commercial preparations. </p>
              <p><b>(9) Triacontanol ~</b> This fatty acid is found in
                many plants. It increases growth rates and yields up to
                25%, and increases the protein content, even in
                darkness, when most plants are dormant. It seems to
                enhance the growth of plants without increasing their
                consumption of nitrogen. </p>
              <p>Triacontanol is non-toxic, and incredibly potent. The
                applied dosage is one part in 10 million of water,
                applied as a foliar spray. The simplest way to use
                triacontanol is to plow under a crop of alfalfa, which
                contains relatively large amounts of the substance.
                Other common sources include cotton, apples, and
                sunflower seeds (which contain up to 8% in the fatty
                acid fraction). </p>
              <p>Triacontanol is extracted from dried plants by

                  a "1x potency". The grinding process is called
                  "trituration". By another method of preparation, the
                  substance is diluted with nine parts of water or
                  alcohol. The solution must be stirred vigorously,
                  and/or stimulated with select frequencies by a signal

                  "succussion".</font> </p>
              <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Homeopathic remedies

                  1:1000 is 3x, and so on. Each time the next higher
                  potency is prepared, one part of the preceding potency
                  is diluted with 9 parts of water or lactose. Some
                  triturated powders can be prepared in a lapidary
                  tumbler, using steel balls to do the grinding. A
                  blender also can be used to prepare both triturations

              <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From a chemical
                  standpoint, the quantity of the triturated substance

                  being scarcely a trace, yet the effects are clearly
                  pronounced. Homeopathic theory posits that the
                  mechanical energy applied by trituration and
                  succussion distends the molecules of the original
                  substance, thus altering the fundamental nature and

              Source: <a href="http://www.srs.fs.fed.us/">Southern
                Research Station - USDA Forest Service</a> <br>
              Date: 2003-03-26
              <p>NEW ORLEANS, LA - Known for its intoxicating effects on
                felines, catnip oil may also have a future in termite
                control. Recent experiments by USDA Forest Service
                researcher Chris Peterson show that catnip oil repels
                and even kills termites in a laboratory setting. </p>
              <p>Peterson, a researcher with the Forest Service Southern
                Research Station (SRS), and fellow researcher Janice
                Ems-Wilson, a chemist at Valencia Community College in
                Orlando, FL, presented the results of their research at
                the national meeting of the American Chemical Society
                held March 23 - 27 in New Orleans. </p>
              <p>An entomologist with the SRS Wood Products Insect
                Research unit in Starkville, MS, Peterson has been
                testing essential catnip oil as a possible replacement
                for the more toxic pesticides presently used to control
                termites. Probably the most common termite control
                method is treating the soil next to wood structures with
                chemical compounds: some of the active ingredients of
                traditional termiticides, such as chlordane and
                chlorpyrifos, have lost their registrations in the U.S.
                due to their toxicity. New, more eco-friendly compounds
                are being sought to fill the void. </p>
              <p>The search for new termiticidal products is active.
                "The USDA Forest Service routinely tests about three new
                termite formulations for effectiveness every year, with
                a new active ingredient tested about once in every two
                years," said Peterson. "Natural compounds from plants,
                bacteria, and fungi could provide new commercial
                products that are less toxic to humans and the
                environment." </p>
              <p>For their termite study, Peterson and Ems-Wilson
                infused sand with catnip essential oil--the kind
                routinely sold in pet stores--to test the effectiveness
                of the oil as a barrier to termite tunneling. To test
                vertical tunneling, the researchers placed yellow pine
                sapwood in the bottom of a test tube filled with sand. A
                two-inch barrier of catnip-treated sand separated the
                termites in the top layer of untreated sand from the
                pine. To test horizontal tunneling, the researchers
                constructed a barrier of treated sand across the middle
                of a transparent box of sand, again with the tempting
                pine placed across the barrier from the termites. In
                both tests, catnip oil reduced or eliminated termite
                tunneling. </p>
              <p>Peterson and Ems-Wilson also tested the catnip oil for
                its toxicity to termites by treating them directly with
                a dilution of the oil, fumigating them, and exposing
                them to catnip-infused soil. The researchers carefully
                counted the termites in the multiple tests on barriers
                to make sure the barrier-effect they found was not due
                to termite mortality. </p>
              <p>"At higher concentrations, the oil does kill termites,
                but not as effectively as the commercial compounds
                currently used in soil treatments," said Peterson. "Our
                results show that catnip oil is a very effective
                deterrent to termite tunneling, with the effective doses
                tested much lower than those reported for similar
                natural products." </p>
              <p>Unfortunately, catnip oil breaks down quickly in the
                environment. The chemicals now used to prevent termite
                infestation must remain effective for more than five
                years in government testing. "There is the inevitable
                tradeoff," said Peterson. "Chemicals that last a long
                time also have greater potential for environmental
                damage. We hope that the active ingredients in catnip
                oil can eventually be modified to last longer." </p>
              <p>Peterson emphasizes that his experiments are
                preliminary: catnip oil has not been officially tested
                for safety and effectiveness in the field. "The other
                factor is cost," said Peterson. "Catnip oil is much too
                expensive to use at effective rates when compared to
                other compounds. Until a way is found to produce the oil
                competitively and formulate it for long-term use, its
                only practical use would be for controlling isolated
                populations of termites." </p>
              <p>The mission of the SRS Wood Products Insect Research
                unit is to improve the protection of wood products from
                subterranean termite damage, define the role of termites
                in forest ecosystems, and understand their impact on
                forest health. For more information: <a

                  conductive spring members are disposed in a generally
                  horizontal plane and connected to a high voltage
                  source of electricity. The spring members have a
                  spring constant such that relatively stiff crops
                  plants will deflect the spring members while
                  relatively flexible weeds will not deflect them.
                  Substantially all of the plants in and around the crop
                  rows are contacted with current-carrying portions of
                  the spring members by moving the spring members
                  relative to the crop rows parallel to the crop rows. A

                  receive sufficient electrical energy to result in

                  at high electrical potential, including a high voltage
                  source of electricity; nozzles for spraying the
                  electrically conductive liquid on plants to be
                  destroyed; and a structure for grounding the high
                  voltage source. Air pressure provided over the liquid
                  in the tank provides the motive force for spraying,
                  and pneumatically operated valves in line with the
                  nozzles are provided for selectively supplying liquid
                  to the nozzles. In this way, there are no moving parts
                  which are electrically charged. Condition-responsive
                  structures, responsive to plant position, are provided
                  for controlling operation of the pneumatic valves,
                  such as air limit proximity switches. The current
                  output of the high voltage source is limited so that
                  damage to the source is prevented, and the no-load
                  voltage of the high voltage source also is preferably
                  controlled.</font> <br>

                  system for producing nitrogen fertilizer using an
                  electric arc process is described in which the
                  electric arc necessary for the process is generated by
                  piezoelectric elements actuated by a hammer mechanism
                  powered by water pressure such as from a garden hose.
                  The nitrogen oxides produced by the arc discharge are
                  drawn into the water to serve as a source of nitrogen
                  fertilizer. The net result of the invention is that
                  the operator can provide nitrogen fertilizer as he
                  supplies water to the same area. The only inputs to
                  this system are air and a source of water under
                  pressure.</font> <br>

                  method and apparatus for controlling plant growth is
                  provided. The apparatus includes a magnetic field
                  generator for producing a controlled, fluctuating,

                  predetermined axis projecting through viable plant

                  after nulling out or measuring and accounting for the

                  seeds are controlled by high voltage pulses with short
                  duration which electropermeabilize the cell membranes
                  of weed seeds in the ground. The device is selective
                  and damages only germinating weed seeds and plants
                  early in their life cycle. The required amount of
                  energy is small; with rectangular pulses the optimal
                  field strength is between 100-300 kV/m with a duration
                  of (10-100 microseconds). A transformer placed on a
                  sowing machine transforms electrical energy to high
                  voltage pulses. The energy may be taken from the
                  pulling tractor via a transmission or from an
                  integrated power source. The high voltage pulses are
                  applied to electrically conducting via applicators to
                  two or more fixedly spaced plates to the soil around
                  newly sown seeds.</font> <br>

                  device for the manipulation of a biological material
                  [seeds] by a magnetic field is presented. The device
                  comprises a magnetic field source coupled to a current
                  source. The current source is of a kind supplying an
                  electric current of at least two electrical degree
                  shifted phases. The magnetic field source comprises a
                  two-part inductor, each inductor part producing a
                  coordinate varying magnetic field (CVMF). Each
                  inductor part is formed by at least two conductors
                  aligned in a spaced-apart relationship, wherein each
                  of the at least two conductors is connectable to a
                  different phase of the current source, and has two
                  spaced-apart parts arranged such that when the
                  conductor is connected to the current source, the
                  electric current flows in its two parts in opposite
                  directions, respectively. The conductors of each
                  inductor part are arranged such that each two locally
                  adjacent conductor parts are associated with two
                  different phases of the electric current source. A
                  distance between the two conductor parts coupled to
                  the same phase of the current source defines a
                  half-wavelength .lambda./2 of a wave of magnetic
                  induction of the CVMF. This distance is selected in
                  accordance with a predetermined relation between the
                  wavelength .lambda. and an effective space .DELTA.
