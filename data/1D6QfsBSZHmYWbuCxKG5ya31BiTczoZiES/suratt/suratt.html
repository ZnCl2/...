            and SG Gas</b></big></div>
      <br>
      <b>Water Ion Technologies</b> causes fundamental molecular changes
      in water that allow the creation of new or improved products with
      properties and characteristics not ever seen before in today's
      world. These products and services affect the most basic needs of
      mankind toward better health, more efficient energy and a cleaner
      environment. The core of Water Ion Technologies is the proprietary
      process, owned by WIT International, L.L.C. or "WIT", for
      generating the Fourth State of Water which is named SG Gas. The
      resulting gas flame has a uniform blue color appearance without
      yellow sparks indicative of water (H2O) vapor or red sparks
      indicative of either H2 or O2 gas contamination that are evident
      in other water-generated gases.<br>
      <br>
      In our process of creating SG Gas, electrolysis does not take
      place! Other gases developed by Rhodes and Brown are "dirty
      cocktails" with mixtures of gases including H2 or O2 gases that
      are generated from heat-producing electrolysis processes and can
      be explosive.<br>
      <br>
      It must be clear in our process of creating SG Gas, electrolysis
      does not take place. "Electrolysis" is defined as a "method of
      separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by passing an
      electric current through them." Electrolysis does not take place
      and no splitting of the water molecular bonds to the basic
      components of oxygen and hydrogen occurs, as is demonstrated by
      the fact that no increase in hydrogen or oxygen gas can be
      measured in the reaction zone during the production of SG Gas.
      This is a key differentiator from the processes that have resulted
      in other gases that were and are produced by electrolysis of
      water. The gases produced by electrolysis exhibit far different
      properties from that of SG Gas. Gases produced by electrolysis are
      explosive, cannot be pressurized and are heat-producing gases on
      ignition. Rather, our discovery involves a shift of one hydrogen
      within a water molecule (H2O) to create a diatomic bond of two
      hydrogens with the oxygen. The combination of the electric and
      magnetic forces associated with our discovery, restructures the
      water molecule and creates the resulting O--HH molecule such that
      SG Gas can be pressurized and is not explosive upon ignition.<br>
      <br>
      Our process for creating the more stable, safer SG Gas is neither
      heat producing (no electrolysis) nor involves any splitting of
      hydrogen and oxygen bonds from the water molecule that could
      create an explosive situation.<br>

          <b>Apparatus And Method For Making Flammable Gas</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      An electrolyzer includes a first electrode in the form of an inner
      tank formed of a material capable of being magnetized and a second
      electrode in the form of an outer tank formed of a material
      capable of being magnetized. The inner tank is nested within the
      outer tank. A spacer basket formed of a plastic material is
      disposed between the inner tank and the outer tank. The inner tank
      includes a positive terminal in electrical communication with a DC
      power source and the outer tank includes a negative terminal in
      electrical communication with the DC power source. A magnet for
      magnetizing the outer tank has a field sufficient to affect the
      inner tank. Electrolysis within the tank produces a flammable gas
      having a first hydrogen atom bonded to an oxygen atom and a second
      hydrogen atom bonded to the first hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates, generally, to the generation of gas
      from electrolysis. More particularly, it relates to the generation
      of a flammable gas having unusual properties and a heretofore
      unknown molecular structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] It has long been known that water can be separated into
      hydrogen and oxygen with the use of an electrolyzer. However, the
      cost of the process is greater than the benefits received.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] What is needed, then, is an improved electrolysis method
      and apparatus that produces a novel flammable gas from an
      electrolyte and water solution that provides benefits without the
      prior art high cost of separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] However, in view of the prior art considered as a whole at
      the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to
      those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art how the identified
      needs could be fulfilled.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a
      novel flammable gas and for an electrolyzer capable of generating
      such novel gas is now provided in the form of a new, useful, and
      nonobvious invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Because molecules such as hydrogen and oxygen have magnetic
      qualities, they exist normally in a diatomic state O2 and H2. They
      also have electronegative values that affect the strength of the
      bond. In the case of a water molecule (H2O), this invention
      discloses that introducing a current through an electrolyte
      solution, preferably a potassium hydroxide solution, in the
      presence of a magnetic field reconfigures the molecule into a
      heretofore unknown gas referred to hereinafter as hydroxyhydrogen
      or hydrogas. This heretofore unknown gas is a diatomic hydrogen
      molecule that is single bonded to atomic oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] This is accomplished by spacing an anode and a cathode
      about a quarter of an inch apart and introducing a DC voltage of
      approximately 1.5 to 2.0 volts with current equal to approximately
      one-quarter of an amp (0.25 amp) per square inch of cathode
      surface area. This weakens the electronegative strength of the
      oxygen atom and allows a hydrogen atom to dislodge and
      magnetically bond to the other hydrogen atom that is strengthened
      by the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The resulting product is a flammable non-toxic gas that
      implodes when lit, and is an oxidizer that liberates atomic
      hydrogen when it bonds with another molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] More particularly, the novel electrolyzer includes a first
      electrode in the form of an inner tank having a first diameter
      formed of a material capable of being magnetized and a second
      electrode in the form of an outer tank having a second diameter
      formed of a material capable of being magnetized. The second
      diameter is greater than the first diameter and the inner tank is
      nested within the outer tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A cylindrical open space is created between the inner and
      outer tanks by the difference in tank diameters. Drain holes are
      formed in the sidewalls of the inner tank, near the bottom end
      thereof, so that when the inner tank is filled water and an
      electrolyte such as potassium hydroxide to form an electrolytic
      fluid, the electrolytic liquid fluid flows through the drain holes
      and is disposed in the open space between the inner tank and said
      outer tank. The inner tank is also full of said electrolytic fluid
      when said open space is full.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A spacer basket formed of a plastic material is disposed in
      the open space between the inner tank and the outer tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The positive side of a DC power source is in electrical
      communication with a positive terminal secured to the inner tank
      and the negative side of the DC power source is in electrical
      communication with a negative terminal secured to the outer tank.
      The DC power source provides a voltage of about 1.5 to 2.0 volts
      and a current of about 0.25 amps per square inch of cathode
      surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] A magnet having a strength of about twenty (20) Gauss units
      magnetizes the outer tank, and the strength of the magnetic field
      of the magnet is sufficient to affect the inner tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The outer tank has a gas outlet and a flammable gas is
      generated by electrolysis within the electrolyzer and is collected
      as it exits through said gas outlet. The flammable gas burns at a
      temperature of about two hundred seventy degrees Fahrenheit
      (270[deg.] F.) when ignited. The flammable gas has a first
      hydrogen atom bonded with an oxygen atom and a second hydrogen
      atom bonded with the first hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] A purified, polarized water is made by passing the
      flammable gas through distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] An important object of this invention is to provide a
      method and apparatus for making the novel gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] These and other important objects, advantages, and features
      of the invention will become clear as this description proceeds.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The invention accordingly comprises the features of
      construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts
      that will be exemplified in the description set forth hereinafter
      and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.<br>

        <br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0027] The novel electrolyzer is surrounded by a magnetic field
      that may be generated by an electromagnet or a permanent magnet.
      Carefully controlled voltage and amperage reconfigures a water
      molecule into a magnecule, referred to hereinafter as
      hydroxyhydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] More particularly, a current is passed through a conductive
      water solution. The current weakens the bonding strength of the
      water and thus allows the magnetic force provided by the magnetic
      field to reconfigure the water molecule into a highly polar
      magnacule containing atomic oxygen bonded to a diatomic molecule
      of hydrogen. The resulting product is a flammable gas. When lit by
      an ignition source, the hydroxyhydrogen gas implodes and produces
      a very low temperature flame of approximately two hundred seventy
      degrees Fahrenheit (270[deg.] F.).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The total heat energy is approximately equal to the power
      required to create the gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Due to its low temperature, the gas has limited utility as
      a stand alone fuel. However, when the flame is applied to a
      substrate such as iron, the flame temperature increases almost
      immediately to the melting temperature of iron. The same phenomena
      holds true for metals other than iron and substances other than
      metals; the flame temperature rises quickly to the melting
      temperature of the metal or other substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The electronegative value of iron is lower than the
      electronegative value of hydrogen. This causes the highly
      energized hydroxyl molecule to attach itself to the iron and
      release hydrogen. The released hydrogen bonds with atmospheric
      oxygen and thereby creates large amounts of heat. This quality
      makes the gas highly useful in the metal-cutting industry and
      reduces the amount of hydrocarbons used and thus reduces the
      amount of byproducts of hydrocarbons that are released into the
      atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Although the novel gas is not a fuel, when added to the air
      intake of a combustion engine, the novel gas dramatically reduces
      harmful exhaust emissions and increases fuel efficiency. This
      reduces oil consumption. It is a safe, non-toxic oxidizer that
      bonds easily with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring now to FIG. 1, it will there be seen that a water
      molecule is denoted 10 as a whole. As is well-known, it includes
      two (2) hydrogen atoms, collectively denoted 12, and one (1)
      oxygen atom, denoted 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A hydroxyhydrogen magnecule 16 is disclosed in FIG. 2. It
      also includes two (2) hydrogen atoms 12 and one (1) oxygen atom
      14. However, a first hydrogen atom has been released from its bond
      with oxygen atom 14 and has bonded with a second hydrogen atom as
      depicted.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Conventional science maintains that hydrogen can have but
      one (1) bond, as depicted in FIG. 1. It follows that the hydrogen
      atom 12 in FIG. 2 that seems to have two (2) bonds (one with
      oxygen atom 14 and one with another hydrogen atom) cannot exist in
      nature. However, the properties and behavior of the novel gas may
      be explained if the structure depicted in FIG. 2 is correct.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Ionic and covalent bonding could better be described as
      electrostatic and magnetic bonding, respectively. The Lewis dot
      theory of bonding which is taught in all universities is flawed in
      many ways. Lewis himself recognized that nitrogen, which can have
      a valence of 3, 4, or 5, was an exception to the rule. Diatomic
      molecules such as hydrogen are also exceptions. Based on the Lewis
      dot theory, hydrogen can have only one bond. This contradicts
      Gauss's Law which states that there are no monopoles in magnetism,
      i.e., there are only dipoles. Water is proof that Gauss is correct
      since it is well known that liquid water forms hydrogen bonds with
      other water molecules in order to remain in a liquid solution.
      Individual H2O molecules from evaporation or transpiration are a
      gas. Based on the atomic weight of the molecule, water is a gas.
      By applying a small amount of energy in an electrolyzer, we can
      separate the water molecules into a gaseous form and with the
      presence of a magnetic field re-establish the diatomic hydrogen
      bond. The magnetic strength should be approximately twenty (20)
      Gauss units.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The electrolyzer that causes this reconfiguration of a
      water molecule is depicted in FIGS. 3-5. Electrolyzer 20 includes
      inner tank 22 that serves as an electrode and magnetized outer
      tank 24 that serves as an electrode. Spacer basket 26 is
      positioned between said inner and outer tanks. The distance
      between the inner and outer tanks controls the voltage and the
      volume of gas output is determined by the amperage.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Multiple drain holes, collectively denoted 28, are formed
      in the cylindrical sidewalls 30 of inner tank 24, near imperforate
      bottom wall 32 thereof. Drain holes 28 allow electrolyte in inner
      tank 22 to flow into the open space between the inner and outer
      tanks.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Inner tank 22 includes water and electrolyte fill spout 34
      which is insulated from but sealed to outer tank 24 by spacer
      basket 26.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Positive terminal 36 is in electrical communication with
      the positive side of a DC power source 21. Positive terminal 36 is
      attached to inner tank 22 and insulated from outer tank 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Gas outlet 38 is attached to outer tank 24. The open end
      thereof may be attached to a filter, dryer, or storage tank,
      depending upon the application.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Negative terminal 40 is attached to outer tank 24 and the
      negative side of said DC power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Spacer basket 26 is made of a plastic or other material
      suitable as an electrical insulator and sufficiently resistant to
      withstand strong electrolytic solutions such as potassium
      hydroxide. It has open flow through areas as depicted in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Inner tank 22 and outer tank 24 are made of material
      capable of being magnetized.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Outer tank 24 is magnetized by a permanent magnet or an
      electromagnet with sufficient Gauss units to affect inner tank 22.
      In a commercial embodiment, the strength of the magnetic field is
      about twenty (20) Gauss units.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The properties of the novel polarized gas are not limited
      to increase in flame temperature property mentioned above.
      Bubbling the novel polarized flammable gas through distilled water
      results in bonding with many organic and inorganic substances and
      rendering them harmless. Even distilled water, filtered water, and
      reverse osmosis water still contain free radicals and traces of
      bacteria. Lab tests have shown that the water produced by bubbling
      the novel polarized gas through it is more conductive, non-toxic,
      and bacteria free. Controlled studies on plants have shown that it
      makes them healthier and faster-growing. Wounds heal faster on
      mammals cleaned daily with the novel water. People who have
      imbibed the water anecdotally recount the stopping of migraine
      headaches, clearer vision, improved concentration, and other
      improvements such as dissolving vitamins, minerals and nutrients
      faster.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Without regard to what is eaten or what kind of medicine,
      vitamins, or supplements are taken, if the body does not
      metabolize it, it doesn't provide any benefits. Metabolism is the
      sum of all chemical changes that take place in the body. These
      changes are responsible for maintaining health and providing
      energy, but energy is also required to bring about these changes.
      Since water is the liquid the body uses to dissolve and transport
      foods, vitamins, nutrients, and medicines, it is essential to
      energize this vital fluid in order for the body to function
      properly and to heal itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] When water evaporates from the earth, it rises through a
      powerful magnetic field that induces a charge. Lightning is the
      discharge of this stored energy. As rain drops fall back to earth,
      a small amount of energy is also induced which cleans the air,
      neutralizes pollution, and has enough energy left over to make
      lawns greener, healthier, and grow three (3) times faster than
      they would grow with ordinary water. Even the slightest
      polarization of water, as evidenced by rain, is extremely
      beneficial in nature. In order to control the degree of
      polarization, the polarized gas is made from water as disclosed
      above and then bubbled through a quantity of distilled water as
      aforesaid.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The novel gas produced by the novel electrolyzer thus
      enables the production of a novel water having numerous
      therapeutic effects. The novel gas has many other applications as
      well, such as the enabling of more efficient combustion of fuels,
      and so on, all of which are inherent and thus within the scope of
      this invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, and
      those made apparent from the foregoing description, are
      efficiently attained. Since certain changes may be made in the
      above construction without departing from the scope of the
      invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the
      foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall
      be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] It is also to be understood that the following claims are
      intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the
      invention herein described, and all statements of the scope of the
      invention that, as a matter of language, might be said to fall

      [0003] This invention relates to the generation of a purified

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Electrolysis of water is known to produce hydrogen gas (H2)
      at the cathode and oxygen gas (O2) at the anode. Due to the high
      heat of the chambers, water vapor also resulted from this process.
      If the hydrogen gas and oxygen gas were not effectively separated,
      such methods resulted in an impure gaseous product that could not
      be effectively compressed or stored under pressure for industrial
      applications in a single container and was deemed explosive and
      dangerous. Thus, it remained desirable to develop a method by
      which a useful, stable, purified, compressible single gas could be
      formed from water or an aqueous fluid.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] A method for generating a gas having desirable properties
      is herein disclosed. In addition, methodology for purifying said
      gas is disclosed. Applicants refer to this gas as “SG Gas.”<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Applicant hereby incorporates U.S. Ser. No. 11/738,476
      filed on Apr. 21, 2007; U.S. Ser. No. 12/596,077 filed Mar. 17,
      2010 by reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In a first step of the method, an aqueous fluid is provided
      to a reaction zone. While varous aqueous fluids, such as distilled
      water, tap water, or water taken from a river, stream, lake or the
      like may be used to generate electrical current at satisfactory
      levels, it is preferred to use an electrolyte solution for the
      aqueous fluid of standardized composition so that the conditions
      of the method can be better standardized for maximum yield of gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The aqueous fluid is provided to a reaction zone which is
      preferably closed off so to allow the reaction to occur under
      pressure. An alkali salt is preferably used as an electrolyte
      dissolved in distilled water. Preferred alkali salts are potassium
      hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. The specific
      gravity of the alkali salt in the solution is above 1.0. Most
      preferably, potassium hydroxide is employed at a specific gravity
      from at least above 1.0 up to about 1.2. If another electrolyte is
      chosen other than potassium hydroxide a mole ratio must be
      calculated for that substance so that the maximum mole ratio
      represented by the specific gravity of 1.2 provided for potassium
      hydroxide will not be exceeded. These specific gravity values are
      as determined by a refractometer which provides readings that are
      temperature compensated. Most preferably, the electrolyte employed
      is potassium hydroxide (powder form) dissolved in distilled water
      at a concentration sufficient to form a solution having up to 1.2
      specific gravity. A suitable refractometer is the Westover Model
      RHA-100, portable refractometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Aqueous fluid is contained in a receptacle which can be
      made out of a variety of materials including sheet steel,
      stainless steel, CV-PVC and epoxy resin fiberglass. The apparatus
      and internal devices need to be heat resistant and waterproof. The
      reaction zone is comprised of said aqueous fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The aqueous fluid is placed in a reaction zone in the
      method of the invention. Overall, the method employs creation of a
      magnetic field in the aqueous fluid and periodic collapse of the
      magnetic field under conditions which do not provoke electrolysis
      of the aqueous fluid. Under these conditions, a single gas is
      generated and collected. This gas has desirable properties and is
      useful for applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In a first step of the method, a magnetic field is applied
      to the reaction zone. Preferably, the magnetic field is applied by
      providing a source of electric power to said reaction zone. An
      electric current in said reaction zone provides a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In a preferred embodiment, two metallic end plates having
      an inside surface and an outside surface, and having the capacity
      to conduct an electrical current are used in the reaction zone in
      opposing configuration. The inside of each end plate is partially
      submerged in the electrolyte solution. The metallic plates are
      preferably comprised of nickel alloy or stainless steel, but any
      metal can be used as long as such metal has the capacity to
      conduct an electric current and is preferably resistant to erosion
      by alkali solutions. One of said metallic plates serves as a
      cathode and the other as an anode. The cathode and anode should be
      separated a sufficient distance so that a magnetic field forms
      when current is applied to the reaction zone. The distance between
      the plates must be greater than one inch (2.5 cm) in the method of
      the invention and is preferably eight to sixteen inches apart.
      This distance is independent of the volume of the aqueous fluid
      employed or size of the reaction zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] There is a relationship between the concentration of
      electrolyte solution and the amperage which will exist in the
      aqueous fluid upon application of current thereto. The higher the
      specific gravity, the greater the amperage will result. This will
      also affect the strength of the magnetic field, and increase the
      temperature of the solution. Electrolysis (used industrially to
      produce hydrogen gas via the reaction 2H2O(l)?2H2(g)+O2(g)) which
      is not desired in the method of the invention, could occur if the
      current is too high. The current may be too high if the specific
      gravity of the electrolyte exceeds the equivalent of 1.2 for
      potassium hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In order for the magnetic field to be applied to the
      reaction zone, a power source (e.g., 110 volts DC) is applied
      respectively to the anode and to the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] An appropriate power source that may be used in the method
      of the invention is 110 volt alternating current which has been
      converted to direct current using a rectifying process (e.g., a
      diode bridge device). Any standard power or voltage source may be
      used as long as it is rectified to direct current. When an
      electric current is applied to the reaction zone, a magnetic field
      is created in the reaction zone, which periodically collapses and
      causes the conversion of the water in the aqueous fluid into gas.
      Cyclic pulsation will be present in current even after alternating
      current is converted to direct current (for example a 60 cycle
      pulsation from household current) unless a smoothing circuit has
      been incorporated. This resulting cyclic pulsation is employable
      in the invention to periodically collapse the magnetic field,
      however using an auxiliary pulsing unit is preferably used in the
      method of the invention so that better regulation of pulsing may
      be employed. Any means for causing the electric current provided
      to the reaction zone to pulse at a frequency of 15 to 20 kilohertz
      decreases the wattage needed to create gas by approximately a
      factor of 10. The amount of energy needed to generate one (1)
      liter of gas is 0.0028 kilowatt-hour and with a pulsing device
      associated with the reaction zone, the amount drops to 0.00028
      kilowatt-hour or less to generate one (1) liter of gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] As the pulsing occurs, the stationary magnetic field
      alternatively collapses and is reinstated. It has been found that
      a reaction occurs in the electrolyte solution between the two end
      plates upon collapse of the magnetic field, which results in a
      release of a generated gas. Some of the same gas will be pulled
      toward the individual plates and released as part of the generated
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In a pilot plant apparatus for determining optimal
      conditions, a clear Plexiglas receptacle can be used for the
      reaction zone, so that one can visibly monitor the reaction with
      ultraviolet light and observe the generation of gas. This pilot
      plant preferably provides adjustment means for the cathode and
      anode so that they can be moved to optimize the reaction for a
      given aqueous fluid composition and changes in pulsing duration
      and frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Gas is generated not only at the electrodes but also
      appears as bubbles in the body of water between the electrodes. It
      has been found that use of minimal electric currents between two
      electrodes results from the electrodes being spread a sufficient
      distance apart of at least one inch (2.5 cm) and preferably eight
      to sixteen inches apart, thereby creating the aforesaid magnetic
      field enveloping the reaction chamber. A pure gas is produced in
      the body of aqueous fluid between the electrodes, without the
      production of a high levels of heat that would cause the water to
      vaporize (212° F.). Rather, the reaction zone remains at a
      temperature not exceeding 120° F. dependent on ambient
      temperature. Normally, there is a 30° F. temperature rise above
      ambient temperature assuming room temperature 90° F. The
      collection chambers contain no increase in oxygen gas, no increase
      in hydrogen gas, and no noticeable water vapor. Thus, costs are
      lowered, production speed increases, and the resulting gas is
      uniform in its properties. Also important, the resulting
      homogeneous gas can be pumped into a stainless steel cylinder and
      has been found to be stable and not explosive under pressures of
      over 1000 lb.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The important functionalities in the process are imposition
      of a magnetic field on the aqueous fluid and the ability to
      periodically collapse the magnetic field to generate the desired
      gas, under conditions short of those that will induce
      electrolysis. Other means which provide for these functionalities
      can be used. For example, in an alternative embodiment, wires
      could be inserted instead of plates in the reaction zone and when
      current passes from one wire through the aqueous fluid to the
      other wire, a magnetic field would be produced. In another
      exemplary alternative, a wire coil outside the reaction zone could
      be used to which a source of DC power can be supplied to create a
      primary magnetic field in the reaction zone. A wire coil placed in
      the middle of the solution can serve as a secondary magnetic field
      and when powered in the opposite direction of the current flow in
      pulses would collapse the primary field and create the necessary
      reaction to form the gas. Such a coil would be similar in concept
      to an automobile coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] When water is converted into gas, the natural conversion
      from liquid to gas creates an increase in volume and thus an
      increase in pressure within the reaction zone. While standard
      atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi at sea level, the pressure
      in the closed reaction zone is maintained between 30 and 100 psi
      by using a check valve at the outlet of the reaction chamber to
      control it, since maximum gas production occurs in this pressure
      range.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Now referring to FIG. 1, a schematic of a reaction chamber
      is illustrated. Cathode (1) and anode (2) are in opposing
      configuration, preferably more than one inch apart and most
      preferably eight to sixteen inches apart. In the process of the
      invention, a current is passed through an aqueous fluid (3) and
      the current flow through the electrolyte creates a magnetic field.
      The electricity is pulsed, which collapses the magnetic field with
      each pulse of electricity. This produces the gas at a very
      efficient rate in the area of the solution between the electrodes,
      as denoted by (4) in FIG. 1. The gas produced may be collected
      from the reaction zone through gas outlet (5) and subjected to
      further purification as taught herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The generated gas is then preferably exposed to a second
      magnetic field by providing a second reaction zone comprising of
      rare earth magnets. The strength of the rare earth magnets should
      be greater than fifty (50) Gauss units. Gas flows through a
      chamber exposed to rare earth magnets for purification. Rare earth
      magnets, dense metal magnets typically made from a composite of
      neodymium, iron and boron with or without a nickel coating or
      plating, are attached to the exterior of the chamber. Since SG Gas
      is paramagnetic and water vapor is diamagnetic the magnetic
      chamber strengthens the molecular bond of the gas and repels the
      water vapor back into the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The purified SG Gas may be used immediately or compressed
      and stored in a gas storage tank. Purified SG Gas may be allowed
      to flow out of said second reaction zone directly to a torch
      attachment, to a compressor for storage in a pressurized vessel,
      or gas outflow valve for infusion into water or other substances.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In a method for making a compressible, stable gas with
      desirable properties, SG Gas is made according to the method of
      the invention. SG Gas can then be safely compressed and stored. SG
      Gas can be compressed above 1,000 psi. SG Gas also can be stored
      in a pressurized vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In an exemplary procedure for compression, SG Gas is
      discharged from the apparatus into a hose with a compressor
      attached. We use a Whirlwind Compressor, Model 2200-2 HPE,
      manufactured by High Pressure Eng. Co., Inc. A canister with
      pressure gauges is used to fill the chamber with SG Gas, using a
      hose to transport the SG Gas from the apparatus and compressor
      into the canister. We use an empty oxygen tank that has been
      vacuumed to remove any residual oxygen and water. The empty and
      vacuumed oxygen tank with pressure valve has a manufacturer name
      of White Martins, ABRE with dimensions of 23? diameter and 19?
      height. SG Gas is placed under pressure in the compression chamber
      up to and beyond 1,000 psi. for storage of SG Gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] SG Gas remains stable and under pressure for one month and
      longer. To test its stability, wood chips were placed in a
      stainless steel tank and the tank filled with SG Gas. The wood
      chips absorbed SG Gas and additional SG Gas was used to refill the
      chamber and maintain a 30 psi. Once the wood chips were saturated
      with SG Gas, the tank was decompressed and pressure reduced to 0
      psi. For a period of over 30 days, no pressure was generated
      assuming that no out gassing of SG Gas occurred. The wood chips
      displayed different burn properties after 60 days when compared to
      that of the non-treated wood chips. The treated wood chips with
      absorbed SG Gas burned more efficiently when compared to that of
      non-treated wood chips thereby demonstrating the stability of the
      SG Gas bond with the treated wood chips.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Analytical Testing and Observations of SG Gas Under
      Pressure Maximum Pressure: SG Gas imploded when pressures exceeded
      1,600 psi. Safe Pressurization: SG Gas remains safe and stable at
      pressures around 1,000 psi for over 30 days. SG Gas should remain
      stable under pressure indefinitely, at least for a sufficient
      period of time to allow said gas to be utilized at time 30-60 days
      after generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The purified SG Gas was tested and exhibited properties of
      a pure, homogeneous gas that was found to be compressible as
      stated above, safe, also able to oxidize any non-oxidized
      substrate its flame contacts and able to reduce any completely
      oxidized substrate its flame contacts. The following
      characteristics were observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] <b>Ultra-violet Light Test</b>: Exhibits a blue gray color
      appearance compared to untreated distilled water which exhibits no
      color, when exposed to an ultra-violet light, manufactured by
      Zelco Industries Model 10015.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] <b>Balloon</b>: Is lighter than air and causes balloons
      filled therewith to rise.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] <b>Cooling</b>: The Balloon Filled with Purified Gas:
      Balloon remains inflated at or below -10° F.<br>
      <br>
      [0036]<b> Ignition</b>: The purified SG Gas produced according to
      the above method was tested for ignition properties. The
      temperature of the flame produced upon ignition was estimated to
      be about 270° F. using an infrared temperature device (Raynger
      ST2L infrared temperature device). The purified gas, when lit with
      an ignition source such as a spark, causes an implosion. When
      materials are exposed to the flame, which creates a chemical
      reaction with the material, base metals will rapidly rise to melt
      temperature points, releasing heat and converting the gas back
      into water (H2O).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Purified SG Gas was discharged from the reaction zone
      through a hose with a torch attached. On the gas output of the
      apparatus, a flash-back arrestor is recommended. The gas may be
      exposed to an ignition source (e.g., spark or electrical arc) thus
      combustion of the gas occurs. The heat of the resulting flame on
      the subject torch has a temperature of approximately 270° F.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] When an air/propane torch is burning, a small amount of SG
      Gas is introduced into the air mixing chamber of a lit propane
      torch, a single uniform flame cone becomes visible demonstrating a
      more efficient conversion of hydrocarbon and more heat from
      combustion of hydrocarbon, meaning it has a use as a fuel
      extender. One use is injection of SG Gas into an air intake of a
      combustion engine thereby reducing harmful exhaust emissions and
      increasing fuel efficiency. A by-product of this process is the
      creation of water during the combustion cycle that generates
      steam. The steam causes an increase in the torque generated by the
      engine resulting in greater power output. Depending upon the type
      of fuel, SG Gas extends fuel efficiency by a factor between 2 and
      10.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] When ignited purified gas contacts another substance,
      melting occurs within a short period of time, usually less than
      one minute. The results of some examples of substances exposed to
      ignited purified SG Gas may be found in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0040] In lieu of melting a substrate, ignited purified gas may be
      applied to a substrate with a view toward capturing the generated
      heat as a useful product. The heat generated can be transferred to
      a fluid such as air or water, thereby producing hot air or steam
      that can then be used industrially, such as for example to drive a
      turbine or piston-type engine for production of mechanical energy.
      In a preferred method, the flame of the SG gas can be applied to a
      substrate in conduit form having an inside surface and an outside
      surface. A fluid such as air or water can flow thorough the
      conduit adjacent the inside surface of the conduit. The flame of
      the SG gas can be applied to the outside surface of the conduit
      which causes the heat-generating reaction to occur. The heat is
      then transferred to the fluid flowing through the conduit,
      preventing melting of the surface but creating a useful heated
      fluid that can be used in further applications. An exemplary
      conduit is a metal tube or pipe, such as copper tubing. It has
      been further determined that SG Gas can be infused into other
      substances, rendering a useful product.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Candles: SG Gas infused into melted paraffin wax and poured
      into a mold with a wick will create candles that burn with lower
      carbon emission as observed using a Pace 400 Four Gas Analyzer.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Fluids: The gas had an affinity for water and other liquids
      including fuels but bubbled from the liquids after reaching a
      saturation point. One novel use of the gas is infusing it back
      into water to create ionized or polarized water. The resulting
      gas-infused water creates smaller water clusters that are believed
      to permit faster cellular absorption and hydration.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an exemplary method for infusing SG Gas into water, SG
      Gas is discharged from the reaction zone into a hose with a
      ceramic diffuser attached. For treating large volumes of water, a
      ceramic block diffuser may be used. The diffusers are used to
      reduce the size of the SG Gas bubbles to improve efficiency of
      water absorption. SG Gas may also be stored under pressure, then
      infused into water.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It is preferred to infuse water that has gone through a
      distillation process prior to infusion of SG Gas into treated
      water with less than 1 ppm TDS (Total Dissolved Solids). One may
      use an absorption graph to determine time required for achieving
      desired absorption of SG Gas into water. The typical rate of 30%
      absorption is approximately one hour to treat 100 gallons of
      water. A higher saturation of SG Gas up to 100% of total
      absorption occurs with more infusion of SG Gas into water over
      time. The actual time and percentage of absorption of SG Gas are
      affected by the purity of water, volume of water, size of gas
      bubbles, temperature and other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The resulting ionized or polarized water (“SG Gas-infused
      Water”) clings longer to a magnet when compared to that of regular
      water. Absorption over time or saturation graphs to monitor
      changes in the water properties infused with SG Gas including
      capacitance levels may be prepared. FIG. 7 shows a typical
      absorption over time graph for infusion of SG Gas into water.
      Subsequently, one may measure capacitance levels in the treated
      water over a time period exceeding 30 days to demonstrate that the
      gas in water is stable. Other measurement: Total Dissolved Solids
      (TDS) dropped from a start of 0.33 ppm in untreated distilled
      water to a finish of 0.17 ppm after infusion of SG Gas into
      distilled water for a period of approximately 11 minutes. A Fluke
      189 True RMS Multimeter was used to measure drop in capacitance<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Storage of SG Gas in Water: The resulting polarized water
      with SG Gas treatment remains stable and can be stored for 2 years
      or more. The actual maximum storage time has yet to be observed
      but in theory, SG Gas should remain permanently stable in the
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Absorption: During infusion of SG Gas into purified water,
      we used a Fluke 189 True RMS Multimeter to measure drop in
      capacitance. The absorption over time graph is plotted to monitor
      the drop in capacitance. The first capacitance drop during initial
      infusion of SG Gas into a gallon of purified water occurs within
      the first three minutes of infusion. After that time, the
      capacitance gradually drops until the point of maximum saturation
      of SG Gas is typically reached between eight and 20 minutes
      depending on variables including initial purity of water, size of
      gas bubbles, and volume of water to be treated. The resulting
      treated or infused water is referred herein as “SG Gas-infused
      Water” herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Other Parameters Monitored: During infusion of SG Gas into
      purified water, a drop in TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
      concentration, conductivity and resistively can be measured. An
      appropriate measuring device is a Control Company Traceable™
      #4063CC meter.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] pH Test: Lab tests show that distilled water had a pH of
      6.8 and when infused with SG Gas had a pH change to 7.6.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Ice Cubes: SG Gas remains in SG Gas-infused Water or
      polarized water until freezing temperatures when the SG Gas forms
      a gas bubble within the ice cube itself, sometimes producing on
      the surface of the ice cubes, capillary tubes where the SG Gas
      escapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Ultraviolet Light Exposure: SG Gas-infused Water was tested
      for the effects of ultraviolet light exposure. A clear spray
      bottle containing SG Gas-infused Water or polarized water placed
      in the Florida sun for over two years remained clear in appearance
      and without algae growth which had been observed in water not
      infused with SG Gas under similar conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Magnets: A drop of SG Gas-infused Waterclings to the
      surface of a magnet longer when compared to that of untreated
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Many uses have been found for SG Gas-infused Water. Table 2
      lists some of these uses.<br>

      additives.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Use in Process of Tar Sands Extraction: Conventional water
      with petroleum solvents used in the separation of tar from sand
      was replaced with SG Gas-infused Water. SG Gas-infused Water was
      heated (no petroleum solvent added) with a sample of tar sands in
      a pan to approximately 160° F. Tar was observed separating from
      the sand, providing a cleaner and more efficient process with less
      by-products and emissions released from tar extraction.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Use for Improved Cleaning: For laundry, one may add a
      quantity (1/3 of a gallon in a standard washing machine tub of 12
      gallons for medium load and 16 gallons for large load) of SG
      Gas-infused Water to the soap cycle of a top loading washing
      machine and the remaining water (approximately 2/3 of a gallon) is
      added to the rinse cycle. The polarized characteristic and smaller
      molecular size of SG Gas-infused Water enable the detergent and
      water solution to more thoroughly penetrate the cloth fabric and
      remove the dirt and grime. The addition of SG Gas-infused Water to
      the rinse assists in completely removing the soap residue that may
      contain residual dirt from the fabric. This process results in
      cleaner and stain-free laundry with less body oil and bacteria
      buildup. Laundry without these SG Gas-infused Water additives
      display less brilliant whites and retain a pungent odor caused by
      residual bacteria living in the fabric of the washed clothes.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Reduced Use of Emulsifiers and Surfactants: One may dilute
      cleaning solutions with SG Gas-infused Water for effective
      cleaning of surfaces to remove grime, oil and grease and removal
      of bacteria. SG Gas-infused Water is a natural disinfectant
      without harsh chemical additives. Typically, one uses at least 1
      part cleaning solution with 20 parts SG Gas-infused Water to
      maintain cleaning properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biological Properties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] <b>Transport, Delivery and Absorption of Nutrients</b>: In
      a controlled experiment, a standard drug metabolism test in vitro
      was conducted over a period of 21 days. This comparative test was
      performed on cell membrane permeability for Vitamin C solution
      (L-ascorbic acid) using (1) Hank's Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS)
      and (2) SG Gas-infused Water. Caco-2 cells were used and
      permeability of the apical side (similar to intestine surface) and
      basolateral side (similar to underneath intestinal surface) for
      the separate solutions were determined. Vitamin C quantitiation
      was conducted on HPLC (HP1100 equipped with PDA detector) and
      Zorbax C18 reverse phase column (4.6×250 mm, 5 micro) at 30 C.
      Test results demonstrated Vitamin C permeability of SG Gas-infused
      Water was about 4 times higher than the control counterpart. (Hu,
      2008 (unpublished communication).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] <b>Plant Growth:</b> In a controlled greenhouse setting,
      four groups of ivy plants were watered using (1) 100% well water,
      (2) mix of 1/3 mix SG Gas-infused Water and 2/3 well water, (3)
      mix of 2/3 SG Gas-infused Water and 1/3 well water, and (4) 100%
      SG Gas-infused Water. The ivy plants were harvested and dehydrated
      to allow measurement of dry plant mass. The fourth group of 100%
      SG Gas-infused Water had over 16 percent increase in mass when
      compared to that the first group of well water. (Reiser, 2006
      (private communication).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] <b>Fish Growth:</b> Two home aquariums were used to hold
      two respective groups of goldfish. SG Gas was bubbled into one
      aquarium and the second with air for a period of thirty days. It
      was observed that the goldfish in the former aquarium aerated by
      SG Gas grew at least 15 percent more and the aquarium tank
      remained cleaner with less algae growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] <b>Wound Treatment and Healing:</b> The polarization of
      the SG Gas-infused Water provides natural anti-bacterial and
      non-toxic anti-infective properties that promote healing of
      superficial and multi-layer wounds and a reduction in pain
      perception. A fifty-year old woman burned herself by accidentally
      spilling scalding-hot coffee onto her hand. Upon seeking medical
      attention, a physician advised the patient that she may have to
      undergo abridement or dead skin removal and possible skin graft
      surgery. The patient washed the affected area with SG Gas-infused,
      purified water and applied a medicinal ointment. The wound was
      wrapped with a sterile gauze and the gauze was moistened to keep
      the wound hydrated with SG Gas-infused Water. The patient reported
      an immediate and on-going lessening of pain with the application
      of SG Gas-infused Water. Over the period of ten days with
      repeating these treatment steps involving changing of the
      moistened sterile gauze on at least a daily basis, the site of the
      wound developed new skin with minimal evidence of scaring.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Upon cessation of the treatment regime when the upper skin
      layer appeared to be healed, blisters appeared on the surface of
      the skin. The treatment with SG Gas-infused Water was reinitiated
      and the blisters healed as well as the remaining layers of skin.
      The patient experienced healing and thereby avoided debridement of
      dead skin, and skin grafts. Skin Treatment: Topical applications
      twice a day on each side of a male volunteer's face in vicinity of
      his eyes were made. Two types of topical solutions were prepared
      with 1% magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP), one using SG
      Gas-infused Water and the other using tap water. After 21 days,
      the volunteer observed on the side where SG Gas-infused Water
      solution was applied, a slight reduction in the depth of fine
      lines around the eye and a lighting of darker skin pigment when
      compared to that of the other area where the tap water solution
      was applied. (Puleo of Otima Specialty Chemical, 2008 (private
      communication).<br>
      <br>
      [0062]<b> Eye Relief</b>: SG Gas-infused Water may be sprayed into
      the eyes for immediate relief and lessening of redness that is
      comparable to use of over-the-counter eye drops. This natural
      treatment without any chemical additives, assists in hydrating
      eyes and removing irritants such as dust and pollen.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] <b>Dental Care:</b> A 50:50 solution of commercial mouth
      wash was mixed with SG Gas-infused Water and a capful of this
      solution was used twice a day after brushing teeth. Less plaque
      buildup and stains were noted by professional dental hygienists as
      compared to previous observations six months earlier when this
      solution had not been used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Molecular Structure Based on Gas Properties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] It is believed by the inventors from observing the
      properties of SG Gas that the process disclosed herein results in
      a product not achieved by heretofore-reported processes for the
      electrolysis of water into gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Given the low energy reaction that created the gas and the
      use of no catalysts, it is believed unlikely that any O—H bonds of
      water could possibly be broken in the process used. It is known
      that breaking O—H bonds requires two faradays per mole and the
      process of the invention only employs 2.8 watt hours per liter,
      which is about a maximum of 1.6 faradays per mole. Further, the SG
      Gas resulting from the process disclosed herein is flammable but
      the flame temperature of the gas is only about 270° F. (132.2°
      C.), as compared to diatomic hydrogen gas which is highly
      combustable and autoignites at 560° C. A hydrogen/oxygen torch
      flame is reportedly 3200° C.=5792° F. However, the SG Gas flame
      easily melts metals, which likely indicates that an oxygen is
      active. The gas flame also reduces ceramics, which indicates that
      the hydrogen is in an ionized state.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] SG Gas has an affinity for water and other liquids
      including fuels but bubbles from the liquids after reaching a
      saturation point. One use of the gas disclosed herein is infusing
      it back into water to create ionized or polarized water.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] SG Gas is always a gas at room temperature while normal
      water vapor requires energy to evaporate in great quantities. When
      combusted, the gas always returns to liquid water. When placed in
      a balloon, the gas initially floats the balloon but it seeps from
      the balloon rather quickly indicating that the gas has a small
      molecular structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] One theory consistent with the properties heretofore
      observed on SG Gas is that no bonds of H2O are broken when the
      process of the invention is used, but that the combination of the
      electric and magnetic forces restructure the water molecule.
      Gauss' Law that states there are no monopoles in magnetism, only
      dipoles. It is well known that liquid water forms hydrogen bonds
      with other water molecules in order to remain in a liquid
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Applying Gauss' Law to hydrogen, it has polar properties
      that opens up a new configuration, one in which a hydrogen can be
      bound to another hydrogen and an oxygen. Upon exposure to an
      electric current, the electronegative strength of the oxygen atom
      is weakened, allowing a hydrogen atom to dislodge and magnetically
      bond to the other hydrogen atom that is strengthened by the
      magnetic field. Hence, the electric and magnetic forces made
      possible a shift of a hydrogen from H—O—H to O—H—H creating a
      diatomic hydrogen molecule that is single bonded to atomic oxygen.
      As the exposed oxygen is a reactive site on the gas molecule an
      appropriate name is “hydroxyhydrogen”. This structure predicts
      that the oxygen is now active and can oxidize metals. It predicts
      that in the unburned gaseous state, the increased negative charge
      causes greater spacing among the gas molecules causing stability,
      a lower boiling point, a lower freezing point, and a higher vapor
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The inventors have conceived of a new isomer of water—it
      contains the same atoms, only in a different configuration and
      thus exhibits different properties from normal water vapor. The
      gas does not cluster to create liquid water at regular atmospheric
      temperatures and pressures as does the molecules of normal water
      vapor. The gas exists in a higher energy state, burns by itself at
      a low temperature, and melts any substrates when exposed to the
      gas flame. The gas flame has a uniform blue color appearance
      without yellow sparks indicative of water (H2O) vapor or red
      sparks indicative of either H2 or O2 gas contamination. Hence, we
      call the resulting gas (SG Gas) an ionized gas or a plasma gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Now referring to FIGS. 2-5, atoms shown are shown in their
      polar orientation for better understanding N meaning North Pole
      and S meaning South Pole. This dictates the orbital spin or
      magnetic flux. FIG. 2 illustrates water prior to undergoing the
      process of the invention. FIG. 3 illustrates the process and the
      believed effect on the aqueous fluid used. FIG. 4 illustrates the
      orientation of the molecule after the process which is consistent
      with the observations. FIG. 5 illustrates the water clusters as
      they would exist after the process of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] While the magnetic field orients the atoms within the water
      molecule, the collapsing field induces a charge in the opposite
      direction that dislodges the opposing hydrogen bond and allows it
      to bond to the other hydrogen atom in the ortho position as
      depicted in FIG. 5. Ortho-hydrogen is more reactive than
      para-hydrogen and produces much more energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] This reaction changes water from a liquid cluster to an
      ionized gas or plasma gas that will, when ignited, and the flame
      applied to a solid substrate, melt nearly any substance. Further,
      when the gas is infused into a water cluster it will bond to the
      water molecules and create a much smaller cluster of a different
      shape and properties allowing it to penetrate cells and hydrate
      animals and plants at a substantially faster rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] It must be clear that due to the process used herein,
      electrolysis does not take place. “Electrolysis” is defined as a
      “method of separating chemically bonded elements and compounds by
      passing an electric current through them.” Electrolysis does not
      take place and no splitting of the water molecular bonds occurs,
      as is demonstrated by the fact that no increase in hydrogen or
      oxygen gas can be measured in the reaction zone. This is a key
      differentiator from the processes that have resulted in a gas
      being produced by electrolysis of water. The gases produced by
      electrolysis exhibit far different properties from SG Gas. Gases
      produced by electrolysis are explosive, cannot be pressurized and
      are heat-producing gases on ignition.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] SG Gas is herein disclosed to be an ionized gas with the
      potential to oxidize or reduce any substance. On a non:oxidized
      substrate, such as steel, the active oxygen within the molecule
      will chemically bond to the steel bringing it immediately to its
      melting temperature and releasing hydrogen, which bonds with
      atmospheric oxygen to produce heat. On an oxidized substrate, such
      as ceramic, the hydrogen reduces the substrate by chemically
      bonding with the oxygen present within the substrate, melting the
      material and releasing atomic oxygen, which then bonds with the
      material. This double reaction is responsible for producing much
      more heat than an ordinary oxidation reduction reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] These reactions are proven on rusty steel and concrete.
      When ordinary gas, such as: methane, ethane, propane, butane, or
      acetylene are applied to rusty steel popping and spitting of
      material occurs due to the explosive reaction of the ferrous oxide
      being separated from the non-oxidized metal due to different
      expansion rates. With SG Gas, this does not occur, since oxidation
      and reduction are occurring at the same time and the expansion
      rates are equal. On concrete when heat from an ordinary gas is
      applied, the portion the flame touches will expand and break loose
      from the rest of the concrete with an explosive force and spit
      pieces of hot concrete outward and leave holes in the concrete.
      Again, this does not occur with SG Gas&nbsp;&nbsp; because it is
      being reduced to a liquid form before the pressure of uneven
      expansion occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Simply stated SG Gas is an ionized gas capable of oxidizing
      or reducing almost any material without the adverse reactions
      created by heat producing flames. Heat is the byproduct of
      friction, in chemistry two atoms colliding together in a reaction
      known as oxidation and reduction cause this friction. A gas,
      referred to as a fuel, is usually a hydrocarbon that is easily
      oxidized, however, the carbon is what is being oxidized and the
      oxygen is being reduced meaning this is where friction occurs and
      these are the items being heated. Heat given off by these
      substances is refractive heat and the substances being heated are
      absorbing heat or, better stated, are being bombarded by fast
      moving hot gases. SG Gas may change the definition of melting
      point due to the lack of heat producing flames.<br>
