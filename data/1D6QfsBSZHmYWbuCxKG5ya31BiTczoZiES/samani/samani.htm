          Professor Patents Liquid Organic Fertilizer<br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      LAS CRUCES (krwg) - Even in the harsh region of central Asia,
      necessity is the mother of invention. It was the needs of farmers
      in the rugged, impoverished area that inspired a New Mexico State
      University professor to develop an easily transportable,
      easy-to-apply fertilizer that could lead to long-term gains for
      growers the world over.<br>
      <br>
      Zohrab Samani, a professor in the NMSU College of Engineering's
      civil engineering department, developed a concept for liquid
      fertilizer while doing volunteer work in 2000 in the Republic of
      Tajikistan.<br>
      <br>
      "This was just after the civil war in that country, and I was
      quite distressed with the situation of the farmers who could not
      afford to buy synthetic fertilizer for their small vegetable
      plots," Samani said. "It occurred to me that the waste from the
      large vegetable market in the nearby town of Dushanbe could be
      used to generate fertilizer."<br>
      <br>
      Inspired, Samani developed a rudimentary accelerated bio-leaching
      schematic, wherein vegetable waste could be placed in a sealed
      batch and bacteria-laden leachate was used to hydrolyze and break
      down the organics into a liquid solution. The idea was to be able
      to add the solution into irrigation water.<br>
      <br>
      Returning to Las Cruces, Samani went to work in a university lab,
      developing a liquid fertilizer from grass clippings. He applied
      the leachate to one of four tomato plants that he was growing at
      home, and he noticed a sudden surge in the growth of that
      particular plant.<br>
      <br>
      In 2001, Samani presented his research and findings, along with a
      proposal, to Abbas Ghassemi, the director of NMSU's Waste
      Management, Education and Research Consortium, a consortium for
      environmental education and technology development. Ghassemi
      offered Samani a mini-grant and Samani used it to help fund
      additional testing with a column and a recirculation pump, using
      grass clippings from the NMSU golf course.<br>
      <br>
      During the same time, Samani got together with Marco Huez, a
      friend who was working towards his doctorate in the College of
      Agriculture, Consumer and Environmental Sciences. Huez, studying
      interactions of salinity and organics in chile, began using the
      liquid fertilizer on green chile being grown in an NMSU
      greenhouse. The results were astounding, as the liquid-fertilized
      chiles were measurably larger and more abundant than those in the
      control group 23 percent higher than previous yields. The organic
      makeup of the liquid fertilizer had a positive effect on the
      plants by countering the soil salinity.<br>
      <br>
      "The experiment in the greenhouse showed that the liquid organic
      fertilizer could increase the yield of green chile, especially in
      saline soil," Samani said. "It clearly showed that the fertilizer
      could increase the chile yield under all conditions, and the
      results were especially pronounced in soil with a high salinity."<br>
      <br>
      Samani and his students kept working, and they developed ways to
      concentrate the mixture, via cooking it in an oven and through
      solarization, accomplished by placing the fertilizer in a
      container, covering it with vented, clear plastic and leaving it
      in the sun for a few days. Concentrated, the fertilizer's makeup
      is nutrient-rich liquid, at 6.35 percent nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The concoction is convenient, because it can be mixed into drip
      irrigation systems without plugging the drip tapes. It also is an
      economical alternative for organic farmers. Fish fertilizer, for
      example, can cost as much as $7,000 an acre for organic vegetable
      crops. Using an alfalfa-based liquid organic fertilizer, since
      alfalfa is grown organically without synthetic chemicals and is
      readily available, can reduce the cost to $300 an acre. It also
      can be applied multiple times to one field over one growing
      season.<br>
      <br>
      Samani and NMSU recently received a patent for the liquid
      fertilizer and the method used to produce it. He is currently
      experimenting with ways to temporarily solidify the liquid to make
      transporting it easier.<br>

      The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for the
      production of organic liquid fertilizer from waste using a
      two-phase process. The first phase comprises a successive
      extraction process whereby liquid leachate is drained from one
      plant or storage container and the process subsequently re-started
      with new fresh water. The second phase comprises an accelerated
      bio-leaching process wherein plant material is stored in a solid
      bed similar to a batch process, and a leachate (e.g., water and
      bacteria) is re-circulated through the solid bed until the process
      of hydrolysis and acidification results in dissolution of organic
      material into the re-circulating leachate. The leachate is thus
      concentrated without losing the nutrient and is subsequently used
      as an organic fertilizer.<br>

      Organic farming was one of the fastest growing segments of U.S.
      agriculture during the 1990's (USDA-ERS 2002). U.S. sales of
      organic food products grew 20-25% annually during the past decade
      reaching $7 billion in 2000 (USDA-2002). Traditionally, organic
      farming has relied on composted organic material or rotation crops
      as sources of plant nutrients.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention comprises generating liquid fertilizer that
      can be applied through irrigation systems. Liquid fertilizer has
      several potential advantages compared to traditional composting
      methods. For example, liquid fertilizer is a clean plant-based
      fertilizer and does not have the typical problems of weed seeds,
      pathogens, or high sodium content. Also, liquid fertilizer is
      dissolved in water and is easily available for plant uptake
      contrary to composted material where only a fraction of the
      nutrient is available for plant uptake and often needs to be
      supplemented with mineral fertilizer. Also, liquid fertilizer can
      be applied to plants on a timely basis as needed. The following
      are examples of devices and processes that produce fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention preferably uses a plant source,
      anaerobically digests the plant source, and subsequently uses a
      sequential bioleaching process which increases the amount of
      nutrient extracted or leached from a fixed amount of organic plant
      source. The leachate is concentrated without losing the nutrient
      and is subsequently used as a fertilizer (preferably an organic
      fertilizer). The present invention uses moderate heat at an
      optimum temperature to enhance hydrolysis and acidification and
      reduces the time required to produce the nutrient-rich leachate.
      No pre-treatment is required to digest the plant source. The
      present invention is lightweight, inexpensive, and uses a
      successive extraction process to produce an organic fertilizer
      with an enhanced nitrogen content.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The preferred invention relates to an apparatus and method of
      producing liquid fertilizer using successive extraction and
      accelerated bioleaching. The preferred embodiment is described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid fertilizer is produced in an apparatus comprising a first
      phase container, a leachate distribution system, and an external
      second-phase container. The first-phase container holds leachate
      and packed plant matter. The leachate is distributed via a system
      comprising a circulation pump, piping, a leachate distribution
      system, and a leachate drain system. The external second-phase
      container stores and heats the leachate.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid fertilizer is produced by mixing leachate, packing
      plant material, and adding a fluid in at least one first-phase
      container and by accelerating bioleaching. Accelerating
      bioleaching comprises recirculating the leachate periodically
      through the first container, hydrolyzing the leachate, acidifying
      the leachate, and dissolving the organic material into the
      recirculating leachate. The leachate the first-phase container is
      augmented by adding additional fluid.<br>
      <br>
      The leachate is successively extracted from the first-phase
      container and replaced with a fluid. The leachate is then disposed
      in an external second-phase container where it is concentrated by
      controlling heating by heating at above approximately 80 degrees
      F., storing the leachate in the second phase container and
      exposing it to sunlight, or boiling. Leachate odor is minimized by
      the controlled heating, and concentrating the liquid leachate
      prevents the loss of nutrient or organic content. Finally, the
      leachate is removed from the external second-phase container as
      liquid organic fertilizer.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      An embodiment of the present invention provides a liquid
      fertilizer made from waste using accelerated bioleaching and
      successive extraction and a method for producing the liquid
      fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      As used in the specification and claims herein, the terms "a",
      "an", and "the" mean one or more. The term "leachate" means a
      fluid and bacteria. The term "fluid" means continuous amorphous
      substance that tends to flow and to conform to the outline of its
      container, such as water, or any other liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the process of generating liquid fertilizer in
      accordance with the present invention comprises a two-phase
      process. In the first phase, dilute liquid fertilizer (preferably
      organic liquid fertilizer) is generated through an accelerated
      bioleaching process preferably utilizing a system as depicted in
      FIG. 1. The process is based on an accelerated bio-leaching
      process wherein material, preferably plant material including, but
      not limited to, green grass and alfalfa, is stored in a solid bed
      similar to a batch process, and a leachate (e.g., water and
      bacteria) is re-circulated through the solid bed until the process
      of hydrolysis and acidification results in dissolution of organic
      material into the re-circulating leachate.<br>
      <br>
      A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention is shown in
      FIG. 1. System 50 comprises, in part, column 100 (which can be of
      any appropriate material such as PVC and of suitable dimensions
      such as of approximately 3 feet high and one foot in diameter).
      Drip irrigation leachate distribution system 110 is provided at
      the top of column 100. Sub-drain system 120 with a filter is
      installed at the bottom of column 100 to collect leachate 200.
      Fresh grass waste 300 is packed in column 100 between leachate
      distribution system 110 and sub-drain system 120. Sufficient water
      is applied to satisfy the field capacity of the organic media and
      provide an additional 20% leachate at the bottom. Leachate 200 is
      re-circulated (via, for example, pump 130) periodically through
      system 50. Preferably, samples are taken periodically to analyze
      for nutrient and organic content of leachate.<br>
      <br>
      In the second phase, the dilute liquid fertilizer is concentrated
      using either or both of two different methods. In a first method,
      leachate 200 is concentrated through controlled heating at 80-85
      degrees F. In the second method, leachate 200 is concentrated
      using a solarization approach where liquid is stored in an outdoor
      container covered with clear plastic with vents and leaving in the
      sun for a few days. The purpose of the concentration is to
      facilitate the handling, transportation and application of the
      organic liquid fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also addresses the problem of salinity that
      is detrimental to many crops. Salt accumulation limits the uptake
      and transport to nutrients that have an effect on plant growth.
      Uptake of nitrogen in saline conditions is reduced in addition to
      dry mass production. Increased inorganic nitrogen nutrition has
      been shown to decrease ion toxicity under this condition.
      Additionally, it is well known to apply manure to provide organic
      nitrogen. However, the use of organic nitrogen from an organic
      liquid fertilizer in saline conditions is beneficial to plant
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the present invention comprises producing liquid fertilizer
      from waste (e.g., green waste) using an accelerated bio-leaching
      process. The liquid fertilizer can be concentrated using
      controlled heating without a significant loss of nutrient or
      organic content. The concentrated liquid can be classified as
      fertilizer in accordance with both international and U.S.
      fertilizer standards. The fertilizer can be applied through
      irrigation systems on a timely basis and can produce higher crop
      yield in comparison to mineral fertilizer. The fertilizer can be
      applied through drip tapes in a field scale or other drip
      irrigation system.<br>

      A non-limiting example of a system for the production of liquid
      fertilizer was constructed and used as described herein for
      approximately three weeks of leaching. Table 1 shows the nutrient
      composition for the resulting dilute leachate composition at the
      end of the first phase.<br>

      The dilute liquid had a pH of 5.7. The liquid was then heated at a
      controlled temperature of 80-85 degrees F. in order to concentrate
      the nutrient. The volume of the concentrated liquid was 10% of the
      original volume, and had a pH of 5.4. Table 2 shows the nutrient
      content of the concentrated fertilizer.<br>

      The concentrated liquid described in Table 2 is properly
      classified as commercial fertilizer as it has more than 6%
      nutrient by weight. The International Fertilizer Industry
      Association ("IFA") defines fertilizer as "a natural or
      manufactured material with at least 5% of one or more of the three
      primary nutrients (N, PsO5, K2O). In the United States, fertilizer
      preferably has a combined NPK of at least 6% in order to be
      classified as fertilizer. Fertilizers with only one primary
      nutrient are called "straight fertilizer", and with two or three
      primary nutrients are called "multi-nutrient fertilizers."<br>
      <br>
      One noticeable effect of the concentration was that, a few days
      after the treatment was begun, the liquid had virtually no odor,
      contrary to the dilute sample following the first phase which has
      a strong odor like that of sewage. It appears that compounds
      causing the odor are the first to break away from the liquid as
      the concentration process begins.<br>

      <br>
      In another non-limiting example, green house experiments were
      conducted to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing organic
      fertilizer in the production of organic green chile. A randomized
      block design experiment with nine treatments and four replications
      was used. The treatments consisted of three levels of soil
      salinity (ECe=1, 5, 4.5, 6.5) and three levels of fertilizer. The
      levels of fertilizers were: 120 Kg of N/ha of commercial mineral
      fertilizer, 120 Kg N/ha of organic liquid fertilizer and 200 Kg
      N/ha of organic liquid fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows the results of the experiment with the first three
      harvests. In the green house experiment, liquid fertilizer was
      diluted in the irrigation water and applied on a periodic basis
      according to experiment station recommendations. The green house
      experiment showed that the yield of green chile was increased
      significantly by using organic liquid fertilizer, especially in
      soils with high salinity. The organic liquid fertilizer not only
      increases the yield, but also produces an organic crop that has
      considerably higher market value. Traditionally, one of the
      challenges of the organic farming industry has been to match the
      quality and quantity of crops grown by commercial fertilizer. A
      high level of organic in the solution reduces the negative impact
      of salinity in the soil.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3</span><br

      <br>
      In another non-limiting example, the liquid organic fertilizer was
      compared to a chemical fertilizer for chile pepper growth.<br>
      Chile pepper (Capsicum annuum L. cv. Sandia) was grown in green
      house conditions. The type of soil is a Brazito sandy loam with an
      electrical conductivity (EC) of 0.59 dS m&lt;-1 &gt;and a pH of
      7.7. A mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl in a ratio of 1:1 was used to
      prepare saline solutions, which were sprayed evenly over each
      plastic pot of 15 kg soil according to three levels of salinity:
      S1 (1.7 dS/m), S2 (5.0 dS/m), and S3 (6.5 dS/m). Ammonium nitrate
      and an organic liquid fertilizer were the two nitrogen sources.
      The first was applied at a rate of 120 kg ha&lt;-1 &gt;(F1), and
      the second in two rates: 120 kg ha&lt;-1 &gt;(F2) and 200 kg
      ha&lt;-1 &gt;(F3). The organic liquid fertilizer's chemical
      properties are shown in Table 3.<br>

      The three salinity levels were combined with the three rates of
      fertilizer to give nine treatments. Fertilizers were manually
      applied and split in four applications. Pepper seedlings were
      transplanted in pots arranged in a randomized complete block
      design with four replications.<br>
      <br>
      Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as the ratio of yield
      (g/plant) and the amount of water used to reach this yield.<br>
      Soil pH and EC was measured in the saturation extract using a
      glass pH electrode and a temperature-compensating conductivity
      meter, respectively. Soil NH4&lt;+&gt; and NO3&lt;-&gt; were
      analyzed using a Multiscan Ascent plate reader spectrophotometer.<br>
      <br>
      Dry weights of roots, shoots, leaves, and fruits were determined
      after drying for 76 hours at 70 degrees C. Total plant nitrogen
      was determined using the Kjeldahl digestion procedure (TKN).
      Ground plant parts were digested in concentrated H2SO4 in a block
      digester and quantified as NH4&lt;+&gt; on an AutoAnalyzer II
      ammonia system.<br>
      <br>
      Data was analyzed with the SAS statistical package. Differences
      between treatments were tested using Tukey's students test.<br>

      Soil reaction (pH) showed some variation. The final electrical
      conductivities (EC) show a light decrement compared to original
      values: from 1.7 to 1.61 dS m&lt;-1 &gt;for 51, from 5.0 to 4.23
      dS m&lt;-1 &gt;for S2, and from 6.5 to 6.26 dS m&lt;-1 &gt;for S3.
      However, there were differences between treatments. Soil NH4-N was
      slightly affected by the kind of fertilization and salinity. The
      same response had soil NO3-N and Total-N. However, a high
      concentration was observed for NO3-N form in the S3F1 treatment.<br>
      <br>
      According to ANOVA, plant height showed a similar response to
      saline (65.83 cm for S2, and 66.00 cm for S3) and non-saline
      (78.45 cm for 51) conditions while the treatments had small
      effects on shoot diameter (1.13 cm for S1, 1.01 cm for S2, and
      0.97 cm for S3). Results are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      Influence of salinity and nitrogen source on leaves, shoots, and
      root dry weights are shown in Table 5. The dry weights of shoots
      and roots components decreased significantly in response to
      increments in salinity (from 35.685 g to 25.886 g for 51 and S3 in
      roots, and 112.226 g to 83.386 g for the same salinity levels for
      shoots). However, in leaves there was a decrement in dry weight
      for S2 (57.165 g), and an increment in S3 (68.509 g) with respect
      to S1 (66.329 g).<br>

      <br>
      The greater yields were obtained when 200 kg ha&lt;-1 &gt;(F3) of
      organic fertilizer was applied to chile pepper plants. Total
      yields of chile pepper increased 18.19% (1155.7 g), 15.17% (1126.1
      g), and 14.59% (1462.7 g) for S1 (1.8 dS m&lt;-1&gt;), S2 (4.3 dS
      m&lt;-1&gt;), and S3 (6.4 dS m&lt;-1&gt;) respectively compared
      with yield of chile pepper (977.82 g) grown with NH4NO3 (F1, 120
      kg ha&lt;-1&gt;) in non-saline soil conditions S1 (1.3 dS
      m&lt;-1&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      In relation to yields in different harvests (Table 6), the higher
      yields were obtained using organic fertilizer as the nitrogen
      source. Only in non-saline conditions were yields using NH4NO3
      greater than yields using organic fertilizer in the first and last
      harvests. However, in the last harvest there were no differences
      between treatments.<br>

      The difference in value of applied water as salinity increased is
      shown in FIG. 6. Significantly, the quantity of water was
      diminished by increasing salinity: from an average of 46,310.17 ml

      Another embodiment of the present invention was demonstrated by a
      non-limiting example of a system for the production of liquid
      fertilizer, constructed and used as described herein, for
      approximately three weeks of leaching. Grass and/or alfalfa were
      placed in the system container. Bacteria were added at 120[deg.]
      F. Water was added to the container and then the container was
      sealed. The dilute liquid was stored in the external storage
      container. The system preferably comprises two digesters because
      these digesters are smaller, less expensive, and improve leaching.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid was removed after fifteen days and replaced with fresh
      water. Fresh water was added two or three more times during the
      bioleaching process. This resulted in a twice higher yield.
      Previous yields were, after one week, a 30% yield of 0.3 mg/liter.
      After two weeks, a 72% yield of 0.76 mg/l resulted.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid was then boiled in order to concentrate the nutrient.
      Heated water was subsequently added and the concentration was
      doubled. An acid or base, depending on the type of bacteria, was
      added.<br>
      <br>
      One noticeable effect of the concentration was that, a few days
      after the treatment was begun, the liquid had virtually no odor,
      contrary to the dilute sample following the first phase which had
      a strong odor like that of sewage. Compounds that caused the odor
      were the first to break away from the liquid as the concentration
      process began.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to high nutrient concentration and ease of handling,
      not having an odor is a noteworthy advantage for an organic
      fertilizer. Odor was also reduced when the liquid fertilizer was
      put in a container and left in the sun for a few days so that the
      volatile aromatic compounds were vaporized.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the process of generating liquid fertilizer in
      accordance with the present invention comprises a two-phase
      process. The first phase comprises a successive extraction process
      whereby liquid leachate is drained from one plant or storage
      container after four weeks and the process subsequently started
      with new fresh water. The successive extraction process is based
      on an accelerated bio-leaching process wherein material,
      preferably plant material including, but not limited to, green
      grass and alfalfa, is stored in a solid bed similar to a batch
      process, and a leachate (e.g., water and bacteria) is
      re-circulated through the solid bed until the process of
      hydrolysis and acidification results in dissolution of organic
      material into the re-circulating leachate.<br>
      <br>
      A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention is shown in
      FIG. 10. System 10 comprises, in part, mixing container 20 into
      which bacteria, organic material such as grass or alfalfa, and
      water is added. External storage container 30 is provided to
      collect leachate 51. Fresh grass waste 70 is packed in container
      20 between leachate distribution system 60 and external storage
      container 30 that facilitates using multiple fermenters with a
      single storage unit. Liquid leachate 80 is successively extracted.
      Sufficient water is applied to satisfy the field capacity of the
      organic media and provide an additional 20% leachate at the
      bottom. Leachate 51 is re-circulated (via, for example, pump 40)
      periodically through system 10. Preferably, samples are taken
      periodically to analyze for nutrient and organic content of
      leachate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 5</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the second phase, the dilute liquid fertilizer is concentrated
      using either or both of two different methods. In a first method,
      the leachate (e.g. from grass) was concentrated through controlled
      heating at 50[deg.] C. for two days. After two days, only a small
      amount of odor was detectable compared to a very strong odor in
      the beginning. The sample volume was reduced to 0.18 liters and
      the total nitrogen content was measured at 75,400 mg/liter
      compared to 7,000 mg/liter prior to the treatment. The sample was
      therefore concentrated by a factor of eleven with only a small
      amount of nitrogen loss. In a second method, leachate was heated
      in a closed environment at 90[deg.] C. The heat treatment was
      required to kill potential pathogens and to increase nitrogen
      concentration. Nitrogen concentration increased from 7,000 parts
      per million (ppm) to 12,600 ppm. The volume was reduced by 53%.
      The organic liquid fertilizer was heat treated without losing
      nitrogen. The purpose of the concentration is to facilitate the
      handling, transportation and application of the organic liquid
      fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by
      substituting the generically or specifically described reactants
      and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in
      the preceding examples.<br>

      FIG. 7 shows salinity and fertilizer effect on soil electrical
      conductivity (EC) of chile pepper grown in greenhouse conditions.
      FIG. 8 shows salinity and fertilizer effect on average added water
      of chile pepper grown in greenhouse conditions. FIG. 9 shows
      salinity and fertilizer effect on plant height (cm) of chile
      pepper grown in greenhouse conditions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11 shows the increased efficiency using successive extraction
      methods where the liquid is removed from the storage container at
      discrete intervals. Fresh water is subsequently added to the
      external storage containers. A resulting increased efficiency is
      noted after four weeks.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also uses warm water (e.g. 120 to 130[deg.]
      F.) with grass or other plant materials to accelerate the
      fermentation process. The pH dropped much faster with warm water
      than with ambient temperature water.<br>
