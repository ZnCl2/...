      <span style="font-style: italic;">Gary Posner, Scowe Professor of
        Chemistry at Johns Hopkins and leader of a team that has
        developed a new series of malaria drugs.</span><br>
      <br>
      Johns Hopkins University researchers have cured malaria-infected
      mice with single shots of a new series of potent, long lasting
      synthetic drugs modeled on an ancient Chinese herbal folk remedy.<br>
      <br>
      The team also has developed several other compounds which defeated
      the febrile disease in rodents after three oral doses.<br>
      <br>
      These peroxide compounds, containing a crucial oxygen-oxygen unit,
      promise not only to be more effective than today's best malaria
      remedies, but also potentially safer and more efficient, said
      research team leader Gary Posner, Scowe Professor of Chemistry in
      the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins.<br>
      <br>
      An article about the team's work is slated to appear on the Web on
      April 17 in the ASAP section of The Journal of Medicinal
      Chemistry. Go here: http://tinyurl.com/3cwg3a<br>
      <br>
      "We are disclosing, for the first time, the curative activity of a
      new generation of compounds that are long-lasting and therapeutic,
      even when used by themselves," Posner said. "Older drugs in this
      family of peroxide antimalarials also are known to be fast-acting,
      but they are unfortunately short-lived and not curative when used
      by themselves."<br>
      <br>
      Though they say their results are very promising, the researchers
      caution that the new compounds must be thoroughly tested for
      safety and for how they are absorbed, distributed and metabolized
      in, and eliminated from, rodents' bodies before human tests begin.<br>
      <br>
      Malaria afflicts between 300 million and 500 million people a
      year, killing between 1.5 million and 3 million, mostly children
      and mostly in developing nations. The parasite that causes the
      disease is spread by female mosquitoes feeding on human blood. The
      most commonly fatal species of the malaria parasite now shows
      strong resistance to most current treatments, making the
      development of effective new drugs a worldwide priority.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1992, Posner and his team, which includes collaborator
      Theresa Shapiro, professor and chair of clinical pharmacology at
      the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, have been tackling that
      challenge by designing a series of peroxide compounds, called
      trioxanes.<br>
      <br>
      "As a class, these compounds have proven to be unusually valuable
      in several ways, from their brisk and potent antimalarial activity
      to their lack of resistance and cross-resistance with other
      antimalarial agents," Shapiro said.<br>
      <br>
      The Johns Hopkins trioxanes mimic artemisinin, the active agent in
      a Chinese herbal drug used to treat malaria and other fevers for
      thousands of years. Artemisinin comes from the Artemisia annua
      plant, an herb also known by a variety of names including sweet
      wormwood.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen-oxygen unit in the peroxides causes malaria parasites
      essentially to self-destruct. The parasites digest hemoglobin, the
      oxygen-carrying pigment of red blood cells, and, in the process,
      release a substance called heme, a deep-red iron-containing blood
      pigment. When the heme encounters peroxides, a powerful chemical
      reaction occurs, releasing carbon-free radicals and oxidizing
      agents that eventually kill the parasites.<br>
      <br>
      But the first generation of trioxane drugs also had a number of
      shortcomings, including a half-life of less than one hour. (A
      drug's half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of it to
      be metabolized.) Posner and team believe that their new compounds
      address those disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      "Our semi-synthetic artemisinin-derived compounds successfully
      overcome the disadvantages of their first-generation
      predecessors," he said. "Most important is their curative activity
      after a single, low dose, which is distinctly unusual. But based
      on our intentional design, they may also have a longer half-life
      in animals. We also designed them to be more lipophilic, meaning
      they have an enhanced ability to dissolve in fats and thus to
      arrive inside malaria-infected red blood cells."<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the new compounds are far less likely to break down
      into toxic substances when they are metabolized in the test
      animals' bodies, making them potentially safer than their
      predecessors.<br>
      <br>
      Although the substance is inexpensive by Western standards, the
      widespread use of artemisinins in the developing world remains
      limited, in part by availability and the cost of separating the
      active ingredient from the Artemisia annua plant. Posner and his
      team contend that the potency and curative activity of their
      compounds provide "a substantially more efficient and economical
      use of the price-setting natural product."<br>
      <br>
      The team's research was supported by the National Institutes of
      Health and the Johns Hopkins University Malaria Research
      Institute.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- In only two
      steps and in 65% overall yield, natural trioxane artemisinin (I)
      was converted on gram scale into C-10-carba trioxane dimer (3).
      This new, very stable dimer was then transformed easily in one
      additional step into four different dimers (4-7). Alcohol and diol
      dimers (4 and 5) and ketone dimer (7) are 10 times more
      antimalarially potent in vitro than artemisinin (1), and alcohol
      and diol dimers (4 and 5) are strongly inhibitory but not
      cytotoxic toward several human cancer cell lines. Water-soluble
      carboxylic acid derivatives (8a-10c and 12) were easily prepared
      from dimers (4-6); they are thermally stable even at 60 DEG C. for
      24 hours, are more orally efficacious as antimalarials than either
      artelinic acid or sodium artesunate, and have potent and selective
      anticancer activities.; Further derivitization of the alcohol
      dimers (4 and 17), diol dimer (5) and ketone (7) has produced a
      number of analogs also antimalarially active in vitro at
      sub-nanomolar concentrations (most notably: pyridine N-oxides (13,
      15, 18, 23, 24 and 25), phosphoric acid triesters (26 and 27),
      sulfonamide (40) and cyclic carbonate (41)). In addition, dimers
      (13 and 19) are more efficacious (when administered both orally
      and i.v.) and less toxic (when administered intraperitoneally to
      mice as a single dose) than clinically-used sodium artesunate,
      thereby giving them a better antimalarial therapeutic index than
      sodium artesunate. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Field of the Invention </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the formation of a novel, stable
      C-10 carba trioxane dimer that may easily be transformed into
      different trioxane dimers. Some of these dimers are 10 times more
      antimalarially potent in vitro than artemisinin. These anticancer
      dimers selectively inhibit growth in vitro of several human cancer
      cell lines without being cytotoxic. The present invention relates
      also to water-soluble carboxylic acid derivatives that are
      thermally stable, that are more orally efficacious antimalarials
      than either artelinic acid or clinically used sodium artesunate,
      and that have potent and selective anticancer activities. The
      present invention further relates to antimalarial trioxane dimers
      that are safer and more efficacious than sodium artesunate. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of the State of
        Art </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Each year approximately 200-300 million people experience a
      malarial illness and over 1 million individuals die. In patients
      with severe and complicated disease, the mortality rate is between
      20 and 50%. <br>
      <br>
      Plasmodium is the genus of protozoan parasites which is
      responsible for all cases of human malaria and Plasmodium
      falciparum is the species of parasite that is responsible for the
      vast majority of fatal malaria infections. Malaria has
      traditionally been treated with quinolines such as chloroquine,
      quinine, mefloquine, and primaquine and with antifolates such as
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Unfortunately, most P. falciparum
      strains have now become resistant to chloroquine, and some, such
      as those in Southeast Asia, have also developed resistance to
      mefloquine and halofantrine; multidrug resistance is developing in
      Africa also. <br>
      <br>
      The endoperoxides are a promising class of antimalarial drugs
      which may meet the dual challenges posed by drug-resistant
      parasites and the rapid progression of malarial illness. The first
      generation endoperoxides include natural artemisinin and several
      synthetic derivatives, discussed in further detail below. <br>
      <br>
      Artemisia annua L., also known as qinghao or sweet wormwood, is a
      pervasive weed that has been used for many centuries in Chinese
      traditional medicine as a treatment for fever and malaria. Its
      earliest mention, for use in hemorrhoids, occurs in the Recipes
      for 52 Kinds of Diseases found in the Mawangdui Han dynasty tomb
      dating from 168 B.C. Nearly five hundred years later Ge Hong wrote
      the Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang (Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency
      Treatments) in which he advised that a water extract of qinghao
      was effective at reducing fevers. In 1596, Li Shizhen, the famous
      herbalist, wrote that chills and fever of malaria can be combated
      by qinghao preparations. Finally, in 1972, Chinese chemists
      isolated from the leafy portions of the plant the substance
      responsible for its reputed medicinal action. This crystalline
      compound, called qinghaosu, also referred to as QHS or
      artemisinin, is a sesquiterpene lactone with an internal peroxide
      linkage. <br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin is a member of the amorphane subgroup of cadinenes and
      has the following structure (I); "Art" will be used for shorthand
      in many of the figures. <br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="artemisin.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      ##STR00001## Artemisinin or QHS was the subject of a 1979 study
      conducted by the Qinghaosu Antimalarial Coordinating Research
      Group involving the treatment of 2099 cases of malaria (P. vivax
      and P. falciparum in a ratio of about 3:1 ) with different dosage
      forms of QHS, leading to the clinical cure of all patients. See,
      Qinghaosu Antimalarial Coordinating Research Group, Chin. Med. J.,
      92:811 (1979). Since that time artemisinin has been used
      successfully in many thousand malaria patients throughout the
      world including those infected with both chloroquine-sensitive and
      chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum. Assay of
      artemisinin against P. falciparum in vitro revealed that its
      potency is comparable to that of chloroquine in two Hanian strains
      (Z. Ye, et al., J. Trad. Chin. Med., 3:95 (1983)) and of
      mefloquine in the Camp (chloroquine-susceptible) and Smith
      (chloroquine-resistant) strains, D. L. Klayman, et al., J. Nat.
      Prod., 47:715 (1984). <br>
      <br>
      Although artemisinin is effective at suppressing the parasitemias
      of P. vivax and P. falciparum, the problems encountered with
      recrudescence, and the compound's insolubility in water, led
      scientists to modify artemisinin chemically, a difficult task
      because of the chemical reactivity of the peroxide linkage which
      is believed to be an essential moiety for antimalarial activity. <br>
      <br>
      Reduction of artemisinin in the presence of sodium borohydride
      results in the production of dihydroartemisinin (II-1) or DHQHS,
      (illustrated in structure II below), in which the lactone group is
      converted to a lactol (hemiacetal) function, with properties
      similar to artemisinin. Artemisinin in methanol is reduced with
      sodium borohydride to an equilibrium mixture of .alpha.- and
      .beta.-isomers of dihydroartemisinin. Using dihydroartemisinin as
      a starting compound a large number of other derivatives, such as,
      <br>
      <br>
      ##STR00002## artemether (compound II-2), arteether (II-3), sodium
      artesunate (II-4), artelinic acid (II-5), sodium artelinate
      (II-6), dihydroartemisinin condensation by-product (II-7) and the
      olefinic compound, structure III, <br>
      <br>
      ##STR00003## have been produced. <br>
      <br>
      Artemether (II-2) is produced by reacting
      .beta.-dihydroartemisinin with boron trifluoride (BF.sub.3)
      etherate or HCl in methanol:benzene (1:2) at room temperature. A
      mixture of .beta.-and .alpha.-artemether (70:30) is obtained, from
      which the former is isolated by column chromatography and
      recrystallized from hexane or methanol, R. Haynes, Transactions of
      the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 88(l):
      S1/23-S1/26 (1994). For arteether (II-3), (Brossi, et al., 1988),
      the .alpha.-isomer is equilibrated (epimerized) to the
      .beta.-isomer in ethanol:benzene mixture containing BF.sub.3
      etherate. Treatment of dihydroartemisinin with an unspecified
      dehydrating agent yields both the olefinic compound, (III), and
      the dihydroartemisinin condensation by-product (II-7), formed on
      addition of dihydroartemisinin to (III), M. Cao, et al., Chem.
      Abstr., 100:34720k (1984). Until recently, the secondary hydroxy
      group in dihydroartemisinin (II-1) provided the only site in an
      active artemisinin-related compound that had been used for
      derivatization. See B. Venugopalan, "Synthesis of a Novel Ring
      Contracted Artemisinin Derivative," Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal
      Chemistry Letters, 4(5):751 -752 (1994). <br>
      <br>
      The potency of various artemisinin-derivatives in comparison to
      artemisinin as a function of the concentration at which the
      parasitemia is 90 percent suppressed (SD.sub.90) was reported by
      D. L. Klayman, "Qinghaosu (Artemisinin): An Antimalarial Drug from
      China," Science 228:1049-1055 (1985). Dr. Klayman reported that
      the olefinic compound III is inactive against P. berghei-infected
      mice, whereas the dihydroartemisinin condensation by-product
      (II-7) has an SD.sub.90 of 10 mg/Kg in P. berghei-infected mice.
      Thus, the dihydroartemisinin ether dimer proved to be less potent
      than artemisinin, which has an SD.sub.90of 6.20 mg/Kg. Following,
      in order of their overall antimalarial efficacy, are the three
      types of derivatives of dihydroartemisinin (II-1) that have been
      produced: (artemisinin)&lt;ethers (II, R.dbd.alkyl)&lt;esters [II,
      R.dbd.C(.dbd.O)-alkyl or -aryl]&lt;carbonates [II, R.dbd.C
      (.dbd.O)O-alkyl or -aryl]. <br>
      <br>
      Other rational design of structurally simpler analogs of
      artemisinin has led to the synthesis of various trioxanes, some of
      which possess excellent antimalarial activity. Posner, G. H., et
      al., reported the chemistry and biology of a series of new
      structurally simple, easily prepared, racemic 1,2,4-trioxanes
      (disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,437 and incorporated herein by
      reference) that are tricyclic (lacking the lactone ring present in
      tetracyclic artemisinin I) and that are derivatives of trioxane
      alcohol IV <br>
      <br>
      ##STR00004## having the relative stereochemistry shown above.
      Especially attractive features of trioxane alcohol IV are the
      following: (1) its straightforward and easy preparation from cheap
      and readily available starting materials, (2) its availability on
      gram scale, and (3) its easy one-step conversion, using standard
      chemical transformations, into alcohol derivatives such as esters
      and ethers, without destruction of the crucial trioxane framework.
      See, Posner, G. H., et al., J Med. Chem., 35:2459-2467 (1992),
      incorporated herein by reference. The complete chemical synthesis
      of artemisinin and a variety of other derivatives is reviewed by
      Sharma, R. P., et al., Heterocycles, 32(8):1593-1638 (1991), and
      is incorporated herein by reference. <br>
      <br>
      Metabolic studies by Baker, et al., demonstrated that
      .beta.-arteether (II-3), one of the antimalarial derivatives
      discussed previously, was rapidly converted by rat liver
      microsomes into dihydroartemisinin (II-1). See Baker, J. K., et
      al., Biol. Mass. Spect., 20:609-628 (1991). This finding and the
      fact that the most effective artemisinin derivatives against
      malaria have been ethers or esters of (II-1) suggest that they
      were prodrugs for (II-1). The controlled slow formation of (II-1),
      however, is not desirable in view of its short half-life in plasma
      (less than two hours) and relatively high toxicity. <br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately C-10 acetal derivatives are often unstable (i.e.
      easily hydrolyzed) in water. Therefore making hydrolytically
      stable C-10 non-acetal carba-derivatives has become a high
      priority internationally. <br>
      <br>
      Over the past thirty years only a few drugs isolated from higher
      plants have yielded clinical agents, the outstanding examples
      being vinblastine and vincristine from the Madagascan periwinkle,
      Catharanthus roseus, etoposide, the semi-synthetic lignan, from
      Mayapple Podophyllum peltatum and the diterpenoid taxol, commonly
      referred to as paclitaxel, from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia.
      Of these agents, paclitaxel is the most exciting, recently
      receiving approval by the Food and Drug Administration for the
      treatment of refractory ovarian cancer. Since the isolation of
      artemisinin, there has been a concerted effort by investigators to
      study other therapeutic applications of artemisinin and its
      derivatives. <br>
      <br>
      National Institutes of Health reported that artemisinin is
      inactive against P388 leukemia. See NCI Report on NSC 369397
      (tested on 25 Oct. 1983). Later anticancer studies that have been
      conducted on cell line panels consisting of 60 lines organized
      into nine, disease-related subpanels including leukemia,
      non-small-cell lung cancer, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal,
      prostate and breast cancers, further confirm that artemisinin
      displays very little anticancer activity. A series of
      artemisinin-related endoperoxides were tested for cytotoxicity to
      Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells using the microculture
      tetrazolum (MTT) assay, H. J. Woerdenbag, et al., "Cytotoxicity of
      Artemisinin-Related Endoperoxides to Ehrlich Ascites Tumor Cells,"
      Journal of Natural Products, 56(6):849-856 (1993). The MTT assay,
      used to test the artemisinin-related endoperoxides for
      cytotoxicity, is based on the metabolic reduction of soluble
      tetrazolium salts into insoluble colored formazan products by
      mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity of the tumor cells. As
      parameters for cytotoxicity, the IC.sub.50 and IC.sub.80 values,
      the drug concentrations causing respectively 50% and 80% growth
      inhibition of the tumor cells, were used. Artemisinin (I) had an
      IC.sub.50 value of 29.8 .mu.M. Derivatives of dihydroartemisinin
      (II-1) being developed as antimalarial drugs (artemether (II-2),
      arteether (III-3), sodium artesunate (II-4), artelinic acid (II-5)
      and sodium artelinate (II-6)), exhibited a somewhat more potent
      cytotoxicity. Their IC.sub.50 values ranged from 12.2 .mu.M to
      19.9 .mu.M. The dihydroartemisinin condensation by-product dimer
      (II-7), disclosed previously by M. Cao, et a., 1984, was the most
      potent cytotoxic agent, its IC.sub.50 being 1.4 .mu.M. At this
      drug concentration the condensation by-product (II-7) is
      approximately twenty-two times more cytotoxic than artemisinin and
      sixty times more cytotoxic than dihydroartemisinin (II-1), the
      parent compound. <br>
      <br>
      While artemisinin and its related derivatives (II 1-6) discussed
      above demonstrated zero to slight antiproliferative and antitumor
      activity, it has been discovered that a class of artemisinin dimer
      compounds exhibits antiproliferative and antitumor activities that
      are, in vitro, equivalent to or greater than known
      antiproliferative and antitumor agents. See, U.S. Pat. No.
      5,677,468 incorporated herein by reference. Unfortunately, while
      the in vitro results of these artemisinin compounds are
      encouraging these compounds do not appear to have significant
      antitumor activity on the treatment of tumor cells in mice. <br>
      <br>
      There is still a need, therefore, to develop methods for the
      formation of hydrolytically stable C-10 non-acetal
      carba-derivatives and structural analogs thereof having
      antimalarial, and antiproliferative and antitumor activities that
      are equivalent to or greater than those of known antimalarial, and
      antiproliferative and antitumor agents, respectively. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Accordingly, this invention provides a class of artemisinin
      related dimers which demonstrate antimalarial and antitumor
      activities. <br>
      <br>
      More specifically, this invention provides a class of trioxane
      dimers which demonstrate antimalarial and antitumor activities and
      that are considerably more stable toward hydrolysis than
      artemether and related C-10 ethers and esters. <br>
      <br>
      This invention further provides artemisinin dimers to be used
      clinically as chemotherapeutic antimalarial and anticancer drugs.
      <br>
      <br>
      This invention further provides artemisinin C-10-acetal
      derivatives for comparisson to the corresponding dimers, and to be
      used clinically as chemotherapeutic antimalarial drugs. <br>
      <br>
      This invention further provides a C-10-carba trioxane dimer that
      is easily transformed in one additional step into different
      dimers. <br>
      <br>
      This invention further provides water-soluble carboxylic acid
      dimers that are thermally stable, that are more orally efficacious
      antimalarials than either artelinic acid or clinically used sodium
      artesunate, and that have potent and selective anticancer
      activities. <br>
      <br>
      Additional objects, advantages and novel features of this
      invention shall be set forth in part in the description and

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </span><br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a direct method for converting a
      novel C-10-carba trioxane dimer in one step into a number of
      different dimers, all of which are hydrolytically stable. The
      resulting trioxane dimers may then be further reacted to form
      3-carbon atom linked, oxygenated dimers. These C-10 non-acetal
      derivatives of natural trioxane artemisinin have high in vitro
      antimalarial and antitumor activities. <br>
      <br>
      In general, the compound of the present invention includes
      resolved enantiomers, diastereomers, solvates and pharmaceutical
      acceptable salts thereof, and may be illustrated as follows: <br>

      <br>
      ##STR00007## where where E is H, O, NR, CH.sub.2 or S wherein R
      may be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or any other substituent. <br>
      <br>
      In general, the first step of the preferred process of the present
      invention, shown in FIG. 1, conversion of artemisinin (I) into
      .alpha.-dihydroartemisinin acetate (2), is accomplished by using
      an effective amount of a hydride nucleophile in combination with
      an acetylating agent which chemoselectively reacts at the C-10
      position of the artemisinin skeleton without disrupting the O--O
      bond in this trioxane. Effective nucleophilic hydride reagents
      include, but are not limited to sodium borohydride, and DIBAL. The
      relative amounts of the various possible nucleophilic hydride
      reagents depends upon the concentration employed and other
      conditions of the reaction. Various amounts of the nucleophilic
      reagents can be employed, but generally it should be present in
      the range of 1.0 to 1.5 molar equivalents of nucleophilic hydride
      per molar equivalent of artemisinin for the reaction to proceed to
      completion. Effective acetylating agents include, but are not
      limited to acetyl chloride and acetic anhydride. The relative
      amounts of the various possible acetylating agents depends upon
      the concentration employed and other conditions of the reaction.
      Various amounts of the acetylating agents can be employed, but
      generally it should be present in the range of 1.0 to 1.5 molar
      equivalents of acetylating agent per molar equivalent of
      dihydroartemisinin for the reaction to proceed to completion. <br>
      <br>
      The next step, shown in FIG. 2, in the production of the novel
      meso trioxane dimer 3 involves the substitution of the acetoxy
      group from the C-10 acetate 2 product to form the meso trioxane
      dimer 3 product. Inspiration for this bis-allylation of C-10
      acetate 2 was based on the pioneering trioxane mono-allylations of
      Ziffer (Pu, Y. M.; Ziffer, H., Synthesis and Antimalarial
      Activities of 12.beta.-Allyldeoxoartemisinin. J. Med. Chem. 1995,
      38, 613-616) and O'Neill (O'Neill, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42,
      5487-5493; and O'Neill, P. M., et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin
      Trans. 2001, 1, 2682-2689.) using allylsilane and based also on
      allylic bis-silane chemistry, see Rychnovsky, S. D., et. al.,
      Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 41-44. The requisite allylic
      bis-silane is easily prepared in one step from the corresponding
      commercial allylic dichloride (Shown in FIG. 2); in the presence
      of fresh tin tetrachloride, the allylic bis-silane converts
      acetate 2 on gram scale into meso dimer 3, characterized by
      .sup.1H NMR spectroscopy as done before in structurally related
      trioxanes. This double substitution reaction undoubtedly proceeds
      sequentially via initial monoallylation, producing an intermediate
      C-10 allylic silane that then reacts with another molecule of
      trioxane acetate 2 to form the product dimer 3. This new dimer 3,
      with an unsaturated 3-carbon atom linker between the two trioxane
      units, is stable in air and light at room temperature for at least
      six months, and its preparation on much larger industrial scale
      should be feasible. <br>
      <br>
      In contrast to most simple peroxides that are easily cleaved by
      reducing agents and by reactive organometallics, the peroxide
      linkage in artemisinin-like trioxanes is relatively robust.
      Therefore, several different chemical transformations
      chemospecifically involving only the linker isobutylene
      carbon-carbon double bond in dimer 3 may be performed and are
      discussed in further detail below. <br>
      <br>
      Borane reduction and in situ oxidation produced bis-trioxane
      primary alcohol 4, shown in FIG. 3. Dihydroxylation using osmium
      tetroxide gave bis-trioxane vicinal diol 5, shown in FIG. 4.
      Dimethyldioxirane formed bis-trioxane epoxide 6, shown in FIG. 5.
      Oxidative cleavage using catalytic osmium tetroxide and Oxone led
      to bis-trioxane ketone 7, shown in FIG. 6. Bis-Trioxanes 4-7 are
      stable even when heated neat in air for 24 h at 60.degree. C.;
      .sup.1H NMR spectroscopy showed less than 5% decomposition under
      these accelerated aging conditions. <br>
      <br>
      To illustrate further the chemical inertness of the peroxide unit
      in these trioxane dimers, and especially to generate some
      water-soluble dimers that can be easily administered in vivo, each
      dimer 4-7 was converted into a carboxylic acid (FIGS. 16-20).
      Primary alcohol 4 opened succinic anhydride to form bis-artesunate
      8a in high yield, see FIG. 16. Likewise, diol 5 opened succinic
      anhydride to produce the tertiary alcohol primary succinate ester
      9, see FIG. 17. Epoxide 6 reacted chemospecifically with a
      benzenethiol in the presence of chromatographic alumina to give
      .beta. hydroxysulfide 10a in high yield; sulfide to sulfone
      oxidation gave dimer benzoate ester 10b that was saponified into
      benzoic acid 10c, see FIG. 18. Ketone 7 underwent chemospecific
      addition of styryllithium to afford styryl tertiary alcohol 11a;
      oxidative cleavage of the styrene double bond produced benzoic
      acid 11b, see FIG. 19. Primary alcohol 4 was allylated and the
      allyl double bond was oxidatively cleaved to generate acetic acid
      12b, see FIG. 20. <br>
      <br>
      Each of these new carboxylic acid dimers is at least as soluble in
      water at pH 7.4 as is the antimalarial drug candidate artelinic
      acid, and tertiary alcohol primary succinate ester 9 is close to
      30 times more water-soluble than artelinic acid, and phosphonic
      acid 16 is even more water soluble than succinate ester 9.
      Trioxane dimer carboxylic acids 8a-10c and 12b are stable in air
      even at 60.degree. C. for 24 hours. <br>
      <br>
      Primary alcohol 4 may also be transformed into a variety of other
      compounds as shown in FIGS. 21-25, 28, 30, 34-38 and 43. Likewise,
      diol 5 may be converted into a variety of compounds as shown in
      FIGS. 27, 29, 31 and 45. Additionally, secondary alcohol 17 may be
      transformed into a variety of compounds as shown in FIGS. 32 and
      33. Likewise, ketone 7 may be converted into a variety of
      compounds as shown in FIGS. 42, 44, 47 and 48 and epoxide 6 may be
      reacted further as shown in FIG. 46. Finally, dimer 3 may be
      converted to a variety of compounds as shown in FIGS. 51, 52 and
      53. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Determination of Antimalarial
        Activity </span><br>
      <br>
      To determine the antimalarial effect of various dimers of the
      present invention, screening assays were performed against
      chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum (NF54), according to the
      method described below, and their IC.sub.50 values are included in
      Table 1. <br>
      <br>
      Activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of
      [.sup.3H]hypoxanthine, by the methods of DesJardins and Milhous,
      with the following modifications, see Desjardins, R. E.; Canfield,
      C. J.; Haynes, J. D.; Chulay, J. D., Antimicrob. Agents
      Chemother., 16:710 (1979); Milhous, W. K.; Weatherly, N. F.;
      Bowdre, J. H.; Desjardins, R., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.,
      27:525 (1985). Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum (NF54 strain)
      were maintained in a 2.4% suspension of type O.sup.+ human
      erythrocytes (obtained weekly from a rotating pool of screened
      healthy volunteers) in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL # 13200-076),
      supplemented with 25 mM
      N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES;
      Calbiochern #391338), 27 mM NaHCO.sub.3 (Gibco BRL # 11810-025),
      and 10% heat-inactivated human type O.sup.+ serum (Interstate
      Blood Bank, Inc.), under 3% O.sub.2, 4% CO.sub.2, and 93% N.sub.2.
      Parasitemia was maintained at 0.05-3% and doubling time at
      approximately 15 hours by twice weekly change of medium and
      replenishment with fresh erythrocytes. <br>
      <br>
      Stock solutions (approximately 2.5 mg/mL of HPLC-purified or
      recrystallized test compound) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
      (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich #27,043-1). DMSO solutions were diluted
      500-fold in medium, serially diluted in 0.2% DMSO in medium (to
      maintain constant solvent concentration), then 100 .mu.L aliquots
      were pipetted into microtiter plate wells (Costar3595).
      Provisional EC.sub.50 values were obtained in a survey of seven
      5-fold dilutions yielding final concentrations (in triplicate) of
      0.16-2500 ng/mL. Assays were later expanded to include ten
      concentrations (in quadruplicate) of approximately 1.8-fold
      dilutions which flank the provisional EC.sub.50. Plates included
      at least 8 wells of no drug controls (4 with and 4 without DMSO)
      and 4 wells of uninfected erythrocytes. Parasite culture (0.25%
      parasitemia in 2.4% hematocrit; 100 .mu.L per well) was added and
      the plate was incubated for 48 hours prior to the addition of 25
      .mu.L [.sup.3H]hypoxanthine (14.1 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/mL in 70%
      ethanol, New England Nuclear NET-177, diluted to 25 .mu.Ci/mL with
      medium) and subsequent 20 hour incubation. Cells were harvested
      (Brandel MB-48R) onto GF-C glass filters (Brandel). The filters
      were washed five times with 3 mL water per sample spot, dried
      under a heat lamp, and counted (Beckman Model LS-6500) in
      scintillation cocktail (ICN Cytoscint). <br>
      <br>
      Decays per minute (dpm) values were downloaded and analyzed (Power
      Macintosh 7200/90; Microsoft Excel 5.0), to yield the mean and
      standard deviation at each drug concentration. Dose-response
      curves were fit to the experimental data (Delta Point DeltaGraph
      3.5.3) by means of the Marquardt algorithm, were solved for the
      drug concentration that kills 50% of parasites, and were analyzed
      for goodness of fit (R.sup.2 value). <br>

      In sharp contrast to the potency of the natural trioxane
      artemisinin (IC.sub.50=7.7 nm) and of the initial olefinic dimer 3
      (IC.sub.50=24 nM), alcohol dimers 4 and 17, diol dimer 5 and
      ketone dimer 7 all have substantially enhanced potencies, with
      IC.sub.50 values below one nM. In addition, further derivitization
      of these potent antimalarials has produced a number of analogs
      also antimalarially active in sub-nanomolar concentrations (most
      notably: pyridine N-oxides 13, 15, 18, 23, 24 and 25, phosphoric
      acid triesters 26 and 27, sulfonamide 40 and cyclic carbonate 41).

      The in vivo antimalarial efficacies of water-soluble dimer
      carboxylic acids 8a-10c and 12b (11b not tested), as measured in
      mice according to a published protocol, are shown in Table II. In
      all cases, these water-soluble dimeric trioxanes are more
      efficacious than the drug candidate artelinic acid administered
      intravenously (IV) and than the clinically used drug sodium
      artesunate administered orally (PO). At an IV dose of 10 mg/kg of
      mouse body weight, each dimeric trioxane 8a-10c and 12b suppressed
      P. berghei NY malaria parasite growth considerably better
      (&gt;80%) than did artelinic acid or sodium artesunate. Neither
      overt toxicity nor behavioral modification was observed due to
      drug administration in any of these mouse experiments. <br>

      Growth Inhibition. To determine the growth inhibition (GI) and
      cytotoxicity of dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9, 10c, 11b, 12b, 13, and 14
      respectively, of the present invention, screening assays were
      performed by the National Cancer Institute using a 60 cell line
      panel; these activities are summarized in Tables III, IV and V
      (set out below). The screening assay is performed on 96-well
      microtitre plates. Relatively high initial inoculation densities
      are used, in order to permit measurement of "time-zero" values and
      to enhance the screen's ability to detect and provide some
      differentiation between growth inhibition and cytotoxic response
      parameters. The specific inoculation densities (which range from
      5,000 to 40,000 cells/well) used for each cell line are those
      which, for the respective line, were determined to give an optical
      density signal for both the "time-zero" value (at 24 hours) and
      the "no-drug" control (at 72 hours) above the noise level and
      within the linear range of the end-point assay (which measures
      cellular protein). The inoculated microtitre plates are
      pre-incubated for 24 hours at 37.degree. C. prior to drug
      additions. The five drug dilutions tested routinely range from
      10.sup.-4 to 10.sup.-8 molar. Higher or lower concentration ranges
      may be selected on a non-routine basis if appropriate solubility
      and/or prior biological information or other screening data so
      dictate. Duplicate wells are prepared for all concentrations,
      (concentration is often denoted by placing brackets around a
      number); "time-zero" and "no drug" controls are also provided for
      each test. The minimum amount of compound required for a one-time
      evaluation in the routine screen can be calculated from the
      knowledge that each test requires a total of approximately 40 ml
      (0.04 liter) of cell culture medium containing the highest desired
      drug concentration. Thus, the amount (grams) of sample required
      (assuming an upper test concentration limit of 10.sup.-4 M) is:
      molecular weight of compound.times.10.sup.-4.times.0.04. After a
      48 hour incubation (37.degree. C.) with the test compound, the
      cells are fixed in situ to the bottoms of the microtitre wells by
      addition of 50 .mu.l of either 50% trichloroacetic acid (for
      adherent cell lines) or 80% trichloroacetic acid (for settled cell
      suspension lines), followed by incubation for 60 minutes at
      4.degree. C. The cellular protein in each well is assayed using a
      sulforhodamine B (SRB) stain procedure. Briefly, after discarding
      the supernatants, the microtitre plates are washed 5 times with
      deionized water and air-dried. One hundred microliters of SRB
      solution (0.4% w/v in 1% acetic acid) is added to each microtitre
      well and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Unbound SRB
      is removed by washing 5 times with 1% acetic acid. The plates are
      air-dried, the bound stain is solubilized with Tris buffer, and
      the optical densities read at 515 nm. SRB is a bright pink anionic
      dye which, in dilute acetic acid, binds electrostatically to the
      basic amino acids of TCA-fixed cells. Cryopreserved master stocks
      of all the lines are maintained, and cultures used for screening
      are replaced from the master stock after no more than twenty
      passages in the screening laboratory. The cell line panel consists
      of 60 lines, organized into nine, disease-related subpanels
      including leukemia, non-small-cell lung cancer, colon, CNS,
      melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast cancers. <br>
      <br>
      The response parameters GI.sub.50 and LC.sub.50 are interpolated
      values representing the concentrations at which the percentage
      growth (PG) is +50 and -50, respectively: <br>
      <br>
      GI.sub.50 is the concentration for which the PG=+50. At this value
      the increase from time t.sub.zero, in the number or mass of cells
      in the test well is only 50% as much as the corresponding increase
      in the control well during this period of the experiment, see
      Table III. A drug effect of this intensity is interpreted as
      primary growth inhibition. <br>
      <br>
      TGI is the concentration for which PG=0. At this value the number
      or mass of cells in the well at the end of the experiment equals
      the number or mass of cells in the well at time t.sub.zero, see
      Table IV. A drug effect of this intensity is regarded as
      cytostasis. <br>
      <br>
      LC.sub.50 is the concentration for which the PG=-50. At this
      value, the number or mass of cells in the test well at the end of
      the experiment is half that at time t.sub.zero, see Table V. This
      is interpreted as cytotoxicity. <br>

      The data indicate that alcohol and diol dimers 4 and 5 are
      selectively and strongly inhibitory to leukemia cell line RPM
      1-8226, to melanoma cell line SK-MEL-5, and to renal cancer cell
      line ACHN. The epoxide dimer 6 and the ketone dimer 7 are less
      inhibitory. The data further indicate that the carboxylic acid
      derivatives 8a, 9, 10c, 11b, and 12b are also selectively and
      strong inhibitory to colon cancer KM12, ovarian cancer OVCAR 3,
      and to breast cancer MDA-MB-435. The data lastly indicate that the
      acetic acid derivative 12b is highly selective and especially
      inhibitory. <br>
      <br>
      The dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9, 10c, 11b and 12b of the present invention
      in most instances are as potent and in some instances more potent
      than paclitaxel. The data in Tables III, IV and V are graphically
      represented in FIGS. 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, 7j and 7k
      through FIGS. 15j. Dose response curves, shown in the above
      mentioned Figures, are obtained by exposing various cancer cell
      lines to compounds having a known concentration ([log.sub.10M]),
      as discussed in detail above, and then plotting the percentage
      growth of each cell line for each concentration. The drug
      concentration limits that are tested are between 10.sup.-4 or
      -4.00M and 10.sup.-9 or -9.00M. The -4.00M value being the high
      concentration and the -9.00M value being the low concentration.
      Percentage growth is determined by dividing the number or mass of
      cells in the test well by the number or mass of cells in a control
      well. Referring to the leukemia cell line MOLT-4 in FIGS. 7a, 7b,
      7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, 7j and 7k the first comparison that is
      made between artemisinin, paclitaxel, and the dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9,
      10c, 11b, and 12b of the present invention are the drug
      concentrations which are necessary to inhibit growth, graphically
      represented in FIGS. 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h, 7i, 7j and 7k
      as the concentration necessary to achieve the percentage growth
      value of +50. As discussed previously, the five drug dilutions
      routinely tested range from 10.sup.-4 to 10.sup.-9 molar.
      Therefore, concentrations less than or greater than 10.sup.-9 and
      10.sup.-4 molar, respectively, that are required to achieve a
      desired result are not determined. Referring now to FIG. 7a, some
      concentration of paclitaxel that is less than 10.sup.-8M is
      necessary to achieve primary growth inhibition; in fact the lower
      concentrations have been determined for this drug and the
      concentration at which primary growth inhibition occurs using
      paclitaxel is at 10.sup.-11 molar. FIG. 7b indicates that some
      concentration of artemisinin that is greater than 10.sup.-4 molar
      is necessary to achieve primary growth inhibition. Referring to
      the alcohol and diol trioxane dimers 4 and 5, dose response curves
      in FIGS. 7c and 7d, respectively, the leukemia cell line MOLT-4
      displays primary growth inhibition at drug concentrations that are
      less than 10.sup.-7 and less than 10.sup.-8 molar, respectively.
      Referring to the carboxylic acid derivatives 8a, 9, 10c, 11b and
      12b, dose response curves in FIGS. 7e, 7f, 7g, 7h and 7i,
      respectively, the leukemia cell line MOLT-4 displays primary
      growth inhibition at drug concentrations that are less than
      10.sup.-8, 10.sup.-5, 10.sup.-8 and 10.sup.-7 molar respectively.
      The drug concentration at which artemisinin is considered
      cytostatic, i.e., percentage growth is equal to 0, is at a
      concentration greater than 10.sup.-4 molar. The dimers 4, 5, 8a,
      9, 10c, 11b, and 12b reach cytostasis at some concentration
      greater than 10.sup.-4 M, while the paclitaxel concentration
      necessary to achieve cytostasis is also some value greater than
      10.sup.-4 M. Cytotoxicity, i.e., the concentration for which the
      percentage growth is equal to -50, occurs at a concentration
      greater than 10.sup.-4 M for paclitaxel, artemisinin, for both
      alcohol and diol trioxane dimers 4 and 5, and for carboxylic acid
      dimers 8a, 9, 10c, 11 and 12b, respectively. <br>
      <br>
      The potency of the dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9, 10c, 11b, and 12b,
      respectively, of the present invention as compared to artemisinin
      and paclitaxel varies from cell line to cell line. The mean values
      for each drug are presented at the end Tables III, IV and V and
      the dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9, 10c, 11b, and 12b of the present invention
      are more potent than artemisinin and equivalent to and in many
      instances higher in potency than paclitaxel. <br>
      <br>
      The dihydroartemisinin dimer disclosed by M. Cao, et al., and
      tested by D. L. Klayman and H. J. Woerdenbag, discussed
      previously, was approximately twenty-two times more potent at
      causing 50% growth inhibition in one cancer cell line than
      artemisinin. With respect to the drug concentrations causing 50%
      growth inhibition, the dimers 4, 5, 8a, 9, 10c, 11b, and 12b were
      at least 100 times more potent than artemisinin. When interpreting
      the mean values, it is important to take into consideration that
      drug concentrations less than 10.sup.-9M and greater then 10M were
      not collected, and this factor is reflected in the range. <br>
      <br>

      the present invention on various cancer cell lines versus the
      effects of artemisinin and paclitaxel on the same cell lines see

        Anti-Malarial Compounds in Male CD-1 Mice </span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the relative toxicity
      of four structurally similar anti-malarial compounds (13, 16, 19,
      and sodium artesunate) following a single intraperitoneal (ip)
      injection. This study was not performed in compliance with the
      U.S. FDA "Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory
      Studies" (GLP) as described in 21 CFR Part 58; however,
      documentation of all procedures and quality control checking of
      data was performed as for GLP studies. <br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A. Test Article and Dose
        Preparation </span><br>
      <br>
      Compounds 13, 16, 19 and sodium artesunate (Mepha Ltd., Lot No.
      1), were provided by NIAID via McKesson BioServices HBOC
      (Rockville, Md.). Each compound was dissolved in DMSO (Mallinkrodt
      Lot No. V18H15) to achieve a concentration of 200 mg/ml, and then
      3 parts sesame oil (Spectrum Lot No. M10656) was added to make a
      working concentration of 50 mg/ml for dose administration.
      Stability, strength, and uniformity of the test articles in the
      dose formulations were not determined for this study. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">B. Test System </span><br>
      <br>
      Forty-two CD1 male mice purchased from Charles River Laboratories
      (Wilmington, Mass.) were used in the study. Mice were quarantined
      for 3 days prior to initiation of the study. General procedures
      for animal care and housing were in accordance with the National
      Research Council (NRC) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
      Animals (1996) and the animal welfare standards incorporated in 9
      CFR Part 3, 1991. Mice were approximately 6 weeks old and weighed
      25.2-31.2 g at study initiation. They were individually housed
      under a 12 hr light-dark cycle, with a temperature range of
      68-72.degree. F. and 33-67% humidity. Purina Certified Rodent Chow
      #5002 and purified tap water were available ad libitum. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">C. Experimental Design and Data
        Collection </span><br>
      <br>
      Mice were weighed and randomized into treatment groups on the day
      prior to the first dose administration. Due to limitations in the
      amount of available test materials, fewer mice in 1000 mg/kg
      groups were treated than specified in the protocol. The numbers of
      animals intended to be used and actually used with each compound
      at each dose level are shown in the table below; the only
      differences are in the high-dose groups. <br>
      <br>
      Mice were administered either compounds 13, 16,19 or sodium
      artesunate once ip at does levels at 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg.
      Control animals were administered a vehicle solution (25% DMSO and
      75% sesame oil) at a volume of 20 ml/kg. Surviving animals were
      sacrificed on Day 8 and blood was collected for clinical pathology
      evaluations. <br>
      <br>
      Clinical signs were observed daily, including evaluation of the
      injection site 1 to 2 hr. after treatment on Day 1 and once daily
      on Days 2-8. Mortality and morbidity were checked twice daily on
      weekdays and once daily on the weekend, see Table VI. Animals were
      weighed daily and prior to necropsy. <br>

      In conclusion, new C-10 non-acetal trioxane dimer 3, easily
      prepared on gram scale and thermally stable, can be used to make a
      diverse series of 3-carbon atom linked, oxygenated dimers 4-7
      without destroying the critical pharmacophore peroxide bond. Each
      of the new trioxane dimers 4, 5, and 7 is 10 times more
      antimalarially potent in vitro than the natural trioxane
      artemisinin (I), and alcohol and diol dimers 4 and 5 are strongly
      inhibitory but not cytotoxic toward several human cancer cell
      lines. Moreover, water-soluble trioxane dimers 8a-10c and 12b are
      orally active new antimalarials that are more efficacious than
      artelinic acid and than sodium artesunate in mice. These
      semi-synthetic new chemical entities 4 and 5 and especially 8a-10c
      and 12b, therefore, deserve further preclinical evaluation as
      potential drug candidates for chemotherapy of malaria and cancer.
      Dimers 13 and 19 are more efficacious (when administered both
      orally and i.v.) and less toxic (when administered
      intraperitoneally to mice as a single dose) than clinically-used
      sodium artesunate, thereby giving them a better antimalarial
      therapeutic index than sodium artesunate. <br>

      Unless otherwise noted, reactions were run in oven-dried glassware
      under an atmosphere of argon. Diethyl ether (ether) and
      tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled from sodium benzophenone
      ketyl prior to use. Methylene chloride (CH.sub.2Cl.sub.2) was
      distilled from calcium hydride prior to use. All other compounds
      were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and used without
      further purification. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
      was conducted with Silica Gel 60 F254 plates (250 micrometer
      thickness, Merck). Column chromatography was performed using flash
      silica gel (particle size 400-230 mesh). Yields are not optimized.
      Purity of final products was judged to be &gt;95% based on their
      chromatographic homogeneity. High performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) was carried out with a Rainin HPLX system
      equipped with two 25 mL/min preparative pump heads using a Rainin
      Dynamax 10 mm.times.250 mm (semi-preparative) column packed with
      60 .ANG. silica gel (8 .mu.m pore size) as bare silica. Melting
      points were measured using a Mel-Temp metal-block apparatus and
      are uncorrected. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
      obtained on a Varian XL-400 spectrometer, operating at 400 MHz for
      .sup.1H, 162 MHz for .sup.31P 100 MHz for .sup.13C. .sup.1H and
      .sup.13C chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm)
      downfield from tetramethylsilane, .sup.31P chemical shifts are
      measured using 85% phosphoric acid as an external reference.
      Splitting patterns are described as singlet(s), doublet(d),
      triplet(t), quartet(q), quintet (qt), sextet (st), multiplet (m)
      and broad (br). Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using a
      Perkin-Elmer 1600 FT-IR spectrometer. Resonances are reported in
      wavenumbers (cm.sup.-1). Low and high resolution mass spectra
      (LRMS and HRMS) were obtained with electronic or chemical
      ionization (El or Cl) either (1) at Johns Hopkins University on a
      VG Instruments 70-S Spectrometer run at 70 eV for El and run with
      ammonia (NH.sub.3), butane (C4H.sub.10) or methane (CH.sub.4) as
      carrier gas for Cl or (2) at Ohio State University with a 3-Tesla
      Finnigan FTMS-2000 Fourier Transform mass spectrometer. Samples
      were sprayed from a commercial Analytica electrospray ionization
      source, and then focused into the FTMS cell using a home-built set
      of ion optics. For ESI analysis, most compounds were sprayed from
      a micromolar concentration of the analyte in various solvent
      mixtures, such as tetrahydrofuran/CH.sub.3OH, with added NaCl.
      This process generated the sodiated molecular ion (usually as the
      singly-charged species), denoted as (M+Na).sup.+. But in some
      cases, acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid was used to generate
      the protonated molecular ion (M+H)+ instead. Electron impact (El)
      ionization was performed with a Kratos MS-25, using 70 eV
      ionization conditions. Combustion analyses were conducted by
      Atlantic Microlab (Norcross, Ga.). Various methods of purifying
      the products of the present invention are known and understood by
      those skilled in the art and the purification methods presented in
      the Examples is solely listed by way of example and is not
      intended to limit the invention. <br>

      .about.9 mmol) and continued stirring for a further 1 hour.
      Methylene chloride (5 mL) and water (5 mL) were added and organics

      nicotinic acid N-oxide (21.5 mg, 0.155 mmol) in anhydrous

      (22.0 mg, 0.180 mmol) and
      1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride
      (34.5 mg, 0.180 mmol). A further 1 mL of anhydrous methylene
      chloride was added to wash down the flask walls and the reaction
      was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, at which time TLC
      analysis showed full consumption of starting material. Water (5
      mL), 3M HCl solution (5 mL) and methylene chloride (5 mL) were
      added and organics were extracted with methylene chloride
      (3.times.20 mL), dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and concentrated in
      vacuo to give a colorless oil. Gradient column chromatography on
      silica (crude was dry-loaded) eluting firstly with 100% ethyl
      acetate and then with 5% methanol/ethyl acetate isolated
      bis-trioxane secondary alcohol nicotinate N-oxide 25 as a
