      A prototype "water chip" developed by researchers at The
      University of Texas at Austin in collaboration with a startup
      company.<br>
      <br>
      By creating a small electrical field that removes salts from
      seawater, chemists at The University of Texas at Austin and the
      University of Marburg in Germany have introduced a new method for
      the desalination of seawater that consumes less energy and is
      dramatically simpler than conventional techniques. The new method
      requires so little energy that it can run on a store-bought
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      The process evades the problems confronting current desalination
      methods by eliminating the need for a membrane and by separating
      salt from water at a microscale.<br>
      <br>
      The technique, called electrochemically mediated seawater
      desalination, was described last week in the journal Angewandte
      Chemie. The research team was led by Richard Crooks of The
      University of Texas at Austin and Ulrich Tallarek of the
      University of Marburg. It’s patent-pending and is in commercial
      development by startup company Okeanos Technologies.<br>
      <br>
      “The availability of water for drinking and crop irrigation is one
      of the most basic requirements for maintaining and improving human
      health,” said Crooks, the Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry in
      the College of Natural Sciences. “Seawater desalination is one way
      to address this need, but most current methods for desalinating
      water rely on expensive and easily contaminated membranes. The
      membrane-free method we’ve developed still needs to be refined and
      scaled up, but if we can succeed at that, then one day it might be
      possible to provide fresh water on a massive scale using a simple,
      even portable, system.”<br>
      <br>
      This new method holds particular promise for the water-stressed
      areas in which about a third of the planet’s inhabitants live.
      Many of these regions have access to abundant seawater but not to
      the energy infrastructure or money necessary to desalt water using
      conventional technology. As a result, millions of deaths per year
      in these regions are attributed to water-related causes.<br>
      <br>
      “People are dying because of a lack of freshwater,” said Tony
      Frudakis, founder and CEO of Okeanos Technologies. “And they’ll
      continue to do so until there is some kind of breakthrough, and
      that is what we are hoping our technology will represent.”<br>
      desalination<br>
      <br>
      The left panel shows the salt (which is tagged with a fluorescent
      tracer) flowing upward after a voltage is applied by an electrode
      (the dark rectangle) jutting into the channel at just the point
      where it branches. In the right panel no voltage is being applied.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve desalination, the researchers apply a small voltage
      (3.0 volts) to a plastic chip filled with seawater. The chip
      contains a microchannel with two branches. At the junction of the
      channel an embedded electrode neutralizes some of the chloride
      ions in seawater to create an “ion depletion zone” that increases
      the local electric field compared with the rest of the channel.
      This change in the electric field is sufficient to redirect salts
      into one branch, allowing desalinated water to pass through the
      other branch.<br>
      <br>
      “The neutralization reaction occurring at the electrode is key to
      removing the salts in seawater,” said Kyle Knust, a graduate
      student in Crooks’ lab and first author on the paper.<br>
      <br>
      Like a troll at the foot of the bridge, the ion depletion zone
      prevents salt from passing through, resulting in the production of
      freshwater.<br>
      <br>
      Thus far Crooks and his colleagues have achieved 25 percent
      desalination. Although drinking water requires 99 percent
      desalination, they are confident that goal can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      “This was a proof of principle,” said Knust. “We’ve made
      comparable performance improvements while developing other
      applications based on the formation of an ion depletion zone. That
      suggests that 99 percent desalination is not beyond our reach.”<br>
      <br>
      The other major challenge is to scale up the process. Right now
      the microchannels, about the size of a human hair, produce about
      40 nanoliters of desalted water per minute. To make this technique
      practical for individual or communal use, a device would have to
      produce liters of water per day. The authors are confident that
      this can be achieved as well.<br>
      <br>
      If these engineering challenges are surmounted, they foresee a
      future in which the technology is deployed at different scales to
      meet different needs.<br>
      <br>
      “You could build a disaster relief array or a municipal-scale
      unit,” said Frudakis. “Okeanos has even contemplated building a
      small system that would look like a Coke machine and would operate
      in a standalone fashion to produce enough water for a small
      village.”<br>
      <br>
      The fundamental scientific breakthroughs that led to this advance
      were primarily supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences in
      the U.S. Department of Energy. Okeanos Technologies is funded by
      venture capital and grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection
      Agency. The intellectual property is owned by The University of
      Texas at Austin through the Office of Technology Commercialization
      (OTC). In the event of eventual profits, patent holders, including
      Crooks and Knust, will be paid according to the OTC’s standard
      licensing agreement. Okeanos Technologies is also currently
      supporting Knust’s stipend and tuition via a gift to UT. <br>

      Okeanos was formed in 2010 to develop a next-generation,
      ultra-efficient desalination technology to address our planets
      chronic and increasingly alarming fresh water shortages. Our
      WaterChip™ platform represents a “solid-state” alternative to
      present-day approaches for creating fresh water from seawater and
      brackish aquifer sources. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="center"><big><b>Our Technology</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      OKEANOS TECHNOLOGIES WAS FOUNDED ON THE BELIEF THAT THE WORLD
      NEEDS A NEW CLEAN-ENERGY DESALINATION FUTURE AND THAT ARRIVING AT
      THIS FUTURE WILL REQUIRE MASSIVELY PARALLEL DESALINATION (MPD)].<br>
      <br>
      We believe the evolution of desalination technology requires a
      completely new way of thinking. Rather than reflexive, incremental
      improvements to existing but fundamentally inefficient technology
      platforms, we need to re-conceptualize the entire problem from
      different scales of perspective, using entirely new approaches and
      alternative modes of engineering.<br>
      <br>
      Okeanos Technologies is the first to have done this.<br>
      <br>
      The Okeanos WaterChip™ is a solid-state, Massively Paralleled
      Desalination (MPD) platform that employs a newly characterized,
      patent-pending micro-electrochemical process to desalinate with
      radical energy-efficiency. We desalinate millionths of a liter at
      a time – that is, we “Microdesalinate” – and we do this using tiny
      microstructures, which are then massively paralleled to produce
      useful water flows. Desalination in tiny volumes allows us exploit
      a form of energy that simply cannot be generated in “macroscale”
      (e.g. liters of space). This form of energy is called an
      “electrochemical field gradient” and using it to do the “work” of
      desalination is advantageous because this work is limited by
      electron rather than ion-transfer kinetics, making it far more
      efficient than those processes that function in the dimensions of
      space you are used to thinking about - such as Reverse Osmosis,
      Electrodialysis or heat/evaporative based methods.<br>
      <br>
      To put all of this another way, we are in essence exploiting the
      power of the electron to harness and redirect the built-in,
      corrosive energy of seawater towards the useful task of
      desalination, and we do this in very tiny volumes.<br>
      <br>
      BENEFITS OF WATERCHIP™ TECHNOLOGY:<br>
      <br>
      COST-EFFECTIVENESS – World-record desalination efficiency =
      dramatic reduction in operational expenses.<br>
      RELEVANCE – Cost-effective desalination will provide profound
      economic, political, environmental and humanitarian benefits
      across the globe.<br>
      ELEGANCE – Operation without extreme hydraulic pressures, massive
      electrical currents or intense heat sources make for simple,
      compact installations with small system footprint.<br>
      CLEANLINESS – Operation on alternative energy sources, and/or
      reduced burden on dirty, coal-powered grid energy results in
      direct environmental benefits.<br>
      FEASIBILITY-- Pretreatment. No membranes means minimal
      pretreatment required other than basic sedimentation. Elimination
      of the need for chemicals, filters, treatment ponds etc. results
      in massive capital and effective operational savings. Post
      treatment. No post treatment required. Complete disinfection,
      de-boronation, and heavy metals removal without the use of
      chemicals, which have to be added and then removed with other
      technologies in expensive (capex/opex) multi-stage processes.
      Maintenance. No membranes also means no fouling and the
      minimization of maintenance capital and labor.<br>
      SCALABILITY -- Operating expense scales linearly with output rates
      – unlike other technologies which require massive operational
      economies of scale and capital accessories (e.g. energy recovery
      systems) to reach what might loosely be called “economic
      competitiveness”. Highly modular framework – systems to address
      from small to large scale (e.g. municipal) needs.<br>
      FLEXIBILITY – On demand programmability for seawater vs. brackish
      waters means no need for source water dependent
      configuration/equipment, further enhancing effective operating
      efficiencies.<br>
      SAFETY -- Bacteria, viruses and particulates are removed as
      efficiently as salt, without the use of expensive and cumbersome
      coagulants or chemicals -- On demand monitoring of system
      performance in real time<br>
      DURABILITY – no moving parts, no extreme operating conditions
      (e.g. hydraulic pressures or voltages).<br>
      MANUFACTURABILITY – recent advances in microelectronics
      fabrication and proprietary designs translate into capital (e.g.
      system purchase) expenses on par with today’s technologies.<br>

      [0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional
      Application No. 61/740,780, filed Dec. 21, 2012, which is hereby
      incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      <b>STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention was made with Government Support under
      Agreement DE-FG02-06ER15758 awarded by the U.S. Department of
      Energy, and Contract EP-D-12-026 awarded by the U.S. Environmental
      Protection Agency. The Government has certain rights in the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] This application relates generally to devices, systems, and
      methods for the desalination of water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The global demand for freshwater is growing rapidly. Many
      conventional sources of freshwater, including lakes, rivers, and
      aquifers, are rapidly becoming depleted. As a consequence,
      freshwater is becoming a limited resource in many regions. In
      fact, the United Nations estimates two-thirds of the world's
      population could be living in water stressed regions by 2025.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Currently, approximately 97% of the world's water supply is
      present as seawater. Desalination-the process by which salinated
      water (e.g., seawater) is converted to fresh water-offers the
      potential to provide dependable supplies of freshwater suitable
      for human consumption or irrigation. Unfortunately, existing
      desalination processes, including distillation and reverse
      osmosis, require both large amounts of energy and specialized,
      expensive infrastructure. As a consequence, desalination is
      currently expensive compared to most conventional sources of
      water, and often prohibitively expensive in developing regions of
      the world. Therefore, only a small fraction of total human water
      use is currently satisfied by desalination. More energy efficient
      methods for water desalination offer the potential to address the
      increasing demands for freshwater, particularly in water stressed
      regions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Disclosed are microfluidic devices and systems for the
      desalination of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Microfluidic devices for the desalination of water can
      comprise a desalination unit. The desalination unit can comprise
      an inlet channel fluidly connected to a dilute outlet channel and
      a concentrated outlet channel. The dilute outlet channel and the
      concentrated outlet channel can diverge from the inlet channel at
      an intersection. The desalination unit can further comprise an
      electrode in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit.
      The electrode can be configured to generate an electric field
      gradient in proximity to the intersection where dilute outlet
      channel and concentrated outlet channel diverge from the inlet
      channel. Under an applied bias and in the presence of a flow of
      saltwater, the electric field gradient can preferentially direct
      ions in the saltwater into concentrated outlet channel, while
      desalted water flows into the dilute outlet channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In some embodiments, the microfluidic device can further
      include an auxiliary channel fluidly isolated from the
      desalination unit. The auxiliary channel can be electrochemically
      connected to the desalination unit via a bipolar electrode. In
      these cases, the bipolar electrode can be configured to be in
      electrochemical contact with both the desalination unit and the
      auxiliary channel. Under an applied bias across the auxiliary
      channel and the desalination unit and in the presence of a flow of
      saltwater, the electric field gradient can preferentially direct
      ions in the saltwater into concentrated outlet channel of the
      desalination unit, while desalted water flows into the dilute
      outlet channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In some embodiments, the auxiliary channel comprises a
      desalination unit. In these embodiments, the microfluidic device
      can comprise two desalination units, which can be of identical or
      different structure. The first desalination unit can be
      electrochemically connected to the second desalination unit by a
      bipolar electrode. Under an applied bias across the first
      desalination unit and the second desalination unit and in the
      presence of a pressure driven flow of saltwater, the electric
      field gradient can preferentially direct ions in the saltwater
      into concentrated outlet channels of the first and second
      desalination units, while desalted water flows into the dilute
      outlet channels of the first and second desalination units.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A plurality of the microfluidic devices described herein
      can be combined to form a water purification system. The system
      can comprise a plurality of the devices described herein arranged
      in parallel or fluidly connected in series. The systems can also
      comprise a plurality of devices both arranged in parallel and
      fluidly connected in series. For example, the device can include a
      first pair of devices fluidly connected in series which are
      arranged in parallel with a second pair of devices fluidly
      connected in series. In such systems, the plurality of devices can
      be fabricated in a single plane (i.e., as a 2-dimensional system)
      or in three dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Also provided are methods of using the devices and systems
      described herein to decrease the salinity of water.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0023] Disclosed are microfluidic devices and systems for the
      desalination of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Microfluidic devices for the desalination of water can
      comprise a desalination unit. The desalination unit can comprise
      an inlet channel fluidly connected to a dilute outlet channel and
      a concentrated outlet channel. The dilute outlet channel and the
      concentrated outlet channel can diverge from the inlet channel at
      an intersection. The desalination unit can also comprise an
      electrode in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit.
      The electrode can be configured to generate an electric field
      gradient in proximity to the intersection where dilute outlet
      channel and concentrated outlet channel diverge from the inlet
      channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] An example device comprising a desalination unit ( 100) is
      schematically illustrated in FIG. 1A. The desalination unit
      includes an inlet channel ( 102) fluidly connected to a dilute
      outlet channel ( 104) and a concentrated outlet channel ( 106).
      The dilute outlet channel ( 104) and the concentrated outlet
      channel ( 106) diverge from the inlet channel ( 102) at an
      intersection ( 107). An electrode ( 108) is positioned in
      proximity to the intersection ( 107). The electrode ( 108) is
      configured to form an ion depletion zone ( 109) at and downstream
      of the electrode during device operation, resulting in the
      formation of an electric field gradient in proximity to the
      intersection. The example device further includes a fluid
      reservoir ( 110) fluidly connected to the upstream terminus of the
      inlet channel ( 102), a fluid reservoir ( 114) fluidly connected
      to the downstream terminus of the dilute outlet channel ( 104),
      and a fluid reservoir ( 112) fluidly connected to the downstream
      terminus of the concentrated outlet channel ( 106).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The dimensions of the microfluidic channels in the
      desalination unit ( 100) (e.g., the inlet channel ( 102), the
      dilute outlet channel ( 104), and the concentrated outlet channel
      ( 106)) can individually and/or in combination be selected in view
      of a number of factors, including the size and position of the
      electrode relative to the microfluidic channels in the
      desalination unit, the desired device flow rate, salinity of the
      saltwater being treated using the device, and the desired degree
      of salinity reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In some instances, the dimensions of the inlet channel (
      102), the dilute outlet channel ( 104), and the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 106) are selected such that the sum of the area
      of a cross-section of dilute outlet channel and the area of a
      cross-section of the concentrated outlet channel is substantially
      equal to the area of a cross-section of the inlet channel. In this
      context, substantially equal can mean that the sum of the area of
      a cross-section of dilute outlet channel and the area of a
      cross-section of the concentrated outlet channel is with for
      example, 15%, of the area of a cross-section of the inlet channel
      (e.g., within 10% of the area of a cross-section of the inlet
      channel, or within 5% of the area of a cross-section of the inlet
      channel). In some embodiments, the dilute outlet channel, and the
      concentrated outlet channel have substantially equivalent
      cross-sectional dimensions, meaning that the height and width of
      the dilute outlet channel are substantially equivalent (e.g.,
      within 15%, within 10%, or within 5%) to the height and width of
      the concentrated outlet channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The dimensions of the microfluidic channels in the
      desalination unit ( 100) (e.g., the inlet channel ( 102), the
      dilute outlet channel ( 104), and the concentrated outlet channel
      ( 106)) can be fabricated so as to have a variety of
      cross-sectional shapes. In some embodiments, the microfluidic
      channels in the desalination unit (e.g., the inlet channel, the
      dilute outlet channel, and the concentrated outlet channel) have a
      substantially square or rectangular cross-sectional shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In some embodiments, the inlet channel ( 102) has a width
      of about 1000 microns or less (e.g., about 900 microns or less,
      about 800 microns or less, about 750 microns or less, about 700
      microns or less, about 600 microns or less, about 500 microns or
      less, about 400 microns or less, about 300 microns or less, about
      250 microns or less, about 200 microns or less, about 150 microns
      or less, about 100 microns or less, about 75 microns or less, or
      about 50 microns or less). In some embodiments, the inlet channel
      ( 102) has a width of at least about 1 micron (e.g., at least
      about 5 microns, at least about 10 microns, at least about 15
      microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about 25 microns, at
      least about 50 microns, at least about 75 microns, at least about
      100 microns, at least about 150 microns, at least about 200
      microns, at least about 250 microns, at least about 300 microns,
      at least about 400 microns, at least about 500 microns, at least
      about 600 microns, at least about 700 microns, at least about 750
      microns, at least about 800 microns, at least about 900 microns,
      or at least about 1000 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The inlet channel ( 102) can have a width that ranges from
      any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum dimensions
      described above. For example, the inlet channel ( 102) can have a
      width that ranges from about 1000 microns to about 1 micron (e.g.,
      from about 750 microns to about 5 microns, from about 500 microns
      to about 10 microns, from about 250 microns to about 20 microns,
      or from about 150 microns to about 25 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In some embodiments, the inlet channel ( 102) has a height
      of about 50 microns or less (e.g., about 45 microns or less, about
      40 microns or less, about 35 microns or less, about 30 microns or
      less, about 25 microns or less, about 20 microns or less, about 15
      microns or less, about 10 microns or less, about 9 microns or
      less, about 8 microns or less, about 7.5 microns or less, about 7
      microns or less, about 6 microns or less, about 5 microns or less,
      about 4 microns or less, about 3 microns or less, about 2.5
      microns or less, or about 2 microns or less). In some embodiments,
      the inlet channel ( 102) has a height of at least about 1 micron
      (e.g., at least about 2 microns, at least about 2.5 microns, at
      least about 3 microns, at least about 4 microns, at least about 5
      microns, at least about 6 microns, at least about 7 microns, at
      least about 7.5 microns, at least about 8 microns, at least about
      9 microns, at least about 10 microns, at least about 15 microns,
      at least about 20 microns, at least about 25 microns, at least
      about 30 microns, at least about 35 microns, at least about 40
      microns, or at least about 45 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The inlet channel ( 102) can have a height that ranges from
      any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum dimensions
      described above. For example, the inlet channel ( 102) can have a
      height that ranges from about 50 microns to about 1 micron (e.g.,
      from about 45 microns to about 1 micron, from about 40 microns to
      about 1 micron, from about 35 microns to about 1 micron, from
      about 30 microns to about 1 micron, from about 25 microns to about
      1 micron, or from about 20 microns to about 1 micron).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In some embodiments, the dilute outlet channel ( 104) has a
      width of about 500 microns or less (e.g., about 450 microns or
      less, about 400 microns or less, about 350 microns or less, about
      300 microns or less, about 250 microns or less, about 200 microns
      or less, about 150 microns or less, about 125 microns or less,
      about 100 microns or less, about 75 microns or less, about 50
      microns or less, about 25 microns or less, about 20 microns or
      less, about 15 microns or less, about 10 microns or less, about 5
      microns or less, or about 1 micron or less). In some embodiments,
      the dilute outlet channel ( 104) has a width of at least about 0.5
      microns (e.g., at least about 1 micron, at least about 2.5
      microns, at least about 5 microns, at least about 10 microns, at
      least about 15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about
      25 microns, at least about 50 microns, at least about 75 microns,
      at least about 100 microns, at least about 150 microns, at least
      about 200 microns, at least about 250 microns, at least about 300
      microns, at least about 400 microns, or at least about 450
      microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The dilute outlet channel ( 104) can have a width that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the dilute outlet channel
      ( 104) can have a width that ranges from about 500 microns to
      about 0.5 microns (e.g., from about 400 microns to about 1 micron,
      from about 250 microns to about 1 micron, from about 150 microns
      to about 5 microns, or from about 80 microns to about 10 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In some embodiments, the dilute outlet channel ( 104) has a
      height of about 50 microns or less (e.g., about 45 microns or
      less, about 40 microns or less, about 35 microns or less, about 30
      microns or less, about 25 microns or less, about 20 microns or
      less, about 15 microns or less, about 10 microns or less, about 9

      microns or less, about 4 microns or less, about 3 microns or less,
      about 2.5 microns or less, or about 2 microns or less). In some
      embodiments, the dilute outlet channel ( 104) has a height of at
      least about 1 micron (e.g., at least about 2 microns, at least
      about 2.5 microns, at least about 3 microns, at least about 4
      microns, at least about 5 microns, at least about 6 microns, at
      least about 7 microns, at least about 7.5 microns, at least about
      8 microns, at least about 9 microns, at least about 10 microns, at
      least about 15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about
      25 microns, at least about 30 microns, at least about 35 microns,
      at least about 40 microns, or at least about 45 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The dilute outlet channel ( 104) can have a height that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the dilute outlet channel
      ( 104) can have a height that ranges from about 50 microns to
      about 1 micron (e.g., from about 45 microns to about 1 micron,
      from about 40 microns to about 1 micron, from about 35 microns to
      about 1 micron, from about 30 microns to about 1 micron, from
      about 25 microns to about 1 micron, or from about 20 microns to
      about 1 micron).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In some embodiments, the concentrated outlet channel ( 106)
      has a width of about 500 microns or less (e.g., about 450 microns
      or less, about 400 microns or less, about 350 microns or less,
      about 300 microns or less, about 250 microns or less, about 200
      microns or less, about 150 microns or less, about 125 microns or

      less, about 15 microns or less, about 10 microns or less, about 5
      microns or less, or about 1 micron or less). In some embodiments,
      the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) has a width of at least
      about 0.5 microns (e.g., at least about 1 micron, at least about
      2.5 microns, at least about 5 microns, at least about 10 microns,
      at least about 15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least
      about 25 microns, at least about 50 microns, at least about 75
      microns, at least about 100 microns, at least about 150 microns,
      at least about 200 microns, at least about 250 microns, at least
      about 300 microns, at least about 400 microns, or at least about
      450 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The concentrated outlet channel ( 106) can have a width
      that ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the
      maximum dimensions described above. For example, the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 106) can have a width that ranges from about 500
      microns to about 0.5 microns (e.g., from about 400 microns to
      about 1 micron, from about 250 microns to about 1 micron, from
      about 150 microns to about 5 microns, or from about 80 microns to
      about 10 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In some embodiments, the concentrated outlet channel ( 106)
      has a height of about 50 microns or less (e.g., about 45 microns
      or less, about 40 microns or less, about 35 microns or less, about
      30 microns or less, about 25 microns or less, about 20 microns or
      less, about 15 microns or less, about 10 microns or less, about 9
      microns or less, about 8 microns or less, about 7.5 microns or
      less, about 7 microns or less, about 6 microns or less, about 5
      microns or less, about 4 microns or less, about 3 microns or less,
      about 2.5 microns or less, or about 2 microns or less). In some
      embodiments, the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) has a height
      of at least about 1 micron (e.g., at least about 2 microns, at
      least about 2.5 microns, at least about 3 microns, at least about
      4 microns, at least about 5 microns, at least about 6 microns, at
      least about 7 microns, at least about 7.5 microns, at least about
      8 microns, at least about 9 microns, at least about 10 microns, at
      least about 15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about
      25 microns, at least about 30 microns, at least about 35 microns,
      at least about 40 microns, or at least about 45 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The concentrated outlet channel ( 106) can have a height
      that ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the
      maximum dimensions described above. For example, the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 106) can have a height that ranges from about 50
      microns to about 1 micron (e.g., from about 45 microns to about 1
      micron, from about 40 microns to about 1 micron, from about 35
      microns to about 1 micron, from about 30 microns to about 1
      micron, from about 25 microns to about 1 micron, or from about 20
      microns to about 1 micron).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The length of the microfluidic channels in the desalination
      unit ( 100) (e.g., the inlet channel ( 102), the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104), and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106)) can
      vary. The length of the microfluidic channels in the desalination
      unit can individually be selected in view of a number of the
      overall device design and other operational considerations. In
      some embodiments, the inlet channel ( 102), the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104), and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) each
      have a length of at least about 0.1 cm (e.g., at least about 0.2
      cm, at least about 0.3 cm, at least about 0.4 cm, at least about
      0.5 cm, at least about 0.6 cm, at least about 0.7 cm, at least
      about 0.8 cm, at least about 0.9 cm, at least about 1 cm, at least
      about 2 cm, at least about 2.5 cm, at least about 3 cm, at least
      about 4 cm, at least about 5 cm, or longer). The microfluidic
      channels in the desalination unit can be substantially linear in
      shape, or they can possess one or more non-linear regions (e.g., a
      curved region, a spiral region, an angular region, or combinations
      thereof) along the length of their fluid flow path.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] With reference again to FIG. 1A, the dilute outlet channel
      ( 104) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) diverge from the
      inlet channel ( 102) at an intersection ( 107). The orientation of
      the dilute outlet channel ( 104) and the concentrated outlet
      channel ( 106) with respect to one another at the intersection can
      be varied. The angle formed between the dilute outlet channel (
      104) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) in a device can be
      selected in view of a number of parameters, including the size and
      position of the electrode relative to the microfluidic channels in
      the desalination unit, the desired device flow rate, salinity of
      the saltwater being treated using the device, and the desired
      degree of salinity reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In some cases, the angle formed between the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) at the
      intersection ( 107) is about 60 degrees or less (e.g., about 55
      degrees or less, about 50 degrees or less, about 45 degrees or
      less, about 40 degrees or less, about 35 degrees or less, about 30
      degrees or less, about 25 degrees or less, about 20 degrees or
      less, about 15 degrees or less, or less).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The electrode ( 108) can be fabricated from any suitable
      conductive material, such as a metal (e.g., gold), metal alloy,
      metal oxide, or conductive carbon. The electrode ( 108) is
      configured so as to be in electrochemical contact with the
      desalination unit ( 100), meaning that the electrode ( 108) can
      participate in a faradaic reaction with one or more components of
      a solution present in a microfluidic channel of the desalination
      unit. For example, the electrode ( 108) can be configured such
      that a surface of the electrode is in direct contact with fluid
      present in a microfluidic channel of the desalination unit. The
      device can be configured such that the electrode ( 108) can
      function as either an anode, cathode, or anode and cathode during
      device operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The position and dimensions of the electrode ( 108)
      relative to the desalination unit can be selected in view of a
      number of factors, including the size and configuration of the
      microfluidic channels in the desalination unit, the desired device
      flow rate, salinity of the saltwater being treated using the
      device, and the desired degree of salinity reduction. The
      electrode ( 108) can have a variety of 2-dimensional or
      3-dimensional shapes, provided that the electrode ( 108) can be
      integrated into the device, and is compatible with the formation
      of an electric field gradient suitable to direct ions flowing
      through the inlet channel ( 102) preferentially into the
      concentrated outlet channel ( 106). In certain embodiments, the
      electrode ( 108) is a conductive surface (e.g., a line, a
      rectangular pad, or a square pad) substantially co-planar with the
      floor of the inlet channel ( 102), and integrated into the floor
      of the inlet channel in proximity to the intersection ( 107). In
      other embodiments, the electrode ( 108) is a conductive surface
      (e.g., a line, a rectangular pad, or a square pad) that is
      fabricated onto/into the floor of the inlet channel in proximity
      to the intersection ( 107), and which extends from the floor of
      the inlet channel into the inlet channel. In these embodiments,
      the electrode can be said to have a height, measured as the
      distance from the floor of the inlet channel to the surface or
      edge of the electrode within the inlet channel positioned at
      greatest distance from the floor of the inlet channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] With reference again to FIG. 1A, the electrode ( 108) can
      be positioned in proximity to the intersection ( 107) so as to
      form an ion depletion zone ( 109) at and downstream of the
      electrode ( 108), and extending into the dilute outlet channel (
      104) during device operation. The ion depletion zone ( 109) can
      optionally extend into a portion of the concentrated inlet channel
      ( 106). In some embodiments, the electrode ( 108) is positioned
      within the floor of the inlet channel ( 102) upstream of the
      opening of the dilute outlet channel ( 104).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] By way of exemplification, FIG. 1B illustrates an enlarged
      view of the intersection ( 107) of the device shown in FIG. 1A.
      The electrode ( 108) is positioned within the floor of the inlet
      channel ( 102). The surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit is positioned
      approximately +-50 microns (measured as the distance from the
      opening of the dilute outlet channel to the downstream edge of the
      electrode, 130) upstream or downstream of the opening of the
      dilute outlet channel ( 104).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In certain embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108)
      in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit is
      positioned upstream of the opening of the dilute outlet channel (
      104), and within about 500 microns of the opening of the dilute
      outlet channel (e.g., within about 400 microns, within about 300
      microns, within about 250 microns, within about 200 microns,
      within about 150 microns, within about 100 microns, within about
      90 microns, within about 80 microns, within about 75 microns,
      within about 70 microns, within about 60 microns, within about 50
      microns, within about 40 microns, within about 30 microns, within
      about 25 microns, within about 20 microns, or within about 10
      microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit is positioned
      downstream of the opening of the dilute outlet channel ( 104), and
      within about 100 microns of the opening of the dilute outlet
      channel (e.g., within about 90 microns, within about 80 microns,
      within about 75 microns, within about 70 microns, within about 60
      microns, within about 50 microns, within about 40 microns, within
      about 30 microns, within about 25 microns, within about 20
      microns, within about 10 microns, or within about 5 microns). When
      the surface of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact
      with the desalination unit is positioned downstream of the opening
      of the dilute outlet channel ( 104), the length of the electrode
      (as discussed below) must be sufficient such that at least a
      portion of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with
      the desalination unit extends beyond the opening of the dilute
      outlet channel ( 104), and into the inlet channel (i.e., a portion
      of the electrode must be located upstream of the dilute outlet
      channel)<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Again referring to FIG. 1B, the surface of the electrode (
      108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit can
      have a width ( 132, measured as the distance from one side of the
      surface of the electrode to the other side of the surface of the
      electrode along an axis perpendicular to the direction of fluid
      flow through the inlet channel) and a length ( 134, measured as
      the distance from one side of the surface of the electrode to the
      other side of the surface of the electrode along an axis parallel
      to the direction of fluid flow through the inlet channel). By way
      of exemplification, in the example device to FIG. 1B, the surface
      of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with the
      desalination unit has a width ( 132) that is about equal to the
      width of the dilute outlet channel ( 104) (50 microns), and a
      length ( 134) of about 100 microns.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width (
      132) of at least about 50% of the width of the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104) (e.g., at least about 60% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least about 70% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least about 75% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least about 80% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least about 90% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least about 90% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel, at least the width of the dilute outlet
      channel, at least about 105% of the width of the dilute outlet
      channel, or at least about 110% of the width of the dilute outlet
      channel). In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108)
      in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width
      ( 132) that is less than about 150% of the width of the dilute
      outlet channel ( 104) (e.g., less than about 140% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, less than about 130% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, less than about 125% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, less than about 120% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, less than about 110% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, less than about 105% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, or less than the width of the dilute
      outlet channel).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The surface of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical
      contact with the desalination unit can have a width ( 132) that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination
      unit can have a width ( 132) that ranges from about 50% of the
      width of the dilute outlet channel ( 104) to about 150% of the
      width of the dilute outlet channel (e.g., from about 75% of the
      width of the dilute outlet channel to about 125% of the width of
      the dilute outlet channel, from about 90% of the width of the
      dilute outlet channel to about 110% of the width of the dilute
      outlet channel, or from about 95% of the width of the dilute
      outlet channel to about 105% of the width of the dilute outlet
      channel). In certain embodiments, the surface of the electrode (
      108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a
      width ( 132) that is about equal to the width of the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width (
      132) that is at least about 25% of the width of the inlet channel
      ( 102) (e.g., at least about 30% of the width of the inlet
      channel, at least about 40% of the width of the inlet channel, at
      least about 45% of the width of the inlet channel, at least about
      50% of the width of the inlet channel, at least about 55% of the
      width of the inlet channel, or at least about 60% of the width of
      the inlet channel). In some embodiments, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination
      unit has a width ( 132) that is less than about 75% of the width
      of the inlet channel ( 102) (e.g., less than about 60% of the
      width of the inlet channel, less than about 55% of the width of
      the inlet channel, less than about 50% of the width of the inlet
      channel, less than about 45% of the width of the inlet channel, or
      less than about 40% of the width of the inlet channel).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The surface of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical
      contact with the desalination unit can have a width ( 132) that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination
      unit can have a width ( 132) that ranges from about 25% of the
      width of the inlet channel ( 102) to about 75% of the width of the
      inlet channel (e.g., from about 30% of the width of the dilute
      outlet channel to about 70% of the width of the dilute outlet
      channel, from about 40% of the width of the dilute outlet channel
      to about 60% of the width of the dilute outlet channel, or from
      about 45% of the width of the dilute outlet channel to about 55%
      of the width of the dilute outlet channel). In certain
      embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width (
      132) that is about 50% of the width of the inlet channel ( 102).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width (
      132) of about 600 microns or less (e.g., about 500 microns or
      less, about 450 microns or less, about 400 microns or less, about
      350 microns or less, about 300 microns or less, about 250 microns
      or less, about 200 microns or less, about 150 microns or less,
      about 125 microns or less, about 100 microns or less, about 75
      microns or less, about 50 microns or less, about 25 microns or
      less, about 20 microns or less, about 15 microns or less, about 10
      microns or less, about 5 microns or less, or about 1 micron or
      less). In some embodiments, the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit has a width (
      132) of at least about 0.5 microns (e.g., at least about 1 micron,
      at least about 2.5 microns, at least about 5 microns, at least
      about 10 microns, at least about 15 microns, at least about 20
      microns, at least about 25 microns, at least about 50 microns, at
      least about 75 microns, at least about 100 microns, at least about
      150 microns, at least about 200 microns, at least about 250
      microns, at least about 300 microns, at least about 400 microns,
      at least about 450 microns, or at least about 500 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The surface of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical
      contact with the desalination unit can have a width ( 132) that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) in electrochemical contact with the desalination
      unit can have a width ( 132) that ranges from about 600 microns to
      about 0.5 microns (e.g., from about 400 microns to about 1 micron,
      from about 250 microns to about 1 micron, from about 150 microns
      to about 5 microns, or from about 80 microns to about 10 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The length ( 134) of the surface of the electrode ( 108) in
      electrochemical contact with the desalination unit can be varied.
      In some embodiments the surface of the electrode ( 108) has a
      length ( 134) of at least about 10 microns (e.g., at least about
      15 microns, at least about 20 microns, at least about 25 microns,
      at least about 50 microns, at least about 75 microns, at least
      about 100 microns, at least about 150 microns, at least about 200
      microns, at least about 250 microns, at least about 300 microns,
      at least about 400 microns, at least about 450 microns, or at
      least about 450 microns). In some embodiments, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) has a length ( 134) of less than about 500
      microns (e.g., less than about 400 microns, less than about 300
      microns, less than about 250 microns, less than about 200 microns,
      or less than about 100 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The surface of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical
      contact with the desalination unit can have a length ( 134) that
      ranges from any of the minimum dimensions to any of the maximum
      dimensions described above. For example, the surface of the
      electrode ( 108) can have a length ( 134) that ranges from about
      10 microns to about 500 microns (e.g., from about 25 microns to
      about 250 microns, or from about 50 microns to about 150 microns).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The height of the electrode ( 108) in electrochemical
      contact with the desalination unit can also be varied. The height
      of the electrode ( 108) can be selected in view of a number of
      factors, including the height of the microfluidic channels in the
      desalination unit. In some cases, the height of the electrode (
      108) is approximately zero (i.e., the electrode is substantially
      co-planar with the floor of the inlet channel). In some
      embodiments, the height of the electrode ( 108) is less than about
      1 micron (e.g., less than about 900 nm, less than about 800 nm,
      less than about 750 nm, less than about 700 nm, less than about
      600 nm, less than about 500 nm, less than about 400 nm, less than
      about 300 nm, less than about 250 nm, less than about 200 nm, or
      less than about 100 nm).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As shown in FIG. 1C, a power supply ( 140) can be
      configured to apply a potential bias across the desalination unit.
      A flow of saltwater ( 120) can be initiated from the inlet channel
      ( 102) to the dilute outlet channel ( 104) and the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 106). Upon application of a potential bias, an
      ion depletion zone ( 109) and subsequent electric field gradient
      are formed near the electrode ( 108) in proximity to the
      intersection ( 107). As a consequence, ions in the saltwater are
      preferentially directed into the concentrated outlet channel (
      106), resulting in a brine ( 122) flowing through the concentrated
      outlet channel. Desalted water (i.e., water containing less salt
      that the saltwater introduced into the inlet channel; 124) flows
      into the dilute outlet channel ( 104).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In some embodiments, the microfluidic device can further
      include an auxiliary channel fluidly isolated from the
      desalination unit. An example device comprising a desalination
      unit ( 100) and an auxiliary channel ( 202) is schematically
      illustrated in FIG. 2. The desalination unit includes an inlet
      channel ( 102) fluidly connected to a dilute outlet channel ( 104)
      and a concentrated outlet channel ( 106). The dilute outlet
      channel ( 104) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) diverge
      from the inlet channel ( 102) at an intersection ( 107). The
      device also includes and an auxiliary channel ( 202) which is
      fluidly isolated from the desalination unit ( 100).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The auxiliary channel ( 202) can comprise, for example, a
      single microfluidic channel. In these embodiments, dimensions of
      the auxiliary channel (e.g., height, width, and length) can vary.
      The dimensions of the auxiliary channel ( 202) can individually be
      selected in view of a number of the overall device design and
      other operational considerations. The auxiliary channel ( 202) can
      be substantially linear in shape, or it can possess one or more
      non-linear regions (e.g., a curved region, a spiral region, an
      angular region, or combinations thereof) along the length of their
      fluid flow path. The auxiliary channel ( 202) can optionally
      possess one or more branch points. The auxiliary channel ( 202)
      can further include additional elements, such as electrodes, fluid
      inlets, fluid outlets, fluid reservoirs, valves, pumps, and
      combinations thereof, connected to the auxiliary channel to
      facilitate device operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The auxiliary channel ( 202) can be electrochemically
      connected to the desalination unit ( 100) via a bipolar electrode.
      In these embodiments, the bipolar electrode is configured so as to
      be in electrochemical contact with both the desalination unit (
      100) and the auxiliary channel ( 202), meaning that a first
      surface of the bipolar electrode can participate in a faradaic
      reaction with one or more components of a solution present in a
      microfluidic channel of the desalination unit, and a second
      surface of the bipolar electrode can participate in a faradaic
      reaction with one or more components of a solution present in the
      auxiliary channel. The device can be configured such that the
      bipolar electrode comprises an anode in electrochemical contact
      with the desalination unit and a cathode in electrochemical
      contact with the auxiliary channel during device operation.
      Alternatively, the device can be configured such that the bipolar
      electrode comprises a cathode in electrochemical contact with the
      desalination unit and an anode in electrochemical contact with the
      auxiliary channel during device operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] By way of exemplification, referring again to the example
      device illustrated in FIG. 2, a bipolar electrode ( 204)
      electrochemically connects the auxiliary channel ( 202) and the
      desalination unit ( 100). A first surface of the bipolar electrode
      ( 206) is in electrochemical contact with the desalination unit (
      100), and is positioned in proximity to the intersection ( 107).
      The first surface of the bipolar electrode ( 206) is configured to
      form an ion depletion zone ( 109) at and downstream of the surface
      of the bipolar electrode during device operation, resulting in the
      formation of an electric field gradient in proximity to the
      intersection. A second surface of the bipolar electrode ( 208) is
      in electrochemical contact with the auxiliary channel ( 202).<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The first surface of the bipolar electrode ( 206) can
      occupy the same position within the desalination unit, and have
      the same dimensions as the surface of electrode ( 108) described
      above with respect to the first desalination unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Referring again to FIG. 2, the example device further
      includes a fluid reservoir ( 110) fluidly connected to the
      upstream terminus of the inlet channel ( 102), a fluid reservoir (
      114) fluidly connected to the downstream terminus of the dilute
      outlet channel ( 104), a fluid reservoir ( 112) fluidly connected
      to the downstream terminus of the concentrated outlet channel (
      106), and fluid reservoirs ( 210 and 212) fluidly connected to the
      termini of the auxiliary channel ( 202).<br>
      <br>
      [0067] A power supply can be configured to apply a potential bias
      across the auxiliary channel ( 202) and the desalination unit (
      100). A flow of saltwater ( 120) can be initiated from the inlet
      channel ( 102) to the dilute outlet channel ( 104) and the
      concentrated outlet channel ( 106). Upon application of a
      potential bias, an ion depletion zone ( 109) and subsequent
      electric field gradient are formed near the first surface of the
      bipolar electrode ( 206) in proximity to the intersection ( 107).
      As a consequence, ions in the saltwater are preferentially
      directed into the concentrated outlet channel ( 106), resulting in
      a brine ( 122) flowing through the concentrated outlet channel.
      Desalted water ( 124) flows into the dilute outlet channel ( 104).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In some embodiments, the auxiliary channel can comprise a
      desalination unit. In these embodiments, the microfluidic device
      can comprise two desalination units, which can be of identical or
      different structure. An example device comprising two desalination
      units is illustrated in FIG. 3. The device includes a first
      desalination unit ( 100) electrochemically connected to a second
      desalination unit ( 302) by a bipolar electrode ( 310). The first
      desalination unit ( 100) is fluidly isolated from the second
      desalination unit ( 302).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The first desalination unit ( 100) includes an inlet
      channel ( 102) fluidly connected to a dilute outlet channel ( 104)
      and a concentrated outlet channel ( 106). The dilute outlet
      channel ( 104) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 106) diverge
      from the inlet channel ( 102) at an intersection ( 107). The
      second desalination unit ( 302) includes an inlet channel ( 304)
      fluidly connected to a dilute outlet channel ( 306) and a
      concentrated outlet channel ( 308). The dilute outlet channel (
      306) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 308) diverge from the
      inlet channel ( 304) at an intersection ( 307).<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A bipolar electrode ( 310) electrochemically connects the
      first desalination unit ( 100) and the second desalination unit (
      302). A first surface of the bipolar electrode ( 312) is in
      electrochemical contact with the first desalination unit ( 100),
      and is positioned in proximity to the intersection ( 107). The
      first surface of the bipolar electrode ( 312) is configured to
      form an ion depletion zone ( 109) downstream of the surface of the
      bipolar electrode during device operation, resulting in the
      formation of an electric field gradient in proximity to the
      intersection of the first desalination unit. A second surface of
      the bipolar electrode ( 314) is in electrochemical contact with
      the second desalination unit ( 302), and is positioned in
      proximity to the intersection of the second desalination unit (
      307). The second surface of the bipolar electrode ( 314) is
      configured to form an ion depletion zone ( 309) downstream of the
      surface of the bipolar electrode during device operation,
      resulting in the formation of an electric field gradient in
      proximity to the intersection of the second desalination unit. The
      example device further includes fluid reservoirs ( 110 and 320)
      fluidly connected to the upstream termini of the inlet channels of
      the first and second desalination units, fluid reservoirs ( 114
      and 322) fluidly connected to the downstream termini of the dilute
      outlet channels of the first and second desalination units, and
      fluid reservoirs ( 112 and 324) fluidly connected to the
      downstream termini of the concentrated outlet channels of the
      first and second desalination units.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The second desalination unit ( 302), as well as all of the
      elements making up the second desalination unit (e.g., the inlet
      channel ( 304), the dilute outlet channel ( 306), and the
      concentrated outlet channel ( 308)) can have the same dimensions
      and relative configurations as those described above with respect
      to the first desalination unit. The first surface of the bipolar
      electrode ( 312) and the second surface of the bipolar electrode (
      314) can occupy the same positions within their respective
      desalination units, and have the same dimensions as the surface of
      electrode ( 108) described above with respect to the first
      desalination unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] A power supply can be configured to apply a potential bias
      across the first desalination unit ( 100) and the second
      desalination unit ( 302). A flow of saltwater ( 120 and 330) can
      be initiated from the inlet channels of the first and second
      desalination units to the dilute outlet channels and the
      concentrated outlet channels of the first and second desalination
      units. Upon application of a potential bias, ion depletion zones (
      109 and 309) and subsequent electric field gradients are formed
      near the first surface of the bipolar electrode ( 312) in
      proximity to the intersection ( 107) of the first desalination
      unit, and near the second surface of the bipolar electrode ( 314)
      in proximity to the intersection ( 307) of the second desalination
      unit. As a consequence, ions in the saltwater are preferentially
      directed into the concentrated outlet channels of the first and
      second desalination units ( 106 and 308), resulting in a brine (
      122 and 334) flowing through the concentrated outlet channels of
      the first and second desalination units. Desalted water ( 124 and
      332) flows into the dilute outlet channels ( 104 and 306) of the
      first and second desalination units.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The microfluidic devices described herein can further
      include one or more additional components (e.g., pressure gauges,
      valves, pressure inlets, pumps, fluid reservoirs, sensors,
      electrodes, power supplies, and combinations thereof) to
      facilitate device function. In some embodiments, the devices
      include a pump, valve, fluid reservoir, or combination thereof
      configured to regulate fluid flow into the inlet channel of the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The devices can include a salinometer configured to measure
      the salinity of fluid flowing through one or more of the
      microfluidic channels of the device. For example, in some cases,
      the devices can include a salinometer configured to measure the
      salinity of fluid flowing through the dilute outlet channel. The
      salinometer can measure the salinity of the fluid via any suitable
      means. For example, the salinometer can measure the fluid's
      electrical conductivity, specific gravity, index of refraction, or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In certain embodiments, the devices include a salinometer
      configured to measure the salinity of fluid flowing through the
      dilute outlet channel, and a pump, valve, fluid reservoir, or
      combination thereof configured to regulate fluid flow into the
      inlet channel of the device. The devices can further include
      signal processing circuitry or a processor configured to operate
      the pump and/or valve connected to the inlet channel so as to
      adjust fluid flow into the inlet channel of the device in response
      to the salinity of fluid flowing through the dilute outlet
      channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Systems<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A plurality of the microfluidic devices described herein
      can be combined to form a water purification system.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Water purification systems can comprise any number of the
      devices described herein. The number of devices incorporated
      within the water purification system can be selected in view of a
      number of factors, including the overall system design, the
      desired throughput of the system, salinity of the saltwater being
      treated using the system, and the desired degree of salinity
      reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In some cases, the inlet channels of two or more of the
      devices in the system are fluidly connected to a common water
      inlet, so as to facilitate the flow of saltwater into the inlet
      channels of multiple devices in the system. Similarly, the dilute
      outlet channels of two or more of the devices in the system can be
      fluidly connected to a common water outlet, so as to facilitate
      the collection of desalted water from the dilute outlet channels
      of multiple devices in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The system can comprise a plurality of the devices
      described herein arranged in parallel. Within the context of the
      systems described herein, two devices can be described as being
      arranged in parallel within a system when fluid flowing from
      either the dilute outlet channel or the concentrated outlet
      channel of the first device in the system does not subsequently
      flow into the inlet channel of the second device in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] By way of example, FIG. 4 is a schematic drawing of a water
      purification system ( 400) that includes a first desalination unit
      ( 402) and a second desalination unit ( 404) arranged in parallel.
      The example device further includes an auxiliary channel ( 406)
      which is fluidly isolated from both the first and second
      desalination unit. A first bipolar electrode ( 408)
      electrochemically connects the auxiliary channel ( 406) and the
      first desalination unit ( 402). A second bipolar electrode ( 410)
      electrochemically connects the auxiliary channel ( 406) and the
      second desalination unit ( 404). The example system can be
      operated by applying a potential bias between the auxiliary
      channel and the first and second desalination units.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] FIG. 5 illustrates a second example water purification
      system ( 500) that includes two devices arranged in parallel. The
      system ( 500) comprises a first device which includes a first
      desalination unit ( 502) electrochemically connected to a first
      auxiliary channel ( 504) by a first bipolar electrode ( 506). The
      system ( 500) further comprises a second device which is arranged
      in parallel with respect to the first device, and which includes a
      second desalination unit ( 508) electrochemically connected to a
      second auxiliary channel ( 510) by a second bipolar electrode (
      512). As illustrated in FIG. 5, a power supply can be configured
      to apply a potential bias across both the first auxiliary channel
      ( 504) and desalination unit ( 502) and the second auxiliary
      channel ( 510) and desalination unit ( 508).<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The system can comprise a plurality of the devices
      described herein fluidly connected in series. Within the context
      of the systems described herein, two devices can be described as
      being fluidly connected in series within a system when fluid
      flowing from either the dilute outlet channel or the concentrated
      outlet channel of the first device in the system subsequently
      flows into the inlet channel of the second device in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] By way of example, FIG. 6 is a schematic drawing of a water
      purification system ( 600) that includes two devices fluidly
      connected in series. The system ( 600) includes a first
      desalination unit ( 602) and a second desalination unit ( 604)
      fluidly connected in series, such that the dilute outlet channel
      of the first desalination unit is fluidly connected to the inlet
      channel of the second desalination unit. The example device
      further includes an auxiliary channel ( 606) which is fluidly
      isolated from both the first and second desalination unit. A first
      bipolar electrode ( 608) electrochemically connects the auxiliary
      channel ( 606) and the first desalination unit ( 602). A second
      bipolar electrode ( 610) electrochemically connects the auxiliary
      channel ( 606) and the second desalination unit ( 604). The
      example system can be operated by applying a potential bias
      between the auxiliary channel and the first and second
      desalination units.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] If desired, the systems can contain a plurality of devices
      both arranged in parallel and fluidly connected in series. For
      example, the device can include a first pair devices fluidly
      connected in series which are arranged in parallel with a second
      pair of devices fluidly connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Methods of Making<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The microfluidic devices and systems described herein can
      be fabricated from any substrate material which is non-conductive,
      and suitable for the flow of aqueous solutions through the
      microfluidic channels of the device or system. For example, the
      device or system can be fabricated, in whole or in part, from
      glass, silicon, or combinations thereof. The device or system can
      also be fabricated, in whole or in part, from a polymer and/or
      plastic, such as a polyester (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate;
      PET) polyurethane, polycarbonate, halogenated polymer (e.g.,
      polyvinyl chloride and/or fluorinated polymer such as
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), polyacrylate and/or poly
      methacrylate (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate; PMMA), silicone
      (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane; PDMS), a thermosetting resin (e.g.,
      Bakelite), or a copolymer, blend, and/or combination thereof. The
      device or system can also be fabricated, in whole or in part, from
      a ceramic (e.g., silicon nitride, silicon carbide, titania,
      alumina, silica, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In certain embodiments, the device or system is fabricated,
      in whole or in part, from a photocurable epoxy. In certain
      embodiments, the device or system is fabricated, in whole or in
      part, from PDMS.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The microfluidic devices and systems described herein can
      be fabricated using a variety of microfabrication techniques known
      in the art. Suitable methods for the microfabrication of
      microfluidic devices include, for example, lithography, etching,
      embossing, roll-to-roll manufacturing, lamination, printing, and
      molding of polymeric substrates. The microfabrication process can
      involve one or more of the processes described below (or similar
      processes). Different portions of the device or system can be
      fabricated using different methods, and subsequently assembled or
      bonded together to form the final microfluidic device or system.
      Suitable fabrication methods can be selected in view of a number
      of factors, including the nature of the substrate(s) used to form
      the device or system, performance requirements, and the dimensions
      of the microfluidic features making up the device or system.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Lithography involves use of light or other form of energy
      such as electron beam to selectively alter a substrate material.
      Typically, a polymeric material or precursor (e.g., photoresist, a
      light-resistant material) is coated on a substrate and is
      selectively exposed to light or other form of energy. Depending on
      the photoresist, exposed regions of the photoresist either remain
      or are dissolved in subsequent processing steps known generally as
      "developing." This process results in a pattern of the photoresist
      on the substrate. In some embodiments, the photoresist is used as
      a master in a molding process. In some embodiments, a polymeric
      precursor is poured on the substrate with photoresist, polymerized
      (i.e., cured) and peeled off. The resulting polymer is bonded or
      glued to another flat substrate after drilling holes for inlets
      and outlets.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In some embodiments, the photoresist is used as a mask for
      an etching process. For example, after patterning photoresist on a
      silicon substrate, channels can be etched into the substrate using
      a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) process or other chemical etching
      process known in the art (e.g., plasma etch, KOH etch, HF etch,
      etc.). The photoresist can then be removed, and the substrate can
      be bonded to another substrate using one of any bonding procedures
      known in the art (e.g., anodic bonding, adhesive bonding, direct
      bonding, eutectic bonding, etc.). Multiple lithographic and
      etching steps and machining steps such as drilling can be
      included. Carbon electrodes may be fabricated in place by means of
      photoresist pyrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In some embodiments, a polymeric substrate, such as PMMA,
      can be heated and pressed against a master mold for an embossing
      process. The master mold can be formed by a variety of processes,
      including lithography and machining. The polymeric substrate can
      then be bonded with another substrate to form a microfluidic
      device or system. Machining processes can be included if
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Devices and systems can also be fabricated using an
      injection molding process. In an injection molding process, a
      molten polymer or metal or alloy is injected into a suitable mold
      and allowed to cool and solidify. The mold typically consists of
      two parts that allow the molded component to be removed. Parts
      thus manufactured can be bonded to result in the device or system.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In some embodiments, sacrificial etch can be used to form
      the device or system. Lithographic techniques can be used to
      pattern a material on a substrate. This material can then be
      covered by another material of different chemical nature. This
      material can undergo lithography and etch processes, or another
      suitable machining process. The substrate can then be exposed to a
      chemical agent that selectively removes the first material. In
      this way, channels can be formed in the second material, leaving
      voids where the first material was present before the etch
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In some embodiments, microchannels can be directly machined
      into a substrate by laser machining or CNC machining. If desired,
      several layers can be machined, and subsequently bonded together
      to obtain the final device or system.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Electrodes as well as other electrical device components
      can be fabricated within the devices and systems by patterning
      suitable conductive materials on and/or within substrate materials
      using a number of suitable methods known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In one or more embodiments, the conductive material
      includes one or more metals. Non-limiting examples of suitable
      metals include Sn, Zn, Au, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Al, In, Cu, or a
      combination thereof. Other suitable conductive materials include
      metal oxides and conductive non-metals (e.g., carbon derivatives
      such as graphite). Conductive materials can be deposited using a
      vacuum deposition process (e.g., cathodic arc deposition, electron
      beam physical vapor deposition, evaporative deposition, pulsed
      laser deposition, or sputter deposition). Conductive material can
      also be provided in the form of a conductive ink which can be
      screen printed, ink-jet printed, or otherwise deposited onto the
      surface of the substrate material to form an electrical device
      component. Conductive inks are typically formed by blending resins
      or adhesives with one or more powdered conductive materials such
      as Sn, Zn, Au, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Al, In, Cu, graphite powder, carbon
      black, or other conductive metals or metal alloys. Examples
      include carbon-based inks, silver inks, and aluminum inks.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] When forming an electrical device component, such as an
      electrode, in the devices or systems described herein, one or more
      conductive materials will preferably be deposited or applied as a
      thin film. In certain embodiments, the conductive layers are thin
      metallic or carbon films which are about 50 microns in thickness
      or less (e.g., about 40 microns in thickness or less, about 30
      microns in thickness or less, about 25 microns in thickness or
      less, about 20 microns in thickness or less, about 15 microns in
      thickness or less, about 10 microns in thickness or less, about 5
      microns in thickness or less, about 1 micron in thickness or less,
      about 900 nm in thickness or less, about 800 nm in thickness or
      less, about 750 nm in thickness or less, about 700 nm in thickness
      or less, about 600 nm in thickness or less, about 500 nm in
      thickness or less, about 400 nm in thickness or less, about 300 nm
      in thickness or less, or about 250 nm in thickness or less).<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Methods of Using<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The microfluidic devices and systems described herein can
      be used to decrease the salinity of water. The salinity of water
      can be decreased by flowing saltwater through the desalination
      unit of a device or system described herein, and performing a
      faradaic reaction at the electrode positioned in proximity to the
      intersection of the desalination unit. The faradaic reaction
      generates an electric field gradient that directs ions in the
      saltwater away from the dilute outlet channel of the desalination
      unit, and towards the concentrated outlet channel of the
      desalination unit. As a result, the salinity of water which flows
      into the dilute outlet channel is lower than the salinity of the
      saltwater flowing into the inlet channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In some embodiments, methods of decreasing the salinity of
      water include providing a flow of saltwater through the inlet
      channel of a device described herein or the water inlet of a
      system described herein, applying a potential bias to generate an
      electric field gradient that influences the flow of ions in the
      saltwater through the desalination unit of the device or the
      desalination units of the system, and collecting water from the
      dilute outlet channel of the device or the water outlet of the
      system. In these methods, the water collected from the dilute
      outlet channel of the device or the water outlet of the system can
      have a lower electrical conductivity than the saltwater flowed
      through the inlet channel of the device or the water inlet of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In some embodiments, the potential bias applied to generate
      an electric field gradient is greater than about 1 volt (e.g.,
      greater than about 2 volts, greater than about 2.5 volts, greater
      than about 3 volts, greater than about 4 volts, greater than about
      5 volts, greater than about 6 volts, greater than about 7 volts,
      greater than about 8 volts, or greater than about 9 volts). In
      some embodiments, the potential bias applied to generate an
      electric field gradient is less than about 10 volts (e.g., less
      than about 9 volts, less than about 9 volts, less than about 8
      volts, less than about 7 volts, less than about 6 volts, less than
      about 5 volts, less than about 4 volts, less than about 3 volts,
      less than about 2.5 volts, or less than about 2 volts).<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The potential bias applied to generate an electric field
      gradient can range from any of the minimum voltages to any of the
      maximum voltages described above. In some embodiments, the
      potential bias applied to generate an electric field gradient
      ranges from about 1 volt to about 10 volts (e.g., from about 1
      volt to about 7 volts, from about 2 volts to about 7 volts, or
      from about 2.5 to about 5 volts).<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In some embodiments, the flow rate of the saltwater through
      the desalination unit of the device or the flow rate of the
      saltwater through each desalination unit of the system ranges from
      about 0.01 to about 1 microliter per minute (e.g., from about 0.05
      to about 0.5 microliters per minute, or from about 0.1 to about
      0.5 microliters per minute). Suitable flow rates can be selected
      in view of a variety of factors including the architecture of the
      device or system, the salinity of the saltwater being treated
      using the device or system, and the desired degree of salinity
      reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The devices, systems, and methods described herein can be
      used to decrease the salinity of saltwater having any measurable
      concentration of dissolved sodium chloride. The saltwater can be
      seawater (e.g., saltwater having a conductivity of between about 4
      S/m and about 6 S/m). The saltwater can be brackish water (e.g.,
      saltwater having a conductivity of between about 0.05 S/m and
      about 4 S/m). In certain embodiments, the saltwater has a
      conductivity of greater than about 0.05 S/m (e.g., greater than
      about 0.1 S/m, greater than about 0.5 S/m, greater than about 1.0
      S/m, greater than about 2.0 S/m, greater than about 2.5 S/m,
      greater than about 3.0 S/m, greater than about 3.5 S/m, greater
      than about 4.0 S/m, greater than about 4.5 S/m, greater than about
      5.0 S/m, or greater than about 5.5 S/m).<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The devices, systems, and methods described herein can be
      used to decrease the salinity of saltwater by varying degrees. The
      degree of salinity reduction can depend on a number of factors,
      including the architecture of the device or system, and the
      salinity of the saltwater being treated using the device or
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In some embodiments, the conductivity of the water
      desalinated using the devices, systems, and methods described
      herein (e.g., the water collected from the dilute outlet channel
      of the device or the water outlet of the system) does not exceed
      about 90% of the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the
      device or system (e.g., it does not exceed about 80% of the
      conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or system, it
      does not exceed about 75% of the conductivity of the saltwater
      flowed into the device or system, it does not exceed about 70% of
      the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or
      system, it does not exceed about 60% of the conductivity of the
      saltwater flowed into the device or system, it does not exceed
      about 50% of the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the
      device or system, it does not exceed about 40% of the conductivity
      of the saltwater flowed into the device or system, it does not
      exceed about 30% of the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into
      the device or system, it does not exceed about 25% of the
      conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or system, it
      does not exceed about 20% of the conductivity of the saltwater
      flowed into the device or system, it does not exceed about 10% of
      the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or
      system, it does not exceed about 5% of the conductivity of the
      saltwater flowed into the device or system, it does not exceed
      about 1% of the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the
      device or system, it does not exceed about 0.5% of the
      conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or system, it
      does not exceed about 0.1% of the conductivity of the saltwater
      flowed into the device or system, it does not exceed about 0.05%
      of the conductivity of the saltwater flowed into the device or
      system, it does not exceed about 0.01% of the conductivity of the
      saltwater flowed into the device or system, or less).<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In some cases, water desalinated using the devices,
      systems, and methods described herein (e.g., water collected from
      the dilute outlet channel of the device or the water outlet of the

      [0109] In some embodiments, the water desalinated using the
      devices, systems, and methods described herein (e.g., water
      collected from the dilute outlet channel of the device or the
      water outlet of the system) is drinking water (e.g., the water has
      a conductivity of from about 0.05 S/m to about 0.005 S/m). In some
      embodiments, the water desalinated using the devices, systems, and
      methods described herein (e.g., water collected from the dilute
      outlet channel of the device or the water outlet of the system) is
      ultrapure water (e.g., the water has a conductivity of from about
      0.005 S/m to about 5.5*10 &lt;-6 &gt;S/m).<br>
      <br>
      [0110] If desired, water can be treated multiple times using the
      devices, systems, and methods described herein to achieve a
      desired decrease in the salinity of the saltwater.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The devices and systems described herein can be used to
      desalinate water with greater energy efficiency than conventional
      desalination methods. In some cases, the devices and systems
      described herein can be used to desalinate water with at an energy
      efficiency of less than about 1000 mWh/L (e.g., at least about 900
      mWh/L, at least about 800 mWh/L, at least about 750 mWh/L, at
      least about 700 mWh/L, at least about 600 mWh/L, at least about
      500 mWh/L, at least about 400 mWh/L, at least about 300 mWh/L, at
      least about 250 mWh/L, at least about 200 mWh/L, at least about
      100 mWh/L, at least about 90 mWh/L, at least about 80 mWh/L, at
      least about 75 mWh/L, at least about 70 mWh/L, at least about 60
      mWh/L, at least about 50 mWh/L, at least about 40 mWh/L, at least
      about 30 mWh/L, at least about 25 mWh/L, at least about 20 mWh/L,
      at least about 15 mWh/L, or at least about 10 mWh/L, or at least
      about 5 mWh/L). In some embodiments, the devices and systems
      described herein can be used to desalinate water with at an energy
      efficiency ranging from any of the minimum values above to about 1
      mWh/L (e.g., from at least about 1000 mWh/L to about 1 mWh/L, from
      at least about 500 mWh/L to about 1 mWh/L, from at least about 100
      mWh/L to about 1 mWh/L, from at least about 75 mWh/L to about 1
      mWh/L, or from at least about 50 mWh/L to about 1 mWh/L).<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In some cases, the saltwater is not pre-treated prior to
      desalination with the devices and systems described herein. In
      other embodiments, the saltwater can be treated prior to
      desalination. For example, the removal of multivalent cations
      (e.g., Ca &lt;2+&gt;, Mg &lt;2+&gt;, or combinations thereof) from
      saltwater prior to desalination could reduce precipitate formation
      within the device or system over long operation times.
      Accordingly, in some embodiments, the saltwater can be pre-treated
      to reduce the level of dissolved multivalent cations in solution,
      for example, by contacting the saltwater with a suitable ion
      exchange resin. If necessary, saltwater can also be pre-treated to
      remove debris, for example, by sedimentation and/or filtration. If
      desired, saltwater can also be disinfected prior to desalination.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] If desired for a particular end use, water can be further
      treated following desalination with the devices and systems
      described herein. For example, water can be fluoridated by
      addition of a suitable fluoride salt, such as sodium fluoride,
      fluorosilicic acid, or sodium fluorosilicate. Water can also be
      passed through an ion exchange resin and/or treated to adjust pH
      following desalination with the devices and systems described
      herein.<br>

      <br>
      Desalination Using a Microfluidic Device<br>
      <br>
      [0114] A microelectrochemical cell comprising a desalination unit
      and an auxiliary channel spanned by a single bipolar electrode
      (BPE) was used to desalinate seawater along a locally generated
      electric field gradient in the presence of pressure driven flow
      (PDF). Seawater desalination was achieved by applying a potential
      bias between a parallel desalination unit and auxiliary channel to
      drive the oxidation of chloride at the anodic pole of the bipolar
      electrode. At the cathodic pole, water reduction occurs to support
      current flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The oxidation of chloride at the anodic pole of the BPE
      results in an ion depletion zone and subsequent electric field
      gradient. The electric field gradient directed ions flowing
      through the desalination unit into a branching microchannel,
      creating a brine stream, while desalted water continued to flow
      forward when the rate of pressure driven flow was controlled.
      Seawater desalination could thus be achieved by controlling the
      rate of pressure driven flow to create both a salted and desalted
      stream.<br>

      <br>
      [0117] Fabrication of Microfluidic Device<br>
      <br>
      [0118] A PDMS/quartz hybrid microfluidic device was prepared using
      microfabrication methods known in the art. The structure of the
      microfluidic device is schematically illustrated in FIG. 2. The
      device comprises a desalination unit and an auxiliary channel
      spanned by a single bipolar electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] A pyrolyzed photoresist carbon electrode was fabricated on
      a quartz slide (1 in*1 in). Photoresist was spin coated onto the
      slide at 3500 rpm for 45 seconds, and then soft baked on a hot
      plate at 100[deg.] C. for 1 minute to remove excess solvent. The
      device was then exposed to a UV lamp with patterned mask above to
      reveal the electrode (100 [mu]m wide by 6.3 mm long) design. The
      excess photoresist was then removed by development. The devices
      were then placed in a quartz tube furnace with a forming gas of 5%
      H 2 and 95% N 2 continuously flowing at 100 standard cubic
      centimeters per minute to allow the photoresist to pyrolyze. After
      pyrolysis, the device was cooled to room temperate.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] A PDMS desalination unit (5.0 mm long and 22 [mu]m tall)
      with a 100 [mu]m wide inlet channel and 50 [mu]m wide dilute
      outlet channel and concentrated outlet channel was fabricated
      parallel to an auxiliary channel (5.0 mm long, 22 [mu]m tall, 100
      [mu]m wide) using a SU-8 photoresist mold patterned on a silicon
      wafer. The separation between the desalination unit and the
      auxiliary channel was 6.0 mm (center-to-center). The PDMS channels
      were rinsed with ethanol and dried under N 2, then the PDMS and
      quartz/electrode surfaces were exposed to an air plasma for 15
      seconds, and finally the two parts were bound together with the
      BPE aligned at the intersection where the dilute outlet channel
      and concentrated outlet channel diverge from the inlet channel.
      The PDMS/quartz microfluidic device was then placed in an oven at
      65[deg.] C. for 5 min to promote irreversible bonding.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Evaluation of Desalination<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Seawater collected from Port Aransas, Tex. was used to
      evaluate desalination. To prevent obstruction of the microfluidic
      channel, the seawater samples were allowed to undergo a simple
      sedimentation process before sample collection. The seawater was
      spiked with a cationic (20 [mu]M Ru(bpy) &lt;2+&gt;) tracer to
      fluorescently monitor the movement of ions through the
      desalination unit during desalination.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] A solution height differential was created between the
      fluid reservoir fluidly connected to the inlet channel ( 110; V 1)
      and the fluid reservoirs fluidly connected to the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 112; V 2) and fluidly connected to the dilute
      outlet channel ( 114, V 3). In this way, a pressure driven flow
      (PDF) from right to left was initiated.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] Results<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Using Au driving electrodes, E tot=2.5 V was applied to
      reservoirs 212 and 210 while fluid reservoirs 110, 112, and 114
      were grounded. The potential bias created a sufficiently large
      potential difference between the poles of the BPE ( 204) to drive
      water oxidation and reduction at the BPE anode ( 206) and cathode
      ( 208). See Eqn. 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, chloride
      oxidation occurred at the BPE anode ( 206; Eqn. 3) directly
      resulting in an ion depletion zone near the BPE as chlorine was
      generated.<br>

      <br>
      [0126] In addition, H &lt;+&gt; electrogenerated by water
      oxidation (Eqn. 1) can neutralize bicarbonate and borate that can
      be present in seawater, further contributing to the strength of
      the ion depletion zone ( 109) and subsequently formed electric
      field gradient. With PDF from right to left, seawater, and thus
      the ions present is seawater, were transported toward the electric
      field gradient formed at intersection where the dilute outlet
      channel ( 104) and concentrated outlet channel ( 106) diverge from
      the inlet channel ( 102).<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The electrophoretic velocity ([mu] ep) of a charged analyte
      is governed by Eqn. 4, where [mu] ep is the analyte's
      electrophoretic mobility and V 1 is the local electric field
      strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [mu] ep=[mu] epV 1 (Eqn. 4)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] In all regions of the device depicted in FIG. 2, except
      near the ion depletion zone formed by the anode of the bipolar
      electrode in proximity to the intersection where dilute outlet
      channel and concentrated outlet channel diverge from the inlet
      channel, the transport of water and all dissolved species is
      controlled by PDF. As a consequence, all neutrals and ions to move
      generally in the direction of fluid flow (i.e., from right to
      left) throughout the device. However, as ions approach the local
      electric field gradient formed by the electrode in proximity to
      the intersection, they experience an increasing [mu] ep as the
      electric field strength increases. In the case of cations, this
      gradient causes them to redirect toward the grounded reservoir in
      the brine stream as a result of the local electrophoretic velocity
      of the ions ([mu] ep) exceeding the mean convective velocity of
      the fluid (PDF). To maintain electroneutrality with the
      microchannel, anions are also redirected into the brine stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The flow of ionic species through the microchannels of the
      device was monitored by observing the flow of Ru(bpy) &lt;2+&gt;
      (a fluorescent cationic tracer) through the device. FIGS. 7A and
      7B are fluorescence micrographs of the device taken before ( FIG.
      7A) and after ( FIG. 7B) application of a potential bias. As shown
      in FIG. 7A, when no potential bias was applied, ions flowed
      through the inlet channel ( 702), and into both the dilute outlet
      channel ( 704) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 706). Upon
      application of a potential bias, an ion depletion zone and
      subsequent electric field gradient are formed near the BPE anode (
      708) in proximity to the intersection ( 710) of the dilute outlet
      channel ( 704) and the concentrated outlet channel ( 706; FIG.
      7B). As a consequence, ions, including the fluorescent cationic
      tracer Ru(bpy) &lt;2+&gt;, are directed into the concentrated
      outlet channel ( 706). Desalted water (which is non-fluorescent in
      the micrograph due to the absence of fluorescent cationic tracer
      Ru(bpy) &lt;2+&gt;) flows into the dilute outlet channel ( 704).
      These results demonstrate that both cations and anions flow into
      the concentrated outlet channel ( 706). The initial application of
      2.5 V creates an oxidizing environment near the BPE anode which
      causes partial dissolution of the Au anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] To confirm that the formation of an ion depletion zone
      resulted in the deionization of the fluid flowing into the device,
      a similar experiment was conducted using a solution lacking
      chloride ions. If all chloride ions are eliminated from solution,
      one would not expect the BPE anode to induce formation of an ion
      depletion zone and local electric field gradient (as in the case
      of saltwater containing chloride ions). In the control experiment,
      a solution of Na 2SO 4 was flowed through the device. As shown in
      FIG. 8, upon application of 2.5 V, no decrease in fluorescence
      intensity near the BPE anode was observed. This finding was
      consistent with the seawater desalination being the result of an
      ion depletion zone formed near the BPE anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] FIG. 9 shows a representative plot of total current flowing
      through the device (i tot) vs. time. The steady-state operating
      current of the device was 65 nA. With a 2.5 V potential bias
      driving the desalination process, the device operated at a power
      consumption of only 162.5 nW.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Fluid flow rates through the dilute outlet channel could be
      measured using non-charged beads. Fluid flow rates through the
      dilute outlet channel could also be measured by tracking the
      movement of fluorescent tracer after the 2.5 V driving potential
      was turned off, in which case all mass transport was due to PDF.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The average operating fluid flow rate of the devices was
      ~400 [mu]m/s. At higher fluid flow rates, the ion depletion zone
      does not extend as far into the dilute outlet channel.
      Consequently, the desalination process becomes less efficient, and
      ions begin to flow into the dilute outlet channel during device
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Using the device operating at 162.5 nW, 34 mWh/L energy
      efficiencies were achieved. This energy efficiency is orders of
      magnitude higher than the current state-of-the-art seawater
      desalination technologies. For example, reverse osmosis is
      typically performed at energy efficiencies of approximately 5
      Wh/L, and has only achieved maximum energy efficiencies of
      approximately 1.8 Wh/L. This superior efficiency of the
      microfluidic device relative to reverse osmosis is particularly
      notable when considering that these reverse osmosis energy
      efficiencies correspond to the efficiencies of industrial
      desalination facilities (which are often higher than efficiencies
      observed for the same process conducted on a smaller scale).<br>
      <br>
      [0134] A reduction in device scale typically results in a decrease
      in energy efficiency. As a consequence, these devices appear to be
      extremely competitive for small-scale desalination use. Moreover,
      because little equipment is required, and device operation only
      requires a 2.5 V power supply, these devices can be used in water
      stresses regions. In addition, because BPEs do not require a
      direct electrical connection, it is possible to simultaneously
      operate numerous devices in parallel using a simple power supply.<br>

      The present invention relates generally to the field of
      microfluidics-based analysis and, more particularly, to system and
      method for electrokinetic trapping and concentration enrichment of
      analytes in a microfluidic channel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Sample enrichment or preconcentration plays an important role in
      chemical separation and analysis. In general, if molecules to be
      detected (the analyte) exist in a chemical sample in high
      concentrations, then it is easier to detect their presence.
      However, many important analytes, especially biomoleculesa such as
      DNA, proteins, antibodies, antigens, and polysaccharides, often
      exist in minute quantities in real, unprocessed chemical samples.<br>
      <br>
      Microfluidic devies typically consist of a network of channels,
      which have cross- sectional dimensions of tens to hundreds of
      microns, terminated with reservoirs the contain analytes. Various
      approaches have been used to move analytes out of the reservoirs
      and into the channel network, where the analytes are separated and
      detected. Because the total fluid volume of a microfluidic device
      is very small, the analyte must exist in a sufficiently high
      concentration for there to be enough molecules present to be
      detectable.<br>
      <br>
      Some methods are based on controlling the electrokinetic
      properties of at least two plugs (zones of solution of limited or
      defined length within a microchannel) of an electrolyte solution.
      These methods, which include field-amplification stacking,
      isotachophoresis, and micelle sweeping, require that neighboring
      electrolyte plugs have different compositions.<br>
      <br>
      However, this is a difficult condition to realize in a
      commercially viable system. Other methods are based on the
      principle of size exclusion, which is essentially a filtration
      method.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the analyte is larger than the pores of a filtration
      membrane barrier and, as such, the analyte is retained by the
      filter while small molecules (solvent and electrolyte) pass
      through.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for
      chemical analysis includes providing a device having a drain
      region, a source region, and a gate region disposed therebetween,
      associating a buffer solution with the drain region and the source
      region, causing a potential difference between the drain region
      and the source region until a stable current is reached, replacing
      the buffer solution in the source region with a solution
      containing an analyte, and applying a negative potential to the
      source region to create a forward bias.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention provide a number of technical
      advantages.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention may include all, some, or none of
      these advantages. Some embodiments of the invention provide
      devices and methods for the manipulation of charged analytes, such
      as molecules, particles, beads, and the like, such that the
      charged analytes may be trapped, filtered, fractionated, or
      locally enriched in concentration. Having been so manipulated, the
      charged analytes may be available for detection, reaction,
      collection, or other processing, within the same device or upon
      removal to another device or instrument.<br>
      <br>
      The portion of the device responsible for trapping, filtering,
      fractionating or enriching the concentration of the charged
      analyte may be the sole functional aspect of the device, although
      generally this portion will be just one component of an integrated
      device, i. e. , a microfluidic device that is capable of
      performing other operations in combination with, either preceding
      or following, the operation disclosed herein as the subject
      invention. Examples of other operations performed within
      microfluidic devices include mixing, metering, binding,
      incubating, thermocycling, reacting, electrophoresing, absorbing
      or adsorbing and desorbing, extracting, etc. , employing
      structures such as valves, channel networks, pressure actuators,
      thermal sources and sinks, and pH, conductivity, temperature or
      pressure sensors, which are known by and familiar to those skilled
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments may provide a method for concentrating charged
      analytes prior to further processing within an integrated
      microfluidic device. Accordingly, one embodiment provides an
      improved method of electrophoretic separation analysis of charged
      analytes based on concentrating analytes as herein described and
      then releasing the concentrated species into a separation channel.
      Alternatively, further processing may involve releasing the
      concentrated analytes from a first gate region and passing the
      concentrated species via a fluidic network to another, second gate
      region wherein the species may be again concentrated, collected,
      detected or fractionated.<br>
      <br>
      Some embodiments may provide a linear series of gate regions in
      combination in a manner such that each gate region acts to
      concentrate a subset of the charged analytes adjacent thereto,
      while another subset passes through the gate channels of that gate
      region and towards the next, wherein each successive gate region
      presents a different threshold for passage based on
      electrophoretic mobility and thus causing a different subset of
      charged analytes to concentrate adjacent thereto.<br>
      <br>
      Various embodiments of the invention may find general application
      in microfluidic devices for a variety of purposes because the
      method relies upon the balancing of physical forces and motions.
      As such, the invention does not require, for example,
      molecule-specific binding interactions in order to provide
      trapping, filtering, fractionation or enrichment of the analyte.
      Thus, the devices and methods are broadly applicable to a wide
      range of analytes that are charged, or may be associated with
      charge-bearing species, such as molecules or particles.<br>

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and/or
      devices for the trapping and enrichment of charged analytes and,
      as described herein, is based on a fundamentally new principle
      that is broadly applicable to a wide range of uses. However, the
      present invention contemplates that the principle is general and
      versatile and should be applicable to any suitably charged
      molecule or object, and to many other suitable forms of a device
      in which the principle operates.<br>
      <br>
      In the following detailed description, the term"analyte"is used in
      a broad sense. On one hand, analyte means a discrete substance,
      molecule, aggregate, polymer, bead, particle, cell or subcellular
      component, bearing a charge, that is to be subjected to
      manipulation or processing in a device or by a method. Analytes
      include, but are not limited to, peptides, proteins,
      polynucleotides, polypeptides, oligonucleotides, organic
      molecules, haptens, epitopes, cells or parts of biological cells,
      posttranslational modifications of proteins, receptors, complex
      sugars, vitamins, hormones, and the like. Analytes may also be
      inorganic compounds or particles, semiconductor particles, such as
      quantum dots, polymeric beads or particles, etc. , provided the
      material in question is small enough to be able to physically pass
      through gate channels of a particular device (as described in
      greater detail below) and thus be capable of performing according
      to inventive methods described herein. For any of the above-listed
      exemplary analytes, they must either have a net anionic or
      cationic charge; though if not intrinsically charged, the
      particular analyte may be modified or otherwise associated with
      some other charged species such that it bears a charge when used
      in embodiments of the invention. However, the term"analyte"is not
      intended to refer to the ions that make up the supporting
      electrolyte used in the buffer solutions.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, and according to the context, "analyte"is also
      used to mean a multicomponent sample used according to embodiments
      of the invention. Used in this sense, the analyte contains a
      plurality of distinct charged species, and each of the species
      will respond differently in the operation of a device. Some of the
      species may become concentrated, while others may not under a
      given set of conditions.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 1 illustrates a system 100 for electrokinetic trapping and
      concentration enrichment of an analyte 111 according to one
      embodiment of the invention. FIGURE 1 is meant to illustrate the
      general principle of the invention, which relies on exerting
      spatial control over the electrokinetic velocity of analyte 111.
      In the illustrated embodiment, system 100 includes a drain region
      or channel 102 having a first electrode 103, a source region or
      channel 104 having a second electrode 105, a gate region 106
      providing fluid communication between drain channel 102 and source
      channel 104, a buffer solution 108 associated with drain channel
      102, a second solution 110 containing analyte 111 disposed in
      source channel 104, and a power supply 112 operable to impart a
      potential difference, or bias, between first electrode 103 and
      second electrode 105.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, gate region 106 is defined by a
      plurality of gate channels 107 that span between drain channel 102
      and source channel 104. The gate channel openings are pores that
      are filled with electrolyte buffer solution 108. The size of any
      one gate channel 107 (or pore opening) should be smaller than the
      cross-sectional area of the channel section that gate channel 107
      opens into (i. e. , the area of the gate channel/channel section
      interface) in order to have a functional device. In one
      embodiment, the combined area of the openings of all gate channels
      107 is prescribed to be smaller than the cross- sectional area of
      the interface between gate region 106 and the drain or source
      channels, as further described below. The area of the interface is
      in some embodiments equivalent to the cross-section of a channel
      section as is generally the case when the channel sections lie
      within the same plane.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the present invention also calls for the pore
      openings to be larger than the size of the analyte that is to be
      trapped, filtered, or concentrated using the device. As such, pore
      openings, or gate channel widths, ranging in scale from about 2 nm
      to 2 llm, or even 5 pm are contemplated. A range of 10 nm to 1000
      nm may be more typical.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, for a device with channel sizes on the order of 10 pm
      to 1 mm, the relative width of the pore opening to the width of
      the channel sections is at least a ratio of about 1 to 10, and may
      be as small as 1 to 1,000 or 1 to 100,000. The size of opening
      chosen depends on a variety of factors, such as the size, the
      charge and mobility of the analyte, the viscosity and conductivity
      of the buffer solution, the chemical nature of the gate region
      material, and the anticipated rate of convective flow required
      through the pores.<br>
      <br>
      The latter consideration, the rate of convective flow, is a
      significant factor in the operation of a device. Electroosmotic
      (eo) flow is generated within a gate channel 107, as indicated by
      arrow 109, when an electric field exists along that channel as a
      result of there being a permanent charge on the wall of the
      channel. Counterions predominate in the solution double layer at
      the wall interface, and the electrokinetic movement of these
      counterions in response to the electric field causes a net flow of
      the bulk solution. In one operation of the device, convective flow
      is required through gate channels 107 and, as such, channel walls
      bearing a charge are a characteristic of the device. At least one
      of either drain channel 102, source channel 104 or gate channels
      107 of gate region 106 will have a charge- bearing surface. With
      an eo flow generated in at least one of these sections there will
      be a net convective flow (a combination of eo flow and
      pressure-driven flow caused by the eo flow) of buffer solution 108
      in gate channels 107, due to the requirements of mass balance,
      subject to considerations such as the particular geometry of the
      particular channel network in a device.<br>
      <br>
      Electrodes 103,105 are said to be associated with their respective
      channel sections 102,104. By this it is intended that a particular
      electrode sets the electrical potential distribution in the
      solution that is contained in its respective channel section,
      proximal to gate region 106. The electrode may reside within the
      channel, or within a suitable port or reservoir that communicates
      with the channel. In the case of a device being comprised of a
      network of channels, the electrode may be physically distant, and
      may even be located on the other side of a different gate region.
      However, for the gate region in question, the electrode is
      considered associated with a channel section as long as the
      channel section that the electrode sets the potential of is
      proximal with respect to the gate.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIGURE 1, an operation of one embodiment of
      system 100 as it embodies a method for concentrating a charged
      analyte is now considered. Drain channel 102 and source channel
      104 of the microfluidic device are filled with electrolyte buffer
      solution 108. The electrolyte provides ion conductors within the
      fluid and in response to a potential bias supplied between
      electrodes 103,105 supports the establishment of an electric field
      along the channels. Analyte 111, specifically a negatively charged
      analyte, such as a DNA molecule, is initially located in source
      channel 104, typically in a port or reservoir that communicates
      with the channel section, thereby associating it with the channel
      section. A potential bias is imparted to electrodes 103,105 to
      produce an electric field therebetween, wherein in this example
      the source electrode 105 is negative and drain electrode 103 is
      positive.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the electrokinetic motion of the DNA molecule under
      the influence of the electric field is towards drain electrode
      103, and thus towards the gate region 106. This motion is
      characterized by an electrokinetic velocity that is the vector sum
      of the intrinsic electrophoretic (ep) velocity of analyte 111 and
      the convective velocity of buffer solution 108. Again, convective
      motion of buffer solution 108 refers to motion that is either
      electroosmotic flow or pressure-driven flow induced by the eo
      flow, or a combination thereof. By providing wall sections of any
      or all of the channels that bear a negative charge, the convective
      velocity of buffer solution 108 within gate region 106 is opposite
      in direction to the ep velocity of DNA in source channel 104. By
      having a convective velocity that is larger than the ep velocity,
      the DNA is not able to enter gate region 106 and instead
      accumulates and concentrates at a location in source channel 104
      adjacent gate region 106.<br>
      <br>
      The location of the concentrated band that forms is typically near
      the interface of gate region 106 with source channel 104.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGURE 1, the first requirement for trapping and
      enriching DNA (i. e., analyte 111) is that the ep velocity of DNA
      in source channel 104, which may be polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),
      must be larger than the eo velocity of buffer solution 108 in
      source channel 104. That is to say, analyte 111 has a net
      electrokinetic velocity in source channel 104 towards gate region
      106. The second requirement for DNA trapping and enrichment is
      that the local convective velocity of buffer solution 108 in the
      gate channels 107 is greater than and opposite in direction to the
      intrinsic ep velocity of analyte 111. Thus, fluid emanating from
      the pores, or gate channels 107, exemplified by, for example, a
      polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) membrane, effectively prevents
      analytes 111 from entering. Accordingly, analyte 111 accumulate
      near gate region 106 due to the opposing forces.<br>
      <br>
      Because the eo velocity is equal to the product of the eo mobility
      and the electric field, thus it follows that the eo velocity may
      be modulated by changing the magnitude of the electric field.
      Furthermore, the local eo velocity may be varied according to
      position within a microfluidic network by simply changing the
      cross-sectional area at that position. For example, having a gate
      region comprised of gate channels having a smaller total cross-
      sectional area compared to the interface of the gate region and
      the source channel results in a higher local eo velocity through
      the pores. Thus, changing the cross-sectional area ratio provides
      a means for modulating the eo (convective) flow within a channel.
      This flow rate modulation selectively traps those analytes having
      an intrinsic ep mobility smaller than the local velocity of the
      eo"jets"emanating from the gate channel, while passing those
      analytes that have a ep mobility higher than the eo jet velocity.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGURE 1, in the case of analyte 111 being positively
      charged, the particular parameters given in the above example
      would need to be changed appropriately.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the bias imparted would be reversed, with source
      electrode 105 being positive and drain electrode 103 being
      negative, and the walls would necessarily have a net positive
      charge in order that an opposing convective flow be established
      through gate channels 107.<br>
      <br>
      Gate region 106 and gate channels 107 associated therewith are an
      important part of the subject invention. In one embodiment, the
      use of a porous membrane, more usually referred to as a nanoporous
      membrane, is contemplated. Nanoporous membrane materials are an
      area of interest, particularly for applications in filtration and
      sensing. As a result, methods for controlling the pore size, the
      composition, and the functional groups exposed within the pores,
      and the use of materials that range from organic polymers to
      semiconductors, ceramics and organic/inorganic composites, such as
      epoxy-embedded carbon nanotubes are known in the art. Depending on
      the material used, those skilled in the art will be familiar with
      the various techniques used to prepare such membranes, such as
      ion-track or ion-beam etching, anodic etching, microlithography in
      combination with etching, laser ablation, templated chemical
      assembly, sol-gel techniques, and the like. Nanoporous membranes
      for use in some embodiments of the invention may be comprised of
      at least one of the following: a polyester polymer such as PETE,
      polyimide, cellulose, polycarbonate, carbon or carbon nanotubes,
      semiconductors such as silicon or insulators such as silicon
      nitride, silica, alumina, or other inorganic ceramic materials
      such as titanates. Another class of nanoporous material, the
      hydrogel, is also useful in the invention and is described in
      further detail below.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 2 illustrates a microfluidic system 200 chemical analysis
      and separation in accordance with one embodiment of the invention.
      In the illustrated embodiment, system 200 includes a drain
      reservoir 202 having a first electrode 203, a drain channel 204, a
      source reservoir 206 having a second electrode 207, a source
      channel 208, gate channel 210, a power supply 212, and an imaging
      device 214. Drain reservoir 202 may be any suitable size and shape
      and contains a buffer solution 216. Drain reservoir 202 couples to
      drain channel 204 in any suitable manner. Drain channel 204 may be
      any suitable size and shape; however, in one embodiment drain
      channel 204 as well as source channel 208 are polydimethylsiloxane
      (PDMS) channels having an approximate cross-section of 100 um x 20
      u. m. Source reservoir 206 also may be any suitable size and shape
      and contains a second solution 218 containing one or more analytes
      211. Gate channel 210 may be any suitable size and shape; however,
      in the illustrated embodiment, gate channel 210 is a nanoporous
      polyester membrane. For example, in a particular embodiment of the
      invention, gate channel 210 is a polyester membrane formed from
      PETE and having a 200 nm pore diameter, 10 llm thick, and 3x108
      pores/cm2 manufactured by Osmonics. In other embodiments, gate
      channel 210 may be a porous hydrogel polymer network.<br>
      <br>
      First electrode 203 and second electrode 207 may be any suitable
      electrodes and are immersed within their respective reservoir in
      order to create an electric field inside drain channel 204 and
      source channel 208. Power supply 212, which may be any suitable
      power supply, is operable to apply a potential difference between
      first electrode 203 and second electrode 207.<br>
      <br>
      Imaging device 214 may be any suitable device that is operable to
      create an image of analyte 211 within system 200. For example,
      imaging device 214 may be an inverted fluorescence microscope
      equipped with an imaging CCD camera. In one embodiment, imaging
      device 214 is operable to obtain fluorescence micrographs of
      analyte 211.<br>
      <br>
      In operation of one embodiment of system 200, drain reservoir 202,
      drain channel 204, source reservoir 206, and source channel 208
      are filled with buffer solution 216. Buffer solution 216 may be
      any suitable buffer solution and, in a particular embodiment,
      buffer solution 216 is a TBE buffer solution (89mM TRIS base +
      89mM boric acid + 2mM EDTA, pH 8.4) at reduced pressure. Buffer
      solution 216 is conditioned by applying 100 V between first
      electrode 203 and second electrode 207 until a stable current is
      reached. That portion of buffer solution 216 in source reservoir
      206 is then replaced with second solution 218 containing analyte
      211. For example, in a particular embodiment of the invention,
      analyte 211 is 10 llg/mL DNA (a 20mer ssDNA, 5'-labeled with
      fluorescein, obtained from IDT of Coralville, IA). Although
      analyte 211 is labeled with fluorescein in this example, any
      suitable label may be used to label analyte 211.<br>
      <br>
      After obtaining a fluorescence micrograph 300 (FIGURE 3A), a
      forward bias (negative potential in source reservoir 206) is
      applied between first electrode 203 and second electrode 207. The
      resulting motion of analyte 211 (i. e. , DNA) is recorded using
      imaging device 214. This eventually results in the formation of an
      enriched band 220 of analyte 211 within source channel 208. Using
      the conditions noted above, enrichment of DNA is apparent within
      approximately thirty seconds and reaches an enrichment factor of
      eleven within approximately sixty-eight seconds, as shown in the
      fluorescence micrograph 302 of FIGURE 3B. The minimum width of
      enriched band 220 is approximately 100 um. The formation of
      enriched band 220 is a result of the general principle of the
      invention, as outlined and described in FIGURE 1.<br>
      <br>
      When the forward bias is reversed, analyte 211 is immediately
      transported through gate channel 210, which indicates that
      enrichment is not a consequence of size exclusion induced by gate
      channel 210 (in this example the pores of the nanoporous
      membrane).<br>
      <br>
      Transportation of analyte 211 through gate channel 210 is
      illustrated by the fluorescence micrograph 304 of FIGURE 3C. The
      transported analyte 211 is then trapped in drain channel 204 by
      the same balance of ep and eo velocities that was initially
      responsible for the formation of enrichment band 220 in source
      channel 208.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 4 is a graph 400 illustrating fluorescence intensity as a
      function of time allotted for concentration enrichment of DNA in
      an experiment used to demonstrate one embodiment of the invention.
      As illustrated in FIGURE 4, the magnitude of DNA concentration
      reaches a limiting value in the center of the enriched band within
      a finite time (tconc). At t &lt; tconc the enriched band has a
      nearly constant length, but when t &gt; tConc this enriched band
      begins to expand longitudinally in the direction of the source
      reservoir. Using the conditions noted above, for an initial
      concentration of 10 llg/mL DNA and a 100 V forward bias, tronc is
      approximately five minutes and the enrichment factor, calculated
      from the relative fluorescence intensity is approximately thirty.
      However, when the DNA concentration in the source reservoir is
      reduced to approximately 1 llg/mL and 0. 1, ug/mL, the enrichment
      factor is increased to 300 and 800, respectively. Considering the
      simplicity and compactness of a microfluidic system, such as
      system 200, these enrichment factors are significant.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 5 illustrates a system 500 for implementing another
      embodiment of trapping and enrichment of a negatively charged
      molecule or object according to the teachings of the invention. In
      the illustrated embodiment, system 500 includes a microfluidic
      device having a primary microchannel 502 that has a section 504
      with an enlarged width at the center, and a first reservoir 506
      and a second reservoir 508 at either primary microchannel 502
      terminus.<br>
      <br>
      Side channels 510,512 are also shown intersecting with first and
      second channel sections 502a, 502b of the primary channel 502,
      although these are optional and not critical to the concentrating
      function of the device. The enlarged width section 504 is used to
      hold a hydrogel plug 514 that serves as the gate region of the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      A PDMS-glass microfluidic device similar to system 500 was
      fabricated for testing using standard rapid prototyping procedures
      and techniques. The microfluidic channel network formed had
      primary microchannel 502 about 7 mm long whose ends were connected
      to reservoirs 506,508, each 3 mm in diameter. This primary
      microchannel 502 was approximately 100 um wide and 25 um deep,
      except at center section 504 where it was approximately 200 um
      wide for a length of about 400 urn. On either side of section 504,
      that was to be the gate region, there was side channels 510,512
      connected to primary microchannel 502 at arbitrary angles (~ 45 ).
      The side channels 510, 512 terminate in reservoirs 520,522, each
      about 0.5 mm in diameter. The cross-sectional dimensions of side
      channels 510,512 were the same as those for primary microchannel
      502.<br>
      <br>
      The gate region hydrogel plug 514 was prepared in situ by first
      placing a hydrogel precursor solution comprising 1: 4 molar ratio
      of acrylic acid (AA) to 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), 5 wt %
      of a crosslinker, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and 3 wt
      % of a photoinitiator, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone (DMPAP)
      (all from<br>
      Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. St. Louis, MO), into primary microchannel 502
      by capillary action. A UV beam of 365 nm (300 mW/cm2, EFOS Lite
      E3000, Ontario, Canada) was projected onto the gate region for
      about 200 s from the side port of a microscope (DIAPHOT 300,
      Nikon) and through a lOx objective. A chrome mask was placed at
      the confocal plane at the side port so that a well-defined pattern
      of UV beam was created prior to projection and reduction through
      the microscope optics. Unreacted precursor solution was flushed
      out by introducing 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH = 8.3) at a
      rate of 10 pL/min through reservoirs 506, 508 for more than 10
      min. As the anionic hydrogel plug 514 comes in contact with the
      basic buffer solution, it expands and pushes itself against the
      walls of microchannel 502.<br>
      <br>
      Comparatively less swelling is observed in case of uncharged
      hydrogel plug; still, it is enough to ensure that plug 514 remains
      stationary even under the influence of electric field.<br>
      <br>
      The enlarged width section 504 in the primary channel 502 is
      advantageous for securing the position of hydrogel plug 514, and
      the prevention of any movement or slippage of the plug along the
      channel is desired. It is preferable to stabilize hydrogel plug
      514 against the influence of high electric fields or other forces,
      such as hydrodynamic flow either during device fabrication or
      usage of the device. Alternatively, or in addition to the flange
      provided by enlarged width section 504, the channel walls may be
      treated to have a reactive chemical group (e. g. , a crosslinking
      agent) that can chemically bond to hydrogel plug 514 in order to
      secure its position.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable hydrogel polymer plugs may be prepared from a wide
      variety of monomers, crosslinking agents, and initiators. The
      various components may be chosen for their degree of
      hydrophilicity, net charge, ability to enhance or reduce swelling
      or specific functional groups they may possess. However, the gel
      should provide two basic properties: (1) an ability to act as a
      porous ion conductor, and (2) the structural strength to withstand
      the forces of the electric field and any pressure-driven flow to
      which it will be exposed. In this regard, the amount of
      crosslinker used is important. When the percentage amount is too
      low the gel will not be rigid enough. Conversely, too high an
      amount of crosslinker limits the ability to swell and form a
      porous network. Thus, a percentage of at least about 5%, and no
      more than about 10% is preferred. Likewise, the amount of
      initiator used determines the properties of the gel produced.
      Initiator present in the range of-1-5 wt % generally produces
      hydrogels suitable for the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogel plug 514 may be preformed and added to the
      microfluidic channel network, or it may be formed in situ. The
      formation of the polymer may be photoinitiated or thermally
      initiated. Photoirradiated regions may be determined by
      interposing a mask or using a directed light source. On the other
      hand, the location of the gel precursor solution may be defined
      and thus determine the location and size of hydrogel plug 514.
      These methods are also well known in the art. Another exemplary
      method has been reported by Yu, et al. , in Anal. Chem. , 2002,73,
      p. 5088-5096.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURES 6A through 6D illustrate the preconcentration phenomena
      observed in a microfluidic channel incorporating the anionic
      hydrogel plug 514, illustrated by system 500, as imaged using the
      microscope system previously described. After conditioning the
      channel by applying a potential bias of 100 V for 10 min, the
      potential was switched off and a 5 uM fluorescein solution was
      introduced through reservoir 508 to replace the buffer solution in
      channels 502b and 512. The solutions in all the reservoirs
      506,520, 508,522 are kept at the same level to nullify any
      hydrodynamic flows inside the channel. Two platinum electrodes
      were inserted in reservoirs 506,508. A potential of 100 V was
      applied between the electrodes using a power source (range 0-1067
      V) operated by a suitable in-house computer program.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 6A shows the fluorescence micrograph obtained before the
      application of any potential bias. After applying a forward 100 V
      bias (reservoir 506 at positive potential), the negatively charged
      fluorescein ions migrate rapidly from reservoir 508 to reservoir
      506.<br>
      <br>
      However, hydrogel plug 514 at the gate region acts as a barrier to
      this movement, resulting in the concentration of fluorescein near
      the hydrogel-solution interface. This is apparent from FIGURE 6B,
      where concentration factors of 16 and 10 were achieved just inside
      the hydrogel and in the solution just outside the hydrogel,
      respectively, within 90 s. During forward bias, some fluorescein
      was lost as a fraction of fluorescein solution (about 2-fold
      concentrated) is directed towards floating reservoir 522. When the
      potential bias is reversed (FIGURE 6C), fluorescein is rapidly
      transported back towards reservoir 508. A minute amount of
      fluorescein (about 0. 75-fold) was trapped inside hydrogel plug
      514 even after the application of reverse bias for 120 s (FIGURE
      6D).<br>
      <br>
      As shown by a graph 650 of concentration vs. time in FIGURE 6E, a
      higher preconcentration factor is observed inside hydrogel plug
      514 (ROI 1) than in the solution (ROI 2). The enrichment factors
      reach a limiting value of 16 and 10 respectively within 100s. At t
      = 160 s, in the absence of potential bias, fluorescein
      concentrated inside hydrogel plug 514 starts to diffuse back to
      the solution, which in turn increases the concentration at ROI 2.<br>
      <br>
      The above observation is likely caused by electrostatic repulsions
      between the hydrogel backbone and the fluorescein molecules, which
      become significant when the external bias voltage is turned off.
      On applying a reverse bias at t = 180 s, fluorescein is
      immediately transported back towards reservoir 508.<br>
      <br>
      In a recent study of protein interaction and diffusion in
      HEMA-co-AA hydrogels, it has been reported that negatively charged
      protein Bovine Serum Albumin (Molecular weight 66 kDa and
      hydrodynamic radius of 3.4 nm at 4 C) is able to diffuse
      (diffusion coefficient of the order of 10-8 cm2/s) through the
      hydrogel at swelling ratios of less than 2. This suggests that the
      hydrogel pore size is greater than 3.4 nm. The calculated Debye
      length for 10 mM buffer solution is about 3 nm. Thus, the hydrogel
      pore size is sufficiently larger than the Debye length, giving
      rise to considerable electroosmotic flow inside the pores. The
      observed concentration phenomenon is consistent with the
      explanation that an electroosmotic flow opposes the electrokinetic
      transport of fluorescein ions, with a balance being achieved just
      inside the hydrogel boundary where sample stacking, i. e. , the
      formation of the band of fluorescein, is observed. Electrostatic
      repulsion between the charged hydrogel and the anionic analyte is
      also present, although experiments using uncharged hydrogel
      display the same stacking, or concentration, phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      The trapping and/or enrichment principles illustrated and
      described above in conjunction with FIGURES 1 through 6 may be
      important in many applications. Some of these applications are
      described in the embodiments illustrated in FIGURES 7 through 9.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 7 illustrates a system 700 for electrokinetic trapping and
      concentration enrichment in microfluidic systems according to one
      embodiment of the present invention in which an enriched band of a
      mixture may be utilized as an injection plug for capillary
      electrophoretic (CE) separation. System 700 may be considered to
      be similar to system 200 of FIGURE 2; however, in the embodiment
      illustrated in FIGURE 7, system 700 also includes a separation
      region 702 having a separation reservoir 704, a separation
      electrode 706, and a separation channel 708, which is coupled to a
      source channel 710. Assuming that an analyte 711 is a negatively
      charged DNA molecule, a forward bias (negative potential in a
      source reservoir 712 and a positive potential in drain reservoir
      714) is applied for a particular period of time. As a result, an
      enriched band 716 forms in a source channel 720 adjacent a gate
      channel 718, in accordance with the principle described above in
      conjunction with FIGURE 1.<br>
      <br>
      When that bias is turned off, a bias is applied between a source
      electrode 713 and separation electrode 706 immediately thereafter,
      such that enriched band 716 is driven toward separation reservoir
      704. Other embodiments for channel networks and the manner in
      which separation channel 708 communicates with gate channel 718
      are also included in the subject invention. The analyte 711
      concentrated at gate channel 718 may be processed in a variety of
      manners, such as, for example, to create a defined injection plug,
      prior to being driven into separation channel 708. Methods and
      devices for injecting sample plugs into microfluidic
      electrophoretic separation channels are well known in the art; see
      for example U. S. Patent Nos. 5,599, 432,5, 750,015, 5,900, 130,6,
      007,690, 6,699, 377, which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      The separated analytes 711 may be collected at the end of
      separation channel 708, further injected into a separate
      instrument, or a detector may be positioned along or at the end of
      separation channel 708 to record the passage of analytes 711 along
      separation channel 708.<br>
      <br>
      Detection may be optical (absorbance, fluorescence, shadowing),
      electrochemical (amperometric, potentiometric), or by other
      suitable methods. Note that separation channel 708 may be modified
      to obtain a particular benefit; for example, the channel surface
      may be treated to modulate and control eo flow, or the entire
      channel may be filled with a separation medium, such as a sieving
      polymeric matrix for the case of DNA separation, to improve
      resolution.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURES 8A and 8B illustrate a system 800 for electrokinetic
      trapping and concentration enrichment in microfluidic systems
      according to an embodiment of the invention in which the location
      of an enriched band 802 may be controlled by applying a sequence
      of bias voltages with well-defined temporal control. In the
      illustrated embodiment, system 800 includes a source reservoir 804
      having a source electrode 806, a source channel 808, a first drain
      reservoir 810 having a first drain electrode 812, a first drain
      channel 814, a second drain reservoir 816 having a second drain
      electrode 818, a second drain channel 820, a first gate channel
      822, and a second gate channel 824.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment of the invention, enriched band 802 forms by
      applying a forward bias voltage between source electrode 806, and
      first drain electrode 812. This forward bias is then switched off
      and another forward bias is immediately applied between source
      electrode 806 and second drain electrode 818. Enriched band 802
      thus moves from a location adjacent first gate channel 822 to a
      location adjacent second gate channel 824, as indicated in FIGURE
      8B. Enriched band 802 moves to this new location via ep transport.
      This type of manipulation of enriched bands containing highly
      concentrated chemical reagents may be utilized in other suitable
      applications. For example, using the illustrated technique to
      bring two reactive reagents together to initiate a chemical
      reaction or to bring together assay reagents for binding,
      interacting, or reacting is contemplated by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIGURE 9 illustrates a system 900 for electrokinetic trapping and
      concentration enrichment in microfluidic systems according to one
      embodiment of the invention in which a mixtures of charged
      molecules may be trapped, enriched, and separated using a series
      of gate channels. As such, system 900 includes a source reservoir
      902 having a source electrode 904, a first source channel 906, a
      second source channel 908, a third source channel 910, a drain
      reservoir 912 having a drain electrode 914, a first gate channel
      916, a second gate channel 918, and a third gate channel 920. Gate
      channels 916,918, and 920 have successively smaller
      cross-sectional areas with respect to their adjacent source
      channel to allow trapping, enrichment, and separation of a mixture
      of charged chemicals or objects based on differences in their ep
      mobilities. For example, based on the principles discussed above
      in conjunction with FIGURE 2, after separation a first enriched
      band forms in first source channel 906 adjacent first gate channel
      916 and contains chemicals with the lowest average ep mobility,
      whereas an enriched band 924 forms within third source channel 910
      adjacent third gate channel 920 and contains chemicals with the
      highest average ep mobility. In addition, an enriched band 926
      forms in second source channel 908 adjacent second gate channel
      918 and contains chemicals with an average ep mobility between
      that of enriched band 922 and enriched band 924. A combination of
      the pore size, number of pores, total area of pore openings and
      pore surface charge of gate channels 916,918, and 920 may be
      varied to achieve the proper balance of convective flow rate per
      pore for each gate channel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Device Fabrication</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A microfluidic device generally has a thickness of 0.2 to 10 mm,
      and a length and width that vary greatly depending on the purpose,
      but are generally in the range of 2 to 20 cm, and 2 to 10 cm,
      respectively. Devices for electrophoretic separations may be
      longer. In some embodiments, devices fabricated wholly using thin
      films may be used as devices and be as thin as about 0.1 mm<br>
      <br>
      Devices according to the present invention may be fabricated in
      any suitable manner.<br>
      <br>
      A device body may be formed in plastic off of a
      micromachined/etched positive rendition of the channels, chambers,
      reservoirs and any other fluidic features. Suitable plastics
      include acrylics, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polystyrenes and
      other polymers suitable for microfluidic or electrokinetic
      applications. A backing is preferably made of a nonconducting film
      or body attached to the surface of the device body containing the
      channels. One suitable material for a backing is a
      polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) film. The backing is preferably
      attached to the body by chemical, thermal, or mechanical bonding.
      Ultrasonic welding (an example of mechanical welding) may also be
      employed to fuse various parts together. Of course, the body of
      microfluidic devices may be produced directly by etching the
      intended structures in a substrate. In such instances, a cover
      including wells or reservoir openings is preferably placed over
      channels or trenches in the substrate to complete the device.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the channel features may be formed in the cover (or
      film) by, e. g. , embossing, the film thereafter being attached to
      a substrate that may feature wells. Other materials are also
      contemplated, such as the exemplified material poly
      (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), silicon, and glass. Further details as
      to device construction may be appreciated by those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, channels have a rectangular, trapezoidal,
      or"D"-shaped cross- section. However, other cross-sectional
      geometries may be employed. Preferably, the channels have a
      substantially constant or uniform cross-section. It is also
      preferred that channels have a surface finish that does not result
      in irregular flow effects.<br>
      <br>
      Devices may also be constructed in a multilayer fashion, wherein
      the channels comprising the microfluidic network of the device do
      not all lie within the same plane. One advantage of a multilayer
      design is that thin porous polymer films or monoliths may be used
      as the gate region, which may be incorporated into the device as a
      layer interposed between substrate lamella in which channels,
      reservoirs, etc. are included. In other words, the device may be
      assembled by aligning, and sealing together, a channel substrate
      layer, a gate region layer, and a second channel substrate layer.
      U. S. Patent No. 6,623, 860 to Hu describes fabrication methods
      and designs for multilevel flow structures useful for microfluidic
      operations.<br>
      <br>
      Material is generally added to or removed from devices at ports or
      reservoirs. A reservoir is preferably sized to contain sufficient
      material for performing a desired test or experiment and also may
      be used for insertion of an electrode so that an external
      electrode may be submerged into any fluid solution used in the
      device and used to apply an electric field within portions of the
      solution, e. g. , for applications requiring electrokinetic motion
      (i. e. , employing either or both electrophoretic and
      electroosmotic phenomena). Suitable materials for the electrodes
      include platinum or other suitable conducting materials,
      particularly those resistant to corrosion. The electrodes may be
      connected to a programmable voltage controller for applying
      desired voltage differentials across the channels.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, electrodes may be integrated by directly
      fabricating electrodes on the surface of the device. See, for
      example, the disclosure of Zhao et al. in U. S. Patent Application
      No. 20020079219, for a discussion of forming electrodes on plastic
      microfluidic devices.<br>
      <br>
      Methods for forming electrodes from metals or conducting inks on
      glass or polyimide substrates are also well known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      As is known in the art, voltages may be used to drive the device.
      For example, U. S. Patent No. 6,010, 607 to Ramsey describes
      information on the manner in which voltages may be applied in
      order to operate the device. Although the present invention relies
      upon electrokinetic phenomena, any device using the invention need
      not rely exclusively on electrokinetic motivation throughout the
      device. As is apparent to one with skill in the art, features as
      described herein may be used in connection other components or
      modules within the microfluidic device that is at least partially
      pressure driven or otherwise motivated.<br>
      <br>
      Although embodiments of the invention and their advantages are
      described in detail, a person skilled in the art could make
      various alterations, additions, and omissions without departing
      from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
