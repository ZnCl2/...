      The invention relates to electrochemistry and can be used for
      producing a combustible gas from liquids. The inventive method
      consists in evaporating a liquid and processing the molecules of
      the evaporated liquid in a high electric field which has an
      intensity of not less than 1kW/cm. Evaporation is performed with
      the aid of a capillary material immersed in the liquid which is
      exposed to the action of the electric field having an intensity of
      not less than 1kW/cm. The evaporation efficiency and the degree of
      molecule dissociation is controlled by modifying the parameters of
      the electric fields (intensity, frequency, a power). The power
      action of the high electric field on the molecules of the liquid
      is used twice. Initially, the liquid is transformed into gas by
      means of the high electric dc field and afterwards, the energy of
      the electric field is used for dissociating the molecules of the
      evaporated liquid.<br>
