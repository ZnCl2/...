      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- The following provisional patent application
        refers to the methods and compositions relating to a novel use
        for enzymatic catalysis of C21-H30-O2 (delta-nine
        tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) as an insect repellent, bactericide,
        and fungicide and dispensation methods as commercial reagent.
        The bio-synthesis of cannabinoids represents a landmark
        achievement in the field of composting, vector removal and
        ecological reconstitution. Although the benefits have been known
        for millennia, the advent of modern bio-engineering techniques
        brings these small seeds of native wisdom to bear on a broader
        and more industrialized scale-removing dangerous molds and
        pestilences such as mosquitoes from swamped and flooded regions,
        raw sewage areas, and disaster sites where ensuing vermin and
        harmful vectors may cause greater damage than the initial
        catastrophes.; It is the ambition and intention of authors that
        tactical usage of this broad-sweeping technique may rapidly and
        at low cost satisfy a global demand in what may be termed a
        "grass-roots" bio-engineering project worthy of the 3rd
        Millennium; bringing to fruition micro-mass-productivity. Should
        a clear error be found either in spirit or in factual evidence
        presented please do not hesitate to contact me. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001]The present invention relates the compositions and
        methods for controlling harmful pestilence in toilets and
        sewage, using modular extensible genetic techniques, and the
        facilitation of rapid, low-cost, cannabinoid production. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ARTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0002]Regions of standing wastewater harboring high
        concentrations of unprocessed, unfiltered rubbage and manure can
        be natural sites for disease. The need for low-impact,
        low-maintenance composting solutions is needed to address city
        sewers and streets around the world that routinely overflow with
        toxic bilge. Controlling pests in such regions may often require
        the use of manufactured chemicals--created along costly and
        inefficient energy gradients (USPTO U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,537).
        Many of these chemical treatments present long-term hazards to
        the environment in the forms of run-off contamination, and
        build-up. Once introduced into a system these non-biodegradable
        inorganic compounds may not easily be eradicated Although these
        methods may be suitable for certain bilge water, especially in
        treatment facilities where build-up and run-off are not
        concerns, they do not address the needs of farmers dealing with
        compost piles, nor sewage water running rampant through the
        streets of cities that have been obliterated by tsunamis,
        hurricanes, or tornadoes--wherein there may be an immediate need
        for rapid decomposition and pestilence ridding. Nor do these
        prior arts address the need for low impact conversion and or
        transmutation of toxins and pestilence, nor do these methods
        establish within the bilge an ecological breeding ground wherein
        one skilled in the arts might hope to use the nutrient rich,
        albeit highly toxic, solution for the establishment of
        biological byproduct. On the other hand, allowing the
        degradation of the toxic bilge to take place naturally may not
        be a viable option--as the aforementioned pestilence may soon
        make a bid to use the nutrient source as a home. In the proposed
        invention one skilled in the arts would safely apply numerous
        vectors to convert the bilge into valuable natural resources
        while simultaneously defending the region from harmful
        pestilence both through the creation of anti-microbial
        substances and through direct competition for resources--in much
        the same way that acidophilus in yogurt out--competes other
        microbes. </p>
      <p>[0003]With regards to the issue of treating filth dispersed
        deep in underground sewers and inaccessible areas--the invention
        makes a stark contrast to previous arts. Whereas most chemical
        reactions must obey the laws of Brownian motion or undergo
        energetically unfavorable processes such as pumping (USPTO U.S.
        Pat. No. 5,360,556) or heating (USPTO U.S. Pat. No. 6,753,536),
        enzymatic reactions enabled in motile vectors hold a decisive
        advantage as they can move through a liquid medium more easily.
        As one skilled in the arts appreciates the possibility of using
        a motile plant vector such as the sperm of the gingko would
        allow even greater motility for the vector. In the preferred
        embodiment of this invention catalysts hosted in transgenic e.
        coli, transgenic tobacco root hair, and used in modular
        extensible vectors controlling the synthesis of compounds such
        as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabigerolic acid
        (CBGA), cannabichromenic acid (CBMA), the associated long term
        costs of pestilence control may be reduced dramatically--while
        simultaneously enriching the soil with valuable nutrients for
        commercial crops. As one skilled in the arts will
        appreciate--the long term application of the proposed invention
        will manifest itself in stages--much as any great culture
        ranging from ancient cheese and yogurt cultures to present day
        bio-engineered vectors, each application of the invention may,
        in the spirit of evolution, lead to a unique bio-transformation
        specifically adapted to its environment. The proposed invention
        brings to the table a base level of safer transmutation of
        certain toxic fungi (Llewellyn 1977), (Turner 1981), infectious
        microbes, (Van Klingeren 1976), (Schmitz 1973), and insect
        pests, (Quaghebeur, 1981) as well as infectious disease
        transmitted through insects such as West Nile Virus (McPartland,
        1993). The nature of this invention is energetically favorable,
        easily propagated, and low up-keep in cost making it also ideal
        for third-world implementation in the pursuit of cleaner, safer
        land. In cases of emergency the preferred embodiment might also
        serve as a possible source of the neuroprotectant delta-nine
        tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) through the application of heat such
        as sunlight or direct flame. In the event of a terrorist attack
        of neurotoxins, for instance, one might as a means of last
        resort set fire to the growth medium to convert THCA to
        THC--which upon inhaling provides neuroprotection (Hampson 1998)
        (Van der Stelt 2001) (Mechoulam 2001) (USPTO U.S. Pat. No.
        6,630,507). Whereas in prior arts Elsohy et al (USPTO U.S. Pat.
        No. 6,730,519) disclosed a method for reduced cost THC
        production they also rely on traditional abiotic, inorganic,
        energetically unfavorable means for THC extraction and
        purification of THC. Moreover their claims depend on natural
        growth of Cannabis Sativa, a process that may take up to fifteen
        weeks. Clearly this is not an acceptable waiting period in the
        case of a terrorist attack. In an alternate embodiment of the
        invention a serum of raw nutrients, as opposed to raw sewage,
        were used as the basic medium--in this case using modularized
        transgenic enzymatic techniques one skilled in the arts might
        produce several tons of THC in two to three days. </p>

        cells. The term includes any organism whose genome has been
        altered by in vitro manipulation of the early embryo or
        fertilized egg or by any transgenic technology to induce a
        specific gene knockout. </p>
      <p>[0019]The term "transgene" refers any piece of DNA which is
        inserted by artifice into a cell, and becomes part of the genome
        of the organism (i.e., either stably integrated or as a stable
        extrachromosomal element) which develops from that cell. Such a
        transgene may include a gene which is partly or entirely
        heterologous (i.e., foreign) to the transgenic organism, or may
        represent a gene homologous to an endogenous gene of the
        organism. Included within this definition is a transgene created
        by the providing of an RNA sequence that is transcribed into DNA
        and then incorporated into the genome. The transgenes of the
        invention include DNA sequences that encode the fluorescent or
        bioluminescent protein that may be expressed in a transgenic
        non-human animal, the genes required for the synthesis of
        cannabinoids, and any additional genetic information necessary
        for the greater control of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0020]The following terms are used to describe the sequence
        relationships between two or more polynucleotides: "reference
        sequence", "comparison window", "sequence identity", "percentage
        identical to a sequence", and "substantial identity". A
        "reference sequence" is a defined sequence used as a basis for a
        sequence comparison; a reference sequence may be a subset of a
        larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA
        or gene sequence, or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene
        sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 20
        nucleotides in length, frequently at least 25 nucleotides in
        length, and often at least 50 nucleotides in length. Since two
        polynucleotides may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a
        portion of the complete polynucleotide sequence) that is similar
        between the two polynucleotides, and (2) may further comprise a
        sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides,
        sequence comparisons between two (or more) polynucleotides are
        typically performed by comparing sequences of the two
        polynucleotides over a "comparison window" to identify and
        compare local regions of sequence similarity. A "comparison
        window", as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at
        least 20 contiguous nucleotide positions wherein a
        polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence
        of at least 20 contiguous nucleotides and wherein the portion of
        the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may
        comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or
        less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not
        comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the
        two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a
        comparison window may be conducted by the local homology
        algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482,
        by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch
        (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, by the search for similarity method
        of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.)
        85:2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms
        (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics
        Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575
        Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by inspection, and the best
        alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology
        over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is
        selected. The term "sequence identity" means that two
        polynucleotide sequences are identical (i.e., on a
        nucleotide-by-nucleotide basis) over the window of comparison.
        The term "percentage identical to a sequence" is calculated by
        comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of
        comparison, determining the number of positions at which the
        identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) occurs
        in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions,
        dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of
        positions in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size),
        and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of
        sequence identity. The terms "substantial identity" as used
        herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide sequence,
        wherein the polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at
        least 30 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 50 to 60
        percent sequence identity, more usually at least 60 percent
        sequence identity as compared to a reference sequence over a
        comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions,
        frequently over a window of at least 25-50 nucleotides, wherein
        the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing
        the reference sequence to the polynucleotide sequence which may
        include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of
        the reference sequence over the window of comparison. As applied
        to polypeptides, the term "substantial identity" means that two
        peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the
        programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at
        least 30 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 40
        percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 50 percent
        sequence identity, and most preferably at least 60 percent
        sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions which are not
        identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions.
        Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the
        interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For
        example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is
        glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of
        amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and
        threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side
        chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids
        having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
        tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is

      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION--OPERATION</b> </p>
      <p>[0022]As one skilled in the arts may appreciate the variety of
        vectors able to transform of the initial reagents (TSCSL, TOAP,
        TCAs, TTAs, TCBMs, TCBAs) into the desired reagents (THC, CBD,
        CBM) may result in hundreds or thousands of potential scenarios.
        Consider the heat that is generated in many compost conversion
        where temperatures may rise above 160 degrees Fahrenheit, in
        such cases it may be expedient to use an thermophilic vector,
        particularly for the incubation of the TSCSL, and TOAP. In the
        preferred embodiment of the invention it should be noted that
        the TTAs, TCBMs, TCBAs, are used in either a plant or animal
        vector--since cannabinoids exhibits both anti-microbial and
        anti-fungal activity it will require a non-microbial and
        non-fungal host. </p>
      <p>[0023]In its preferred embodiment begin with a gigantic pile of
        refuse, that may include fecal matter, untreated sewage water,
        and decaying animal parts. It may be to the advantage of the
        user to initiate the enzymatic activity in a more sterile
        environment with nutrients needed for the synthesis of
        precursors of cannabinoids to alleviate environmental pressures
        of the sludge. In such cases as necessary the resulting enzymes
        and precursor products may be added directly to the filthy
        sludge or set aside and used as the growth medium for the
        transgenic cannabinoid synthesis with the resulting cannabinoids
        added to the filth sludge after their synthesis is completed. </p>
      <p>[0024]Expose the pile of refuse to TSCSLs, TOAPs, and TCs
        teas--brewed as per the guideline in the literature commonly as
        anyone skilled in the arts will appreciate--and genetically
        modified to include promoters operably linked to bioluminescent
        proteins to help indicate and monitor effectiveness of the
        treatment. This tea is given from 24 hours to one month as
        indicated by bioluminescence (FIG. 1) to finish blending in with
        the refuse--or as long as the bioluminescence appears active.
        (FIG. 1. Step: Stilbene-like Synthase). These teas, when mixed
        with toxic bilge, enzymatically synthesize cannabinoids. </p>
      <p>[0025]Next a root bed made of TTAs, TCBAs, and or TCBMs. Note
        the versatility of this invention. Any one of the aforementioned
        synthases, or indeed all three may be placed atop the pile bilge
        to create the desired reagents (ie THC, CBA, CBM). Also
        noteworthy is the elegant closed-loop nature of this system. By
        initiating the reaction with microbes that are not themselves
        immune to the final product the system will eventually turn
        itself off--as the reagent levels rise to higher levels the
        TSCSLs, TOAPs, and TCs die. </p>
      <p><b>IN AN ALTERNATE EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0026]The bucket containing the OAP is loosened atop a pile of
        crud, that may consist of any decaying or decayed matter, and
        that must consist of some decaying vegetable matter or living
        vegetation. </p>
      <p>[0027]The bucket containing the CAS is loosened atop the pile
        of crud that previously received OAP treatment. </p>
      <p>[0028]A blanket of roots from tobacco made of TTAs, TCBAs and
        or TCBMs are thrown over the crapulence and festering therein
        may it yield bountifully wee little cannabinoids. </p>
      <p><b>Overview</b> </p>
      <p>[0029]This invention relates to the synthesis of cannabinoids
        for the purpose of general pestilence riddance in filthy organic
        and inorganic sludge. Through regulated enzymatic reactions,
        wherein cannabinoids with known anti-microbial, insecticidal,
        nematicidal, fungicidal properties and moreover nutritious, and
        neuroprotective, qualities are used to benefit regions where
        other commercial chemical reagents would require mechanized
        dispersion and cleanup. In plain English for those skilled in
        the arts--the genes involved in the enzymatic formulation of
        cannabinoids are inserted into foreign vectors thereby
        reproducing themselves and generating sufficient quantities of
        cannabinoids to clear the region of pestilence. </p>
      <p>[0030]The advantages of this system are numerous. Whereas
        cannabinoid synthesis may not easily take place in Cannabis
        sativa due to its illegality, this invention is highly
        preferable. Whereas cannabinoid synthesis using inorganic
        techniques is not advantageous due to the inefficiency of
        inorganic and organic laboratory chemistry, this invention is
        highly preferable. Whereas most chemical synthesis routes for
        the creation of cannabinoids relate to the creation of extremely
        pure cannabinoids, this invention merely creates sufficient
        quantities as needed to rid a region of pestilence, and makes no
        claims whatsoever as to purity. Whereas the cost of creating
        cannabinoids synthetically would require large sums of money, as
        well as recurring costs for reagents, as well as a high degree
        of expertise and lab equipment, the invention described herein
        requires a single up-front cost to create the necessary vectors,
        and thereafter the invention may be distributed and applied to
        sludge and filth across the world with almost no requirements
        insofar a priori knowledge. </p>
      <p>[0031]Using closed-loop modular enzymatic reactions, wherein
        each phase of catalysis may be halted by another counter
        reaction, and wherein each phase of catalysis may be easily
        monitored for effectiveness allows one skilled in the arts to
        more safely and effectively treat hazardous waste and the
        plethora of contagions therein. This invention refers to
        modular, in the sense that along the enzymatic pathway of choice
        each enzymatic building block is separated into a unique vector,
        uniquely identifiable by means bioluminescence and uniquely
        susceptible to a flavor of anti-microbial or anti-fungal such
        that the enzymatic process of choice may be halted at any given
        phase of production if desired. Modular may also or rather refer
        to the system as a whole, in that it should, handled by one
        skilled in the arts, leave little or no trace of enzymatically
        active reagent and be a closed-loop system--with the
        understanding that in nature there exists no such thing as an
        entirely closed-loop system, however, the preferred embodiment
        of this invention has in its design constructs a self-destruct
        or self-neutralizing mechanism for the living reagents. Thus in
        the preferred embodiment of the invention the catalysis of
        tetrahydrocannabinolic acid results in the recursive destruction
        of the initial vectors (Taura 2004). </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0032]Polyketide Synthesis converts 3 Malonyl CoA plus 1
        n-Hexanoyl-CoA to form OSCoA. This conversion may take place
        inside the muck and sludge, or may take place in a contained
        area and after the OSCoA </p>
      <p>[0033]Stilbene Carboxylate Synthase-Like (STCSL), in the case
        of Cannabis Sativa a Chalcone Synthase (CHS) that exhibits
        Stilbene Synthase (STS) activity in vivo and as per note in the
        literature (Raharjo 2004) there is reason to believe that the
        sequis used in the preferred embodiment of this invention and
        refers to any enzyme that generates 5-amylresorcinolic acid
        (olivetolic acid). While there are several enzymes capable of
        synthesizing olivetolic acid in the final analysis any enzyme
        capable of Olivetolic Acid synthesis will is sufficient. In the
        preferred embodiment the STCSL is inserted into the
        mitochondrial genome using the protofection technique (Khan
        2004). The STCSL should be operably linked to bioluminescent
        protein to facilitate the monitoring of activity. The vector of
        the STCSL should also, in the preferred embodiment, have an
        operably linked In an alternate embodiment of this invention
        olivetolic acid is synthesized through inorganic techniques and
        thus added to the filthy sludge as a trigger molecule. In this
        manner the invention would have a limiting reagent from the
        offset, restricting the final output of pestilence ridders in
        such cases wherein limitations might be preferable. In another
        alternate embodiment of the invention the STCSL is chimeric with
        GOAP, or a pestilence ridding molecule. </p>
      <p>[0034]Geranylpyrophosphate Olivetolic Acid Prenylase (GOAP)
        (Fellermeier 1998) is an integral part of this invention, and
        converts olivetolic acid into cannabigerolic acid. As one
        skilled in the art may appreciate any enzyme capable of yielding
        cannabigerolic acid is sufficient. In the preferred embodiment
        the GOAP is loaded into the vector in the manner described in
        Fellermeier's work. In the preferred embodiment of this
        invention the GOAP is operably linked to a bioluminescent
        protein such as GFP or aequorin, and thus its activation is more
        easily monitored with minimal technical expertise. The GOAP is
        also operably linked to a promoter capable of up-regulating GOAP
        and thereby amplifying GOAP production. </p>
      <p>[0035]Products made from these transgenic vectors should
        produce THCA, and, in addition, other precursor molecules as
        well as the necessary enzymes and proteins requisite for the
        aforementioned production, such as, tetrahydrocannibigerolic
        acid synthase, cannabigerolic acid synthase (CBGAS),
        cannabidiolic acid synthase (CBDAS), cannabichromenic acid
        synthase (CBRMAS), tetrahydrocannibinolic acid (THCA),
        olivetolic acid, polyketide synthase, and cannabigerolic acid
        synthase. Also disclosed is the unique and novel application of
        the TTAs in the function of a compost toilet additive and for
        the low-impact, sustainable, macrobiotic control of pests
        including Alabama argillacea (Riley 1885), Pieris brassicae
        (Beling 1932), Melolontha melolontha (Mateeva 1995), and
        Aphelenchoides composticola, (Grewal 1989). </p>
      <p><b>Operation</b> </p>
      <p>[0036]First the transgenically enhanced vectors (TEVs) as
        necessary and leading up to the cannabigerolic acid phase of
        biosynthesis (FIG. 1) are added into the growth medium and let
        to rest for anywhere from 12 hours to several days with a
        temperature range of 25-35 degrees centigrade, and also
        depending on the volume of waste, the thickness of the muck, and
        the general nature of the festering filth. If time is of the
        essence one may speed up growth times by dispersing units of
        TEVs around the afflicted region through artificial or assisted
        means. If precision in timing is desired it may be convenient to
        include a bioluminescent protein operably linked a functional
        promoter to the TEVs similar in methods to (USPTO U.S. Pat. No.
        6,544,729) and created such as to reflect the activity of the
        TEVs. </p>
      <p>[0037]Next the transgenic plant vector is placed atop the
        festering sludge. The transgenic plant vector releases
        cannabinoids into the sludge, and as it appropriates greater the
        product of transgenic E. Coli(s) so shall it release
        cannabinoids--all the while eradicating both the transgenic E.
        Coli vector as well as the numerous pathogens, microbes,
        insects, fungi etc . . . that are defenseless against the
        cannabinoids. </p>
