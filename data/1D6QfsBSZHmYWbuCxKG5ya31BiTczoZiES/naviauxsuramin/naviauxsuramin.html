      Suramin is a 100-year-old drug developed to treat African sleeping
      sickness and river blindness. Though it has been investigated for
      other diseases, including cancer, it is not approved for any
      therapeutic use in the United States.<br>
      <br>
      However, a small, randomized clinical trial conducted by Robert
      Naviaux, MD, PhD , professor of medicine, pediatrics and
      pathology, and colleagues at University of California San Diego
      School of Medicine have found that a single intravenous dose of
      suramin produced dramatic, but transient, improvement of core
      symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Currently, there are
      no drugs approved for treating the core symptoms of ASD.<br>
      <br>
      More broadly, the trial findings support the “cell danger response
      theory,” which posits that autism and other chronic conditions are
      fundamentally driven by metabolic dysfunction—and thus treatable.
      Naviaux and his co-authors propose larger, longer clinical trials
      to assess suramin (or similar drugs) as an ASD treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Special note from the researchers: Suramin is not approved for the
      treatment of autism. Like many intravenous drugs, when
      administered improperly by untrained personnel, at the wrong dose
      and schedule, without careful measurement of drug levels and
      monitoring for toxicity, suramin can cause harm. Careful clinical
      trials will be needed over several years at several sites to learn
      how to use low-dose suramin safely in autism, and to identify
      drug-drug interactions and rare side effects that cannot currently
      be predicted. We strongly caution against the unauthorized use of
      suramin.<br>

          (SAT-1) Trial</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Interview with Robert Naviaux, MD, PhD, professor of genetics
      in the departments of medicine, pediatrics and pathology<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What is the main point of your paper?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; The first thing you need to know about our paper is
      that it is not about suramin.&nbsp; Our research is aimed at
      finding a unifying cause for autism and an explanation for why it,
      and nearly 20 other chronic diseases, have been increasing over
      the past 30 years.&nbsp; Our research is leading us to the
      conclusion that autism is caused by a treatable metabolic syndrome
      in many children. The exact percentage is currently unknown.&nbsp;
      Metabolism is the language the brain, gut and immune system use to
      communicate. These three systems are linked. You can't change one
      without changing the other. Each of these systems works
      differently in autism, but more specifically, the communication
      between these systems is changed in autism.&nbsp; Such changes
      occur both during and after the pregnancy. Suramin can only
      improve metabolic functions once a child is treated. While
      antipurinergic therapy (APT) with suramin may not directly change
      some aspects of abnormal brain development that were present
      before treatment, APT may improve the function of many brain
      systems, even if brain structure does not change. And in children
      and teens whose brains are still developing, the course or
      trajectory of brain development might also be changed by
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The metabolic syndrome that underlies the dysfunction is caused by
      the abnormal persistence of the cell danger response or CDR.
      Aspects of the CDR are also known to scientists as the "integrated
      stress response." Both genes and environment contribute to the
      CDR, so even genetic causes of autism lower the threshold for CDR
      activation and produce the metabolic syndrome. Ultimately, if the
      symptoms of autism are caused by a metabolic syndrome, the hopeful
      message is that the symptoms can be treated, even though we can't
      change the genes.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:What can you say about the study for neuroscientists and
      families who have never heard of the cell danger response or
      purinergic signaling?<br>
      ANSWER: The main conclusions from the study do not require any
      background knowledge. Although the study was small and
      preliminary, the main conclusions were three: 1) For many
      children, the symptoms of autism are not fixed and can be improved
      dramatically with the right treatment; 2) A treatable metabolic
      syndrome contributes to the pathogenesis of core symptoms of
      autism and 3) A single treatment with low-dose suramin was safe
      and produced significant improvements in the core symptoms and
      metabolism associated with ASD.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What are the caveats?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; After summarizing the design and results of the
      study, we are left with the conclusion that either the results are
      wrong because of the small size of the study, or they are an
      important advance.&nbsp; We won't know which until the results can
      be replicated in larger studies.&nbsp; Even so, I am optimistic
      that we are on the right path.&nbsp; My hope is that other
      investigators will soon join in.&nbsp; Together we can all move
      faster to prove or disprove the CDR hypothesis and test the safety
      and efficacy of antipurinergic therapy in autism.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION.&nbsp; What exactly is the cell danger response (CDR)?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; The CDR is a natural and universal cellular response
      to any injury or stress.&nbsp; Its purpose is to help protect the
      cell and to jump-start the healing process.&nbsp; But sometimes
      the CDR gets stuck.&nbsp; This prevents completion of the natural
      healing cycle and can permanently alter the way the cell responds
      to the world.&nbsp; When this happens, cells behave as if they are
      still injured or in imminent danger, even though the original
      cause of the injury or threat has passed.&nbsp; On a molecular
      level, the defended set points for cellular homeostasis are
      altered. This creates a pathological metabolic memory—an abnormal
      cellular response—that leads to chronic disease. When this happens
      during early child development, it causes autism and many other
      chronic childhood disorders.&nbsp; When it happens later in life,
      a persistent CDR can lead to immune exhaustion and it can lower
      the resistance to chronic infections.&nbsp; When it swings in the
      other direction, the immune system takes on a hair trigger and it
      leads to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.&nbsp; In both
      cases, it increases the prevalence of chronic disease. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;QUESTION:&nbsp; How is purinergic signaling connected to the
      CDR?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; In a second discovery from the lab, we found that
      extracellular nucleotide signaling called "purinergic signaling"
      maintains the CDR. This led us to the possibility of a unified
      approach to the treatment of autism.&nbsp; Antipurinergic drugs
      can treat the abnormal metabolic syndrome that causes autism by
      sending a cellular "all's clear" or safety signal like the one
      that is announced when a fire is extinguished, telling you it is
      safe to return to school.&nbsp; Suramin is just the oldest
      antipurinergic drug available, and the only one that inhibits the
      particular purinergic receptors that cause autism.&nbsp; Many more
      antipurinergic drugs are in development.&nbsp; Suramin is just the
      first of a whole new class of medicines, like the first statin for
      high cholesterol or the first beta blocker for high blood
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; How does suramin work?<br>
      ANSWER: Pharmacologically, suramin has several actions.&nbsp; One
      of its best-studied actions is as an inhibitor of purinergic
      signaling.&nbsp; Inside the cell, nucleotides like ATP and UTP are
      energy carriers and important molecules in normal metabolism.
      Stressed cells release ATP and other molecules made by
      mitochondria into the extracellular space through channels in the
      cell membrane.&nbsp; Extracellular ATP (eATP) is an ancient danger
      signal.&nbsp; It is called a "damage associated molecular pattern"
      or DAMP.&nbsp; When too much eATP is released, it binds to
      purinergic receptors and activates the CDR.&nbsp; Suramin inhibits
      the binding of eATP and eADP to these receptors and sends the
      cellular equivalent of the "all's clear" or safety signal.&nbsp;
      In this capacity, suramin and other antipurinergic drugs are a
      kind of molecular armistice therapy, signaling the cellular war is
      over, the danger has passed and cells can return to "peacetime"
      jobs like normal neurodevelopment, growth, and healing.<br>
      <br>
      Clinically, suramin works by removing negative signals that block
      or slow natural child development.&nbsp; It is more like removing
      the brakes then pressing the accelerator.&nbsp; Accelerated
      catch-up development occurs in the first few weeks when the brakes
      are removed because the child is ready to develop, but was
      otherwise blocked by their illness. This reminds me of giving a
      child who has an inborn error of metabolism in a vitamin or
      nutrient that they can't make or taking away a toxin. The children
      begin to blossom.&nbsp; Children with severe oral motor dyspraxia
      in the SAT-1 study started humming and singing nonsense tunes
      around the house in the first few days after suramin.&nbsp; Like a
      baby learning to talk for the first time, they began making new
      sounds with their mouth, lips and tongue that they had never made
      before.&nbsp; We had four non-verbal children in the study, two
      6-year-olds and the two 14-year-olds.&nbsp; The 6- and the
      14-year-old who received suramin said the first sentences of their
      lives about one week after the single suramin infusion.&nbsp; This
      did not happen in any of the children given placebo.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; How many purinergic receptors are there?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; There are 19 different purinergic receptors.&nbsp;
      Geoff Burnstock (University College London) discovered purinergic
      signaling in 1972, and has been characterizing the nucleotide and
      nucleoside ligands, their receptors and their biology ever since.
      <br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What about the side effects of suramin?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; We did not find any serious side effects or safety
      concerns in this first study of a single, low-dose of
      suramin.&nbsp; The low dose that we used produced blood levels of
      5-15 µM and has never been tested for any disease in the nearly
      100 years that suramin has been used in medicine.&nbsp; All
      previous uses of suramin have been at medium doses for sleeping
      sickness that produced blood levels of 50-100 µM for one to three
      months or high doses for cancer chemotherapy that produced blood
      levels of 150-270 µM for three to six months. <br>
      <br>
      It is important to remember that our study was small and only five
      boys received suramin. We were unable to detect rare side effects
      that might affect fewer than twenty percent (1 in 5) patients.
      Suramin caused a self-limited, asymptomatic rash, but this
      disappeared without treatment in two to four days.&nbsp; Larger
      clinical trials will be needed to detect uncommon side
      effects.&nbsp; For example, a study in which at least 100 children
      received suramin would be necessary to detect a side effect that
      occurred in just one out of 100 (1 percent) of children.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What about the risk of infections?&nbsp; If
      suramin blocks the CDR, won't children have trouble clearing
      common infections or responding to toxin exposures?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; In theory, this could be a risk of suramin.&nbsp;
      However, we looked at this carefully in the trial.&nbsp; The
      infusions were done from October through February, so winter colds
      were a known risk.&nbsp; We found that two children in the placebo
      group got colds. Two children in the suramin group also had
      colds.&nbsp; The severity was the same in both groups.&nbsp; The
      duration of congestion and symptoms was seven to 10 days, and also
      about the same in both groups. We did not find an increased risk
      of infection in the SAT-1 study.&nbsp; However, in theory, any
      broad-spectrum antipurinergic drug might inhibit the CDR so this
      will be a potential risk to monitor in future studies.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What problems can you imagine that might derail
      future suramin trials in autism?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; If the improvements that occurred with suramin
      treatment stopped after a few months, even when effective blood
      levels were maintained, then the trials would fail.&nbsp; Also, if
      we encountered a safety issue that was unacceptable after a few
      months of treatment, then the trials might fail.<br>
      <br>
      Even if suramin itself is not the best antipurinergic drug for
      autism, our studies have helped blaze the trail for the
      development of new antipurinergic drugs that might be even
      better.&nbsp; Before our work, no one knew that purinergic
      signaling abnormalities were a part of autism.&nbsp; Now we do,
      and new drugs can be developed rationally and systematically.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; Will suramin need to be given for life?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; I don't think so, but we don't have the science to
      answer this question yet.&nbsp; More studies will be necessary to
      see if improved development can become self-sustaining without the
      need for regular suramin treatment.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; What about the effect that suramin might have on
      common therapies?<br>
      ANSWER: We found that during the time the children were on
      suramin, the benefit from all their usual therapies and enrichment
      programs increased dramatically.&nbsp; Once suramin removed the
      roadblocks to development, the benefit from speech therapy,
      occupational therapy, applied behavior analysis and even from
      playing games with other children during recess at school
      skyrocketed.&nbsp; Suramin was synergistic with their other
      therapies.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; Why was your study so small?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; This work is new and this type of clinical trial is
      expensive. We did not have enough funding to do a larger study.
      And even with the funding we were able to raise, we had to go
      $500,000 in debt to complete the SAT-1 trial.&nbsp; Fortunately,
      the goals of establishing basic safety, tolerability and activity
      of suramin in autism were accomplished with just 10 subjects.
      Based on these initial promising results, we will now attempt to
      find funding for a larger trial.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION: What is the rate-limiting factor to progress right now?
      Where are the bottlenecks?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; The rate-limiting factor is money. Lack of funding
      has slowed our research progress on the CDR and purinergic
      signaling in autism for the past nine years.&nbsp; We can't do the
      next studies without new funding.&nbsp; We have plans for five
      additional studies over the next five years to collect all the
      data the FDA will need to decide about the approval of suramin for
      autism.&nbsp; With adequate funding, culminating in a multicenter,
      phase III, registrational trial, these studies can be completed
      without further delay. Usually, the multimillion dollar cost of
      new drug development is covered by the Big Pharma that will
      benefit from FDA approval.&nbsp; Unfortunately, since suramin is
      100 years old, the usual patent laws don't apply and the next
      clinical trials will require grass roots support from families and
      foundations and other approaches to raise the needed funding.

      <br>
      QUESTION:&nbsp; Do you think that suramin could help the genetic
      causes of autism too?&nbsp; Why?<br>
      ANSWER:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Each of the genes that increase the risk
      of autism is connected to the cell danger response. For example,
      the Fragile X gene naturally prevents the translation of a large
      number of pro-inflammatory proteins.&nbsp; When the Fragile X gene
      is mutant, pro-inflammatory proteins like TNF-alpha and IL1-beta
      are made, which activates the CDR.&nbsp; The causal gene in
      Angelman syndrome is thought to be the ubiquitin protein ligase
      E3A (UBE3A).&nbsp; When this gene is not expressed, worn-out
      proteins in the cell are not removed properly.&nbsp; This triggers
      the unfolded protein response, which activates the CDR.&nbsp; The
      causal gene in Smith-Magenis syndrome is thought to be the
      retinoic acid activated gene 1 (RAI), which is needed for a normal
      antiviral response.&nbsp; Failure to express RAI prevents normal
      handling of infections and results in a persistently activated
      CDR.&nbsp; We don't think that suramin will treat the physical
      features and non-autism symptoms of these genetic disorders.&nbsp;
      However, we think that suramin will be effective in improving the
      core symptoms of autism in these genetic disorders, and produce
      improvements in language, social behavior, and decrease repetitive
      and restricted behaviors.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION: What about teens and adults with ASD who don't want to
      be treated but rather want to be accepted and appreciated for
      their unique talents, abilities, and differences?<br>
      ANSWER: ASD is a label we use to talk about a group of children
      and adults with a recognizable pattern of neurodevelopmental
      differences.&nbsp; In the extreme, some non-verbal children with
      ASD will grow up to be non-verbal adults who cannot speak for
      themselves and may not ever be able to care for their own daily
      needs or hold down jobs. <br>
      <br>
      In the other extreme, the special gifts of some children with ASD
      will lead them to become activists as teens and adults whose
      voices are highly sought out by local and national agencies to
      express the needs of others and to help guide progress. We had a
      gifted teen with ASD as part of the team on the SAT1 study.&nbsp;
      He is a graphic artist and helped us to design the storyboards
      that allowed each parent and their child to visually review and
      prepare for the steps of the study, with special attention to
      sensory issues that were important for children with ASD.<br>
      <br>
      I have no desire to create new treatments for anyone who does not
      need or want treatment.&nbsp; I do not want to eliminate any
      symptoms or special gifts that someone wants to keep. The right to
      self-determination and the right to health care choice are
      fundamental freedoms.&nbsp; However, unless research can continue
      with the goal of helping children and adults who want treatment,
      new treatments will not be discovered and the complementary
      freedom to choose a treatment when it is desired will be
      lost.&nbsp; We can respect both rights: the right to choose no
      treatment for some and the right to choose new treatments for
      others. Both are possible, and both must be actively chosen to
      protect freedoms for all.<br>
      <br>
      There is another point that needs to be made. In 2017, after more
      than 70 years of trying, there are no effective pharmacologic
      treatments for the core symptoms of autism because a unifying
      theory for the cause of autism does not exist. People's experience
      with ASD treatments-to-date have taught them that the treatment is
      often worse than the disorder. None of the treatments currently
      available actually get at the root problem in autism. If the root
      problem is ultimately proven to be the CDR and abnormalities in
      purinergic signaling, then the core symptoms like social fear,
      anxiety and difficulties with verbal communication might be
      improved without suppressing the gifts that make children and
      adults with ASD exceptional. This new generation of treatments has
      a chance to precisely target the symptoms that hold people back
      with ASD, while not touching the gifts that allow them to excel.<br>
      <br>
      QUESTION: Why is treating autism so important?<br>
      ANSWER: Autism spectrum disorder often affects children who have
      shown early gifts, and might otherwise grow up to become some of
      the best and brightest of their generation.&nbsp; Even if this is
      only true for a fraction of children, it means that some children
      now living with disabling forms of ASD, whose parents fear they
      might never be able to live independently, could have a chance for
      independence and live happy, self-reliant lives.&nbsp; And because
      many children with ASD are significantly impacted by their
      symptoms, these children, once freed from their most disabling
      symptoms, might be just the ones the world needs to solve the
      greatest problems facing our planet in the next century. <br>

      Suramin is a medication used to treat African sleeping sickness
      and river blindness.[1][2] It is the treatment of choice for
      sleeping sickness without central nervous system involvement.[3]
      It is given by injection into a vein.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Suramin causes a fair number of side effects.[4] Common side
      effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, skin
      tingling, and weakness.[2] Sore palms of the hands and soles of
      the feet, trouble seeing, fever, and abdominal pain may also
      occur.[2] Severe side effects may include low blood pressure,
      decreased level of consciousness, kidney problems, and low blood
      cell levels.[4] It is unclear if it is safe when breastfeeding.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Suramin was made at least as early as 1916.[5] It is on the World
      Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and
      most effective medicines needed in a health system.[6] In the
      United States it can be acquired from the Center for Disease
      Control (CDC).[3] The cost of the medication for a course of
      treatment is about US$27.[7] In regions of the world where the
      disease is common suramin is provided for free by the World Health
      Organization (WHO).[8]''<br>

      Our lab sees autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as an involuntary
      behavioral syndrome caused by a conserved cellular response to
      environmental and genetic&nbsp; danger.&nbsp; Autism is therefore
      an “ecogenetic” syndrome that alters child development.&nbsp; This
      perspective has led us to a unified theory for the cause and
      treatment of ASD that is called the cell danger theory1-7. It
      proposes that autism is a treatable metabolic syndrome caused by
      persistent activation of the cell danger response (CDR) produced
      by persistent abnormalities in purinergic signaling. &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      By treating the root cause of this syndrome, we believe many
      children will have chance to lose the symptoms that hold them
      back. Many children will be able to come off spectrum, and many
      children will be able to live independent lives as adults, when
      just a few years ago this notion seemed impossible...<br>

        <b>Naviaux RK, et al.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are caused by both
      genetic and environmental factors. Mitochondria act to connect
      genes and environment by regulating gene-encoded metabolic
      networks according to changes in the chemistry of the cell and its
      environment. Mitochondrial ATP and other metabolites are
      mitokines-signaling molecules made in mitochondria-that undergo
      regulated release from cells to communicate cellular health and
      danger to neighboring cells via purinergic signaling. The role of
      purinergic signaling has not yet been explored in autism spectrum
      disorders.<br>
      OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We used the maternal immune activation
      (MIA) mouse model of gestational poly(IC) exposure and treatment
      with the non-selective purinergic antagonist suramin to test the
      role of purinergic signaling in C57BL/6J mice.<br>
      RESULTS: We found that antipurinergic therapy (APT) corrected 16
      multisystem abnormalities that defined the ASD-like phenotype in
      this model. These included correction of the core social deficits
      and sensorimotor coordination abnormalities, prevention of
      cerebellar Purkinje cell loss, correction of the ultrastructural
      synaptic dysmorphology, and correction of the hypothermia,
      metabolic, mitochondrial, P2Y2 and P2X7 purinergic receptor
      expression, and ERK1/2 and CAMKII signal transduction
      abnormalities.<br>
      CONCLUSIONS: Hyperpurinergia is a fundamental and treatable
      feature of the multisystem abnormalities in the poly(IC) mouse
      model of autism spectrum disorders. Antipurinergic therapy
      provides a new tool for refining current concepts of pathogenesis
      in autism and related spectrum disorders, and represents a fresh
      path forward for new drug development.<br>

      </b>BACKGROUND: This study was designed to test a new approach to
      drug treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the Fragile
      X (Fmr1) knockout mouse model.<br>
      METHODS: We used behavioral analysis, mass spectrometry,
      metabolomics, electron microscopy, and western analysis to test
      the hypothesis that the disturbances in social behavior, novelty
      preference, metabolism, and synapse structure are treatable with
      antipurinergic therapy (APT).<br>
      RESULTS: Weekly treatment with the purinergic antagonist suramin
      (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally), started at 9 weeks of age, restored
      normal social behavior, and improved metabolism, and brain
      synaptosomal structure. Abnormalities in synaptosomal glutamate,
      endocannabinoid, purinergic, and IP3 receptor expression,
      complement C1q, TDP43, and amyloid β precursor protein (APP) were
      corrected. Comprehensive metabolomic analysis identified 20
      biochemical pathways associated with symptom improvements.
      Seventeen pathways were shared with human ASD, and 11 were shared
      with the maternal immune activation (MIA) model of ASD. These
      metabolic pathways were previously identified as functionally
      related mediators of the evolutionarily conserved cell danger
      response (CDR).<br>
      CONCLUSIONS: The data show that antipurinergic therapy improves
      the multisystem, ASD-like features of both the environmental MIA,
      and the genetic Fragile X models. These abnormalities appeared to
      be traceable to mitochondria and regulated by purinergic
      signaling.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) now affect 1-2% of the
      children born in the United States. Hundreds of genetic, metabolic
      and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of ASD.
      Similar factors are known to influence the risk of schizophrenia
      and bipolar disorder; however, a unifying mechanistic explanation
      has remained elusive. Here we used the maternal immune activation
      (MIA) mouse model of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric
      disorders to study the effects of a single dose of the
      antipurinergic drug suramin on the behavior and metabolism of
      adult animals. We found that disturbances in social behavior,
      novelty preference and metabolism are not permanent but are
      treatable with antipurinergic therapy (APT) in this model of ASD
      and schizophrenia. A single dose of suramin (20 mg kg(-1)
      intraperitoneally (i.p.)) given to 6-month-old adults restored
      normal social behavior, novelty preference and metabolism.
      Comprehensive metabolomic analysis identified purine metabolism as
      the key regulatory pathway. Correction of purine metabolism
      normalized 17 of 18 metabolic pathways that were disturbed in the
      MIA model. Two days after treatment, the suramin concentration in
      the plasma and brainstem was 7.64 μM pmol μl(-1) (±0.50) and
      5.15 pmol mg(-1) (±0.49), respectively. These data show good
      uptake of suramin into the central nervous system at the level of
      the brainstem. Most of the improvements associated with APT were
      lost after 5 weeks of drug washout, consistent with the 1-week
      plasma half-life of suramin in mice. Our results show that purine
      metabolism is a master regulator of behavior and metabolism in the
      MIA model, and that single-dose APT with suramin acutely reverses
      these abnormalities, even in adults.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Are the symptoms of autism caused by a treatable metabolic
      syndrome that traces to the abnormal persistence of a normal,
      alternative functional state of mitochondria? A small clinical
      trial published in 2017 suggests this is possible. Based on a new
      unifying theory of pathogenesis for autism called the cell danger
      response (CDR) hypothesis, this study of 10 boys, ages 5-14years,
      showed that all 5 boys who received antipurinergic therapy (APT)
      with a single intravenous dose of suramin experienced improvements
      in all the core symptoms of autism that lasted for 5-8weeks.
      Language, social interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive
      movements all improved. Two children who were non-verbal spoke
      their first sentences. None of these improvements were observed in
      the placebo group. Larger and longer studies are needed to confirm
      this promising discovery. This review introduces the concept of M2
      (anti-inflammatory) and M1 (pro-inflammatory) mitochondria that
      are polarized along a functional continuum according to cell
      stress. The pathophysiology of the CDR, the complementary
      functions of M1 and M2 mitochondria, relevant gene-environment
      interactions, and the metabolic underpinnings of behavior are
      discussed as foundation stones for understanding the improvements
      in ASD behaviors produced by antipurinergic therapy in this small
      clinical trial.<br>

      The invention comprises the salt of the symmetrical urea of
      m-aminobenzoyl-p-methyl-m - aminobenzoyl - 1 - aminonaphthalene-4
      : 6 : 8-trisulphonic acid (suramin) and 1 : 5-di - (41 -
      amidinophenoxy) pentane uncontaminated with either the acid or the
      base from which it may be formed or another salt of said base or
      said acid. It can be produced by reacting in aqueous medium a
      water-soluble salt of the suramin (e.g. the sodium salt) with a
      water-soluble salt, such as the isethionate or methane sulphonate,
      of the 1 : 5-di-(41-amidinophenoxy) pentane and isolating from the
      reaction medium the diamidine salt thus formed. An example
      illustrates this process.<br>
      <br>
      The diamidine salt of this invention is prepared by reaction
      together in an aqueous medium a water-soluble salt, for example,
      the sodium salt of the symmetrical urea of m-aminobenzoyl-pmethyl
      - m - aminobenzoyl - 1 - aminonaphthalene 4:6:8-trisulphonic acid,
      which urea is hereinafter referred to by its common name
      "suramin," and a water-soluble salt of
      1:5-di(4-amidinophenoxy)pentane, for example, the isethionate or
      methane sulphonate, and isolating from the reaction mixture the
      salt thus formed. The resulting salt is
      &lt;RTI&gt;enly&lt;/RTI&gt; sparingly soluble in
      &lt;RTI&gt;water,&lt;/RTI&gt; and is &lt;RTI&gt;conveniently
      isolated by crystallisation.<br>
      <br>
      The salt as thus; prepared has been&lt;/RTI&gt; proved to bel of
      &lt;RTI&gt;considerable&lt;/RTI&gt; &lt;RTI&gt;value&lt;/RTI&gt;
      as a therapeutic agent. More particularly, it has been shown to
      possess a marked prophylactic and curative effect in the treatment
      of trypanosome infections. Both 1:5-di(4-amidinophenoxy)-pentane
      and suramin are known to possess in the form of certain
      water-soluble salts, such as the isethionate and sodium salts
      respectively trypanocidal activity but comparative experiments
      have demonstrated the fact (which is all the more surprising in
      view of the low solubility of the suramin salt of the diamidine)
      that the new salt is unexpectedly and substantially superior to
      either. Thus, in parallel toxicity experiments in rats to
      determine the maximum non-lethal dose on sub-cutaneous
      administration, the following figures were obtained: <br>
      (a) 1:5-di(4-amidino-phenoxy-pentane 5 mg./100 g.<br>
      (b) suramin - - - - - - - 40 mg./100 g.<br>
      (c) the suramin salt of the diamidine &gt; 500 mg./100 g.<br>
      <br>
      The diamidine itself is known to possess a prophylactic action
      against rat trypanosomiasis and comparative tests of the diamidine
      and the new salt thereof were therefore conducted in this
      &lt;RTI&gt;connec&lt;/RTI&gt; tion. In these tests the drugs were
      administered sub-cutaneously and after definite intervals (1, 2,
      4, 8 and 12 weeks) the test animals were inoculated subcutaneously
      with the aforesaid strain of T. brucel and the blood examined
      every two or three days for a month. If in that period no evidence
      of infection was found protection was considered complete. Ubder
      these test conditions, it was found that the diamidine at maximum
      non-lethal dose (5 mg./100 g.) gave protection for 4 weeks while
      the new salt at less than one thirtieth of the maximum non-lethal
      dose (15 mg./100 g.) gave protection for at least 8 months.<br>
      <br>
      Further, such &lt;RTI&gt;tests&lt;/RTI&gt; in which all three
      &lt;RTI&gt;products were compared showed that the&lt;/RTI&gt;
      maximum doses requireld to give com&lt;RTI&gt;plete&lt;/RTI&gt;
      protection for a period of 4 &lt;RTI&gt;weeks&lt;/RTI&gt; were 5
      mg./100 g. in the case of the diamidine, 2 mg/100 g. in the case
      of suramin and 1.96 mg./100 g. of the new salt containing 0.7 mg.
      of the diamidine &lt;RTI&gt;and O.S mg. of surarain.&lt;/RTI&gt;<br>
      <br>
      The &lt;RTI&gt;production&lt;/RTI&gt; of the
      &lt;RTI&gt;new&lt;/RTI&gt; salt is illustrated in tbe following
      Example,<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE.<br>
      To a solution of suramin sodium (14.3 g.) in water (30 c.c.) is
      added a solution of 1:5 - di(4-amidinophenoxy)-pentane
      methane-sulphonate in water (300 c.c.) at 45 C. A white
      precipitate forms which is left to stand overnight and is then
      filtered off, washed with water (150 c.c.) and dried at 50 C.
      under 12 mm. of mercury. The suramin salt of
      1:5di(4-amidinophenoxy)-pentane (26 g.) is thus obtained which
      crystallises with 30 molecules of water.<br>
      <br>
      We are aware that Guimares and Lourie, British Journal of
      Pharmacology and Chemotherapy (1951) Vol. 6, pages 514 to 530,
      have referred to the fact that a precipitate is liable to form in
      mixtures of dilute solutions of suramin and
      1:5-di(4-amidinophenoxy)pentanealso known as pentamidine and give
      reasons for attributing to the formation of an inactive salt
      complex the inhibitory effect observed by them in respect of a
      previous injection of suramin (or the presence of suramin) on
      certain actions of pentamidine, viz, fall of blood pressure,
      broncho-constriction, contraction of gut, " curare-like " action
      on the rat phrenic nerve diaphragm preparation, paralysis in frogs
      and toxicity for mice.<br>

      This invention is for improvements in or relating to
      phenanthridinium salts and to processes for their production, and
      has for its object the provision of new and therapeutically useful
      substances.<br>
      <br>
      While many phenanthridine compounds, in the form of their
      quaternary salts, have heretofore been proposed for use as
      trypanocidal agents, only a few have been used to any substantial
      extent in the field. Not only degree of activity but also toxicity
      vary markedly with change in the number and nature of substituents
      and it is impossible at the present time to predict a priori the
      properties (if any) of any new phenanthridine compound.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of research and experimentation, the present
      Applicants have prepared new phenanthridinium salts which have a
      high activity against blood parasites, such as trypanosomes, are
      surprisingly less toxic than Inown phenanthridinium salts
      possessing useful trypanocidal activity and, in consequence,
      exhibit an exceptionally high chemotherapeutic index.<br>
      <br>
      The marked utility of the new compounds is manifested not only in
      the treatment of trypanosome infections but also in relation to
      babesiasis.,,<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      According to a further feature of the invention, those salts of
      formula I in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a m
      amidinophenyldiazoamino group, may be prepared by diazotizing or
      tetrazctizing a phenanthridinium salt of formula II wherein R is a
      hydrogen atom or an amino group and coupling the resultant
      diazonium or bisdiazonium salt with m-aminobenzamidine,<br>
      The invention is illustrated by the following Examples, in which
      the temperatures stated were measured in degrees Centigrade.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE I<br>
      A solution of m-aminobenzamidine monohydrochloride dihydrate (51.9
      g.) in water (225 ml.) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (56.5
      ml.) was cooled to 0 and diazotised with sodium nitrite (17.6 g.)
      in water (100 ml.) any excess nitrous acid remaining being
      decomposed by the addition of sulphamic acid. The diazonium
      solution was added to a solution of 2:7 - diamino - 10 -
      ethyl9-phenylphenanthridinium chloride (99.5 g.) in water (600
      ml.) at 00. To the stirred mixture, an ice-cold solution of sodium
      acetate (142.5 g.) in water (450 ml.) was added.<br>
      <br>
      Stirring was continued at 0 for 75 minutes and then a further
      quantity of sodium acetate (61.5 g.) together with sodium chloride
      (45 g.) dissolved in ice-cold water (450 ml.) was added. After 45
      minutes the product was precipitated as a purple tar by the
      addition of saturated brine (600 ml.). The supernatant liquors
      were decanted. The purple residue was dissolved in water (1 1.)
      and reprecipitated with brine (500 ml.). Paper electrophoresis of
      the precipitated tar (No.1 Whatman paper" Whatman" is a Registered
      Trade Mark) in 3N acetic acid showed the presence of two main
      components, the more mobile one giving a purple spot, the less
      mobile one giving a yellow spot. Subsequent purification steps
      were followed by paper electrophoresis; the purple isomer isolated
      was found to correspond to the purple spot and the red isomer to
      the yellow spot.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of traces of unchanged 2:7 diamino - 10 - ethyl - 9 -
      phenylphenanthrdinium chloride in the unpurified reaction product
      was indicated, on paper electrophoresis, by the presence of a
      characteristic orange spot. The foregoing precipitated tar was
      dissolved in boiling water (300 ml.) andthe solution rapidly
      cooled. The solid A which separated on standing in the
      refrigerator overnight was filtered off from the liquors R. On
      crystallisation of the solid A by dissolving it in boiling water
      and rapidly cooling the solution purple prisms, m.p. 258260
      (decomp.) were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      To the liquors B, obtained as described above, saturated sodium
      bromide solution was added. The solid precipitate (60 g.) was
      washed with acetone and extracted with cold methanol (5 x 100 ml.)
      to leave a red residue (24.3 g., 15.5%) which was shown by paper
      electrophoresis to be an almost pure product. Crystallisation of
      this product from methanol gave 7 - (m - amidinophenyl diazeamino)
      - 2 - amino - 10 - ethyl-9-phenyl- phenanthridinium bromide
      hydrobromide as red needles, m.p. 2400 (decomp.).<br>
      <br>
      This bromide hydrobromide salt (1 g.) in methanol (700 ml.) was
      converted to the corresponding chloride hydrochloride by ion
      exchange through a column of Axnberlite IRA 400 ("Arnberlite" is a
      Registered Trade Mark) chloride resin. 7 - (m - Amidino
      phenyldiazoamino) - 2 - amino - 10 - ethyl 9 -
      phenylphenanthridinium chloride hydro chloride was obtained as red
      needles, m.p. <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The invention comprises: (a)
      amidinophenyldiazoaminophenanthridinium salts of the general
      formula (wherein Am represents -C(:NH)NH2, R1 a C1-6 alkyl group,
      R2 an aryl group, R3 a C1-6 alkoxy group or a halogen atom and Y a
      pharmaceutically acceptable anion) and their acid addition salts
      (including insoluble salts, e.g. amsonates, embonates and suramin
      salts); (b) the preparation of compounds I, in admixture with
      isomeric azo dyestuffs (see Group IV(c)) from which they may or
      may not be separated, by diazotizing a compound of the general
      formula and coupling the resulting diazonium salt with an
      equimolecular proportion of a phenanthridinium salt of the general
      formula and (c) pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least
      one compound I, with or without the isomeric azo dyestuff, in
      association with a significant amount of a pharmaceutical carrier.
      Compounds I can also be prepared by diazotizing a compound III and
      coupling the resulting diazonium salt with a compound II. The
      pharmaceutical compositions, which are active against blood
      parasites, e.g. trypano somes, may be in forms suitable for
      parenteral or oral administration, e.g. solutions, suspensions,
      emulsions, tablets, pills, dispersible powders, granules, syrups,
      elixirs and capsules. 4 - Amino-3-bromobenzamidine
      monohydrochloride, 3-amino - 4 - chlorobenzamidine dihydrochloride
      and 3-amino-4-methoxybenzamidine dihydrochloride are prepared from
      the correspondingly substituted benzonitriles.
      3-Amino-4-chlorobenzonitrile is prepared by reducing
      4-chloro-3-nitrobenzonitrile.ALSO:Azo dyestuffs of the general
      formula (wherein R1 represents a C1-6 alkyl group, R2 represents
      an aryl group, Y represents an anion, one Z represents the group
      and the others hydrogen atoms, Am represents -C(:NH)NH2 and R3
      represents a C1-6 alkoxy group or a halogen atom) are obtained as
      by-products in the preparation of diazoamino compounds (see Group
      IV(b)) by diazotizing a compound of the general formula and
      coupling the resulting diazonium salt with an equimolecular
      proportion of a phenanthridinium salt of the general formula The
      two products may be separated by, for example, fractional
      crystallization from methanol.<br>
