      An initial report on the theory of Rhysmonic Cosmology was
      self-published as a short Monograph (Treatise) about May 1985.
      That Treatise was the result of about 10 years of sporadic effort
      (thoughts and experiments) inspired by some remarks made by Max
      Planck in his book, The Theory of Heat Radiation, which was
      published in 1969. The remarks were on a set of Natural Units
      which were basic and fundamental. How Max Planck came up with them
      I do not know, but I believed in an aetherical construction of Our
      Universe, so I decided to look into those units and a Rhysmonic
      Universe was born! You are referred to the Treatise for more
      details. After 45 years of very sporadic and low-cost effort, it
      is time to more fully explain what Rhysmonic Cosmology is really
      all about. At this writing, I am in my 94th year of life. It is
      time to update the basics of Rhysmonic Cosmology.<br>
      <br>
      First of all, Rhysmonic Theory is a so-called flux-field contact
      action type of theory (after Faraday), one version of the many
      versions which may be out there by many other researchers in the
      past. However, there may also be many differences. Here, I will
      relate to what Rhysmonics adds to the theory of the All in Our
      Universe. Rhysmonics maintains that only rhysmons and a void exist
      here. However, it is possible that our rhysmon may be a Universe
      in its own right in the sub-stratum of Our Universe, and that Our
      Universe may be just a rhysmon in a Super Stratum Universe. Are
      there existences ad infinitum?<br>
      <br>
      Such constructions may lend basis to that long-sought One Particle
      Universes. The presently known flux-fields are the gravitational,
      electrical, and magnetic types (see Figure B, Cosmology note: July
      2014 posted on Rex Research).The field differences appear to be in
      their generation and use, since they are basically the same flux
      fields (after Faraday). I tried to show that in the Treatise! The
      linear flux lines could be considered as a scalar-type, while the
      rotational component could be considered as a torsional-type.
      Since Rhysmonics considers our Universe to be a globular
      (spherical) ball of rhysmonic activities, it also may be
      considered to be isometric and isotropic in construction!! This
      results in some further conclusions in this Note.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Inertial Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A spherical Our Universe would explain many known inertial
      effects. Our Universe is the sole source of energy and mass. This
      source is tappable by simple direct means. The linear (and
      parallel) geometric flux lines ( to use Faraday’s term) are made
      up of short mass-energy vectors, joining head-to-tail, and may be
      considered to be a scalar-type of field. This is seen in Figure B
      from the July 2014 Cosmology note. These extended flux lines
      (vectors) are bi-directional and supported by the isometric and
      isotropic nature of Our Universe. Also, they are longitudinal
      forces and have a velocity, C, for any length, being reflected off
      the edge of Our Universe (making Euclid’s parallel line element
      valid) and Our Universe a perfect Black Body! These effects are
      natural in free space and do not involve the Earth’s g-fields!
      However, the effect is still present near the Earth’s surface
      where G-fields are dominant. I don’t need to explain the effects
      of inertia, since we all have experienced it in sudden
      accelerations or decelerations. Here, Our Universe sustains the
      added energies, possibly forever (?), unless the status quo is
      restored. The same is seen in torsional fields (rotational) such
      as fly wheels, etc., and are due to the isometric and isotropic
      nature of Our Universe.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Anti-Gravity Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two types of gravitational fields are available to us on Earth;
      the natural G-fields of Our Universe and the g-fields developed by
      the presence of Earth. The G-fields keep us pinned down to the
      Earth. However, the G-field becomes an up-field (skyward) 180 ?
      away through the Earth. While the up-component is smaller there at
      that location, the down component dominates, so you remain pinned
      to Earth. If you could somehow reduce the down-component but
      increase the up-component, we would have anti-gravity and reduce
      our weight or actually rise! I will not express anti-gravity as
      used in propulsion tests. I will leave that to others. It has been
      reported that high level sound waves were able to achieve
      anti-gravity effects on Earth. I have never looked into that, but
      apparently it was verified.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The material here was extracted from a draft of a much larger
      possible article. Here, it was shortened quite a bit because at 94
      years of age (and some adverse conditions), I do not want to spend
      time and energy to do so anymore. It’s time for younger
      researchers to carry the ball, so to speak.<br>
