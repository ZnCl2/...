      When I was in high school, I had a dream that one day I would
      invent a motor or a generator that would utilize the earth`s
      magnetic field in someway and that day has come to pass. I do not
      and never did claim that this device is a free energy device or if
      it ever produced excess energy. All I claimed is that my motor
      utilizes the earth`s magnetic field as its outer stator field.
      What value is it to science and the human race is yet to be seen.
      I think of my "earth motor" more as a teaching aid in
      understanding more about the earth`s magnetic field and its
      gravity, just like a voltmeter to an electrician. I do not want
      and did not try to mislead the viewers in thinking that this is a
      free energy device. This was noted in the article below written by
      the mechanical engineer in his own words. It took years of
      experimentation to come up with a working prototype. I believe
      that all things are possible as long as you never give up... so
      keep shooting for the stars, one day it will be your turn. I did
      it for the pure love of science and for the challenge of doing the
      impossible, not for the money. Please read the following article
      written by an engineer who saw a live demo of my earth motor. <br>
      <br>
      <b>A Stunning Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      Those lines of magnetic force that radiate from the north pole to
      the south pole are nothing new to most of us. We see their effect
      in everyday magnets and we know birds and fish use them to
      navigate all over the globe<br>
      <br>
      But it has taken a remarkable inventor to utilize those very lines
      of force to power an electric motor. He calls it his "earth
      motor".<br>
      <br>
      Lorrie Matchett who lives, works and sleeps in his Toronto
      workshop has brought the idea of harnessing these magnetic lines
      of force from the theoretical to a final fulfillment. One day in
      February I was flabbergasted to watch this earth motor slowly
      rotate as it was making history.<br>
      <br>
      The device stands 22 inches high with an arm that moves around
      like a windmill. That's the rotor as we say in engineering lingo.
      This rotor, developing a steady 58 rpm but at low power was easy
      to stop with my fingers.<br>
      <br>
      Just think what this all means - those magnetic lines of force
      being everywhere and they are free. Lorrie said to me that he does
      not claim that this earth motor is a free energy device of any
      kind. He only claims that he utilizes those magnetic lines of
      force as the motor`s outer stator field. He then went over the
      principle with me and we pored over his drawings and circuit
      diagrams. The floor was covered in wire and switching devices. I
      realized how privileged I was to been trusted with this
      information - unknown to anyone else but the inventor, Lorrie
      Matchett. I can understand those lucky individuals who first
      witnessed Marconi's work or the assistant to Alexander Graham Bell
      hearing Bell's voice across the Atlantic!<br>
      <br>
      Let's now address a few questions that surely are in everyone's
      mind.<br>
      <br>
      a. Is it genuine? If this is a fake, then all my years of
      engineering experience are for nothing. Yes, it's genuine.<br>
      <br>
      b. What use is it? Ah, there's the rub! What Lorrie Matchett has
      done is to open a window in electrical science. It's for others
      following through the years that will turn this feat of pure
      science into countless useful applications.<br>
      <br>
      c. How noisy it it? The prototype is utterly quiet.<br>
      <br>
      d. Why did Lorrie Matchett choose myself to witness his carefully
      guarded invention? That's an easy one. On the face of it I would
      appear to be the last person to whom he would show a secret such
      as this - aren't I an inventor also, don't I have a technical
      background and a university education? The answer lies in what I
      did some years ago. I had some surplus machinery and gave it to
      Lorrie at no cost. This must have created a trust in his mind.<br>
