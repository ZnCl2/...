      A mention of Walter Russell's study into Zero Point Energy&nbsp;
      driving all over the second law of thermodynamics :<br>
      <br>
      "Russell also developed and tested counter-wound sets of coils,
      each in the shape of overlapping cones. The device was based on
      the "power multiplication principle" discussed in the many books
      that he had written.<br>
      <br>
      According to a memo dated in 1961, the device worked: "because of
      the false concept of gravity which assumes it to be force of
      attraction which pulls inward from within instead of a cyclic
      force which controls the expansion of cold into heat, and the
      expansion of heat into cold...<br>
      <br>
      Nature's first principle of power production and the construction
      of matter is to produce heat from the cold of space. The heat thus
      generated radiates back into cold to complete the wave cycle which
      automatically repeats itself in this ageless universe of infinite
      continuity.<br>
      <br>
      On September 10, 1961, Walter and (his wife) Lao Russell reported
      to their contacts at NORAD, that the coils had worked and that the
      President of the United States could announce to the world that a
      "greater, safer power than atomic energy" could be provided for
      industry and transportation. The Russell's were convinced that
      they had found and demonstrated a new source of energy and a
      conversion process for what is now known as the zero point
      energy."<br>

      "A couple of years later, after we both spoke at a conference in
      Denver and on the plane back to Dallas, I told Peter (Kelly) about
      an interesting experiment done by Walter Russell and recounted in
      his excellent book 'Atomic Suicide'. <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Two coils were wound on cones.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The apices of these conical coils
        were pointed towards each other and power was applied so that
        bucking fields were created by the collision of opposite
        magnetic fields. Very fine iron filings were dropped into the
        gap between the coils and a levitating sphere was produced.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When the coils were slowly pulled
        apart, an oval followed by a sphere surrounded by a disk
        appeared.</span> When Peter arrived home, he tried this
      experiment and reported that when power was turned on, nearly
      eveyone in the building complained of feeling<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> nauseous or queasy</span>. He
      explained that an experiment was going on so that everyone would
      understand what was happening.<br>
      <br>
      After about an hour, the very clear and cloudless sky began to
      suddenly boil up and <span style="font-weight: bold;">a major
        thunderstorm ensued</span>. Power was removed from the coils and
      the storm dissipated as fast as it had arisen??? Weird stuff no
      doubt and subject to duplication by others if we all share our
      information...... Jerry"<br>

      "I have found only two sources that reference the modeling of EM
      fields in three spatial dimensions: the works of Walter Russell
      (1926, 1947, 1989), and material channeled by Hatonn et. al.
      (1991). The idea that energy exists in male and female vortices
      that form between this dimension and other dimensions is not new.
      The idea just hasn't been very useful, yet. Russell and Hatonn
      describe three dimensional elemental EM fields that can be
      classified as male and female by the spin of their 3-D EM fields,
      much the same way that we describe the poles of a bar magnet.
      Russell developed and tested counter-wound sets of coils, each in
      the shape of overlapping (male/female) cones. Such a coupling and
      cancellation of these fields would open up a whole new way of
      thinking about electricity and EM fields in general. Also, a new
      investigation of the physics of rotating permanent magnets and
      rotating EM fields would be very interesting. All reported
      research in these fields seems to stop in the early 1950s. I
      wonder why."<br>
      <br>
      "Recent research has been conducted by Toby Grotz, Tim Binder, and
      Ron Kovac (1992) in order to verify Walter Russell's theories and
      experiments. They write: "The experiments that Russell conducted
      in 1927, which were verified by Westinghouse laboratories, have
      been repeated. Russell at that time thought that he had found a
      novel way to <span style="font-weight: bold;">change the ratio of
        hydrogen to oxygen in a sealed quartz tube containing water
        vapor.</span> Russell's data indicated that, where there had
      only been water vapor consisting of hydrogen and oxygen in the
      tube, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the addition of inert
        gasses in the amount of 69% were detected. The use of magnetic
        fields was shown to produce this effect</span>. The end result
      of the experiment was to demonstrate a <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">cheap and efficient method of hydrogen production</span>
      for a hydrogen based fuel economy." Russell also developed and
      tested <span style="font-weight: bold;">counter-wound sets of
        coils, each in the shape of overlapping cones. The device was
        based on the "power multiplication principle"</span> discussed
      in the many books that he had written. According to a memo dated
      in 1961, the device worked: "because of the false concept of
      gravity which assumes it to be force of attraction which pulls
      inward from within instead of a cyclic force which controls the
      expansion of cold into heat, and the expansion of heat into
      cold... Nature's first principle of power production and the
      construction of matter is to produce heat from the cold of space.
      The heat thus generated radiates back into cold to complete the
      wave cycle which automatically repeats itself in this ageless
      universe of infinite continuity." (This is very similar to the
      theories of Victor Schauberger; Alexandersson, 1982). On September
      10, 1961, Walter and (his wife) Lao Russell reported to their
      contacts at NORAD, that the coils had worked and that the
      President of the United States could announce to the world that a
      "greater, safer power than atomic energy" could be provided for
      industry and transportation. The Russell's were convinced that
      they had found and demonstrated a new source of energy and a

        Energy and the government</span>", a Jeane Manning article
      translated from German into English using google-translate<br>
      <br>
      Russell also built equipment, which he called "<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Russell's Optical Direct Current
        Generator</span>" which, as stated, caught space/vacuum energy.
      Toby Grotz found original plans of this equipment, in a cellar in
      Colorado. The owner of the cellar was a colleague of a general
      within the NORAD.<br>
      <br>
      Russell collaborated with scientists from NORAD and from the
      company Raytheon.<br>
      <br>
      Grotz said that NORAD was interested in the generator - because in
      addition to <span style="font-weight: bold;">the device producing
        more energy than it required to run, one could also adapt its
        functioning to an extremely efficient new type of radar device</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Russell said "the universe consists of electricity, and nature
      multiplies energies, by concentrating this electricity (or space
      energy) - until she forms matter, like for example a star or a
      planet. Russell's equipment created this natural energy
      accumulation again.<br>

      magazine article by Toby Grotz, Tim Binder and Ron Kovac<br>

      The concept behind Russell Coils: The inner coils are wound from
      the ends toward the center in opposite directions. The outer coils
      are wound from the center toward ends in opposite directions.<br>
      <br>
      (in addition to transmutation) "Russell's work also involved the
      assembly of a device to produce energy from the background flux of
      fields"<br>
      <br>
      "Recent research has uncovered experiments that were conducted by
      Walter and Lao Russell in conjunction with Raytheon Corporation in
      Colorado Springs and General Chapman of NORAD.<br>
      <br>
      The blue prints were discovered to still exist in Colorado Springs
      and the "Russell Optical Dynamo Generator" was found last fall in
      a basement, intact after 30 years.<br>
      <br>
      Documents to be presented will show that Russell reported
      anomalous effects generated as a result of his circuit
      configuration and magnetic field interaction.<br>
      <br>
      "The energy of the vacuum has been analyzed and described by many
      researchers. Walter Russell reported to have found a means to
      harness this vacuum."<br>
      <br>
      The Device was based on the "power multiplication principle"
      discussed in many books Russell had written, many of which have
      been previously footnoted in this paper.<br>
      <br>
      From a memo dated March 16, 1961, the following description is
      given: "This new power and light generator employs a power
      multiplication principle of nature... which multiplies gases of
      minus zero melting points into solids of over 3000 degrees; or
      multiplies the cold of space into hot stars and novas of
      incredibly high temperatures. The reason it has never been known
      is because of the false concept of gravity which assumes it to be
      a force of attraction which pulls inward from within instead of a
      cyclic force which controls the expansion of cold into heat, and
      the expansion of heat into cold... Nature's first principle of
      power production and the construction of matter is to produce heat
      from the cold of space. The heat thus generated radiates back into
      cold to complete the wave cycle which automatically repeats itself
      in this ageless universe of infinite continuity.<br>
      <br>
      Every wave is a perfect dynamo, but the very purpose of waves is
      to generate heat in its armatures at wave amplitude points. That
      is the only way waves create matter".<br>
      <br>
      The prototype that was built consisted of two sets of dual coils.
      The coils were wound as shown in the diagram provided and included
      with this text. The idea behind the coils is to simulate the life
      cycle of the electric current as shown below. The photograph shows
      the actual models of the coils.<br>
      <br>
      On september 10, 1961, Walter and Lao Russell reported to their
      contacts at NORAD, that the coils had worked and that the
      President of the United States could announce to the world that a
      "greater, safer power than atomic energy" could be provided for
      industry and transportation.<br>
      <br>
      The Russells were convinced that they had found and demonstrated a
      new source of energy and a conversion process for what is now
      known as the zero point energy.<br>

      1. One Infinity manifests itself into complementary and

      <br>
      2. Yin and yang are manifested continuously from the eternal
      movement of one infinite universe.<br>
      <br>
      3. Yin represents centrifugality. Yang represents centripetality.

      <br>
      5. Yin repels yin. Yang repels yang.<br>
      <br>
      6. Yin and yang combined in varying proportions produce different
      phenomena. The attraction and repulsion among phenomena is
      proportional to the difference of yin and yang forces.<br>
      <br>
      7. All phenomena are ephemeral, constantly changing their
      constitution of yin and yang forces; yin changes into yang, yang
      changes into yin.<br>

      8. Nothing is solely yin or solely yang. Everything is composed of

      10. Large yin attracts small yin. Large yang attracts small yang.<br>
      <br>
      11. Extreme yin produces yang, and extreme yang produces yin.<br>
      <br>
      12. All physical manifestations are yang at the center, and yin at
      the surface."<br>

      <div align="center"> <b>RUSSELL OPTIC-DYNAMO GENERATOR</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; In the fall of 1959, General Chapman, Colonel Fry,
      Major Sargent, Major Cripe, and others from NORAD in Colorado
      Springs, attended a meeting at Swannanoa, Virginia (University of
      Science and Philosophy) at the invitation of Walter Russell. At
      this meeting Russell explained the workings of a device he
      proposed to build to take advantage of the vacuum state energy,
      and the two directional movement of energy from gravitation,
      (generation), to radiation, (degeneration). During the following
      year Russell, his wife, Lao, and their assistants built the
      device. The prototype that was built consisted of two sets of dual
      and magnetically-sexed coils. On September 10, 1961, Walter and
      Lao Russell reported to their contacts at NORAD, that the coils
      had worked and that the President of the United States could
      announce to the world that a "greater, safer power than atomic
      energy" could be provided for industry and transportation. After
      giving the device over to the U.S. Government, Dr. Russell
      refolded a year and a half later on May 19, 1963. The Russell
      Optic Dynamo-Generator was never released to the public.<br>
      <br>
      From: <b>http://www.philosophy.org/russell-optic-dynamo-generator.html</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; "We have proven the validity of our concept by making
      a simple small scale working model which is now supplying all the
      heat, light and power needed for our four story 52 room
      University. Our reactor generates much more power than needed for
      whatever purpose intended, so enough of that surplus is taken off
      from its generator to motivate the reactor in perpetuity.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear reactors need whole buildings for operation
      while ours occupies no more space than a furnace or oil heating
      plant to house its reactor, its steam-turbine and its generator.
      The nuclear reactor must be prevented from harming humans by
      building great concrete walls around it, while ours is perfectly
      harmless and occupies so little space that the one which operates
      at our headquarters occupies hardly more than six cubic feet, has
      no moving parts, and weighs not more than four hundred pounds,
      exclusive of its small steam turbine and generator.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; It is needless to say that such a simple, mobile,
      light and power producing machine would not only effect the whole
      world-economy, but would be the first step in bringing abundance
