        <p><b>Technology may help the poor, its developers say</b> </p>
        <p><b>December 26, 2004</b> <br>
          <b>Argonne National Laboratory and World Science staff</b> </p>
        <p><img src="grancrete.gif" height="363" width="485"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Researchers say they have found a way to build cheap, sturdy
        homes in one day by spraying a quick-drying ceramic onto flimsy
        frames. The technology could help the world's poor, of which the
        United Nations estimates there are 1.3 billion, they say. </p>
      <p>Scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, a U.S. government
        facility in Argonne, Illinois, and Casa Grande LLC, a
        Mechanicsville, Virginia-based company, developed the
        technology. They say they will make it available worldwide after
        testing whether the homes are earthquake and hurricane
        resistant. </p>
      <p>The ceramic is called Grancrete. The researchers say that when
        sprayed onto a crude frame made of Styrofoam, Grancrete dries to
        form a light, hard surface. This creates a dwelling much better
        than the flimsy structures in which many poor people live. </p>
      <p>Grancrete is based on an Argonne-developed material called
        Ceramicrete, developed in 1996 to encase nuclear waste,
        according to Argonne's Explorer Magazine. </p>
      <p>Ceramicrete thus prevents pollutants from leaking into the
        environment,&nbsp; the magazine reported. Grancrete also netted
        its developers an award from R&amp;D Magazine as one of the "100
        most technologically significant new products" of 2004. </p>
      <p>Casa Grande president Jim Paul told Explorer that his company
        became involved with the technology because initially, it was
        was looking for a concrete substitute for American industry. The
        need arose because concrete erodes in acidic conditions. "But as
        I traveled in Venezuela, I recognized the demand for cheap
        housing, and I thought about how to use our material for that",
        he told the magazine. </p>
      <p>Paul then collaborated with Argonne's Arun Wagh to create
        Grancrete. </p>
      <p>Grancrete is stronger than concrete, is fire resistant and
        withstands both tropical and below-freezing temperatures, the
        developers said; it keeps homes in arid regions cool, and those
        in frigid regions warm. </p>
      <p>To build a home, Grancrete is sprayed onto Styrofoam walls, to
        which it adheres and dries, according to the developers. The
        Styrofoam remains in place as an effective insulator, although
        Wagh suggests simpler walls, such as woven fiber mats, also
        would work well and further reduce the raw materials required. </p>
      <p>Using Grancrete in developing countries has additional
        advantages, says Wagh. "When you build houses in these poor
        villages, the materials you use should be indigenous, and the
        labor should be indigenous", he told the magazine. "Every
        village has soil and ash, and the labor and training
        requirements are so minimal that two local people can build a
        house in two days". </p>
      <p>Workers only need two days of training to learn how to operate
        the machinery, Paul told the publication. Casa Grande typically
        assembles a team of five people who can start in the morning and
        create a home that residents can move into that evening, he
        asserted. The material dries in minutes, he added, whereas
        concrete can take hours or days. </p>
      <p>Grancrete is made from an environmentally friendly mix of
        locally available chemicals, according to the developers. </p>
      <p>It consists of sand or sandy soil, ash, magnesium oxide and
        potassium phosphate, which is a biodegradable element in
        fertilizer. So even if Grancrete were to decompose, Wagh told
        the magazine, it would revitalize the soil. </p>
      <p>It costs about $6,000 U.S. dollars to build a Grancrete home,
        Paul told Explorer, several times cheaper than a conventionally
        built home. The homes are more than four simple walls, the
        developers added; for less than $10,000 U.S., laborers can
        produce Grancrete dwellings twice of 800 square feet, twice the
        size of a typical apartment in Bombay, India. </p>
      <p>Wagh said he aims to see Grancrete used throughout his native
        India and the world to produce housing for the poor. </p>
      <p>Born in the Indian state of Karnataka, Wagh grew up in a
        neighborhood where even to this day the homes have walls and
        ceilings made from knitted mats of palm leaves, and the floors
        are made of dried cow dung, according to Explorer magazine. </p>
      <p>"These homes are regularly subjected to hundreds of inches of
        monsoon rains and cyclone winds and therefore often have to be
        repaired or even entirely rebuilt", Wagh told the publication.
        "Obviously such conditions can have a great impact on the
        health, well-being, and longevity of the children and adults
        living there". </p>
      <p>The spray-on cement now offers hundreds of millions of people
        such as these the opportunity to have adequate housing and live
        longer, healthier lives, he told the publication. </p>
      <p>Argonne and Casa Grande have extensively tested Grancrete for
        structural properties, post-application behavior and production
        costs, the developers said. </p>
      <p>Their next step will be to test it for earthquake and hurricane
        resistance, after which they will make the product available
        worldwide. Wagh hopes the United Nations and other international
        organizations will subsidize mass-scale production around the
        world. </p>

    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      Arun Wagh spent a decade at the Argonne National Laboratory here
      working on a ceramic material that offered the toughness of
      concrete. He finally developed a substance called 'grancrete',
      which can be used to quickly build houses at minimal expense.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"I was asked to create a material that could safely
      encase nuclear waste so that the waste did not get into ground
      water," said Wagh. The substance Wagh developed combined magnesium
      oxide and potassium phosphate with water and ashes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>The promising new technology may lead to affordable
      housing for the world's poorest. Houses can be built by spraying
      grancrete on to a simple frame of Styrofoam and it hardens quickly
      and will not crack easily.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Experiments have proved that grancrete is stronger than
      concrete, is fire resistant and can withstand both tropical and
      sub-freezing temperatures, making it ideal for a broad range of
      geographic locations. It insulates so well that it keeps dwellings
      in arid regions cool and those in frigid regions warm.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Grancrete is 50 percent sand or sandy soil, 25 percent
      ash and 25 percent binding material," Wagh said.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Binding material is composed of magnesium oxide and
      potassium phosphate, the latter of which is a biodegradable
      element in fertilizer. So even if grancrete were to decompose, it
      would revitalize the soil," said the scientist.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"For every tonne of conventional concrete, you get a
      tonne of greenhouse gases. With one tonne of grancrete, you get
      one-tenth of the greenhouse gases."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>According to an estimate by Casa Grande, the company
      that is collaborating with Argonne in making grancrete, the cost
      of building a grancrete home is about $6,000.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Casa Grande made this estimate for building a house in
      Venezuela. In India, it would be much cheaper," said Wagh, whose
      goal is to see grancrete used throughout India, and the world, to
      produce housing for the poor.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact, a test house using grancrete is being built in
      India.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Wagh is familiar with the housing the poor live in. He
      grew up in a village in Karnataka where, even to this day, the
      homes have walls and ceilings made from knitted mats of palm
      leaves and the floors are made up of dried cow dung.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Grancrete is so versatile that Wagh even paints using
      it. "It becomes like a paste and you can add any colour to it...
      It is a little more difficult to use than oil paint.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Every day I come to the office, I get a call from
      people telling me it can be used for something else. You can do
      anything with it. The only thing you cannot do is eat it," Wagh
      said.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Argonne and Casa Grande have extensively field-tested
      grancrete for structural properties, post application behaviour
      and production costs. Their next step will be to test it for both
      earthquake and hurricane resistance, after which they will make
      the product available worldwide.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>According to Jim Paul, president of Casa Grande, workers
      need only two days of training to learn how to calibrate the
      machinery.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Casa Grande typically assembles a team of five people
      who can start in the morning and create a home that residents can
      move into that evening. Grancrete cures in 15 minutes, while
      conventional concrete can take hours, or even days, to dry.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Wagh completed his Masters in Mumbai and got a doctorate
      from the State University in New York. He returned to India,
      taught in Goa, and then spent 12 years in Jamaica.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>In Jamaica, Wagh changed tracks from physics to
      materials science. Returning to the US, he joined Argonne as a
      materials scientist.</blockquote>

        The United States Government has rights in this invention
        pursuant to Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38 between the U.S.
        Department of Energy and The University of Chicago representing
        Argonne National Laboratory. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> <br>
        <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to forming polymer modified chemically
        bonded phosphate ceramics. In particular, this invention
        addresses a need to form a room-temperature-setting ceramic
        based on the conventional Ceramicrete.RTM. and Ferroceramicrete
        technology that will bond polymeric surfaces such as Styrofoam.
      </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Haematite, having the chemical formula Fe.sub.2O.sub.3, is one
        of the most abundant minerals in nature. It exists as iron ore,
        in other minerals such as bauxite, and is also a component in
        clay minerals. It is the major component in laeritic soils (red
        soils found in the tropics). Similarly, manganese oxide, having
        a formula Mn.sub.2O.sub.3 is also a very common component in
        several laeritic soils and also exists as a mineral of manganese
        in the tropics. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,645,518 and 5,830,815 issued to Wagh et al. on
        Jul. 8, 1997 and Nov. 3, 1998, respectively, disclose processes
        for utilizing phosphate ceramics to encapsulate waste. U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,846,894 issued to Singh et al. on Dec. 8, 1998 discloses a
        method to produce phosphate bonded structural products from high
        volume benign wastes. None of these patents provides a method
        for utilizing the waste materials of iron and manganese. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,809 issued to Singh et al. Nov. 28, 2000
        and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/751,655 filed Dec. 29,
        2000, publication no. U.S. 2002/0123422 to Wagh et al. represent
        additional development of the use of chemically bonded phosphate
        ceramics to useful materials. Each of the aforementioned
        patents, that is U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,518 issued to Wagh et al.,
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,894 issued to Singh et al., U.S. Pat. No.
        5,830,815 issued to Wagh et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,809 issued
        to Singh et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,498 issued to Singh et al.
        and the above-identified publication no. U.S. 2002/0123422
        (patent application Ser. No. 09/751,655) is incorporated herein
        in their entireties. </p>
      <p>The phosphate ceramics disclosed in the various patents and
        publication hereinbefore mentioned illustrate a continuing
        effort to use the chemically bonded phosphate ceramics disclosed
        therein for a variety of purposes including the encapsulation of
        hazardous or radioactive waste as seen in the aforementioned
        publication, as well as the production of low cost structural
        materials. Accordingly, therefore, a need exists in the art for
        a low cost structural material which combines with synthetic
        organic resin based structures, for particular usage in the
        construction industry. Typically, in warm weather climates, low
        cost housing may be constructed using styrofoam as a base
        material onto which is sprayed a concrete-like material as a
        finish coating to seal the styrofoam base material against the
        elements and to provide a satisfactory looking structure.
        Heretofore, the phosphate ceramics disclosed in the
        above-captioned patents and publication were used as a finish
        coating in warm temperature climates but have not been
        satisfactory because the bond between styrofoam and the
        phosphate ceramics herein above disclosed is physical and
        peelable such that durable coatings have not been able to be
        provided with the extant material. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide a structural
        material and method for chemically bonding the phosphate
        ceramics hereinbefore disclosed to foam material and
        particularly to polystyrene foam. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method
        to coat styrofoam structures with a material which cures or sets
        at room temperature and is easy to apply in the field. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an
        aqueous based material which may be applied to a styrofoam or
        other synthetic organic resin in the field at low cost and with
        high efficiency. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a method for
        preparing and chemically bonding a phosphate ceramic to a

      <p>The invention consists of certain novel features and a
        combination of parts hereinafter fully described, illustrated in
        the accompanying drawings, and particularly pointed out in the
        appended claims, it being understood that various changes in the
        details may be made without departing from the spirit, or
        sacrificing any of the advantages of the present invention. </p>

        of poly (acrylic acid) sodium salt; </p>

      <p>Although the invention has been described particularly with
        respect to polyacrylic acid sodium salt, as hereinbefore stated,
        other acrylates and the salts thereof are also applicable to the
        present invention and the invention is not limited to the
        disclosed materials of polyacrylic acid salt,
        polymethylmethacrylate, polyacryl amide and polyacrylnitryl.
        However, while the above description is particularly suited to
        providing a material which chemically bonds with polystyrene
        foam by the incorporation of styrene into the aqueous slurry,
        other systems may be used with the present invention wherein the
        ceramicrete or ferroceramicrete is combined with water soluble
        powders and a stabilizing or cross-linking polymer in an aqueous
        solution in order to chemically bond the resultant material to
        the synthetic organic resin structure. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The process and product disclosed herein provides an
        inexpensive construction material, particularly adapted for use
        in warm weather climates where styrofoam or other synthetic
        organic resin foams are used as construction materials and
        require a coating of a hard, dense material for a surface
        finish. There are a large variety of materials which may be used
        to form the slurry which is thereafter chemically adhered to the
        synthetic organic resin foam base or surface. One such material
        is haematite which may be used in combination with sand, fly
        ash, and a variety of other materials hereinbefore described,
        combined with a reducing agent and magnesium oxide or other
        metal oxides with phosphoric acid or monopotassium phosphate and
        acrylate to form the ceramic phosphate formulations hereinbefore
        described. The reducing agents to be used in ferroceramicrete
        may be a variety of materials including elemental metals, tin
        chloride, ferric sulfate or other typical low costs moities. </p>
      <p>An aqueous slurry of the ceramic has a compressive strength
        similar to that of Portland cement, approximately 4000 psi.
        However, the slurry frequently sets very rapidly and can be
        retarded in the rapidity with which it sets, as set forth in the
        previously incorporated '498 patent. In general, as previously
        stated, the ceramicrete and ferroceramicrete disclosed in the
        above-mentioned applications can be used in solid particulate
        form at the construction site and either premixed with solid
        styrofoam and acrylate prior to arrival at the construction site
        or mixed at the construction site. As previously disclosed, the
        phosphate ceramic of the invention may be made from a source of
        phosphate and one or more of an oxide, hydroxide or carbonate of
        one or more of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ca, Zr or mixtures thereof. </p>
      <p>The inventors have discovered that by adding an acrylate such
        as polyacrylic acid sodium salt, or any other suitable salt,
        polymethylmethacrylate or polyacryl amide or other suitable
        acrylates such as polyacrylnitrile or others in combination with
        polystyrene to form an aqueous slurry of the Ceramicrete.RTM. or
        Ferroceramicrete binder with the acrylate and styrofoam, the
        resultant material when applied to a styrofoam base forms not
        merely a physical bond as previously occurred in the art, but a
        chemical bond which is firmly adhered to the styrofoam base
        thereby providing a inexpensive and easy mechanism by which at
        styrofoam based forms on site. Ceramicrete.RTM. and
        Ferroceramicrete are trademarks of Argonne National Laboratory
        but are used herein to denote the phosphate ceramics made by the
        processes disclosed in the above-incorporated patents and
        publication. </p>
      <p>By way of note, the '809 patent teaches a surface coating
        material used to reduce the leaching of soluble salts from
        ceramicrete waste forms. However, the resin there disclosed
        cannot be mixed with the Ceramicrete.RTM. aqueous slurry because
        the resins are not water based. Moreover, the materials there
        disclosed are not suitable for use with polystyrene foam because
        it collapses the foam structure. The materials used in the '809
        patent are styrene solvent and benzoyl peroxide, both of these
        components being toxic and not useful in the construction
        industry. </p>
      <p>The present invention fulfills a significant requirement in the
        construction industry in warm climates in that the present
        invention provides polymers which with Ceramicrete.RTM. (will
        bond chemically to a polystyrene foam surface. The invention
        consists of water soluble materials that can be applied in an
        aqueous Ceramicrete.RTM. slurry and do not adversely affect the
        setting properties of the Ceramicrete.RTM. slurry. Moreover,
        when set, the added polymers do not significantly alter the
        mechanical and physical properties of the Ceramicrete.RTM. or
        Ferroceramicrete material, and more particularly, the polymers
        do not introduce porosity in the Ceramicrete.RTM. or
        Ferroceramicrete material and do not render the set material
        water soluble. </p>
      <p>As previously stated, there are a number of polymers which are
        water soluble and compatible with the aqueous slurry of
        Ceramicrete.RTM. or Ferroceramicrete particles. These water
        soluble polymers include the acrylates such as polyacrylic acid
        (AA) salt, preferably the sodium salt, polymethylmethacrylate
        (PMMA), polyacryl amide and others such as polyacrylnitryl. The
        acrylate salts when dissolved in water produce carboxylate
        anions COO.sup.- by releasing sodium ions into the solution. The
        dissolution may be written as COONa--.fwdarw.COO.sup.-+Na.sup.+.
        The dissolution is illustrated in FIG. 1. In addition to
        dissolution of AA in aqueous solution of Ceramicrete slurry,
        dissolution of MgO in the acidic Ceramicrete slurry forms
        Mg(aq).sup.++. The two ions will react to produce COOMg.sup.+
        complexes. The complex may be of the type COO.sup.---Mg --OOC,
        in which case, one Mg cation will satisfy two carboxylate ion.
        In another mechanism, only one carboxylate ion may be bonded to
        Mg cation and the cation in turn bonds to one of the anions from
        the Ceramicrete matrix. The first possibility stabilizes AA
        partially (FIG. 3) and the second possibility will provide a
        bonding between Ceramicrete matrix and the polymer (FIG. 2).
        These reactions may be written as follows: </p>
      <p>Dissolution of MgO: MgO+2H.sup.+=Mg(aq).sup.+++H.sub.2O </p>
      <p>Complete complexation of AA and Mg:
        COO--+Mg:COO.sup.-+Mg(aq).sup.+++.sup.- -OOC.dbd.COO--Mg--OOC
        Partial complexation of AA and
        Mg::--COO--+Mg(aq).sup.++.dbd.--COO--Mg.sup.+ </p>
      <p>AA by itself, however, needs to be polymerized to form a stable
        component in the matrix. To form a copolymer, styrene
        (C.sub.6H.sub.5CH.dbd.CH.sub.- 2) is added to the composition.
        Styrene will bond to AA as shown in FIG. 3. This reaction forms
        a stable polymer within the Ceramicrete.RTM. matrix. </p>
      <p>The bonding between the Ceramicrete composite matrix and
        Styrofoam is facilitated by the reaction of styrene and AA in
        the same manner as above again as shown in FIG. 3. A similar
        complexation also occurs if an amide is used instead of styrene
        and also with use of PMMA, or other suitable acrylate. </p>
      <p>Table 1 lists various attempts to bind Ceramicrete.RTM. and
        styrofoam. In each case, Ceramicrete.RTM. slurry was made in a
        conventional way, with 7 9 wt. % MgO, 18 et,. %
        KH.sub.2PO.sub.4, 50 wt. % sand and the rest Class F fly ash. To
        this as added 12 wt. % water. The slurry was mixed for 25
        minutes. Each batch was approximately 500 Grams. AA and styrene
        beads were added at different times as shown in Table 1. The
        slurry was then poured over a surface of dense styrofoam and was
        allowed to set. Typical thickness of the Ceramicrete.RTM. layer
        was 0.5 cm. The following criteria were used to test if the
        product was acceptable as a structural material to be sprayed on
        styrofoam walls. 1. The slurry should warm up in 25 minutes 2.
        It should set into a hard ceramic within another hour, 3. The
        bond between Styrofoam and Ceramicrete composite should be
        chemical. </p>
      <p>The last criterion was tested by inserting a spatula between
        the Ceramicrete.RTM. and styrofoam and lifting it up to open the
        interface. If the whole cast of Ceramicrete.RTM. separated from
        the Styrofoam, then it was considered to be only a physical
        bond. If on the other hand, the Ceramicrete.RTM. cast or
        styrofoam broke at the tip of the spatula and the rest of the
        material retained good adhesion, then it was considered to be a
        good chemical bond. </p>
      <p>As seen in Table 1, the bonding was chemical only when styrene
        or excess MgO were used along with AA. In the first case, it
        shows that Ceramicrete.RTM. itself with styrofoam sheet. In the
        second case, adding of only AA did not achieve the desired
        result. In fact, it adversely affected the setting of
        Ceramicrete.RTM.. In the third case, Ceramicrete.RTM. reacted
        with AA and excess MgO to provide a chemical bond. Although 10%
        excess MgO is reported in Table 1, excess MgO may be present in
        the range of from 1 to about 20% by weight, more preferably 1 1
        to about 10% by weight, and most preferably about 10% by weight.
        In the last two cases, however, styrene reacted with AA and
        provided the necessary chemical bonding between styrofoam and
        Ceramicrete.RTM., and also stabilized AA within
        Ceramicrete.RTM.. </p>

      <p>As may be seen therefore, there has been disclosed a structural
        material and a method of making same in which the aqueous slurry
        of particles of a solid phosphate ceramic composite and a
        polyacrylic acid or acrylate or combinations or salts thereof
        are combined with either polystyrene or excess MgO to form a
        reaction product which chemically bonds to a polystyrene base.
        More particularly, the solid phosphate ceramic composites may
        include the reaction product of a source of phosphate such as
        phosphoric acid or monopotassium phosphate and an acrylate.
        Further, the ceramic component may be one or more of a metal
        oxide or hydroxide. The structural material disclosed herein may
        include the oxide wherein the oxide or hydroxide is one or more
        of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ca, Zr or various mixtures or
        combinations thereof. As before stated in the incorporated
        patents, the solid phosphate ceramic generally includes alkali
        metal ions and more particularly and preferably alkali metal
        potassium ions. Various polyacrylates may be used including
        polyacrylic acid or polymethymethacrylate or the sodium salt of
        polyacrylic acid. Additionally, polyacrylamide may also be
        employed. </p>
      <p>In general, the acrylic acid or acrylate or combinations of
        salts thereof may be present in the aqueous solution in the
        range of from about 3% by weight to about 8% by weight. More
        preferably, in the range of from about 4% by weight to about 6%
        by weight. More preferably, the polyacrylic acid or polyacrylate
        or combinations of salts thereof is present in the aqueous
        slurry at a concentration of about 5% by weight. The polystyrene
        which may be used to form the chemical bond in combination with
        the other materials hereinbefore set forth may be generally
        present in the aqueous solution in the range of from about 1% by
        weight to about 10% by weight. </p>
      <p>The structural material disclosed in the above specification is
        particularly useful, as hereinbefore stated, in combination with
        polystyrene base materials in warm climate construction. As
        before stated, the slurry of particles of solid phosphate
        ceramic component along with a suitable acrylate or salt thereof
        in combination with either or both of styrene and excess
        magnesium oxide will provide the chemical bond required to
        obtain the benefits of the present invention. When excess MgO
        over and above the stoichiometric amount are needed in the
        slurry is used, it may be present in a range of from about 1% to
        about 20% by weight, more preferably in the range of from about
        1% to about 10% by weight and most preferably about 10% by
        weight. The method of chemically bonding a structural material
        to a polystyrene base has been disclosed in which an aqueous
        solution of particulate solid phosphate ceramic composite
        particles and either polystyrene particles or an excess of MgO
        or both and a polyacrylate or a polyacrylic acid or salt thereof
        has been used to form a aqueous reaction product which when
        applied to polystyrene base reacts to form a dried reaction
        product chemically bound to the polystyrene base, all as
        hereinbefore disclosed. </p>
      <p>While particular embodiments of the present invention have been
        shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the
        relevant art that changes and modifications may be made without
        departing from the invention in its broader aspects. Therefore,
        the aim in the appended claims is to cover all such changes and
        modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the
        invention. The matter set forth in the foregoing description and
        accompanying drawings is offered by way of illustration only and
        not as a limitation. The actual scope of the invention is
        intended to be defined in the following claims when viewed in
        their proper perspective based on the prior art.</p>

        pursuant to Contract No. W-31-109-ENG-38 between the U.S.

        Argonne National Laboratory. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to a method for forming compactible
        ceramics and for forming ceramics with improved compression,
        flexural and fracture strength, and more specifically, this
        invention relates to a method for using a phosphate binder with
        enhanced binding characteristics in high waste loading scenarios
        which is compactible in the paste stage and which can be used
        with fibers to improve the ceramics' strength. </p>
      <p><b>2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The effective sequestration and disposition of waste oils,
        bulky waste forms and other unwieldy objects continues to elude
        disposal researchers. Typical concretes and ceramics, the later
        of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,846,894, 5,830,815,
        5,645,518, and 6,204,214, and incorporated herein by reference,
        have high compression strengths. However, these materials
        exhibit comparatively poor flexural and fracture properties.
        This leads to crack propagation, particularly when attempting to
        macroencapsulate large-size objects. Compactibility of these
        materials also is lacking. </p>
      <p>To macroencapsulate large-size objects, better fracture
        toughness is needed to avoid crack propagation. For cementing
        lateral junctures in multilateral oil well completions, improved
        flexural strength is needed. To arrest surface crack
        propagation, fiber reinforcement is needed. </p>
      <p>The use of glass fiber as a strengthening additive in cement
        causes problems. Cement is very alkaline and glass fibers
        deteriorate in such alkaline environments. This leads to
        weakening of the composite structure. Some common solutions are
        to over-engineer the composite to compensate for the eventual
        degradation and loss of strength, to use alkali resistant glass
        fibers, and to use coatings such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
        over the glass fiber to protect it from the alkaline
        environment. All of these solutions lead to higher costs. </p>
      <p>Ceramic systems leading to highly ductile waste forms remain
        elusive. For example, in the ceramic formation reaction
        disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,815, and given by Equation 1,
        infra. </p>
      <p>MgO+H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 +2H.sub.2
        O.fwdarw.MgHPO.sub.4.multidot.3H.sub.2 O Eq. 1 </p>
      <p>102.44 Kilojoules per mole of heat are released. This high
        amount of heat results in too rapid ceramic product formation
        (leading to brittleness) for any practical use. Also, some
        materials for disposal prove too soluble in the very low pH
        environs in which the phosphate ceramics disclosed in the '815
        patent operate. Alternatively, solids of low solubility
        (pK.sub.s.about.15 to 25) are not soluble enough in the
        solutions utilized in the '815 patent. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,894 issued to Singh et al. on Dec. 8, 1998
        discloses a method to produce phosphate bonded structural
        products from high volume benign wastes. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,678,234 issued to Colombo, et al. on Oct. 14,
        1997 discloses an encapsulation method utilizing a modified
        sulfur cement at elevated temperatures, and glass or other
        fibers for enhancement of the compressive and tensile strength.
      </p>
      <p>None of the aforementioned patents teaches a method for the
        reduction of volume during stabilization of solid powdered
        wastes. In addition, none of these patents provides a method for
        the stabilization of near insoluble oxides. </p>
      <p>None of the aforementioned patents teaches a method for
        enhancing the flexural and fracture toughness of the structural
        products via a truly homogeneous ceramic-fiber composite. </p>
      <p>None of the aforementioned patents even contemplates using a
        dispersant for fiber additives for strength enhancement. </p>
      <p>A need exists in the art for a method to produce superior
        compactible structural products with enhanced flexural and
        fracture toughness. The method should result in a ceramic which
        can be compressed while it is still putty-like, i.e., before it
        sets completely. The method also should result in the formation
        of a durable and chemically stable ceramic which can be utilized
        to sequester hard-to-contain wastes. Finally, the method should
        utilize inexpensive and commonly available reactants at ambient
        temperatures to produce low cost ceramics. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide a method for
        producing chemically bonded phosphate ceramics (CBPCs) that
        overcomes many of the disadvantages of the prior art. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a ceramic
        capable of encapsulating very low solubility metal oxides. A
        feature of the invention is that the oxides do not need to be
        calcined prior to encapsulation. An advantage is that an
        encapsulation process utilizing a ceramic uses much less energy
        and, accordingly, is less expensive. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention to provide a
        method for producing ceramics which have enhanced flexural and
        fracture toughness. A feature of the invention is that fibers
        being evenly dispersed throughout the ceramic binder enhances
        the flexural and fracture toughness of the binder. An advantage
        of this feature is that it minimizes leakage of encapsulated
        hazardous wastes. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method for producing ceramics which can encapsulate wastes that
        contain nonpolar, or oil-based fluids. A feature of this
        invention is that a magnesium dihydrogen phosphate (MHP)-based
        binder can effectively encapsulate wastes having trace amounts
        of oil. An advantage of this feature is that, at present, there
        is not any effective means for encapsulating petroleum
        fluid-tainted wastes. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method
        for producing glass fiber-reinforced ceramics. A feature of the
        invention is that phosphate-based ceramics are homogeneously
        mixed with the fibers to produce a ceramic structure containing
        fibers dispersed throughout the structure. An advantage of the
        method is that it provides an acidic- to neutral-pH environ
        favorable to the glass fibers. Therefore, corrosion of the glass
        fibers is minimized, and structural integrity of the resulting
        structures is maximized for periods of time heretofore not
        attainable. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method for the effective dispersal of fiber additives in a
        ceramic binder. A feature of the invention is that monopotassium
        phosphate is utilized as a dispersant to prevent aggregation of
        fibers into strands and bunches. An advantage of this feature is
        that the flexural strength of the resulting structure is
        typically twice that of cements. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method which produces compactible ceramics. A feature of the
        invention is the use of magnesium dihydrogen phosphate as a
        binder. An advantage of the method is that it allows for
        compression of the ceramic to a volume 40% less than the
        starting volume of the reaction slurry. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the invention provides a room temperature process for
        producing a compactible ceramic from powders, the process
        comprising combining MgO and magnesium dihydrogen phosphate
        dihydrate to create a dry homogeneous mixture; and contacting
        the mixture with water to form a slurry. </p>
      <p>Also provided is a process for strengthening phosphate
        ceramics, the process comprising adding fibers to the initial
        ceramic mixture to create a homogeneous composite substrate. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>A process is provided to facilitate macro-encapsulation of
        bulk-waste, oil waste, and similar unwieldy types of waste forms
        using ceramic materials and fiber-enforced ceramic materials.
        The same compactible phosphate binder may be used in "neat"
        formulations to make ceramics. </p>
      <p>The inventors also have developed a ceramic-based waste binder
        for utilization with compaction technologies. Use of the binder
        in a compaction mode also accommodates very high waste loadings.
        The binder has enhanced binding characteristics which allow
        treatment of more difficult wastes such as those containing
        oils. </p>
      <p>The invented method and binder enable the production of
        structural products such as conventional bricks and blocks and
        at lower costs than typical processes and materials. </p>
      <p>The inventors have determined that phosphate-based ceramics,
        such as magnesium dihydrogen phosphate (MHP), homogeneously
        mixed with reinforcing fibers form compactible, high strength
        waste sequestration matrices. The phosphate ceramics utilized in
        the reinforcing fiber-encapsulation method include, but are not
        limited to magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate, magnesium
        ammonium phosphate, magnesium sodium phosphate, magnesium
        phosphate, aluminum phosphate, iron phosphate, zinc phosphate,
        and phosphates of all rare earths such as, but not limited to,
        phosphates of lanthanum, cerium, yttrium, and neodymium. </p>
      <p>The resulting ceramics have wide-ranging utility, including the
        ability to encapsulate metal wastes that require a more durable
        ceramic which will withstand the shock of impacts and will not
        crack over time. Such metal wastes include hazardous materials
        (e.g. chromium and arsenic), and fission products such as
        technetium wastes and low-level radioactive materials. Low-level
        radioactive materials suitable for encapsulation in the instant
        ceramic include pyrophoric uranium chips that are stored in
        mineral oils. It is these oil-tainted materials cannot be easily
        encapsulated using state-of-the-art technology. </p>
      <p>The general process for formulating the ceramic starting
        material comprises mixing MgO, and magnesium dihydrogen
        phosphate dihydrate (MHP) to produce a dry mixture; and then
        combining the mixture with water at room temperature to produce
        Newberyite, MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O. That reaction is illustrated
        in Equation 2, infra. </p>
      <p>MgO+Mg(H.sub.2 PO.sub.4).sub.2.multidot.2H.sub.2 O+3H.sub.2
        O.fwdarw.2MgHPO.sub.4.multidot.3H.sub.2 O Eq. 2 </p>
      <p>MHP can be produced by reacting MgO and phosphoric acid
        according to Equation 3: </p>
      <p>MgO+H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 +H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.Mg(H.sub.2
        PO.sub.4).sub.2.2H.sub.2 O Eq. 3 </p>
      <p>Both reactions given by Eqs. 2 and 3 are exothermic and produce
        56.5 and 108.07 Kilojoules of energy per mole, respectively. As
        such, the addition of heat is not necessary to produce the
        binder or resulting composite. </p>
      <p>The magnesium oxide, MgO (calcined), and MHP are present in a
        molar ratio of MgO to MHP which varies from 3:7 to 1:1. An
        equimolar mixture of MgO and MHP is the preferred mode used in
        all MHP binder work mentioned herein. The MgO/MHP mixture to
        water weight ratio varies from 10:1.85 (stoichiometric
        composition) to 10:3.7. The inventors found that MgO should be
        calcined as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,204,214, issued to
        Singh, et al. on Mar. 20, 2001 incorporated herein by reference,
        as the preferred mode for the instant invention. </p>
      <p>Crystalline MHP is made by mixing 16 wt. % of MgO, 77 wt. % of
        H.sub.3 PO.sub.4, and 7 wt. % H.sub.2 O. Those weight
        percentages reflect the stoichiometry of the reaction. Only the
        MgO can be added in excess. The H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 is dissolved in
        water with subsequent slow addition of the MgO. The MgO must be
        added slowly as the reaction is very exothermic and to maintain
        a temperature increase of approximately 5-10.degree. C. from the
        ambient temperature. </p>
      <p>The mixture described supra, without the addition of any other
        materials (i.e., "neat MHP), provides a compactible and durable
        ceramic. The fiber enhanced ceramic made with the MHP process is
        also compactible. </p>
      <p><b>Waste Detail</b> </p>
      <p>For optimal utility, the MHP binder mixture is loaded with any
        one of a myriad of waste powders derived from high volume
        wastes. These wastes include, but are not limited to, the group
        consisting of any inorganic oxides and metals, such as hazardous
        and radioactive wastes, low solubility metal oxides, ceramic
        powders, ashes, red mud, sand, swarfs, lateritic soils, mineral
        wastes, and the same with traces of oils or greases, or
        combinations thereof. The waste powder loading into the ceramic
        mixture comprises up to 85 wt. % of the final ceramic. </p>
      <p>The hazardous and radioactive waste is material selected from
        the group consisting of high level radioactive wastes, low-level
        radioactive wastes, low-level radioactive and hazardous waste
        called "mixed waste," heavy metals, fission products, uranium
        and any other radioactive and pyrophoric metals stored in
        mineral oil, or combinations thereof. Aside from products
        tainted with mineral oil, other oils or greases also can be
        accommodated by the instant binder, including petroleum-based or
        vegetable-based nonpolar compounds, and any other hydrocarbons.
      </p>
      <p>The low solubility metal oxides (pK.sub.sp in the range of
        .about.15 to 25) as waste encapsulation candidates include, but
        are not limited to, oxides of cobalt, copper, dysprosium,
        erbium, europium, holmium, neodymium, palladium, samarium,
        tellurium, ytterbium, yttrium, and zinc. </p>
      <p>The inventors found that the MHP formulations can be compacted
        or compressed to a smaller volume as much as 40% of the original
        volume. The slurry is compacted at temperatures between 0 and
        30.degree. C. Compression process temperatures above 30.degree.
        C. cause the formulation to lose water by evaporation and the
        ceramic loses strength. Compaction methods employed can include,
        but are not limited to, uniaxial presses, harmonic presses,
        adobe presses, and cold or hot isostatic presses. The ceramic
        mixture also facilitates dye casting. </p>
      <p>Monopotassium phosphate can be used as the sole initial
        phosphate reactant to produce a ceramic mixture. Alternatively,
        monopotassium phosphate can be added to any initial phosphate
        binder-waste mixture up to 20 wt. % of the initial mixture as a
        dispersant. </p>
      <p><b>Fiber Detail</b> </p>
      <p>The phosphate-based ceramic systems utilized herein have acidic
        to neutral environments. Those pH ranges are favorable for glass
        fibers which deteriorate in environments of high alkalinity
        (i.e., high pH), as noted supra. As such, the inventors have
        found that the alkaline degradation problem of glass fiber in
        concrete systems, is resolved when cement is supplanted by
        ceramic material, and particularly low-pH ceramic formation
        systems. </p>
      <p>Glass has a very low solubility in moderately acidic and
        neutral environments. The invented ceramic paste, of the type
        derived from equation 3, has an initial pH of 4.3, and when
        setting is complete, it has a pH of 8. This is much lower than
        the pH of cement, which is typically 12 to 13. </p>
      <p>Fibers are added to the initial binder mixture to reinforce
        phosphate-based ceramics and arrest cracks and crack
        propagation. The addition of fibers increases the flexural
        strength up to 2000 psi and the fracture toughness up to 0.8
        Megapascal.multidot. meter (Mpa.multidot.m.sup.1/2). The
        compressive strength of the product is up to five times that of
        conventional bricks and blocks for which the compressive
        strength is 2000 psi. </p>
      <p>To effectively enhance the strength characteristics of the <b><i>ceramicrete,</i></b>
        the fibers are dispersed evenly throughout the ceramic binder to
        create a composite mixture that is homogenous throughout. The
        inventors found that monopotassium phosphate is a good
        dispersant of cut fibers. This is advantageous in that fibers
        can be added as bunches and strands, or any combination thereof,
        but they disperse throughout the binder to be encapsulated as
        individual fibers by MKP. Monopotassium phosphate can be added
        to any initial phosphate binder-waste mixture as a dispersant up
        to 10 wt. % of the initial mixture of any phosphate binder. </p>
      <p>Fibers are comprised of materials selected from the group
        consisting of ceramics, glass fibers, organic polymers, carbon,
        metal fibers, and natural substances. Fibers come from natural
        substances selected from the group consisting of coconut, corn,
        bagasse, jute, sisal, wood, and any cellulosic material.
        Polymers are organic compounds selected from the group
        consisting of nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl
        chloride (PVC). </p>
      <p>The fibers can be added to the ceramic mixture as weaved mat,
        short cut fibers, long cut fibers, oriented strands, or simply
        as cut fibers that are not oriented in any way, or any
        combination thereof, and are added as 1 to 10 wt. % of the
        substrate. To obtain fiber loadings above 2 wt. %, fiber to the
        extent of 2 wt. % must first be added to the binder mixture with
        subsequent stirring to allow the binder mixture to dissolve,
        then addition of fiber up to the desired higher wt. % when the
        mixing slurry becomes thin due to dissolution of the phosphate
        binder. </p>
      <p>The fiber-reinforced ceramic paste can be cast, molded, and
        used to dip-coat, paint, or spray surfaces, and to cement
        lateral junctures in oil and gas wells. </p>
      <p>Addition of fibers increases the viscosity of the setting
        slurry making it difficult to pour the slurry into suitable
        molds. It is easier to dye cast the forms, but dye casting needs
        a modified <b><i>Ceramicrete</i></b> binder. MHP serves this
        need very well. </p>
      <p><b>Process Detail</b> </p>
      <p>A salient feature of the invented process is the ability to
        produce sequestration matrices, up to 80 weight percent of which
        is comprised of waste, and without the addition of heat. </p>
      <p>In one instance, as much as 73 wt. % powder with 18 wt. %
        MgO/MHP binder (equimolar amounts of MgO and MHP) and 9 wt. %
        water is utilized to form a slurry of putty-like consistency.
        The resultant paste can then be pressed at a pressure of
        .about.1000 pounds per square inch (psi) to form a dense
        monolith. Initial setting takes place within ten minutes.
        Alternatively, more water can be added to make a thinner paste
        or slurry and pour this slurry into a mold. Within an hour, the
        slurry sets into a hard ceramic. </p>
      <p>Boric acid can be added to retard the reaction and reduce the
        reaction rate. This provides more time to transfer the mixture
        into the mold and apply pressure for the purpose of compacting
        the slurry. The iron examples infra are present to serve as
        illustrations. Other metals can be encapsulated by the invention
        disclosed herein. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p><b>Pelletizing Steel Industry Waste or Swarfs</b> </p>
      <p>Swarfs are machining wastes containing iron in them. These
        wastes also contain oils and as such, conventional cements
        cannot be used to solidify them. The presence of metal also
        makes swarfs unsuitable for encapsulation/incorporation into
        ceramics generated from a phosphoric acid solution, as disclosed
        in U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,815, because reaction of metal with
        phosphoric acid generates large amounts of heat and boils the
        slurry. </p>
      <p>In storage, swarfs oxidize and form magnetite and haematite.
        While they are pyrophoric wastes and hence are a liability, they
        are ideal raw materials for forming iron phosphate ceramics.
        This is because the wastes contain a significant amount of
        elemental iron that has not rusted, and they also contain
        different iron oxide forms that include haematite and magnetite.
        To recover metal values from these wastes, it is necessary that
        they be pelletized. </p>
      <p>Swarf waste powder was pelletized by encapsulation pursuant to
        the procedure given supra in the "Process Detail" with a swarf
        waste loading of 73 wt. % in the final dry mixture, the
        remaining 23 wt. % being the dry mixture described on p. 6.
        During mixing and pressing, the mixture did not generate heat.
        Each sample formed was a briquette of dimensions
        2".times.2".times.1", and was placed under pressure for 2
        minutes at a pressure of 1000 psi, thus reducing its volume 40%.
        Each briquette was stored in a polyethylene bag for 3 weeks for
        complete curing. Within a day all samples appeared hard and were
        unscratchable, but continued to release water in the bag
        indicating a continued reaction. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows an X-ray diffraction pattern of a typical swarf
        before encapsulation in ceramic. The diffraction pattern shows
        that the swarf contains iron (Fe), carbonized iron (Fe.sub.3 C)
        and haematite (Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3) as its main constituents. FIG.
        3 shows a typical X-ray diffraction pattern of the encapsulated
        swarf. Apart from the unreacted haematite ("#"), unreacted iron
        (".star-solid."), and unreacted carbonized iron ("+"), FIG. 3
        discloses the presence of additional compound, magnetite
        (Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4), designated as @. Magnetite may form via the
        reactions according to equations 4 and 5: </p>
      <p>Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3 +Fe+2e.sup.-.fwdarw.3FeO Eq. 4 </p>
      <p>FeO+Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3.fwdarw.Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4 Eq. 5 </p>
      <p>Some of the FeO that forms via the reaction given in Equation 4
        may react with MHP to form FeHPO.sub.4 according to Equation 6.
      </p>
      <p>FeO+Mg(H.sub.2 PO.sub.4).sub.2.multidot.2H.sub.2
        O.fwdarw.MgHPO.sub.4.multidot.3H.sub.2 O+FeHPO.sub.4 Eq. 6 </p>
      <p>The water that was added to dissolve the MHP binder does not
        participate in the reaction, but is released in the polyethylene
        bag. Thus at the end, 80 wt. % swarf and 20 wt. % binder all
        reacted to form a hydrophosphate compound. </p>
      <p>The briquettes' properties are given in TABLE 1. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TABLE 1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties of solidified swarf samples.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Property&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measured values<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Density (g/cm.sup.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.16<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Porosity (vol. %)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressive strength (psi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2345 .+-. 345</pre>
      <p><br>
        Given the fact that the iron content was high in the original
        swarf material, the density of the briquette is relatively low.
        The lower than anticipated density is most likely due to the
        formation of hydrated iron compounds that generally have lower
        densities. The open porosity of 10% is lower than found in
        solidified concrete and hence lower water absorption. </p>
      <p>The compressive strength of the iron-encapsulating ceramic is
        very similar to that of conventional bricks (.about.2000 psi).
        The samples are hard enough to withstand being dropped from a
        height of 12 feet onto a hard floor. The data in TABLE 1 clearly
        shows that the swarf pellets can withstand rough transportation
        and rough handling. The pellets are also light weight and
        therefore can easily be picked up by an electromagnet for
        feeding into blast furnaces, without being broken into pieces. </p>
      <p>These observations show that the MHP binder can be very
        suitable in recycling metal wastes and for stabilizing uranium
        chips, which have been stored in mineral oils. </p>
      <p>The binder metal wastes and radioactive materials are easily
        incorporated into monolithic waste forms for long-term storage.
      </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p><b>Compacting Ashes</b> </p>
      <p>A number of different ashes were used which included high
        chloride content fly ash, bottom ash and low chloride content
        Class F fly ash. These ashes were radioactively contaminated
        chloride-containing ashes from various U.S. Department of Energy
        (DOE) sites. In each case, a small amount of water was added to
        moisten the mixture. Briquettes of dimensions
        2".times.2".times.1" were made using these ashes along with the
        MHP binder. As with the swarf, each sample formed was a
        briquette of dimensions 2".times.2".times.1", and was placed
        under pressure for 2 minutes at a pressure of 1000 psi, thus
        reducing its volume. Each briquette was stored in a polyethylene
        bag for 3 weeks. The samples were cured for one full week and
        were then cut into 1".times.1".times.1" cubes for which
        compression strengths were measured. The results of the strength
        measurements are given in TABLE 2 which also contains results

      <p><br>
        As noted in the last three rows of the table, high waste
        loadings can be attained with ash of low Cl content. The
        compressive strengths values are 4056 psi, 2059 psi, and 600 psi
        for low Cl waste loadings of 80%, 85%, and 90%, respectively.
        The minimum strength requirement for land disposal of hazardous
        and radioactive waste is 500 psi. </p>
      <p>As a result of compressing the MHP binder briquettes, their
        volumes decreased by as much as .about.40%. The MKP binder
        briquettes do not undergo any volume reduction whatsoever when
        compressed. For waste treatment, this compaction reduces
        disposal costs by 40% which is a distinct advantage over waste
        encapsulation processes utilizing MKP, and is estimated to be
        the lowest cost process for treating high volume radioactive
        waste. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p><b>Yttrium Oxide Containing Waste Forms</b> </p>
      <p>Yttrium oxide was thoroughly mixed with pre-mixed MHP dry
        mixture in a weight ration of 1:2. Water was then added to the
        powder mixture at a weight ratio of powder to water of 3:1. The
        resultant slurry, viscosity of 200 cp, was mixed for 15 minutes
        until it warmed slightly to .about.40.degree. C. due to the
        exothermicity of the process, and subsequently set into a hard
        ceramic within 10 minutes. As such, the slurry provides an
        exothermic reaction, which aids in the setting reaction. </p>
      <p>The ceramic formed in this Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 protocol has a
        density of 1.78 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) and its open
        porosity is .about.5% giving the same density-porosity
        characteristics of MKP binder with various encapsulated wastes.
        However, because Y.sub.2 O.sub.3 is less than sparsely soluble,
        the invented MHP process is the best means to form a ceramic of
        this oxide and other rare earth oxides with similar
        solubilities. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows a X-ray diffraction pattern of the yttrium
        phosphate ceramic. In addition to Newberyite ("*"), Y.sub.2
        O.sub.3 ("o"), and yttrium phosphate trihydrate,
        YPO.sub.4.multidot.3H.sub.2 O (".circle-solid.") are present. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p><b>Magnetite-Containing Ceramic Waste Forms</b> </p>
      <p>Magnetite based ceramics have been made in the past by the
        direct reaction of magnetite and aqueous phosphoric acid
        solution. The reaction is rapid and very exothermic which
        creates difficulties when attempting to form large monoliths.
        This problem may be overcome by using MHP as the binder. </p>
      <p>Magnetite and MHP powder were mixed thoroughly in a weight
        ratio of 1:2 of magnetite to MHP. Water was added in a weight
        ratio of 1:3 of water to mixture. The resultant slurry,
        viscosity of 200 cp, was mixed for .about.15 minutes until the
        mixture's temperature began to increase. The slurry was then
        poured into molds after which it set within an hour and formed a
        dense and hard ceramic. The ceramic has a density of 1.71 g/cc
        and an open porosity of 4.6%. This particular magnetite ceramic
        is a lightweight material. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the ceramic
        formed. Peaks are directly observed only for Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4
        ("x") and MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O ("T") are seen to be present.
        Although no peaks of iron phosphate are visible, the large humps
        indicate a significant amount of a glassy phase. The magnetite
        ceramic sample also looked very glassy and scanning electron
        microscopy showed large portions of featureless or glassy
        material. Thus, the iron phosphate formed an amorphous or glassy
        solid structure. The solid is free of open porosity with almost
        zero water absorption. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
      <p><b>Strength Enhancement by Fiber Addition</b> </p>
      <p>As taught supra, reinforcing substrates such as fibers may be
        directly incorporated into the phosphate powders. In this
        example, the binder powder mixtures comprised magnesium
        potassium phosphate hexahydrate, and Class F fly ash. Two
        different chopped glass fiber lengths were used, 0.25 inch and
        0.5 inch. Fibers were added into the powder blend in a
        proportion of 1 to 3 wt. % of the total mixture. Water was added
        and as the powder dissolved, more fibers could be added, if
        desired or needed to obtain a particular wt. %. A dye-casting
        process can be used to form composites with a greater amount of
        fiber, up to 10 wt. %. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 5(a-b) shows the compressive strength as a function of
        fiber content in composites of 40 and 60 wt. % Class F fly ash
        with two different fiber lengths. As shown in FIG. 5a, with a
        waste loading of 40 wt. % ash and loading with 0.25 inch chopped
        glass fiber, the compressive strength increased, from a value of
        6500 psi for MHP binder ceramic without fibers, to 10,800 psi
        when fiber was added to the extent of 1 and 2 wt. % of the total
        composite. With a fiber loading of 3 wt. %, the compressive
        strength decreased to 9,400 psi. The results for 0.5 inch
        chopped glass fiber were somewhat lower than those for 0.25 inch
        fiber and dropped to 9800 psi at 3 wt. % fiber. </p>
      <p>In the case of 60 wt. % ash, the compressive strength profiles
        are exactly the opposite of those for 40 wt. % ash, as shown in
        FIG. 5b. The compressive strength without fiber is 10,600 psi.
        With 1 wt % of 0.25 inch fiber, the compressive strength is
        12,000 psi; then inversely, the compressive strength of the
        composite with 0.5 inch fibers consistently decreases with
        increasing fiber content. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 6(a-b) shows the flexural strength as a function of fiber
        content in composites of 40 wt. % ash and 60 wt. % ash. FIG. 6a
        shows the results for 40 wt. % ash and FIG. 6b the results for
        60 wt. % ash. For both ash wt. %'s and both fiber lengths,
        flexural strength increases as the fiber wt. % increases. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 7(a-b) shows the fracture toughness of these same
        composites. FIG. 7a shows the results for 40 wt. % fiber and
        FIG. 7b the results for 60 wt. % fiber. The fracture toughness
        of the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> samples without any fibers is
        0.22 and 0.35 Mpa.multidot.m.sup.1/2. Adding fiber to the extent
        of 3 wt. % for both 0.25 and 0.5 inch fibers increases the
        fracture toughness of 40 wt. % ash composite to 0.65
        Mpa.multidot.m.sup.1/2. That figure is approximately twice the
        fracture toughness of MKP formulations, neat, i.e., without any
        fiber additive. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 shows the scanning electron micrograph of a fractured
        surface of a MKP-Class F fly ash composite sample, 60 wt. %
        Class F fly ash and 2 wt. % of 0.25 inch glass fiber. The fibers
        were added as strands or bunches of fibers; yet, the fibers
        dispersed and became encapsulated as individual fibers in the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        matrix. The micrograph clearly shows each fiber is surrounded by
        the matrix. MKP serves as an effective dispersant. As is to be
        expected in an acidic or neutral pH environment, there is no
        corrosion on the fibers' surfaces. This indicates a
        compatibility between the glass fibers and the matrix. </p>
      <p>MKP is a rugged binder, applicable to a wide variety of wastes
        and for specialized structural products where the strength
        requirements are very high. On the other hand, MHP allows for
        high waste loading, is much less expensive, and may be useful
        for development of structural products of high volume waste
        streams. </p>
      <p>A myriad of wastes can be encapsulated by the invented methods
        and ceramics. As such, hazardous metals are good candidates,
        including, but not limited to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead,
        nickel, and zinc. Low solubility-oxides are also good waste
        substrate candidates, as are fission products, including
        technetium, strontium, barium and cesium. Low level wastes, such
        as biomedical materials and other slightly radioactive
        substrates are suitable encapsulation candidates. Wastes
        containing difficult to encapsulate oils are particularly good
        candidates for the instant invention. Even heterogeneous wastes
        and mixed phase wastes are suitable. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described with reference to
        details of the illustrated embodiment, these details are not
        intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the
        appended claims. </p>

        powder form and combined in a stochiometric molar ratio range of
        (0.5-1.5):1 to form a binder powder. Similarly, the sparsely

        The resulting chemically bonded phospho-silicate ceramic
        exhibits high flexural strength, high compression strength, low

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to ceramics, and more
        particularly to a chemically bonded phospho-silicate ceramic
        that exhibits high flexural strength, high compression strength,
        low porosity and permeability to water, sets rapidly at room
        temperature, has a definable and bio-compatible chemical
        composition, is easily colored, and a method of producing the
        same. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>There is an acute need for a rapid setting pore-free high
        strength binding material for use in the construction and waste
        management industries. Traditional cements and ceramics used in
        these industries have many drawbacks that make those traditional
        materials less than ideal. For example, traditional cement, such
        as Portland cement, lacks fracture toughness, is extremely
        porous and permeable to water, and is very slow in setting. The
        open porosity of these traditional cement materials makes these
        materials susceptible to deterioration during the freezing and
        thawing which occurs in many climates across the United States,
        Europe and beyond. The expansion and contraction of water within
        the open pores of these traditional cement materials causes them
        to break down as they are exposed to extreme temperature
        fluctuations. Additionally, traditional cements, such as
        Portland cement, are slow in setting, requiring continuous
        hydration and attention until the cement material has been
        properly set, thus adding considerable labor costs to any given
        project. </p>
      <p>The open porosity and thus high water permeability of
        traditional cement materials also limits the practical use of
        these materials in waste management and waste encapsulation
        projects. Highly porous cements are permeable to ground water
        and allow wastes and toxins to leach out from the encapsulated
        cement material. </p>
      <p>Slightly soluble silicate minerals such as Wollastenite
        (CaSiO.sub.3) and serpentinite (Mg.sub.6 Si.sub.4 O.sub.10
        (OH).sub.8), have been used to develop phosphate cements. These
        phosphate cements are produced by using phosphoric acid,
        partially neutralized with zinc and aluminum, and then reacted
        with Wollastenite or serpentine. In spite of the neutralization
        step, the acid solutions are highly acidic, making them hard to
        transport to a construction site as a raw material and requiring
        rigorous safety training for employees in the construction
        industry, who are used to just adding water to powdered cement.
        Additionally, the high acidity of these phosphate cements
        corrodes conventional construction and concrete equipment. </p>
      <p>Ceramics are typically less porous than traditional cement,
        however, traditional ceramics must be fired at extremely high
        temperatures in order to solidify and cure the ceramic material
        for practical use. Fired ceramic construction products are
        expensive, especially if there are large size components. The
        firing process is not suitable for waste management purposes
        because waste components volatilize during firing. Resins and
        other polymer products used as binding materials also provide a
        less porous product than traditional ceramic materials, however
        resins are typically expensive to manufacture, their fumes are
        toxic, and resulting resin products are flammable. </p>
      <p>One ceramic material that has had some success as a binding
        material is the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> binder. <b><i>Ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders disclosed in our U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,645,518; 5,830,815 and
        5,846,894, include compounds such as magnesium potassium
        phosphate (MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O) and newberyite
        (MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O) ceramics. These <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders are considerably less porous than conventional cements,
        are not toxic or flammable, set at a controllable rate, and are
        a low cost alternative to polymer resins. These <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders provide a compression strength comparable to the
        compression strength exhibited by Portland cement. </p>
      <p>It is also known to combine ash with <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders, as disclosed in our U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,815, to
        increase the compression strength to a level two to three times
        that of the compression strength of Portland cement, The
        porosity of the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> ash product is quite
        low reducing its susceptibility to freeze thaw deterioration and
        increasing its practical usefulness as a suitable waste
        encapsulation material that resists permeation of ground water
        and the leaching of wastes out of the encapsulated <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        ash product. The <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> ash product,
        however, is not often suitable for architectural uses where many
        true and subtle colors and shades are desired because the ash
        product cannot be easily dyed or colored. The <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        ash product is gray or beige depending upon whether fly ash or
        bottom ash is used. This gray or beige starting color prevents
        many common architectural colors such as red, yellow, blue,
        etc., from being achieved, regardless of how much dye or pigment
        is added to the ash-containing product. Additionally, ash is a
        mixture of many oxides and silicates and may contain components
        that are not bio-compatible. </p>
      <p>The lack of bio-compatibility in ash containing products,
        limits the use of those products in the bio-material industries
        which also have a great need for rapid setting, pore free, high
        strength binding materials which are also bio-compatible. Only
        bio-compatible components can make up the binding materials used
        in dentistry and orthopedics etc. For example, zinc phosphate
        cements have been used as dental cements because they are dense,
        hard and also bio-compatible. Zinc phosphate cements, however,
        are expensive to manufacture and set rapidly, within minutes,
        making them difficult to work with and produce in any sort of
        large quantity. For these reasons zinc phosphate cements are not
        practical for use in construction or waste encapsulation
        projects as well. Zinc phosphate cements also do not contain
        calcium phosphates or hydroxyapatite, which are desirable
        elements for bone tissue growth. </p>
      <p>None of the previous binding materials provide a high strength,
        low porosity, rapid setting, easily colored, bio-compatible
        chemical composition needed for use in the construction,
        waste-management, and bio-material industries. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide a chemically
        bonded phospho-silicate ceramic that exhibits high flexural and
        compression strength. The high strength phospho-silicate ceramic
        of the present invention can reduce the size of load-bearing
        structures in the construction industry, provide very strong
        waste encapsuation matrix and provide a high strength
        biomaterial for use in prosthetics and dentistry. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide the new
        chemically bonded phospho-silicate ceramic exhibiting low
        porosity and permeability to water, providing a desirable
        construction material that is resistant to freeze-thaw
        deterioration during temperature fluctuations, as well as
        providing an excellent material for waste encapsulation that is
        resistant to permeation of ground water and leaching from the

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention teaches a new chemically bonded
        phospho-silicate ceramic that will benefit the construction,
        waste management, and biomaterial industries, as well as a
        method for producing the new chemically bonded phospho-silicate
        ceramic. The phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention
        exhibits high flexural strength, high compression strength, low
        porosity and permeability to water, has a definable and
        bio-compatible chemical composition and is readily and easily
        colored to almost any desired shade or hue. The phospho-silicate
        ceramic of the present invention is simply manufactured in large
        or small quantities, sets rapidly at room temperatures in only a
        few hours, and continues to cure over a period of time, The
        phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention can also be
        easily made on site away from the manufacturing plant as its
        separate components are very safely and easily transportable. </p>
      <p>The phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention is formed
        by chemically reacting a monovalent alkali metal phosphate and a
        sparsely soluble divalent oxide, with a sparsely soluble
        silicate in an aqueous solution. The phospho-silicate ceramic of
        the present invention can alternatively be formed by replacing
        the monovalent alkali metal phosphate with ammonium hydrogen
        phosphate, aluminum hydrophosphate or a phosphoric acid
        solution. The monovalent alkali metal phosphate (or ammonium
        hydrogen phosphate, aluminum hydrophosphate or phosphoric acid
        solution) and sparsely soluble oxide form a <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder as disclosed in our earlier patents, namely U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 5,645,518, 5,830,815 and 5,846,894, incorporated herein by
        reference. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,645,518, 5,830,815 and 5,846,894,
        disclose <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> binders such as magnesium
        potassium phosphate (MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O) and newberylite
        (MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O), etc. <b><i>Ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders are inexpensive to manufacture in large scale, because
        their components are widely available and generally inexpensive.
      </p>
      <p>Monovalent alkali metal phosphates suitable for forming <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders include dihydrogen phosphates of all Group 1A elements
        in the periodic table and suitable ammonium hydrogen phosphates
        include, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ((NH.sub.4)H.sub.2
        PO.sub.4) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH.sub.4).sub.2
        HPO.sub.4). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH.sub.2 PO.sub.4);
        lithium dihydrogen phosphate (LiH.sub.2 PO.sub.4); and potassium
        dihydrogen phosphate (KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4) are preferable
        monovalent alkali metals for forming the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders. In addition, aluminum dihydrogen phosphate may also be
        used. </p>
      <p>Suitable sparsely soluble oxides include oxides of Group IIA
        elements that have a solubility constant between 5 and 25.
        Preferably, solubility constants between 5 and 12 are desired,
        and magnesium oxide (MgO); Barium oxide (BaO); and Calcium oxide
        (CaO) are the most preferred oxides for reacting with the
        monovalent alkali metals to form <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders. Zinc oxide (ZnO) of group IIB elements may also be
        used. </p>
      <p>Sparsely soluble silicates suitable for forming the
        phospho-silicate ceramics of the present invention include
        silicates of Group IIA and IA elements that have a solubility
        constant between 5 and 25. Once again silicates with a
        solubility constant between 5-12 are more preferred and
        silicates such as calcium silicate (CaSiO.sub.3); talc or
        magnesium silicate (MgSiO.sub.3) barium silicate (BaSiO.sub.3);
        sodium silicate (NaSiO.sub.3); lithium silicate (LiSiO.sub.3);
        and serpentinite (Mg.sub.6 Si.sub.4 O.sub.10 (OH.sub.8) are
        preferred. Calcium silicate has a solubility product constant of
        approximately 8, which is similar to magnesium oxide, and thus
        would be a compatible material with the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder, and the most preferred sparsely soluble silicate for
        forming the phospho-silicate ceramics of the present invention.
        Calcium silicate, or Wollastonite as it is known in its mineral
        form, is an inexpensive product, typically 5-10 cents per pound,
        and is widely available in large amounts. Wollastonite is also
        available in powder form, is not toxic, and is thus easy to
        handle and transport. Wollastonite as referred to in the present
        patent application is defined according to Dana's Manual of
        Mineralogy, Revised by Cornells Klein and Cornelius S. Hurlbut,
        Jr. 20.sup.th ed, pub. John Wiley and Sons, New York (1977) pp.
        406-408. </p>
      <p>The addition of Wollastonite to the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders produced exciting and unexpected results, as the
        Wollastonite unexpectedly modified the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders significantly. The Wollastonite crystals greatly
        increased the fracture toughness of the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        matrix, and amorphous silicate released from the Wollastonite in
        solution, greatly increased the compression and flexural
        strength of the matrix while at the same time reducing its
        porosity and permeability to water. </p>
      <p>Individual Wollastonite crystals are acicular or elongated in
        structure, and when combined within the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        matrix, the Wollastonite crystals act as whiskers to resist
        crack propagation. The Wollastonite crystals either stop or
        divert propagating cracks requiring more energy for the crack to
        continue, and thus increasing the fracture toughness of the
        resulting product. Wollastonite also increases the viscosity of
        the mixture, and overall strength of the resulting
        phospho-silicate ceramic. </p>
      <p>Amorphous silica released from Wollastonite in an aqueous
        solution chemically reacts with the phosphates of the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder to form a glassy phase within the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        matrix. This chemical reaction was completely unexpected because
        typically silicates and silicas, i.e. sand, are stable
        materials. Silicates and silicas, even do not dissolve in acidic
        solutions and do not react in an aqueous environment. However,
        it was observed that the addition of a sparsely soluble silicate
        such as Wollastonite to phosphate <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binders provided the very unexpected chemical reactions as
        outlined below. </p>
      <p>Sparsely soluble silicates such as Wollastonite, talc, and
        serpentinite are slightly alkaline and when combined with water
        they become ionized, releasing the metal cations. For example,
        Wollastonite dissolved in acidic water such as solutions of
        H.sub.3 PO.sub.4, KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, Al(H.sub.2 PO.sub.4).sub.3
        etc., released cations Ca.sup.++ and silicate SiO.sub.3.sup.--.
        The calcium cations reacted with the phosphates to form calcium
        phosphates. The silicate anion formed metasilicic acid (H.sub.2
        SiO.sub.3) which further reacted with available cations to form
        K.sub.2 SiO.sub.3 as seen in equation 5. ##EQU1## </p>
      <p>The first and third equations demonstrate that the addition of
        a sparsely soluble silicate such as calcium silicate is a good
        method for introducing metasilicic acid to a phosphate slurry.
        The acid reacts subsequently with other available cations, such
        as 2K.sup.+ as shown in equation 5 to form silicate glass. For
        example, if sodium dihydrogen phosphate or potassium dihydrogen
        phosphate was used instead of phosphoric acid water as the
        provider of phosphate anions, the metasilicic acid will react
        with either Na.sup.+ or K.sup.+ ions to form alkali metal glass.
        This alkali metal glass formed within the phospho-silicate
        ceramic of the present invention is believed to fill the voids
        between particles of the ceramic and produce a dense solidified
        non-porous ceramic product. Additionally, the glassy phase
        within the ceramic product is also believed to bind particles of
        the product together to produce a hard ceramic, thus increasing
        both the compression and flexural strength of the resulting
        product. </p>
      <p>After the chemical reaction between the silicate and the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder, at least three products are produced, namely, magnesium
        potassium phosphate binder (MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O), calcium
        hydrophosphate (CaHPO.sub.4.2H.sub.2 O), and potassium silicate
        (K.sub.2 SiO.sub.3). The magnesium potassium phosphate provides
        the bulk strength for the new phospho-silicate ceramic, and the
        potassium silicate produces a glassy phase that fills the voids
        between the bulk compounds, resulting in a product that is
        almost completely dense. This glassy phase provides the benefits
        of reducing or even eliminating the porosity of the resulting
        ceramic and smoothing its surface. </p>
      <p>The compounds of the phospho-silicate ceramic of the present
        invention are not as acidic as phosphate cement, nor as alkaline
        as Portland cement. The compounds are more neutral, less
        corrosive, and weather better over time. However, similar to
        Portland cement, the phospho-silicate ceramic of the present
        invention can be easily made on site by just adding water to a
        blend of powders. Thus, current construction equipment can be
        easily used, without extensive modifications, to make the
        phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention on a
        construction site. </p>
      <p>The phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention is
        manufactured through a unique but relatively simple process of
        combining a monovalent alkali metal phosphate powder and a
        sparsely soluble oxide powder, with the sparsely soluble
        silicate powder in an aqueous solution. The powders are simply
        blended together. The sparsely soluble silicate powder comprises
        1-80% of the powder mixture and preferably 50-60% of the powder
        mixture by weight. The monovalent alkali metal phosphate and the
        sparsely soluble oxide powder are combined in the molar ratio
        range of (0.5-1.5):1 in the widest range, (0.8-1.2):1 in a
        preferred range, and 1:1 in the most preferred ratio range.
        Alternatively, an ammonium hydrogen phosphate powder, aluminum
        hydrophosphate powder or phosphoric acid solution can replace
        the monovalent alkali metal phosphate powder in the same
        concentration. </p>
      <p>Water is then stirred into the powder blend to form a slurry. A
        suitable water to powder weight ratio is (1-1.5):2 in the widest
        range, (1-1.2): 2 in a preferred range and 1:2 in the most
        preferred range. The slurry is stirred for 10 to 25 minutes at
        room temperature and left to harden, or alternatively, poured
        into molds and left to harden. The ceramic material will harden
        within two hours, and then continue to cure for at least 3
        weeks. </p>
      <p>Coloring the phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention
        can also be achieved by simply adding an inorganic powder
        pigment to the powder blend before the water is added. Since
        Wollastonite crystals are white, the phospho-silicate ceramic of
        the present invention can easily be colored to any desired shade
        or hue. This attribute can be particularly useful in the
        construction industry where colored binding materials can
        provide substantial cost savings and provide great architectural
        freedom and creativity in designing structures utilizing binding
        materials of various color schemes. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>In a preferred method, 60% by weight Wollastonite powder, 10%
        by weight magnesium oxide powder, and 30% by weight potassium
        dihydrogen phosphate powder were combined to form a powder
        blend. Water was added to the powder blend in a weight ratio of
        1:5 respectively, and stirred for 15-25 minutes at room
        temperature to form a slurry. The slurry was then poured into
        plastic syringes of one inch diameter and filled to a volume of
        60 cc's and left to cure. The slurry set into a hard ceramic
        within two hours. The resulting chemically bonded
        phospho-silicate ceramic was dense, non-porous and homogenous. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the invention, 12.5% by weight
        magnesium oxide powder, 37.5% by weight potassium dihydrogen
        phosphate powder, and 50% by weight Wollastonite power was mixed
        to form a powder blend. Water was added to the powder blend in a
        weight ratio of 1:4 respectively, and stirred for 15-25 minutes
        at room temperature to form a slurry. The slurry was then poured
        into plastic syringes having a one inch diameter and filled to a
        volume of 60 cc's, and left to cure. The slurry set into a hard
        ceramic within two hours. The resulting chemically bonded
        phospho-silicate ceramic was dense, non-porous and homogenous. </p>

      <p><br>
        As shown in Table 1, the phospho-silicate ceramics of Examples 1
        and 2 have a low water absorption, and thus reduced porosity,
        compared to high strength concrete and <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder. The weight percent water absorption of the
        phospho-silicate ceramics of Examples 1 and 2 is 1/5-1/10 the
        weight percent water absorption of high strength concrete, and
        1/2-1/8 the weight percent water absorption of <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder. It appears that the addition of Wollastonite to the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder reduced the porosity of the resulting phospho-silicate
        ceramic by a significant margin, thus resulting in a much denser
        end product. Typically, water absorption is a direct indication
        of the porosity of a material, however, in the phospho-silicate
        ceramics as shown in Examples 1 and 2, it is believed that at
        least some of the water absorption is due to the formation of
        hydroxides of magnesium and calcium rather than due to the
        porosity of the ceramic. The actual porosity of the
        phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention is believed to
        be less than that indicated by the water absorption test in
        Table 1. As a result, it is expected that the phospho-silicate
        ceramics of the present invention would not experience
        freeze/thaw deterioration during the temperature fluctuations
        experienced in cold climates because the phospho-silicate
        ceramics of the present invention appear fully dense. </p>
      <p>As shown in Table 1 above, the phospho-silicate ceramic of
        Examples 1 and 2 have a flexural strength far superior to the
        flexural strength of high strength concrete and <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder. The phospho-silicate ceramics of Examples 1 and 2 had a
        flexural strength 30-50% higher than the flexural strength of
        high strength concrete. The phospho-silicate ceramics of
        Examples 1 and 2 have a flexural strength 20-40% greater than
        the flexural strength of <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> binder.
        Additionally, as shown in Table 1, the phospho-silicate ceramics
        of Examples 1 and 2 have a compression strength two times the
        compression strength of <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b> binder. </p>
      <p>Table 1 also compares the fracture toughness of the
        phospho-silicate ceramics of Examples 1 and 2, with the <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder/ash product. The MPa.m fracture toughness values for
        phospho-silicate ceramic Examples 1 and 2 are 0.66 and 0.63
        respectively, and the fracture toughness value for <b><i>ceramicrete</i></b>
        binder/ash is 0.19. Both phospho-silicate ceramic Examples 1 and
        2 exhibit a fracture toughness 3 times greater than the fracture
        toughness of the ceramicrete/ash product. This result further
        supports Applicant's theory that the acicular or elongated
        crystals of Wollastenite act as whiskers to resist crack
        propagation and thus increase the overall fracture toughness of
        the resulting product. Ash does not contain elongated crystal
        structures, and as a result, ash is poor in resisting crack
        propagation and increasing the overall fracture toughness of the
        resulting product. </p>
      <p>The X-ray diffraction pattern of the phospho-silicate ceramic
        of Example 1 shown in FIG. 1 exhibited a broad hump in the
        center of the pattern. This broad hump is believed to be due to
        the formation of potassium silicate glass (K.sub.2 SiO.sub.3)
        formed by the chemical reaction between potassium cations and
        metasilic acid, as shown in equation 5 above. It is believed
        that this glassy phase fills in the voids and pores in the
        resulting ceramic of the present invention, and is important for
        both reducing the open porosity of the ceramic of the present
        invention, which appears very dense and has a smooth surface,
        and for increasing the compression and flexural strength of the
        ceramic of the present invention. </p>
      <p>Also shown in the X-ray diffraction analysis, are major peaks
        that were identified as unreacted calcium silicate, magnesium
        potassium phosphate binder (MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O) and calcium
        hydrophosphate (CaHPO.sub.4.2H.sub.2 O). Calcium hydrophosphate
        is likely to be absorbed into the human body and can regenerate
        body tissues when the phospho-silicate ceramic of the present
        invention is used in bio-materials. For this reason, the
        phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention may be one of
        the most suitable materials for bio-material purposes such as
        orthopedic and dental applications. </p>
      <p>A scanning electron micrograph of fracture surface of samples
        of the phospho-silicate ceramic of the present invention is
        shown in FIG. 2. The micrograph shows the crack propagation of
        the ceramic is intergranular, with the cracks running around the
        elongated crystals of the Wollastonite. Such crack deflection by
        the Wollastonite crystals increases the fracture energy and
        improves the fracture toughness of the phospho-silicate ceramic
        of the present invention. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the phospho-silicate ceramic of the
        present invention can be sold as separate components grouped
        into kits for forming phospho-silicate ceramic structures for
        home as well as industrial use. For example, a typical kit would
        include a bag or drum, depending on the volume needed, of
        suitable monovalent alkali metal phosphate powder, suitable
        sparsely soluble oxide, and suitable sparsely soluble silicate.
        Each powder is combined in an appropriate amount as described
        above. The kit could also include an optional bag or drum of
        inorganic pigment powder to dye the final product to a desired
        color, or a bag or drum of an aggregate, such as granite, if a
        particular texture is desired in the final product. Easy to
        follow instructions would direct the user to combine the
        powders, add the appropriate amount of water to form a slurry,
        and add any desired aggregate. The slurry is then poured into a
        mold, for example a countertop mold for home use, and allowed to
        set and cure. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the phospho-silicate ceramic can be sprayed onto
        the surface of a structure for fireproofing, water proofing,
        etc. The phospho-silicate ceramic will chemically bond to the
        substrate, making this product far superior to a laminate
        applied with an adhesive to a substrate. </p>
      <p>Other ways of making Wollastonite containing phospho-silicate
        ceramics include reacting Wollastonite with phosphoric acid
        solution, or aluminum hydro phosphate solution, but a small
        amount of boric acid needs to be added as a retardant because
        phosphoric acid is too reactive. It is also possible to
        neutralize the phosphoric add with hydroxides or carbonates of
        an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium, and react it with
        Wollastonite. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>1. 40 g of Wollastonite, and 67 g of 50 wt. % concentrated
        phosphoric acid solution neutralized with 15% of sodium
        carbonate were reacted for 20 min. The slurry warmed up and set
        into a hard ceramic. We believe, sodium carbonate reacted with
        phosphoric acid solution to form sodium dihydrogen phosphate
        which reacted with Wollastonite to form the ceramic. The ceramic
        contained some glassy phase, probably sodium phosphate and
        sodium silicate, unreacted Wollastonite, and calcium
        hydrophosphate. </p>
      <p>2. 40 g of Wollastonite, 67 g of 50% concentrated phosphoric
        acid solution when mixed together reacted instantaneously and
        formed a precipitate. With addition of 3 g of boric acid,
        however, the slurry set into a hard ceramic. Thus, it is
        possible to produce ceramics of Wollastonite without
        neutralizing phosphoric acid or adding magnesium oxide as done
        in the previous case studies. The product contained calcium
        hydrophosphate and unreacted Wollastonite. </p>
      <p>3. 80 g of Wollastonite, 100 g of 50% concentrated phosphoric
        acid solution and 15 g of potassium carbonate were mixed for 10
        min. Initial setting was in one hour and complete setting was in
        3 days. </p>
      <p>4. 100 g of Wollastonite was mixed with 100 g of sodium
        dihydrogen phosphate and 100 g of water. The slurry was mixed
        for 30 min. It warmed up and set in two days. </p>
      <p>5. 25 g of Wollastonite, 50 g of sodium dihydrogen phosphate,
        112.5 g of ash and 80 g of water were mixed for 10 min. The
        slurry set in two days. The set product contained unidentifiable
        glassy phase. </p>
      <p>All these tests demonstrate that phosphates may be added in
        different forms to produce Wollastonite containing chemically
        bonded phospho-silicate ceramics. </p>
      <p>The foregoing description has been provided to clearly define
        and completely describe the present invention. Various
        modifications may be made without departing from the scope and
        spirit of the invention which is defined in the following
        claims. <br>

      <p>Low-level mixed wastes contain hazardous chemical and low-level
        radioactive materials. Generally, mixed waste streams contain
        aqueous liquids, heterogeneous debris, inorganic sludges and
        particulates, organic liquids and soils. The projected volume
        over the next five years of the mixed waste generated by the
        U.S. Department of Energy alone is estimated at approximately
        1.2 million cubic meters. </p>
      <p>Stabilization of these mixed wastes requires that both phases
        of contaminants are stabilized effectively. </p>
      <p>Typical approaches to stabilization and storage of these mixed
        wastes include vitrification. For example, one process (Crowe,
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,565) requires firing temperatures of at
        least 1,850.degree. C. for at least 12 hours to produce ceramic
        containers. However, such processes, associated with high
        temperatures are costly. In addition, vitrification of waste
        streams often result in the lighting off of volatile components
        contained in the waste stream. This lighting off results in the
        unwanted generation of secondary waste streams. </p>
      <p>One system for producing cements having ceramic type properties
        does not require high temperatures for final crystallization
        (Sugama et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,436,555, assigned to the instant
        assignee). However, that process results in ammonia being
        liberated during processing and storage, which leads to
        container corrosion, and also explosive compositions if wastes
        contain nitrates. </p>
      <p>The inventors also have developed ceramic fabrication methods
        to both stabilize and encapsulate waste. These methods offer a
        number of advantages over typical portland cement grout-,
        polymer- and ceramic-encapsulation techniques. Ceramic
        encapsulation systems are particularly attractive given that the
        bonds formed in these systems are either ionic or covalent, and
        hence stronger than the hydration bonds in portland cement.
        Since waste stabilization using ceramics is due to chemical
        stabilization as well as physical encapsulation, the leaching
        characteristics of these final waste forms are superior to the
        above-identified waste forms which are mainly dependent on
        physical encapsulation. Also, unlike prior vitrification
        requirements, the exothermic ceramic formulation process needs
        no thermal treatment or heat input, resulting in waste
        stabilization being done economically on site and without
        capital intensive equipment and transportation procedures. </p>
      <p>However, exothermic ceramic formulation processes are not
        suitable for the economic encapsulation of large amounts of
        waste. The inventors have found that the production of large
        amounts of heat during reaction causes the reacting solution to
        boil, leading to flaws (i.e. pores) in the final ceramic form,
        short workability time, and fast, uneven curing. While reaction
        temperatures may be partially controlled by circulating cold
        water around the slurry container or mold in which the sample is
        setting, sufficient heat conduction is not present as sample
        sizes increase. </p>
      <p>Another drawback to typical ceramic waste production processes
        is that such systems foster low pH conditions. For example,
        acid-base ceramic encapsulation reactions begin in severe acidic
        conditions, near pH 0. Such severe conditions destabilize HgS to
        a leachable form prior to its physical encapsulation. Low pH
        conditions also lead to CaCO.sub.3 decomposition. </p>
      <p>A need exists in the art for a high volume waste stabilization
        and solidification method that does not generate high amounts of
        heat during the encapsulation process. The process must also be
        operational at moderate pH conditions so as to facilitate
        stabilization of wastes which are unstable at low pH. The final
        product must exhibit low leachability and high durability in
        aqueous systems. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to overcome many of the
        disadvantages of the prior art in the encapsulation and
        stabilization of low-level, radioactive, mixed and other wastes.
      </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a
        temperature-controlled ceramics formation process to encapsulate
        and stabilize wastes. A feature of the invention is the
        utilization of readily available compounds to regulate the
        acid-base reactions associated with the formation of ceramics
        waste forms. An advantage of the invention is maintaining a low
        temperature during the formation process. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a low
        temperature reaction liquor in a process to stabilize mixed
        waste using chemically bonded phosphate ceramics. A feature of
        the present invention is the moderation of the pH of the
        reaction liquor. An advantage of the present invention is that
        the lower reaction temperatures facilitate the formation of more
        dense waste forms. Another advantage is that certain waste
        materials, which decompose or destabilize in low-pH environs,
        are more completely stabilized. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        ceramic waste form high in potassium. A feature of the invention
        is a high amount of crystalline phase in the final waste form.
        An advantage of the invention is a more dense, less porous waste
        form. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the present invention provides for a method for
        regulating the reaction temperature of a ceramic formulation
        process comprising supplying a solution containing a monovalent
        alkali metal; mixing said solution with an oxide powder to
        create a binder; contacting said binder with bulk material to
        form a slurry; and allowing the slurry to cure. </p>
      <p>The invention also provides for a ceramic waste form comprising
        a potassium containing ceramic binder and waste substrate
        encapsulated by the binder. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention teaches two processes for chemically controlling
        the reaction temperature in ceramic formulation processes. These
        two processes allow for the formation of large final waste forms
        for a wide variety of waste streams, said waste streams
        containing ash, cement, silica, Bayer process wastes (red mud),
        potliner residue, pyrophorics, salt mixtures, volatiles, such as
        mercury, lead, cadmium, chromium, and nickel, and unstable
        compounds which cannot be treated by conventional high
        temperature techniques such as vitrification. The invention is
        also applicable to stabilize secondary waste streams resulting
        from thermal treatment processes, such as vitrification and
        plasma hearth processes. </p>
      <p>Radioactive materials are also stabilized by this method, such
        materials including uranium, plutonium, thorium, americium,
        fission products, and any other radioactive isotopes. Irradiated
        lead, hazardous metals, flue-gas desulfurization residues are
        also stabilized and/or encapsulated by the invented method. </p>
      <p>The invention also can be used to stabilize certain RCRA
        organics. The inventors have found that certain of these
        organics do not retard the setting of phosphate ceramics. In one
        scenario, organics such as naphthalene and dichlorobenzene are
        trapped in activated carbon which in turn is stabilized in the
        phosphate matrix by the method claimed herein. This method of
        stabilization can be utilized in situations wherein mixed waste
        contains trace amounts of organics such as polychlorinated
        biphenyls, dioxin, dichlorobenzene, naphthalene, among others.
        As such, the invented method is superior to encapsulation
        methods wherein cement is utilized, in that cement cannot
        stabilize in the presence of organics. </p>
      <p>The method may also be used to stabilize and solidify wastes
        containing salts, such as chlorides, nitrates, nitrides,
        sulfites and sulfates. Conventional cement technology cannot
        stabilize these waste streams. </p>
      <p>Ash waste may be consolidated by this process to 80 volume
        percent of its original volume. Experiments by the inventors
        show good reaction and bonding between amorphous and reactive
        silica from fly ash and bottom ash with phosphate matrix.
        Formation of hard silico-phosphate bonds via this reaction can
        be used for the stabilization of hazardous silica compounds such
        as asbestos. The invention also encapsulates and stabilizes
        silica based filter aids, such as vermiculites and perlites,
        which are used in the removal of contaminants from liquid waste
        streams. </p>
      <p>The two invented temperature control processes yield
        superior-strength final forms having uniform high density
        throughout and improved microstructure compared to typical
        methods of ceramics formation. </p>
      <p>A salient feature of the low-temperature ceramic-waste
        formulation processes is an acid-base reaction, such as that
        depicted in Equation 1, below. Typically, the reaction produces
        phosphate of MgO (Newberyite). </p>
      <p>The acid base reaction results in the reaction of the waste
        components with the acid or acid-phosphates. These reactions
        lead to chemical stabilization of the waste. In addition,
        encapsulation of the waste in the phosphate ceramics formed by
        the reaction products results in physical encapsulation of the
        waste components. </p>
      <p>As noted supra, a problem with the above-disclosed reaction
        sequence is the extremely low pH that exists in the reaction
        liquor as a result of the presence of the phosphoric acid. This
        low pH leads to destabilization of some waste materials during
        encapsulation, and higher reaction temperatures which ultimately
        renders weak final waste forms. </p>
      <p>The two processes for minimizing the exothermicity of the
        acid-base reactions are disclosed as follows: Process #1 deals
        with pretreating phosphoric acid with a carbonate, bicarbonate
        or hydroxide of a monovalent metal prior to mixing with an oxide
        or hydroxide powder so as to buffer the acid. An exemplary
        reaction for process #1 is illustrated in Equation 2, below: </p>
      <p>whereby M is a monovalent metal which can be selected from the
        group consisting of potassium, sodium, lithium. M'oxide
        designates the oxide powder, whereby M' is a metal which can be
        selected from the group consisting of Mg, Al, Ca, and Fe. As
        noted above, M' also can be supplied as an hydroxide. </p>
      <p>Process #2 discloses a method for bypassing the use of acid
        altogether and mixing the oxide powder with a dihydrogen
        phosphate to form a ceramic at a higher pH. Illustrations of
        process #2 are Equations 3-5, below: </p>
      <p><b>Solid Waste Preparation Detail</b> </p>
      <p>Solid wastes first can be manipulated in powder form by
        grinding the waste to an average, preferable approximate
        particle size of 8 to 10 micrometers (.mu.m). However, particles
        can range in size from between approximately 5 .mu.m to several
        millimeters. </p>
      <p>Ash and cement wastes can be first mixed with the starter oxide
        or hydroxide powders using a vibratory shaker, or any
        conventional agitator. Weight percentages of the mixture varies
        at this juncture, but can range from between approximately 15
        percent oxide to 50 percent oxide. Typically, an even weight
        percent (50:50) of oxide to solid waste is sought. However, the
        inventors have successfully encapsulated and stabilized
        single-component fly ash at weight percents as high as 85
        percent ash to 15 percent MgO powder, which makes this technique
        particularly attractive for utilities where single-component fly
        ash is a major land-filling problem. </p>
      <p>The above mixture of powders is then added to pretreated
        phosphoric acid solution (process #1) or to the dihydrogen
        phosphate solution (process #2) to form a reaction slurry. The
        slurry is mixed using a mixer for 10 minutes to 30 minutes
        during which it forms a viscous paste. The paste sets in a few
        hours once poured into a mold. Typically, no pressure is applied
        to the now-molded slurry. The slurry gains full strength in
        approximately one day. </p>
      <p>Mold shapes can vary, depending on the configuration of the
        ultimate deposition site, and can be selected from a myriad of
        geometrical shapes including cuboid, pyramidal, spherical,
        planar, conical, cylindrical, trapezoidal, rectangular, and the
        like. Generally, molds having the shape and size of a typical 55
        gallon drum are used for waste management applications. </p>
      <p><b>Liquid Waste Processing Detail</b> </p>
      <p>In dealing with liquid waste, the invented temperature
        regulated encapsulation method provides a simplified approach
        for an end user compared to more typical encapsulation methods.
        For example, acid phosphates systems are made by adding said
        phosphate to the liquid on site, a process similar to that
        practiced in the cement industry. As such, liquid wastes, such
        as tritiated water, are easily and economically encapsulated
        with this procedure. </p>
      <p>Either process #1 or process #2 can be used if solely liquid is
        being encapsulated and stabilized. In process #1, the waste
        liquid is first combined with acid to form a pH modified
        solution. This modified solution is then mixed with oxide
        powder. Alternatively, the waste liquid can be added to oxide
        powder, to form a slurry, and then mix the slurry with acid. </p>
      <p>In process #2, the liquid waste is mixed with dihydrogen
        phosphate solution. Then, oxide powder is added. As above, an
        alternative procedure is to first combine the liquid waste with
        oxide powder and then add the dihydrogen solution. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that the ratio of acid to water,
        selected from a range of between approximately 37:63 to 50:50,
        produces good results. An acid:water ratio of 50:50 is most
        preferred. If the liquid waste contains more than the required
        amount of water, then correspondingly less water is added to the
        acid to bring the water weight percent of the liquid waste-acid
        mixture up to 50 percent. </p>
      <p>In situations involving liquid-solid waste streams, the liquid
        fraction of the waste stream can be prepared as outlined
        directly above. The resulting liquid waste-acid mixture is then
        mixed with a mixture of solid waste and oxide powder in weight
        percent ranges similar to those outlined above for solid waste
        processing. When using powder mixtures containing MgO and
        dibasic phosphate, weight percent ratios of the oxide to the
        phosphate selected from the range of approximately 87:13 to
        77:23 produce good results. </p>
      <p><b>Phosphate and Oxide Reactant Detail</b> </p>
      <p>Several phosphate systems can be used for the stabilization of
        the target chemical, radioactive and mixed waste streams. Some
        final phosphate-ceramic forms include, but are not limited to
        phosphates of Mg, Mg--Na, Mg--K, Al, Zn and Fe, whereby the
        metals are derived from starter oxide powders and hydroxide
        powders (such as in process #1). In process #2, the metals in
        the final phosphate ceramic forms are derived from both the
        starter powders and the dihydrogen phosphates. Exemplary
        dihydrogen phosphates used in process #2 include, but are not
        limited to, phosphates of potassium, sodium and lithium. The
        acid component may be concentrated or dilute phosphoric acid or
        acid phosphate solutions such as dibasic or tribasic sodium or
        potassium, or aluminum phosphates. The setting times for the
        pastes formed by the reaction ranges from a few hours to a week.
        The phosphates attain their full strength in approximately three
        weeks. </p>
      <p>Oxide powders can be pretreated for better reactions with the
        acids. One technique includes calcining the powders to a typical
        temperature of between approximately 1,200.degree. C. and
        1,500.degree. C. and more typically 1,300.degree. C. The
        inventors have found that the calcining process modifies the
        surface of oxide particles in a myriad of ways to facilitate
        ceramic formation. Calcining causes particles to stick together
        and also form crystals; this leads to the slower reaction rates
        that foster ceramic formation. Fast reactions tend to form
        undesired powdery precipitates. </p>
      <p>Another reaction enhancement technique is washing the powders
        with dilute nitric acid and then water. </p>
      <p>A myriad of oxide and hydroxide powders can be utilized to
        produce the ceramic system, including but not limited to MgO,
        Al(OH).sub.3, CaO, FeO, Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3, and Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4.
      </p>
      <p>MgO and Al(OH).sub.3 powders are available through any
        commercial supply house, such as Baxter Scientific Products,
        McGaw Park, Ill. The myriad iron oxides enumerated above could
        actually be supplied as part of some waste streams such as those
        generated in conjunction with soil and also in low-temperature
        oxidation systems which destroy organics using iron compounds. </p>
      <p><b>Process #1--pH Modification of Acid Solution</b> </p>
      <p>Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the inventors have found that
        when carbonate, bicarbonate, or hydroxides of monovalent metals
        (such as K, Na, Li, and Rb) are used to pretreat the acid prior
        to the acid-base reaction, a decrease in reaction temperature
        results. Also unexpectedly, the inventors have found that the
        addition of potassium containing alkali compounds (such as
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3) result in a more crystalline waste form that
        is impervious to weathering, compressive forces and leaching. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, and as can be determined in FIGS. 1-3, the higher
        the concentration of potassium containing compounds (such as
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3, KHCO.sub.3, and KOH) in the pre-reaction
        mixture, the more crystalline the final product. This high
        crystallinity correlates to higher compression strength and
        lower porosity. </p>
      <p>The carbonate in the pretreatment process decomposes into
        hydroxide, with an evolution of CO.sub.2. This results in a
        partial neutralization of the acid, which in turn reduces the
        rate of reaction and the rate of heat evolution. Typically, pH
        of the reaction slurry is raised from zero to between
        approximately 0.4 and 1. </p>
      <p>Overheating of the slurry is thus avoided by this pH adjustment
        mechanism. Second, and as more thoroughly disclosed infra, the
        use of potassium carbonate generates more crystalline, and
        therefore more stable, phosphate complexes. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 Buffer </p>
      <p>5, 10 and 15 weight percent of potassium carbonate K.sub.2
        OO.sub.3 was added to a 50 weight percent dilute solution of
        phosphoric acid. The resulting solution was allowed to
        equilibrate for several hours. In the equilibration process, the
        pH of the solution raised from near zero to 0.4, 0.6 and 0.9,
        respectively. After equilibration, 100 grams of the solution was
        mixed with 50 grams of an oxide powder. The oxide powder was a
        combination of calcined MgO and boric acid in a 85 weight
        percent MgO to 15 weight percent boric acid ratio. </p>
      <p>While adding the MgO and boric acid mixture to the acid
        solution, the temperature of the slurry, for phosphate
        concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 weight percent, was
        monitored. FIG. 1 depicts the temperature rise in each case.
        System A was a simulation of a process wherein no K.sub.2
        OO.sub.3 was added. The maximum temperature reached in this
        system was 45.degree. C. in a 50 cc volume sample. For samples B
        and C made with 5 and 10 weight percent of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3, the
        temperature rise was 8.degree. C. and 2.degree. C.,
        respectively. No temperature increase was noted when 15 weight
        percent of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 was added to the acid prior to
        reaction. </p>
      <p>X-ray diffraction analysis of the samples showed high
        crystallinity with samples made with 15 weight percent of
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3. Samples made with 5 and 10 weight percent of
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 were more glassy. As can be noted in Table 1,
        below, the X-ray diffraction studies of the samples identified
        unique mineral phases that are responsible for the desired low
        solubility product constant of the final product. This superior
        final product, a chemically bonded composite ceramic, is
        designated hereafter as MKHP. </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>Surprisingly and unexpectedly, magnesium potassium phosphate
        (MKP) is a new component in the material that formed exclusively
        by the addition of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3. MKP represents a superior
        phase for waste form matrix materials, given its solubility
        constant of 10.sup.-11, which is five magnitudes lower than that
        of newberyite which is 10.sup.-6. All of the phases depicted in
        Table 1 have very low solubilities in ground water, and
        lunebergite and newberyite are natural minerals which are hence
        stable in ground water environments. </p>
      <p>Porosity characteristics of the samples varied widely. In the
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 5- and 10-weight percent samples, the glass
        phase of the samples was abundant, with a concomitant higher
        amount of cracking and therefore porosity. By comparison, the
        K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 15 weight percent samples showed an open
        porosity of approximately 6.1 percent. Density was 1.77 g/cc,
        and closed porosity was 10.2 volume percent. Compression
        strength was approximately 3,700 psi. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 Buffer+Fly Ash </p>
      <p>The matrix material disclosed in Example 1 was used in Example
        2. Starter powder composition was 70 weight percent fly ash,
        25.5 weight percent calcined MgO, and 4.5 weight percent boric
        acid. The solution used was a 50 weight percent diluted H.sub.3
        PO.sub.4 buffered with K.sub.2 OO.sub.3. The solution was poured
        into a mixer, such as a cement mixer, and the powder was slowly
        added until all the powder was mixed with the solution in
        approximately 48 minutes. A cylindrical sample of 1,000 ml was
        made. </p>
      <p>The maximum temperature during mixing and setting ranged from
        between approximately 50.degree. C. and 60.degree. C. These
        temperatures did not increase, even when smaller weight percents
        of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 were used. For example, when 10 weight
        percent of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 was used, even at higher volumes
        (1,200 cc), maximum temperatures attained were between
        56.degree. C. and 58.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that in the absence of K.sub.2
        OO.sub.3, the concentration of MgO in the final product is high,
        with Newberyite as the main crystalline phase in the material. </p>
      <p>Data on compression strength and porosity of the materials made
        in Example 2 are shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. These figures show that
        as the content of K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 increases, the strength
        increases and the porosity drops. When K.sub.2 OO.sub.3 is 15
        weight percent in the solution, the compression strength is
        8,750 psi (which is more than twice that of portland cement)
        while porosity is reduced to 7.5 percent. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>Sodium Carbonate </p>
      <p>5, 10, and 15 weight percent of sodium carbonate (Na.sub.2
        OO.sub.3) was added to 50 weight percent of a dilute solution of
        phosphoric acid and the resulting solution was allowed to
        equilibrate for several hours. The pH of the solution was raised
        in the process from near zero to approximately 2.3. 100 grams of
        this solution was reacted with 30 grams of a mixture of calcined
        MgO and boric acid (85 weight percent MgO and 15 weight percent
        boric acid) and 70 grams of fly ash. </p>
      <p>The properties of the 5 weight percent Na.sub.2 OO.sub.3 sample
        were measured. Density was 1.7 g/cc and its open porosity was
        8.6 volume percent. Microstructural analysis of the samples
        revealed that the sample was primarily glassy except for the fly
        ash particles. This process shows that completely glassy phase
        material can be made by the process described above. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>Hazardous Material+MKHP </p>
      <p>Two different hazardous material waste streams were treated. An
        iron oxide-iron chloride waste stream (95 weight percent
        Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3 +5 weight percent FeCl.sub.3) was spiked with
        0.5 weight percent of Ce.sup.3+ and Ce.sup.4+ as surrogates of
        U.sup.3+,.sup.4+ and Pu.sup.3+,.sup.4+, incorporated as oxide.
        Also added was 0.5 weight percent of Ce.sup.4+ as a surrogate of
        U.sup.4+ and Pu.sup.4+, incorporated as oxide. </p>
      <p>The second waste stream was iron phosphate waste stream
        (FePO.sub.4) spiked with 0.5 weight percent of Pb to represent
        hazardous component, introduced as soluble nitrates. </p>
      <p>Both waste streams were stabilized via the carbonate
        modification method of Process #1. Containment of Ce.sup.3+,
        Ce.sup.4+ and Pb was 8.7 ppm, &lt;0.09 ppm and &lt;0.2 ppm,
        respectively. In as much as the 5 ppm regulatory limit on Pb is
        due to be revised downward to 0.37 ppm, the results show that
        the invented encapsulation procedure provides an acceptable
        method of containment. </p>
      <p>Process #2--Dihydrogen Phosphate </p>
      <p>Instead of adding carbonate to reactants to reduce reaction
        temperatures, the inventors have devised a simplified method to
        achieve the same results. This second process reacts dihydrogen
        phosphates of potassium, sodium, lithium, or any other
        monovalent alkali metal with an oxide to form a phosphate
        ceramic. This method forms a ceramic at higher pH while
        minimizing heat generation. An exemplary ceramic formed via this
        process is magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate (MKP),
        which is formed via the reaction mechanism depicted in Equation
        5, above. </p>
      <p>The inventors found that with the avoidance of acid in the
        initial reaction slurry, initial pH values are approximately
        6.2. Consistent with the fact that the dissolution of KH.sub.2
        PO.sub.4 is an endothermic process, the inventors found that at
        initial mixing, the temperature of the slurry slightly
        decreases. As the dissolution and reaction of MgO progresses,
        however, slurry temperatures increase to approximately
        30.degree. C. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
      <p>MKP Ceramic Fabrication </p>
      <p>One mole of calcined and ground MgO was mixed with one mole of
        ground potassium dihydrophosphate (KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4) crystals.
        The mixture was slowly added to 5 moles of water to form a
        paste. When the paste was well mixed, it was poured into
        cylindrical molds, of 1 cm in diameter and 20 cc volume. Hard
        ceramic forms developed in approximately 1 hour. </p>
      <p>X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that all major peaks were
        MKP. No peaks of the potassium dihydrophosphate were noted,
        indicating that it all reacted. </p>
      <p>Open porosity, measured by the water intrusion method, was
        calculated as 2.87 volume percent. Density was 1.73 g/cc. Given
        a theoretical density of 1.88 g/cc, the total porosity is
        calculated to be 8.19 volume percent. Thus, closed porosity
        (i.e., that porosity that is not accessible from outside the
        sample) was 5.33 g/cc. </p>
      <p>These values show that MKP is much denser than Mg-phosphate
        ceramic, wherein total porosity is approximately 30 percent. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
      <p>MKP+Fly Ash </p>
      <p>MKP ceramic synthesized in Example 5 was used to develop waste
        forms of fly ash. Samples were made using three different
        powders which are mixtures of calcined MgO and KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4
        in mole ratios of 1:1, 1.5:1 and 2:1. These powders were mixed
        with fly ash in equal weight proportions using a hopper and
        feeder mechanism. The final mixtures of the powders were
        combined at a slow but constant rate with 5 moles of water in a
        cement mixer to form a slurry. </p>
      <p>The slurry was poured into 1.5 gallon molds as well as 1 liter
        molds. Smaller samples were made by stirring the powders in
        water and using 1 cm diameter, 20 cc cylindrical molds. All
        samples set in approximately 1 hour and hardened fully after one
        week. </p>
      <p>Unlike the material described in Examples 1 and 2, the
        temperature of the slurry does not rise during mixing, but only
        during setting. This eliminates the prior art problem of
        evaporation of contaminants that occurs as a result of heat
        generation during the mixing stage. The inventors found that
        temperatures of the slurry before setting generally do not
        exceed 30.degree. C. As such, no evaporation of either the water
        fraction or the components of the waste occur. Once the slurry
        starts setting, the temperature rises. However, maximum
        temperatures (approximately 75.degree. C.) are reached after the
        sample sets into a hard monolith, thereby not resulting in any
        detrimental effect on the final waste form. Furthermore, the
        inventors have found that the temperature rise is not
        proportional to the size of specimens but in fact tapers off as
        the specimen size is increased. This facilitates the target
        waste encapsulation sizes of 55 gallons. </p>
      <p>The invented process utilizing MKP generates superior final
        ceramic forms. Open porosity values of the waste forms was found
        to be approximately 4.18 volume percent. Measured density was
        1.8 g/cc. Given the estimated theoretical density of 2.05 g/cc,
        the total porosity is 8.9 volume percent, which is much lower
        than Mg-phosphate ceramic found in the prior art. Closed
        porosity was calculated as 4.72 volume percent. Compression
        strength of the sample was 6,734 psi, which is more than 50
        percent stronger than portland cement concrete. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 7</b> </p>
      <p>Boric Acid+MKP+Ash </p>
      <p>Samples of fly ash waste forms were made with MKP matrix and
        calcined MgO powder in which from 0-5 weight percent boric acid
        was added. The addition of boric acid delayed the temperature
        rise of the reacting slurry. Therefore, the addition of boric
        acid facilitates the large scale processing of waste streams
        where more time is needed to mix and pour the slurry. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 8</b> </p>
      <p>CaCO.sub.3 Stabilization </p>
      <p>As noted supra, CaCO.sub.3 decomposes in low pH environs. As a
        result, if waste streams contain this compound, carbon dioxide
        is produced which bubbles from the reaction slurry. Such
        bubbling makes the set product porous and hence permeable to
        ground water. Strength is also compromised. </p>
      <p>Cement sludge, typical of cement-containing waste streams was
        prepared. The composition of the waste stream is depicted in
        Table 2, below: </p>

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>Samples were made by two methods. In the first method, slurry
        was formed with H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 as the reacting acid and waste
        forms containing approximately 30 volume percent of waste were
        fabricated. During this first process, the slurry formed tiny
        bubbles of CO.sub.2, which made the samples porous. </p>
      <p>When samples were made with the MKP process disclosed in
        Examples 5 and 6, supra, wherein KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 was used as
        the acid phosphate, no evolution of CO.sub.2 occurred.
        Comparison of the sample values are presented in Table 3, below:

      <p>Table 3 shows that the waste forms generated via the MKP
        process are denser and contain relatively small amounts of open
        porosity, thereby illustrating the superiority of the invented
        process compared to processes whereby large amounts of acid are
        utilized. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 9</b> </p>
      <p>Red Mud+MKP </p>
      <p>The refining of bauxite to produce aluminum oxides results in
        the production of large amounts of residue, known as red mud.
        Red mud consists of 50 percent inorganic oxides, other compounds
        and hazardous metals. Tremendous amounts of red mud are
        generated annually. </p>
      <p>Large volumes of red mud are easily stabilized when combined
        with the invented phosphate ceramic binder. If the reaction
        slurry, loaded with red mud, is poured as a barrier layer, it
        not only bonds with the substrate soil but also enters fissures
        in the soil and quickly hardens to form a nonporous ceramic
        layer. For example, red mud ceramics produced by the invented
        process exhibit low porosities (.apprxeq.2 volume percent) and
        high compression strengths (4,944 psi). The materials display a
        low porosity and high durability in a range of acid and basic
        environments, thereby making them ideal for mining industry
        applications, pond liners, tailing liners, waste pond dikes, and
        quick-setting grouts. </p>
      <p>A myriad of red mud waste can be utilized in producing final
        structural forms. Red mud waste used by the inventors was
        produced from gibbsitic bauxite. Essentially, it was dry mud
        collected from the periphery of a red mud waste pond. Its
        contents were .apprxeq.50 weight percent iron oxide (Fe.sub.2
        O.sub.3), .apprxeq.16.5 weight percent alumina (Al.sub.2
        O.sub.3), .apprxeq.3 weight percent silica (SiO.sub.2),
        .apprxeq.5.7 weight percent calcium oxide (CaO), and
        .apprxeq.6.8 weight percent titania (TiO.sub.2). X-ray
        diffraction analysis identified haematite (.alpha.-Fe.sub.2
        O.sub.3), goethite (.alpha.-FeOOH), calcite (CaCO.sub.3),
        boehmite (.gamma.-AlOOH), anatase (TiO.sub.2), and bayerite
        (.beta.-AlOOH) as the major crystalline phases. Surprisingly and
        unexpectedly, the inventors have learned that the hydrated
        phases, i.e., boehmite, bayerite and goethite, facilitate the
        development of phosphate bonds in the binding process. </p>
      <p>The amorphous characteristics of the alumina and silica
        components of red mud, which is discussed above, plays a major
        role in the ceramic bonding mechanisms. The inventors have found
        that it is the characteristically smaller particles of amorphous
        material that readily participates in the acid-base reaction and
        therefore facilitates the setting reaction during ceramic
        formation. </p>
      <p>As discussed supra, MgO, when reacted with phosphoric acid or
        an acid phosphate solution, forms magnesium phosphate
        precipitate in an exothermic reaction. This reaction can be
        controlled by use of calcined MgO and also by adjusting the feed
        rate of the solid phase (i.e., the red mud powder+oxide+boric
        acid) to the solution. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, calcined MgO first is mixed with red mud
        powder in a specific weight percent, disclosed in Table 4,
        below. Crushed dry red mud is a super-fine material with more
        than 60 weight percent of the particles finer than 10 mm.
        Particle sizes ranging from between 1 and 5 mm provide good
        results, so that grinding of the mud may not always be necessary
        prior to combining with the MgO. </p>

      <p>The dry mixture is then reacted with the phosphoric acid or an
        acid phosphate solution via constant stirring. This results in a
        low-viscosity paste which thickens as the reaction proceeds. The
        paste is then poured into cylindrical molds of 1.9 cm in
        diameter. Dense ceramics form in approximately 15 minutes, with
        complete hardening occurring in 2 to 24 hours. Prior to testing,
        the samples were stored for three weeks. </p>
      <p>Density was measured by weighing the samples and measuring the
        dimensions and determining the volume. Open porosity was
        determined by water immersion in which the pre-weighed samples
        were immersed in water at 70.degree. C. for 2 hours. The samples
        were then cooled in the water and then removed from the water.
        Excess water was wiped from the surface of the samples and the
        samples were weighed again to determine the amount of water that
        filled the open pores. This higher weight (compared to
        pre-immersion weights) yielded the volume of the open pores in
        the samples, thereby allowing for calculation of the open
        porosity. </p>
      <p>Compression strength was measured with an Instron.TM. machine
        used in compression mode. </p>
      <p>Waste loadings of the samples ranged from 40 to 55 weight
        percent. As an example, a 40 weight percent waste loading means
        that 40 grams of a sample is red mud and 60 grams is both binder
        and water. Densities of samples with red mud are slightly higher
        than that of pure matrix (binder) material, which is 1.73
        gm/cm.sup.3. Red mud density is approximately 3.3 g/cm.sup.3. </p>
      <p>As can be determined in Table 2, the open porosity of the
        red-mud-loaded samples was low compared to the .apprxeq.20
        percent value seen in cement. Furthermore, the compression
        strength of the samples with 40 weight percent loading was found
        to be higher than the 4,000 psi value for portland cement
        concrete. </p>
      <p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray
        (EDX) analyses of a fractured red-mud sample revealed a glassy
        region and a granular region. Both of these regions are well
        bonded. The glassy phase was cracked everywhere while the
        granular phase displayed only those cracks emanating from the
        glassy phase. Table 5, below, provides the general elemental
        composition of each phase. The values contained therein are
        averages of three measurements taken at three different
        locations of each phase. </p>
      <p>The granular phase is attributable to the red mud and the
        glassy phase is mostly the phosphate matrix. As shown, the
        granular phase was found rich in red-mud elements such as Fe and
        Al, while the glassy phase is rich in Mg phosphate elements such
        as Mg and P. </p>
      <p>TABLE 5 ______________________________________ Elemental

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>That significant amounts of phosphate and some magnesium are
        also in the granular phase indicates that phosphate binding
        occurred here with Fe and Al as the cations. </p>
      <p>The relatively few cracks seen in the granular phase (red mud)
        portion of the samples indicates that the strength of the
        invented material is due to this phase. Improving the strength
        of the ceramic therefore entails reducing the amount of the
        glassy phase or reinforcing the glassy phase with particulates.
        One method for such reinforcement is to incorporate finer red
        mud in the starter powder so as to facilitate more consistent
        distribution and better particle reinforcement. Grinding the red
        mud prior to mixing with the oxide powder is one way to obtain
        this finer red mud material. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described with reference to
        details of the illustrated embodiment, these details are not
        intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the
        appended claims. </p>
      <p>For example, in as much as process #2 utilizes KH.sub.2
        PO.sub.4, and in as much as KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 has components of
        common fertilizer, i.e. potash (K.sub.2 O) and phosphate
        (P.sub.2 O.sub.5), process #2 makes it possible to use high
        potash and high phosphate fertilizer to stabilize soils
        containing contaminants. </p>
      <p>Also, given that red mud contains high concentrations of
        oxides, it is feasible to mix red mud with MKP to generate the
        stable waste forms otherwise generated using process #2. This
        modification precludes the need for supplying and pretreating
        oxides, such as MgO in red mud stabilization procedures. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a material to stabilize waste and a
        method of producing the material, and more specifically, this
        invention relates to a ceramic material to stabilize low-level
        mixed wastes and a method for producing the ceramic material. </p>
      <p><b>2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Low-level mixed wastes contain hazardous chemical and low-level
        radioactive materials. Generally, mixed waste streams contain
        aqueous liquids, heterogeneous debris, inorganic sludges and
        particulates, organic liquids and soils. The projected volume
        over the next five years of the mixed waste generated by the
        U.S. Department of Energy alone is estimated at approximately
        1.2 million cubic meters. </p>
      <p>Stabilization of these mixed wastes requires that both phases
        of contaminants are stabilized effectively. </p>
      <p>Typical approaches to stabilization and storage of these mixed
        wastes include vitrification. For example, one process (Crowe,
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,302,565) requires firing temperatures of at
        least 1850.degree. C. for at least 12 hours to produce ceramic
        containers. However, such processes, associated with high
        temperatures are costly. In addition, vitrification of waste
        streams often result in the lighting off of volatile components
        which often are contained in the waste stream. This lighting off
        results in the unwanted generation of secondary waste streams. </p>
      <p>One system for producing cements having ceramic type
        properties, does not require high temperatures for final
        crystallization (Sugama et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,436,555, assigned
        to the instant assignee). However, that process results in
        ammonia being liberated during processing and storage, which
        leads to container corrosion. </p>
      <p>A need exists in the art for a low level waste encapsulation
        technology that connotes relatively high strength and low
        porosity to the final product, and which also sets up at low
        temperatures. The final product must exhibit low leachability
        and high durability in aqueous systems. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to overcome many of the
        disadvantages of the prior art in the encapsulation and
        stabilization of mixed low-level wastes. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a ceramic
        to encapsulate and stabilize mixed low-level wastes. A feature
        of the invention is the utilization of readily available
        materials. An advantage of the invention is the low cost of
        production of these ceramics. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method for using chemically bonded phosphate ceramics to
        stabilize mixed waste forms. A feature of the present invention
        is the fabrication of these ceramics at room temperatures. An
        advantage of the present invention is that the low temperature
        setting characteristics of these ceramics makes them suitable
        for stabilization of mixed wastes containing volatile compounds,
        without the generation of secondary waste streams. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method for producing phosphate ceramics for use as waste
        stabilizers. A feature of the present invention is the
        fabrication of these ceramics via acid-base reactions between an
        inorganic oxide and a phosphate-containing acid solution. An
        advantage of the present invention is the ability to treat both
        solid and liquid wastes, while also obviating the need for high
        temperature vitrification processes, and therefore reducing the
        costs of final waste forms production. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide for a
        method to minimize bulk of final waste forms. A feature of the
        present invention is the utilization of liquid and/or solid
        waste fractions to produce chemically bonded ceramic forms. An
        advantage of the invention is the economic and environmental
        savings of bulk reduction. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the present invention provides for a method to
        stabilize solid and liquid waste at room temperature comprising
        grinding the solid waste to a predetermined particle size,
        combining the now ground solid waste with a starter oxide to
        obtain a powder, contacting the powder with an acid solution to
        create a slurry, said acid solution containing the liquid waste,
        mixing the slurry while maintaining the slurry below a
        predetermined temperature, shaping the now-mixed slurry into a
        predetermined form, and allowing the now-formed slurry to set. </p>
      <p>The invention also provides for a method to encapsulate and
        stabilize waste containing cesium comprising combining the waste
        with Zr(OH).sub.4 to create a solid-phase mixture, grinding said
        solid-phase mixture, mixing phosphoric acid with the solid-phase
        mixture to create a slurry, shaping the now-mixed slurry into a
        predetermined form, subjecting the now-shaped slurry to
        pressure; and allowing the now pressurized slurry to set. </p>
      <p>In addition, the invention provides for a method to stabilize
        liquid waste comprising supplying a powder containing magnesium,
        sodium and phosphate in predetermined proportions, mixing said
        powder with the liquid waste to produce a slurry, forming the
        slurry into a predetermined shape, and allowing the now-shaped
        slurry to set. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention addresses the need to develop benign final waste
        forms for a wide variety of waste streams, said waste streams
        containing pyrophorics, volatiles, such as mercury, lead,
        cadmium, chromium, and nickel, and other unstable compounds
        which cannot be treated by conventional high temperature
        techniques such as vitrification. The invention is also
        applicable to stabilize secondary waste streams resulting from
        thermal treatment processes, such as vitrification and plasma
        hearth processes. </p>
      <p>The invention also can be used to stabilize certain RCRA
        organics. The inventors have found that certain of these
        organics do not retard the setting of phosphate ceramics. In one
        scenario, organics such as naphthalene and dichlorobenzene are
        trapped in activated carbon which in turn is stabilized in the
        phosphate matrix by the method claimed herein. This method of
        stabilization can be utilized in situations wherein mixed waste
        contains trace amounts of organics such as polychlorinated
        biphenyls, dioxin, dichlorobenzene, naphthalene, among others.
        As such, the invented method is superior to encapsulation
        methods wherein cement is utilized, in that cement cannot
        stabilize in the presence of organics. </p>
      <p>Ash waste may be consolidated by this process to 80 volume
        percent of its original volume. Experiments by the inventors
        show good reaction and bonding between amorphous and reactive
        silica from fly ash and bottom ash with phosphate matrix.
        Formation of hard silico-phosphate bonds via this reaction can
        be used for the stabilization of hazardous silica compounds such
        as asbestos. The invention also encapsulates and stabilizes
        silica based filter aids, such as vermiculites and perlites,
        which are used in the removal of contaminants from liquid waste
        streams. </p>
      <p>The inventors have identified a number of phosphate systems,
        which form into hard ceramics via chemical bonding, that can
        stabilize contaminants by both chemical and physical means. The
        process needs no thermal treatment, resulting in waste
        stabilization being done economically on site and without
        capital intensive equipment and transportation costs. </p>
      <p>The room-temperature setting phosphate ceramic waste forms are
        formulated by using a route of acid-base reactions. Oxides or
        hydroxides of various elements are used as starter powders for
        this purpose. Said oxides and hydroxides chemically react with
        phosphoric acid or soluble acid phosphates to form ceramics.
        When waste is mixed with these powders or acid components, the
        waste also participates to form various stable phases in the
        final reaction product which then may be set into ceramic waste
        forms. </p>
      <p>In one instance, the acid-base reaction results in the
        formation of the phosphate of MgO (Newberyite) via the following
        equation: </p>
      <p>The acid base reaction also results in the reaction of the
        waste components with the acid or acid-phosphates. These
        reactions lead to chemical solidification of the waste. In
        addition, encapsulation of the waste in the phosphate ceramics
        formed by the reaction products results in physical
        encapsulation of the waste components. </p>
      <p>Several advantages in phosphate waste forms exist viz portland
        cement grout or polymer encapsulation techniques. Since the
        stabilization in chemically bonded ceramics is due to chemical
        solidification as well as physical encapsulation, the leaching
        characteristics of these final waste forms is superior to the
        above-identified waste forms which are dependent on only
        physical encapsulation. The setting in chemically bonded
        ceramics can occur in a wide pH range and hence is not very
        sensitive to pH of the waste. Further, setting reactions are not
        sensitive to ambient temperatures and hence open-field
        stabilization in cold climates is possible. </p>
      <p>The bonds are either ionic or covalent in phosphate ceramics,
        and hence they are stronger than the hydration bonds in portland
        cement thereby providing better strength to the final product. </p>
      <p>The results on chemical stabilization presented infra are very
        general, given that in these acid-base systems, the acid
        phosphates seem to react with the contaminants irrespective of
        the bulk composition of the waste stream. This translates into a
        wide application in the stabilization of different types of
        waste streams. </p>
      <p>Several phosphate systems can be used for the stabilization of
        chemical, radioactive and mixed waste streams. These include,
        but are not limited to, phosphates of Mg, Mg--Na, Al, Ca, Fe and
        Zr. The acid component may be concentrated or dilute phosphoric
        acid or acid phosphate solutions such as dibasic or tribasic
        sodium or aluminum phosphates. The reactions are exothermic and
        require no external heat treatment. However, the paste-setting
        reactions can be controlled either by the addition of boric acid
        to reduce the reaction rate, or by controlling the rate of
        addition of powder to the acid while concomitantly controlling
        the temperature of the reaction vessel. The setting times for
        the pastes formed by the reaction ranges from a few hours to a
        week. The phosphates attain their full strength in approximately
        three weeks. </p>
      <p>The various invented systems include those outlined in Table 1,
        below: </p>

      <p>The five systems disclosed in Table 1 were chosen for ready
        availability of materials, low cost, and availability of
        literature on the materials. </p>
      <p>Three waste streams were selected for treatment: ash waste,
        contaminated cement sludge, and salts dominated by carbonates.
        Each of the waste streams differs in their bulk composition,
        with the bulk compositions forming nearly 91 weight percent of
        the total waste streams. Representative bulk constituents for
        the ash waste stream sample include activated carbon, fly ash,
        coal ash and vermiculite. 3Representative bulk constituents for
        the salt waste include activated carbon, Na.sub.2
        (CO.sub.3).sub.2, widely used cation or anion exchange resins
        (such as Purolite), water, NaCl, Na(NO.sub.3).sub.2, Na.sub.3
        PO.sub.4, Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4. Representative bulk constituents
        for the cement sludge waste include activated carbon, fly ash,
        water, concrete, Plaster of Paris, Haematite (Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3),
        alumina and perlite. </p>
      <p>Each of these waste streams was spiked to a level of
        approximately 0.5 weight percent, with heavy metals, said metals
        added in the form of soluble nitrates. Total nitrate content was
        approximately 7 weight percent of the total waste. The heavy
        metals included Cr, Ni, Pb, and Cd. The invented method can
        stabilize and encapsulate high heavy metal concentrations (for
        example, exceeding 2 percent); however, most metal
        concentrations encountered are one percent or less, with
        economics dictating the reclamation of anything above one
        percent. </p>
      <p>While a myriad of salts are encountered during waste
        processing, the above identified metals were added for
        demonstration purposes via solubilization to the following RCRA
        nitrates: </p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p>RCRA organics added to the three waste streams included
        naphthalene (C.sub.10 H.sub.8), and dichlorobenzene (C.sub.6
        H.sub.4 Cl.sub.2). These organics were added to see their effect
        on the stabilization process. A radionuclide surrogate CsCl was
        also added to each of the three waste mixtures. </p>
      <p>The heavy metals, organics and radionuclide examples disclosed
        above are meant to serve merely as representative of the variety
        of such compounds that could be encapsulated and stabilized,
        given the myriad of mixed waste scenarios to which the invented
        product and method could be applied. </p>
      <p>Oxide and Hydroxide Preparation </p>
      <p>Oxide powders can be pretreated for better reactions with
        acids. One technique includes calcining the powders to a typical
        temperature of between approximately 1,200.degree. C. and
        1,500.degree. C. and more typically 1,300.degree. C. Another
        reaction enhancement technique is washing the powders with
        dilute nitric acid and then water. A myriad of oxide and
        hydroxide powders can be utilized to produce the ceramic system,
        including but not limited to MgO, Al(OH).sub.3, CaO, FeO,
        Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3, Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4 and Zr(OH).sub.4. </p>
      <p>MgO and Al(OH).sub.3 powders are available through any
        commercial supply house, such as Baxter Scientific Products,
        McGaw Park, Ill. Zr(OH).sub.4 is obtained through Atomergic
        Chemetals Corporation, Farmingdale, N.Y. The myriad iron oxides
        enumerated above could actually be supplied as part of the waste
        stream to be stabilized and encapsulated. </p>
      <p>Waste Processing Detail </p>
      <p>Both solid and liquid wastes are treated by the invented
        process of using acid-base reactions. An exemplary process is
        depicted in FIG. 1., designated generally as numeral 10. Solid
        waste 12, such as contaminated ash, cement, medical waste, may
        first be crushed and mixed with the starter powder, 14, (Table
        1, "Starting Materials"), via a vibratory mixer, 16. The
        resulting mixture is then reacted with the solution, 18, (Table
        1, "Solution") to form a slurry or paste. If the waste is a
        liquid, 20, said liquid 20 is mixed with the solution 18 in a
        standard splash mixer 22 and then the mixture is reacted with
        the powder-mix in a reaction chamber 24. </p>
      <p>After reaction, the reaction liquor is allowed to stabilize in
        a stabilization unit 26. The setting or stabilization step 26
        takes from a few hours to a week. Final waste forms 28 are
        obtained in approximately 3 weeks. </p>
      <p>Solid Waste Processing: </p>
      <p>In the solid waste processing scenarios depicted in Table 1,
        the waste streams were manipulated in powder form by grinding
        the waste to an average, preferable approximate particle size of
        8 to 10 micrometers (.mu.m). However, particles can range in
        size from between approximately 4-75 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>Ash and cement wastes can be first mixed with the starter oxide
        or hydroxide powders using a vibratory shaker, or any
        conventional agitator. Weight percentages of the mixture varies
        at this juncture, but can range from between approximately 15
        percent oxide to 50 percent oxide. Typically, an even weight
        percent (50:50) of oxide to solid waste is sought. However, the
        inventors have successfully encapsulated and stabilized
        single-component fly ash at weight percents as high as 85
        percent ash to 15 percent MgO powder, which makes this technique
        particularly attractive for utilities where single-component fly
        ash is a major land-filling problem. </p>
      <p>Unlike ash and cement waste, salt waste is reacted first with
        phosphoric acid to consume the CO.sub.2 that is formed via the
        reaction depicted in equation 2, below, and then mixed with the
        starting powder. Otherwise, the evolution of CO.sub.2 gas during
        stabilization results in very porous ceramic waste forms being
        produced. </p>
      <p>In all three processing scenarios, the resulting powders are
        slowly added to the respective acid solution and thoroughly
        mixed using a mixer. Mixing can occur at ambient temperatures. </p>
      <p>Typically, the rate of powder addition to the acid solution
        should result in the reaction liquor being maintained at less
        than 100.degree. C. Typical times required for controlled mixing
        range from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Mixing times can be shortened
        if the heat from resulting exothermic reactions, associated with
        the above method, is dissipated via reaction vessel cooling. The
        inventors found that reaction vessel cooling is more likely to
        be necessary when the resulting oxide powder-solid waste mixture
        contains less than 50 weight percent of waste. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the reaction can be slowed with the addition of
        from 5 to 25 weight percent of boric acid in the powder, and
        preferably 15 weight percent. </p>
      <p>Upon temperature equilibration, the reacted paste is a liquid
        slurry which sets in a few hours once poured into a mold.
        Typically, no pressure is applied to the now-molded slurry.
        However, in some processing scenarios, such as when
        zirconium-based powders are utilized, discussed infra, pressures
        in the range of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds per square inch are used.
        The slurry gains full strength in approximately one week. </p>
      <p>Mold shapes can vary, depending on the configuration of the
        ultimate deposition site, and can be selected from a myriad of
        geometrical shapes including cuboid, pyramidal, spherical,
        planar, conical, cylindrical, trapezoidal, rectangular, and the
        like. Generally, molds having the shape and size of a typical 55
        gallon drum are used. </p>
      <p>In the case of zirconium phosphate, the slurry is allowed to
        thicken first and then pressed into uniform shapes in a mold at
        low pressures. Set times for zirconium systems are approximately
        3 weeks and requires initial pressure to achieve a dense form.
        While this additional processing time may seem to detract from
        using zirconium phosphate in the invented encapsulation method,
        surprisingly and unexpectedly the inventors have found that this
        phosphate provides orders of magnitude better encapsulation of
        cesium viz-a-viz the other phosphates. For example, while cesium
        leaching results from Mg-Phosphate and Mg--Na phosphate waste
        forms yielded low levels of 11.1 parts per million and 23 parts
        per million respectively, leaching levels obtained when using Zr
        phosphate waste forms were 0.26 parts per million. </p>
      <p>Liquid Waste Forms: </p>
      <p>The invented liquid encapsulation method provides a simplified
        approach for an end user compared to more typical encapsulation
        methods. For example, Mg--Na phosphates systems are made by
        adding said phosphate to the liquid on site, a process similar
        to that practiced in the cement industry. As such, liquid
        wastes, such as tritiated water, are easily and economically
        encapsulated with this procedure. </p>
      <p>If solely liquid is being encapsulated and stabilized by the
        invented method and product, the liquid is first combined with
        an acid, such as phosphoric acid. The inventors have found that
        the ratio of acid to water, selected from a range of between
        approximately 37:63 to 50:50, produces good results. An
        acid:water ratio of 50:50 is most preferred. If the liquid waste
        contains water, then correspondingly less water is added to the
        acid to bring the water weight percent of the liquid waste-acid
        mixture up to 50 percent. The resulting liquid waste-acid
        mixture is then mixed with oxide powder in weight percent ranges
        similar to those outlined above for solid waste processing. When
        using powder mixtures containing MgO and dibasic phosphate,
        weight percent ratios of the oxide to the phosphate selected
        from the range of approximately 87:13 to 77:23 produce good
        results. </p>
      <p>Physical and Mechanical Properties </p>
      <p>The physical properties most relevant to the final waste forms
        are density, porosity and compression strength. Density of the
        samples was measured by determining the mass and geometrical
        volume. Porosity values were obtained by water immersion.
        Compression strength was measured using an Instron.TM. machine
        in compression mode, or other similar compression strength
        machine. The results of these measurements are depicted in Table
        2, below. </p>
      <p>Overall, the product waste forms are light weight materials
        having very low density. Very low porosity in Mg phosphate waste
        forms with ash waste was attained. High loading, in the range of
        approximately 50-80 percent was observed for the Magnesium
        systems. </p>
      <p>Strength of the waste forms in the Mg phosphate system with ash
        waste does not depend on waste loading, and in fact is higher
        than other room temperature setting materials, such as Portland
        Cement (approx. 6,500 vs. 5,750 psi at 50 percent weight loading
        and 7000 vs. 2000 psi at 70 percent). All of these values well
        exceed the minimum statutory land disposal compression value of
        500 psi for final waste forms. </p>

      <p>Leaching Detail </p>
      <p>All of the invented phosphate systems are very effective in
        stabilizing heavy metal contaminants. As Table 3, depicts below,
        a comparison between the leaching levels for the untreated waste
        and the stabilized samples shows that the leaching levels in the
        stabilized waste are by an order of magnitude lower than those
        for the untreated waste. The data also show that the leaching
        values, even at a high loading of 70 weight percent, are from
        one to two orders of magnitude below the regulatory limits
        established for these metals. </p>
      <p>The superior immobilization is due to the chemical
        stabilization of the contaminants in the matrix. This chemical
        stabilization results from the reaction between contaminant
        metal salts and the acid solution, followed by the physical
        encapsulation within the dense phosphate matrix. The nitrates of
        heavy metals are converted to insoluble phosphates by chemical
        reactions and hence they do not leach into the acidic leachate
        water used in the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure
        (TCLP) of the EPA. The physical encapsulation also immobilizes
        the contaminants in the matrix, thereby providing an excellent
        final waste form for long term storage. </p>

      <p>Immersion Detail </p>
      <p>Immersion studies indicate that the phosphate waste forms are
        durable in aqueous environments. Samples were immersed in
        distilled water and periodically the water was replenished to
        compensate for evaporation loss. Periodic measurements were made
        whereby the samples were removed from the water, dried and
        weighed to observe any weight loss. The pH of the water was also
        measured. At the end of 90 days, specimens were tested for
        compression strength. Results of weight change, pH and
        compression strength of Mg-phosphate ash waste forms at the end
        of 90 days are shown in FIGS. 2-4, respectively. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows the weight change of Mg-phosphate specimens with
        70 weight percent ash waste loading after 90 days immersion
        compared to the weight of the waste form at the beginning of the
        immersion study. After an initial weight loss, probably due to
        the release of free phosphoric acid and unreacted MgO, the waste
        form stabilized. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 depicts pH changes, with the curve depicted therein
        similar to that of FIG. 2. The initial drop in pH is again due
        to phosphoric acid release, with a later rebound due to the
        slower release of MgO. Once the excess acid and unreacted MgO
        were completely released, the pH and weight of the waste form
        stabilized. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows the variation in the compression strength of the
        Mg-Phosphate waste forms as a function of waste loading. For
        comparison purposes, the strength of just-fabricated
        Mg-phosphate waste forms that were not exposed to water is
        presented. FIG. 4 shows that all of the Mg-phosphate waste forms
        exhibited excellent strength viz the 500 psi requirements for
        land-fill final forms. The resultant strength of all of the
        waste forms was exceptionally good and satisfied the regulatory
        requirements after a 90-day exposure in an aqueous environment.
      </p>
      <p>Microstructure and Reaction Mechanism </p>
      <p>The structure of the final waste forms is complex. Scanning
        Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis reveals that the
        room-tempera-ture stabilized Mg-phosphate ash waste forms are
        both crystalline and noncrystalline. Both crystalline and
        noncrystalline phases contain Mg phosphates and silicates,
        perhaps evidence of the presence of phospho-silicate structures.
      </p>
      <p>X-ray diffraction analysis done on ash waste forms of Mg and Zr
        phosphate suggest that Mg phosphate waste forms contain
        unreacted MgO while the reaction in Zr phosphate is complete.
        The formation of phosphate phases is due to a MgO surface
        reaction with phosphoric acid, wherein the core portion of the
        MgO grains remains unscathed. </p>
      <p>The major crystalline phase observed in the Mg phosphate system
        is Newberyite (MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O), an insoluble stable
        phase. The major phase in Zr phosphate is either zirconium
        phosphate or a hydrophosphate of zirconium. </p>
      <p>The fact that the compression strength of the ash waste forms
        in Mg phosphate systems does not depend on the extent of ash
        loading indicates that ash waste itself participates in the
        stabilization process. NMR studies reveal that ash loading
        modifies the mineralogy of the Mg phosphate matrix. Such a
        result makes the Mg phosphate system very suitable for
        stabilization of ash waste streams. </p>
      <p>SEM analysis of Mg phosphate ash waste forms indicates that
        contaminates in the final waste forms are well dispersed both in
        the crystalline and well as noncrystalline phases. These data
        coincide with the results obtained by the inventors whereby any
        variations in the formulations of crystalline or noncrystalline
        phases due to variations in waste stream composition will not
        effect contaminant distribution. Generally, the inventors found
        that the phosphate waste resins microencapsulate contaminants
        very effectively in a homogeneous distribution in a complex
        matrix. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>Magnesium Phosphate Ceramic </p>
      <p>Magnesium oxide powder of approximately 8 micron size was first
        calcined for one hour at 1,300.degree. C. 15 weight percent of
        boric acid was added to this powder and mixed well. The mixture
        was then reacted with 50 weight percent dilute phosphoric acid.
        The addition was done slowly by constantly stirring the powder
        into the solution. The resulting paste was either put in a mold
        to set or was pressed into a hard ceramic during its setting. </p>
      <p>To make a waste form, ash surrogate waste in powder form (with
        particle size of approximately 8 microns) was added to the oxide
        powder. The ratio of powder to the waste was 65:35 by weight in
        this test. The surrogate waste used in these experiments was a
        mixture of fly ash (Class F), coal cinder ash and vermiculite as
        the major component, and activated carbon as a minor component.
        The fly ash content was 40 weight percent, coal cinder ash 33
        weight percent and vermiculite content was 20 weight percent.
        Thus, these three constituents formed 93 weight percent of the
        total surrogate composition. Trace contaminants used were RCRA
        metal nitrates and organics. The concentrations of the metal
        nitrates were such that the metal concentration in the surrogate
        waste was 0.5 weight percent of each metal. Each of the organics
        was also 0.5 weight percent of the final waste form. </p>
      <p>The samples were cured for at least one week. They were
        subjected to various tests. They were found stable in water
        immersion tests. Their strength was 2,923 psi and concentrations
        of heavy metals in TCLP test leachates were 1.64 ppm of Cd, 0.05
        ppm of Cr, 9.63 ppm of Ni and &lt;0.1 ppm of Pb. These values
        are well below the EPA's pass/fail tests for Cd, Cr and Pb of 1
        ppm, 5 ppm and 5 ppm, respectively. The levels for organics were
        below the detection limit of 5 ppm for both naphthalene and
        dichlorobenzene. In as much as the minimum compression strength
        for a waste form is 500 psi, the magnesium phosphate waste forms
        generated herewith the invented method exceeds such requirement.
      </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Magnesium Sodium Phosphate </p>
      <p>The starter MgO powder was washed with 0.28M nitric acid
        solution, then by distilled water and dried. Considerable
        amounts of hydroxide was formed in the powder as a result of the
        washings and this hydroxide reacted with acids to form
        phosphates. Beyond this, the procedure followed herein was the
        same as that in Example 1. The compressive strength observed was
        2561.4 psi and TCLP results were 0.03 ppm for Cd, 0.05 ppm for
        Cr. 0.05 ppm for Ni and &lt;0.1 ppm for Pb. The levels of
        organics in the leachate were below &lt;5 ppm for both
        dichlorobenzene and naphthalene. These results show that the
        magnesium sodium phosphate waste form meets regulatory
        requirements. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>Zirconium Phosphate </p>
      <p>Zirconium hydroxide was the starter powder used. It was reacted
        with 90 wt % concentrated (or 10 wt % diluted) phosphoric acid.
        The reaction yielded a paste which took approximately 3 weeks to
        set into a hard ceramic. The waste form was prepared by the
        method given in Example 1 and the same test procedures were
        followed. Compression strength was 6781.6 psi, the levels in the
        leachate for Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb were 0.07 ppm, 0.16 ppm, 11 ppm
        and &lt;0.1 ppm. The levels for organics were &lt;5 ppm. This
        shows that Zr-phosphate waste forms meet regulatory
        requirements. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method for producing structural
        materials and, more specifically, this invention relates to a
        method for producing structural products by binding benign
        wastes with a ceramic binder. The method is also applicable to
        producing a near term containment material. </p>
      <p><b>2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The amount of available landfill space continues to dwindle. To
        preserve remaining space, recycling programs have been
        implemented to separate out reusable waste materials from
        materials that cannot be recycled, often at considerable
        expense. Despite these efforts, tipping fees continue to
        escalate, particularly because tremendous amounts of
        unrecyclable waste are still generated. Some examples of this
        waste include lumber waste, styrofoam, various kinds of
        cellulose fiber, automobile tires, ashes, used carpet backing,
        mineral wastes, and plastics. Ash, typically generated from
        incinerators, has extremely high disposal costs, partially due
        to the presence of heavy metals. Inked substrates, such as
        colored paper, colored fabrics, and synthetic fabrics pose
        recyclability problems. In addition to not being recyclable,
        many waste forms, such as plastics, or polymeric materials, also
        are not biodegradable. </p>
      <p>A myriad of applications exist to convert many of these waste
        forms into usable products. However, many of the current methods
        incorporate organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, in
        polymeric binders. For example, organic binders are flammable,
        give off noxious fumes during setting, and have limited
        long-term stability. They are also expensive. Such methods are
        therefore unsuitable for housing applications. </p>
      <p>Methods for encapsulating small amounts of low-level mixed
        wastes using ceramic binders also has been considered. However,
        those processes also are not suitable, primarily because they
        require high weight ratios of ceramic binder to waste forms. The
        inventors have found that high concentrations of binder leads to
        undesirably fast curing times, and therefore reduces the
        flowability characteristics of the slurry that are required for
        application in structural component and insulation substrate
        applications. Also, a high weight ratio of binder to waste
        particles connotes higher costs in that the space and economic
        advantages of disposing large volumes of benign waste with small
        amounts of binder are not realized. </p>
      <p>A method for encapsulating waste using phosphate-containing
        material also is known in the art (U.S. Pat. No. Re. 32,329 to
        Paszner et al.). However, that process is relegated to porous
        vegetable matter, such as sugarcane, plant stalks and wood. The
        process also is designed to facilitate rapid setting of the
        final product, which is the antithesis of rendering a blowable
        or flowable mixture for use as a structural support or
        insulation product. </p>
      <p>A need exists in the art for a method to utilize or otherwise
        dispose of nonrecyclable and non-biodegradable, benign waste
        without generating secondary waste streams. The method must be
        economical in providing structural materials for use in housing.
        A need also exists for an inexpensive structural product which
        is partially comprised of benign waste. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to overcome many of
        the disadvantages of the prior art in the utilization of benign
        waste forms. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a
        method for utilizing benign waste. A feature of the invention is
        encapsulating and shaping the benign waste using a binder
        material. An advantage of the invention is conserving valuable
        landfill space. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        method for producing a structural material. A feature of the
        invention is encapsulating benign waste using a nontoxic binder
        material. An advantage of the invention is utilizing the now
        encapsulated benign waste as safe insulative material and
        fire-proof material in housing and other structures. Another
        advantage of the invention is that the method does not emit
        noxious materials and therefore is safe for operators and end
        users. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method
        for producing light-weight structural materials. A feature of
        the invention is the room-temperature encapsulation of large
        amounts of widely available wastes with relatively smaller
        amounts of an inorganic binder. An advantage of the invention is
        that it is an inexpensive process to utilize nonrecyclable waste
        material in blowable or pumpable preparations for ultimate use
        as housing materials. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a
        structural material partially comprised of benign waste. A
        feature of the invention is a high volume percent of waste to
        binder material. An advantage of the invention is the production
        of light weight, strong structural materials that can supplant
        traditional materials. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a method
        for producing a near-term containment material. A feature of the
        invention is using high weight ratios of the containment
        material to the invented binder. An advantage of the invented
        method is the ability to confine the near-term containment
        material to desired mold shapes or structures until most
        activity is reduced or dissipated. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the invention provides for a method to produce
        structural products from benign waste comprising calcining an
        inorganic oxide, mixing the now-calcined oxide with a powdered
        acid to produce a mixture, contacting the mixture with
        phosphoric acid to produce an acid solution, mixing the acid
        solution with waste particles to produce a slurry or a wet mix,
        and allowing the slurry or mix to cure. </p>
      <p>The invention also provides for a structural material
        comprising waste particles, and an inorganic binder enveloping
        the waste particles. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b> </p>
      <p>These and other objects and advantages of the present invention
        will become readily apparent upon consideration of the following
        detailed description and attached drawing, wherein: </p>
      <p><b>Fig. 1</b>&nbsp; is a schematic diagram of a method for
        producing ceramic bonded waste forms using benign material. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The method described herein produces ceramically bound benign
        wastes for use as structural materials. Unlike previous attempts
        to produce stable structural materials from bulk waste, the
        instant process produces an amorphous, more flowable material by
        utilizing lower volume percents of binder to formulate the final
        forms. The resulting ceramic formulation is sufficiently
        amorphous and low in crystalline properties to insure good flow
        of the material and extended work time. The amorphous phase
        mimics polymeric formulations by facilitating the encapsulation
        of waste particles with binder during formation of the final
        slurry. </p>
      <p>A myriad of benign wastes are utilized to produce the
        structural materials, including, but not limited to, lumber
        wastes, styrofoam, various cellulose fibers (including those
        fibers having colored ink), tires, textile wastes, ashes, carpet
        backing, mineral wastes, plastics and other solid materials that
        cease to be useful. These wastes are used in powder or shredded
        forms and are solidified by using a phosphate binder to form
        desired shapes for use in the construction industry. Products
        produced from the method include blowable insulation, particle
        boards, packaging materials, bricks, tiles, wall-forms and
        engineered barrier and shield systems. </p>
      <p>The room-temperature setting phosphate ceramic waste forms are
        formulated by using a route of acid-base reactions. Oxides or
        hydroxides of various elements are used as starter powders for
        this purpose. Said oxides and hydroxides chemically react with
        phosphoric acid or soluble acid phosphates to form ceramics.
        When waste is mixed with these powders or acid components, the
        waste also may participate to form various stable phases in the
        final reaction product which then may be set into ceramic waste
        forms. </p>
      <p>In one instance, the acid-base reaction results in the
        formation of the phosphate of MgO (Newberyite) via the following
        equation: </p>
      <p>The acid base reaction also results in the reaction of the
        waste components with the acid or acid-phosphates. These
        reactions lead to chemical solidification of the waste. In
        addition, encapsulation of the waste in the phosphate ceramics
        formed by the reaction products results in physical
        encapsulation of the waste components. </p>
      <p>Oxide and Hydroxide Preparation </p>
      <p>Oxide powders can be pretreated for better reactions with
        acids. One technique includes calcining the powders to a typical
        temperature of between approximately 1,200.degree. C. and
        1,500.degree. C. and more typically 1,300.degree. C. Another
        reaction enhancement technique is washing the powders with
        dilute nitric acid and then water. A myriad of oxide and
        hydroxide powders can be utilized to produce the ceramic system,
        including but not limited to MgO, Al(OH).sub.3, CaO, FeO,
        Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3, Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4 and Zr(OH).sub.4, ZrO, and
        TiO.sub.2 and crushed dibasic sodium phosphate crystals mixed
        with MgO. </p>
      <p>MgO and Al(OH).sub.3 powders are available through any
        commercial supply house, such as Baxter Scientific Products,
        McGaw Park, Ill. Zr(OH).sub.4 is obtained through Atomergic
        Chemetals Corporation, Farmingdale, N.Y. </p>
      <p>A generic embodiment of the invented method is depicted in FIG.
        1 as numeral 10. First, a supply of oxide 12 is subjected to
        either or both a calcining pretreatment step 14 and a boric acid
        addition step 16. Both steps serve to slow down the reaction
        mechanism. Generally, the boric acid is incorporated when a
        slower reaction is required, for example when extended
        workability of the material is desired. The inventors have found
        that the boric acid forms a glassy phase that coats the oxide
        particles so that the oxide cannot as readily react with
        phosphoric acid. </p>
      <p>As discussed supra, a myriad of oxides can be used in the
        invented method. Any mixing of the oxide with the boric acid is
        strictly controlled to maintain an optimum weight percent of
        constituents of the resulting dry mixture. This weight percent
        is selected from a range of between approximately 5 weight
        percent boric acid to the oxide to 15 percent boric acid to the
        oxide. A preferable weight percent is 10 percent boric acid to
        oxide, e.g., 10 grams of boric acid for every 90 grams of oxide,
        to form the dry mixture. </p>
      <p>The resulting dry mixture 18 is then mixed with between
        approximately 50 to 60 weight percent dilute phosphoric acid 20
        to form an acid solution or binder 22. A preferable weight
        percent is at or below 55 percent, i.e., 55 grams of dry mixture
        to 45 grams of 50 percent dilute phosphoric acid, so as to
        facilitate flowability of the resulting solution. Concentrated
        acid tends to make the reaction more intense. This results in a
        thick slurry developing which is not conducive to coating the
        particles. </p>
      <p>Waste particles, 24, which may be subjected to a pretreatment
        sizing process 23, are then thoroughly mixed with the binder.
        The mixing step 26 ensures that the waste particles are
        completely encapsulated or coated with binder. The resulting
        slurry is molded into desired shapes 28 under no pressure or
        under small pressure (approximately 1,000 pounds per square
        inch), depending on the waste material being bonded. For
        example, processes for encapsulating wood waste often requires
        the aid of pressurization, primarily because wood surfaces
        participate less in the ceramic formation reaction. Rather,
        bonding in such cases is purely from the phosphate phase
        encapsulating the wood particles. Compression also may be
        required to attain desired strengths of final products, such as
        in particle board manufacture. </p>
      <p>Solid Waste Processing: </p>
      <p>In solid waste processing scenarios, the waste streams are
        often manipulated in powder form by grinding the waste to an
        average, preferable approximate particle size of 8 to 10
        micrometers (.mu.m). However, particles can range in size from
        between approximately 4-75 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>Ash and cement wastes can be first mixed with the starter oxide
        or hydroxide powders using a vibratory shaker, or any
        conventional agitator. Weight percentages of the mixture varies
        at this juncture, but can range from between approximately 15
        percent oxide to 50 percent oxide. Typically, an even weight
        percent (50:50) of oxide to solid waste is sought. However, the
        inventors have successfully encapsulated and stabilized
        single-component fly ash at weight percents as high as 85
        percent ash to 15 percent MgO powder, which makes this technique
        particularly attractive for utilities where single-component fly
        ash is a major land-filling problem. </p>
      <p>Typically, the rate of powder addition to the acid solution
        should result in the reaction liquor being maintained at less
        than 100.degree. C. Typical times required for controlled mixing
        range from 30 minutes to 1 hour. Mixing times can be shortened
        if the heat from resulting exothermic reactions, associated with
        the above method, is dissipated via reaction vessel cooling. The
        inventors found that reaction vessel cooling is more likely to
        be necessary when the resulting oxide powder-solid waste mixture
        contains less than 50 weight percent of waste. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the reaction can be slowed with the addition of
        from 5 to 25 weight percent of boric acid in the powder, and
        preferably 10 weight percent. </p>
      <p>Upon temperature equilibration, the reacted paste is a liquid
        slurry which sets in a few hours once poured into a mold.
        Typically, his slurry is mixed with shredded waste and put into
        a mold. </p>
      <p>Mold shapes can vary, depending on the configuration of the
        ultimate deposition site, and can be selected from a myriad of
        geometrical shapes including cuboid, pyramidal, spherical,
        planar, conical, cylindrical, trapezoidal, rectangular, and the
        like. </p>
      <p>Liquid Waste Forms </p>
      <p>Sludges and benign wastes with high water content can be
        incorporated or bound using this binder system by appropriate
        modification to the water content in the acid. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that the volume of the loading of the
        wastes in the final product can range from between approximately
        50-90 volume percent. For insulation and building reinforcement
        applications, the composition of the mixture is adjusted to
        convert it into a pumpable slurry (50 volume percent waste) or a
        blowable particle mixture (80-90 volume percent waste) so as to
        facilitate the filling of cavities. </p>
      <p>The acid-base reaction between the oxide and phosphoric acid
        results in the formation of phosphates on the surface of the
        particles thereby encapsulating individual particles with a thin
        layer of impermeable phosphate binder. This results in a
        structural product in which particles of the waste are protected
        by the binder to provide not only product strength but also
        confers resistance to fire, chemical attack, humidity and other
        weathering conditions. </p>
      <p>Several advantages of the resulting embodiment exist over
        commercially available polymer-based binders. Unlike polymer
        binders, phosphate binders are nonflammable. Also, several
        polymer ingredients are occupational hazards, whereas inorganic
        phosphate binders are comparatively safe. No toxic chemicals or
        vapors are released during production of phosphate bonded
        products. Lastly, phosphate based binder improves the rigidity
        and long-term stability to the structural product, compared to
        currently used organic binders. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>Styrofoam Insulation </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that utilizing the above-disclosed
        method, styrofoam particles are completely coated with a thin,
        impermeable layer of the phosphate binder phase. The uniform
        coating of the styrofoam particles not only provides structural
        stability but also confers resistance to fire, chemical attack,
        humidity and other weathering conditions. As shown in Table 1,
        below, these characteristics are superior to more typical
        insulation materials. </p>
      <p>TABLE 1 ______________________________________ Comparison of
        ceramic-bonded Styrofoam insulation to Fiber Glass- and
        Cellulose-insulation Bonded Key Features Styrofoam Fiberglass

        ______________________________________ </p>
      <p>As depicted in Table 1, the resulting binder-covered styrofoam
        material provided superior R values. For example, thermal
        conductivity measurements, utilizing a modified radial hot-wire
        technique (established by Anter Laboratories, Pittsburgh, Pa.)
        showed that the thermal resistance of the material produced via
        the invented method was approximately 4.5 hour square foot
        degrees Fahrenheit per British Thermal Unit (h.ft..sup.2
        .degree.F./BTU, compared to 2-3 h.ft..sup.2 .degree.F./BTU for
        fiber glass and 3-3.5 h.ft..sup.2 .degree.F./BTU for cellulose.
        This superior R value indicates that phosphate ceramic
        binder-covered styrofoam provides superior energy savings when
        used as an insulation product. </p>
      <p>Insulation products often are susceptible to humidity and tend
        to sag, thereby loosing their structural integrity over time.
        The invented material was subjected to an aging test pursuant to
        ASTM D 2126 (ASTM=American Society for Testing and Materials),
        whereby the material is exposed to severe environments for
        extended periods of time with dimension changes of the material
        closely monitored. The material was exposed to 38.degree. C.
        temperatures at 98 percent humidity for 3 weeks. Specimen volume
        change was shown to be approximately two percent after a two
        week period. This compares to 20 percent for cellulose
        insulation material and is also superior to that seen in
        fiberglass material. </p>
      <p>Generally, a wide range of waste particle sizes can be utilized
        when producing structural products using the invented method.
        When using styrofoam materials, optimal results are obtained
        when particle sizes ranging from 2 millimeters to 5 millimeters
        are used, and when the particles are mixed with binder in a
        weight ratio of 1:2. Optimal weight loading of the styrofoam in
        the final product is approximately 7.5 weight percent, which
        corresponds to approximately 85 to 90 volume percent of the
        final product. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Wood Waste </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that when wood waste is subjected to
        the invented method, particle board having superior flexural
        strength values is produced. For example, samples containing 50
        weight percent of wood and 50 weight percent of binder display
        approximately 1,500 psi in flexural strength. Samples containing
        60 weight percent and 70 weight percent of wood exhibit flexural
        strengths of 400 psi and 300 psi, respectively. </p>
      <p>Generally, suitably sized wood particles range from between
        approximately 1 and 5 millimeters (mm) long, 1 mm thick and 2 to
        3 mm wide. </p>
      <p>In addition, once the wood and binder is thoroughly mixed, the
        samples are subjected to pressurized molding on the order of
        approximately 2650 psi, and for approximately 30 to 90 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>The disclosed process is not be construed as limited to the
        above examples. Also, aside from the myriad of wastes listed
        above for which this process can be used to encapsulate, other
        waste streams are also sufficiently stabilized herewith. For
        example, potliner residue, Bayer sands, ashes generated at plant
        sites and any other mining refuse can be stabilized by this
        process and utilized as structural components. Potliner residue,
        when combined with magnesium phosphate hexahydrate in a 50:50
        weight proportion, yields a ceramic form having a density of 2.9
        grams per cubic centimeter, a porosity of 2.17 percent and a
        compressive strength of 4,210 psi, the last of which is
        comparable to portland cement forms. Consistent with data
        disclosed supra, when higher proportions (60 weight percent) of
        waste material (in this instance potliner residue) is used,
        desired values degraded slightly from those values obtained when
        50 weight percent loadings were used. Density decreased to 2.0
        grams per cubic centimeter, porosity increased to 2.6 percent
        and compression strength decreased to 3,402 psi. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described with reference to
        details of the illustrated embodiment, these details are not
        intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the
        appended claims. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract: </b>Known phosphate ceramic formulations are
        improved and the ability to produce iron-based phosphate ceramic

        metal ions are more stable and/or reactive with the phosphate
        ions, resulting in the formation of insoluble metal species

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the use of chemically bonded
        phosphate ceramic (CBPC) waste forms for immobilizing large
        volumes of low-level, radioactive and/or hazardous waste, and,
        in particular, to an improved process and CBPC product. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Low-level mixed wastes contain hazardous chemical and low-level
        radioactive materials. Of particular concern are low-level mixed
        waste streams that contain heavy metals, such as lead, cadmium,
        copper, zinc, nickel, and iron, among others, and waste streams
        from nuclear materials processing applications that contain
        technetium-99, chromium, and antimony. The U.S. Environmental
        Protection Agency classifies waste as hazardous, under the
        Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), if excessive
        amounts of heavy metals leach from the waste during the Toxicity
        Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). Land disposal of
        leachable heavy metal waste is very expensive and strictly
        regulated, and therefore cost-effective, safe, leach resistant
        methods for encapsulating heavy metal waste is of current
        environmental importance. </p>
      <p>Stabilization of low-level mixed waste requires that the
        contaminants, including soluble heavy metals ions, are
        effectively immobilized. No single solidification and
        stabilization technology is known to successfully treat and
        dispose of low-level mixed waste, due to the physical and
        chemical diversity of the waste streams. Conventional
        high-temperature waste treatment methods (e.g., incineration,
        vitrification) are largely unsuitable for the treatment of
        low-level mixed waste streams, because their reliance on high
        temperature risks the release of volatile contaminants and they
        generate undesirable secondary waste streams. A low-temperature
        approach is to stabilize hazardous waste by using inorganic
        (e.g., pozzolanic) binders, such as cement, lime, kiln dust,
        and/or fly ash. Disadvantages of this approach include a high
        sensitivity to the presence of impurities, high porosity, and
        low waste loading volume. Organic binders (e.g., thermosetting
        polymers) are used even less frequently, because of cost and
        greater complexity of application. Organic binders are not
        compatible with water-based wastes, unless the waste is first
        pre-treated and converted to an emulsion or solid, and organic
        binders are subject to deterioration from environmental factors,
        including biological action and exposure to ultraviolet light. </p>
      <p>Recently, an alternative low-temperature approach has been
        developed at Argonne National Laboratory for stabilizing and
        solidifying low-level mixed waste by incorporating or loading
        the waste into a phosphate ceramic waste form. This technique
        immobilizes the waste by solidification, such that the waste is
        physically micro-encapsulated within the dense matrix of the
        phosphate ceramic waste form, and stabilizes the waste by
        converting the waste into their insoluble phosphate forms.
        Ceramic encapsulation systems are particularly attractive given
        that the bonds formed in these systems are ether ionic or
        covalent, and hence stronger than the hydration bonds in cement
        systems. Also, the ceramic formulation process is exothermic and
        economical. </p>
      <p>Phosphates are particularly good candidates for stabilization
        of radioactive and hazardous waste, because phosphates of radio
        nuclides and hazardous metals are essentially insoluble in
        groundwater. A salient feature of the low-temperature ceramic
        phosphate formulation process is an acid-base reaction. For
        example, magnesium phosphate ceramic waste forms have been
        produced by reacting magnesium oxide (MgO) with phosphoric acid
        to form a phosphate of magnesium oxide, Newberyite, as
        represented in Equation (1), below. </p>
      <p>The acid-base reaction results in the reaction of the waste
        components with the acid or acid-phosphates, leading to chemical
        stabilization of the waste. In addition, encapsulation of the
        waste in the phosphate ceramic results in physical containment
        of the waste components. The reaction represented by Equation
        (1) above occurs rapidly and generates heat, and upon
        evaporation of the water, a porous ceramic product results. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,518 issued to Wagh, et al., incorporated
        herein by reference, describes in detail the process steps for
        setting liquid or solid waste in CBPC products using acid-base
        reactions. Accordingly, the process involves mixing ground solid
        waste, including salt waste spiked with heavy metals, with a
        starter powder of oxide and hydroxide powders of various

        solution of phosphoric acid or soluble acid phosphates;
        thoroughly mixing the waste-powder-acid mixture for about a half

        C.), such that the components of the </p>
      <p>mixture chemically react to form stable phases and a reacted
        viscous slurry or paste results; and allowing the slurry or
        paste to set for a few hours into the final CBPC product. Liquid
        waste is similarly stabilized by mixing the liquid waste with
        the acid solution (preferably 50:50), and then reacting the
        waste-acid mixture with the starting powders. The maximum
        temperature for the process is about 80.degree. C. The CBPC
        products attain full strength in about three weeks, and exhibit
        a complex structure, including a major crystalline phase, e.g.,
        Newberyite (MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O), and an insoluble, stable
        phase. The waste components are generally homogeneously
        distributed within the phosphate ceramic matrix. Unfortunately,
        however, the porous product (Newberyite) is unsuitable for waste
        treatment on a large scale. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,815 issued to Wagh, et al., incorporated
        herein by reference, describes improving the CBPC fabrication
        process by incorporating two temperature control processes for
        both reducing heat generation during the encapsulation
        (reaction) steps and moderating pH conditions (some wastes are
        unstable at a low pH). The first temperature control process
        involves pre-treating the phosphoric acid with a carbonate,
        bicarbonate or hydroxide of a monovalent metal (e.g., K, Na, Li,
        Rb) prior to mixing with an oxide or hydroxide powder so as to
        buffer the acid. In particular, potassium containing alkali
        compounds (e.g., K.sub.2 O, KHCO.sub.3, KOH) result in a more
        crystalline waste form, and the higher the concentration of
        potassium in the potassium containing compound, the more
        crystalline the final product, resulting in a higher compression
        strength, lower porosity, and greater resistance to weathering,
        compressive forces, and leaching. The second temperature control
        process involves bypassing the use of the acid and mixing the
        oxide powder with dihydrogen phosphates of potassium, sodium,
        lithium, or other monovalent alkali metal, to form a ceramic at
        a higher pH. </p>
      <p>Neutralizing the phosphoric acid solution in equation (1) by
        adding potassium hydroxide (KOH), as represented in the chemical
        equation (2) below, reduces the reaction rate and heat
        generation, and results in the formation of a superior magnesium
        potassium phosphate (MKP) mineral product, MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2
        O (magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate), as represented in
        chemical equation (3) below. </p>
      <p>The chemically bonded ceramic phosphate (CBPC) waste form (e.g,
        MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O) is a dense, hard material with excellent
        durability and a high resistance to fire, chemicals, humidity,
        and weather. The low-temperature (e.g., room-temperature)
        process encapsulates chloride and nitrate salts, along with
        hazardous metals, in magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP)
        ceramics, with salt waste loadings of up to between
        approximately 70 weight percent and approximately 80 weight
        percent. This durable MKP ceramic product has been extensively
        developed and used in U.S. Department of Energy waste treatment
        projects. </p>
      <p>Phosphates in general are able to bind with hazardous metals in
        insoluble complexes over a relatively wide pH range and most
        metal hydroxides have a higher solubility than their
        corresponding phosphate forms. In addition to the magnesium and
        magnesium-potassium phosphate waste products discussed above,
        known waste encapsulating phosphate systems include, but not
        limited to, phosphates of magnesium-ammonium, magnesium-sodium,
        aluminum, calcium, iron, zinc, and zirconium (zirconium is
        preferred for cesium encapsulation). A non-exclusive summary of
        known phosphate systems and processing details is provided in
        Table I below, selected according to the ready availability of
        materials and low cost. It is also known to add other materials
        to either the waste or ceramic binder ingredients, such as fly
        ash. </p>

      <p>Iron oxides including either iron oxide (FeO) itself or
        magnetite (Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4) have also been used in the
        formation of phosphate ceramic products, however, these
        materials are uncommon and expensive. Haematite (Fe.sub.2
        O.sub.3) is a very unreactive powder and efforts to form a
        chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) product using
        haematite have been unsuccessful. When mixed with phosphoric
        acid, and even highly concentrated phosphoric acid, the
        haematite either does not react or reacts at such a slow rate
        that the reaction is impractical for the development of CBPC
        products. The slow rate of reaction is due to the insolubility
        of haematite, which is in its highest oxidation state. </p>
      <p>Appropriate oxide powders include, but are not limited to,
        oxides or hydroxides of aluminum, calcium, iron, magnesium,
        titanium, and zirconium, and combinations thereof. The oxide
        powders may be pre-treated (e.g., heated, calcined, washed) for
        better reactions with the acids. While no pressure is typically
        applied to the reacted paste, about 1,000 to 2,000 pounds per
        square inch may be applied when zirconium-based powders are
        used. </p>
      <p>The acid component may be dilute or concentrated phosphoric
        acid or acid phosphate solutions, such as dibasic or tribasic
        sodium, potassium, or aluminum phosphates, and the paste-setting
        reactions are controllable either by the addition of boric acid
        to reduce the reaction rate, or by adding powder to the acid
        while concomitantly controlling the temperature. Examples of
        appropriate phosphates include phosphates of aluminum,
        beryllium, calcium, iron, lanthanum, magnesium,
        magnesium-sodium, magnesium-potassium, yttrium, zinc, and
        zirconium, and combinations thereof. Salt waste may be reacted
        with phosphoric acid to consume any carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2)
        present, prior to mixing the salt waste with the oxide powders
        or binding powders, as the evolution of CO.sub.2 results in very
        porous final ceramic products. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the acid-base reactions involved in the
        phosphate ceramic systems described above occur very rapidly,
        resulting in the generation of considerable exothermic heat that
        prevents the formation of homogeneous large scale phosphate
        ceramic monoliths. The rapid setting of the CBPC products also
        hinders the proper conversion of hazardous or radioactive
        contaminants into stabilized phosphate forms. As a result, the
        CBPC products formed by methods known in the art have very poor
        density and strength. </p>
      <p>Encapsulation of waste containing heavy metals in known CBPC
        systems is also of limited practical use. Although heavy metals
        in the form of soluble nitrates (e.g.,
        Cr(NO.sub.3).sub.3.9H.sub.2 O, Ni(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O,
        Pb(NO.sub.3).sub.2, and Cd(NO.sub.3).sub.2.4H.sub.2 O) are
        reportedly converted to insoluble phosphates by the CBPC forming
        chemical reactions, there is a critical need to improve their
        leach resistance and to provide greater stabilization for the
        metal anions of technetium-99, chromium, and antimony. Efforts
        to encapsulate heavy metal waste in phosphate ceramic products
        are further hampered by low maximum waste loading capacities,
        because of interference of the metal anions with ceramic-setting
        reactions, leaching of soluble metal anions from the resulting
        highly porous ceramic product (especially in aqueous
        environments), and rapid structural degradation of the ceramic
        product caused by the high leach rates. Also, environmental
        stresses degrade the integrity of known CBPC waste forms over
        time. For example, exposure to repeated cycles of wetting,
        drying and/or freezing, or acidic or other conditions conducive
        to leaching may affect the long term effectiveness of waste
        encapsulated CBPC waste forms. </p>
      <p>A need exists for improved phosphate ceramic systems and
        improved methods for disposing of wastes containing metal anions
        in phosphate ceramic products. </p>
      <p>The present invention is a surprisingly effective process step
        that significantly improves known phosphate ceramic
        formulations, enables the production of iron-based phosphate
        ceramic systems, and critically increases the stabilization of
        wastes containing heavy metals within CBPC composites. The
        invention involves adding oxidants or reductants to the ceramic
        phosphate formulations to retard or accelerate the acid-base
        reactions and thereby control the exothermic temperature of the
        reactions. In addition, the use of reducing agents significantly
        improves the stabilization of the metal anions within the
        phosphate ceramic composition, and thus the leach resistance of
        the encapsulated metals, by changing the valence of the metal to
        a lower oxidation state, such that the metal is more stable in
        the presence of the phosphate ions and/or the metal is more
        reactive with the phosphate ions. </p>
      <p>Therefore, in view of the above, a basic object of the present
        invention is to control the reactions rates and heat generation
        in phosphate ceramic processes to allow homogeneous large scale
        phosphate ceramic monoliths. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to significantly
        improve the density and strength of phosphate ceramic products
        formulated from methods known in the art. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to form chemically
        bonded phosphate ceramic products from inexpensive iron-based
        materials, such as haematite. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an
        improved method for stabilizing waste containing metal anions in
        a phosphate ceramic composite having increased loading capacity
        and improved leach resistance. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide an improved,
        safe, low temperature, economical method for stabilizing large
        volumes of waste containing metal anions in a durable, long term
        storage phosphate ceramic product. </p>
      <p>Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the
        invention are set forth in the description below and/or will
        become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of
        the description below and/or by practice of the invention. The
        objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention may be
        realized and attained by means of instrumentation and
        combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Briefly, this invention is a surprisingly effective method for
        significantly improving phosphate ceramic formulations and
        enabling the production of iron-based phosphate ceramic systems.
        The invention involves the addition of an oxidizing or reducing
        step to known phosphate ceramic formulations during the
        acid-base reactions between the oxide powders and phosphoric
        acid or acid phosphate solutions. The additives allow control of
        the rate of the acid-base reactions and concomitant heat
        generation. As a result, phosphate ceramic systems incorporating
        iron-based materials are practical, including the formation of
        iron phosphate ceramic products from haematite, a readily
        available, inexpensive material. The CBPC products may be
        crystalline ceramics and/or glass (non-crystalline). </p>
      <p>In an alternate embodiment, the addition of reducing agents to
        the ceramic phosphate system significantly improves the
        stabilization of heavy metal waste encapsulated within
        chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) waste forms. Addition
        of the reducing agent, preferably a stannous salt, changes the
        valence of the metal to a lower oxidation state, such that the
        metal is more stable in the presence of the phosphate ions
        and/or the metal is more reactive with the phosphate ions.
        Importantly, the reduced metal ions are more stable and/or more
        reactive with the phosphate ions, resulting in the formation of
        insoluble metal species within the final phosphate ceramic
        matrix. </p>

        well as further objects and advantages thereof, will best be
        understood with reference to the following detailed description

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention modifies known methods for encapsulating
        waste in chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) products,
        described in detail in the Background Section above, by
        incorporating a new and unique oxidation or reducing step that
        controls the rate of the acid-base reaction in the formation of
        phosphate ceramic systems. The addition of the oxidation or
        reducing agent to the CBPC binder mix aids in controlling the
        rate of the acid-base reactions and, importantly, changes the
        oxidation state and/or reactivity of CBPC ingredients, e.g.,
        starter oxide powders. Altering the oxidation state of the
        compound may allow CBPC compounds to become more reactive and
        encapsulated waste to become more reactive and less soluble. </p>
      <p>Iron Phosphate Ceramic Products Formed from Haematite </p>
      <p>As discussed above, haematite (Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3), an
        inexpensive and very common ingredient in lateritic soils and
        several mineral wastes, including iron waste tailing and red
        mud, has not been successfully used to form a chemically bonded
        phosphate ceramic (CBPC) product, because of its high oxidation
        state, insolubility, and slow reaction rate with phosphoric
        acid. Using known CBPC formulations, the haematite remains
        unaltered in the oxidation environment of the phosphate solution
        during the acid-base reactions. </p>
      <p>The present invention enables the formation of an iron
        phosphate ceramic product made from haematite by converting the
        haematite into a slightly lower oxidation state, thereby
        increasing its reactivity. For example, adding reductants, such
        as tin chloride or iron sulfide, during the acid-base reaction
        results in the conversion of Fe.sub.2 O.sub.3 to Fe.sub.2
        O.sub.3-.delta.. Preferably, the haematite is reduced prior to
        contacting the haematite with the acid phosphate solution. The
        reduction of haematite is alternatively accomplished by heating
        haematite powder in a reducing atmosphere that contains, but is
        not limited to, nitrogen, high carbon, low oxygen, carbon
        monoxide, and/or iron, or by calcining the haematite powder in a
        vacuum. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>An iron-based chemically bonded phosphate ceramic product was
        formed using haematite and tin chloride as a reductant. First,
        100 g of haematite having a particle size of between 10-50 .mu.m
        was mixed with 5 wt % of tin chloride, in a powder form. The
        mixture was thoroughly stirred in 50 wt % </p>
      <p>dilute phosphoric acid solution, in a solution to powder ratio
        of 1:1, for 30 minutes, forming a thick, pourable paste. The
        paste hardened after 24 hours and was completely set after 3
        weeks. The resulting iron-based CBPC product was dense with
        negligible porosity, and had the red color of haematite. The
        surface appeared very glassy, and upon fracturing, the fracture
        surfaces were smooth and glass-like with no visible pores. X-ray
        diffraction showed the iron-based CBPC product to be mainly
        glassy, and, therefore, the newly discovered iron-based CBPC
        product is identified as a glass-crystalline ceramic. FIG. 1
        shows an SEM micrograph of the iron-based CBPC product made from
        haematite. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>An iron-based chemically bonded phosphate ceramic product was
        formed using haematite and iron sulfide as a reductant. 100 g of
        haematite having a particle size of between 10-50 .mu.m was
        mixed with 5 wt % of iron sulfide, in a powder form, and the
        mixture was thoroughly stirred in 60 wt % dilute phosphoric acid
        solution, in a solution to powder ratio of 1:1, for 30 minutes,
        forming a thick, pourable paste. The paste hardened after 24
        hours and was completely set after 1 week. The resulting
        iron-based CBPC product was red in color, dense with negligible
        porosity, and was also identified as a glass-crystalline
        ceramic. </p>
      <p>In an alternate embodiment, the rate of reaction in the
        formation of iron phosphate ceramics from iron oxide or
        magnetite is retarded by the addition of boric acid. It is known
        to control paste-setting reactions by the addition of boric
        acid. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>An iron-based chemically bonded phosphate ceramic product was
        formed from magnetite. First, 100 g of magnetite having a
        particles size of between 10-50 .mu.m was mixed with 10 wt % of
        boric acid (retardant). The resultant mixture was thoroughly
        stirred in 40 to 50 wt % dilute phosphoric acid solution in a
        1:1 ratio of solution to powder for 30 minutes, forming a thick,
        pourable paste. The paste hardened after 1 hour and was
        completely set in 24 hours. The iron-based CBPC product had a
        black color, and was dense with negligible porosity. X-ray
        diffraction indicated the existence of glassy and crystalline
        phases. FIG. 2 shows an SEM micrograph of the iron-based CBPC
        product made from magnetite. A similar material was also made
        using 50 wt % class F fly ash in the binder powder. Analysis of
        the iron-based CBPC products made from magnetite indicated that
        a considerable amount of unreacted magnetite remained in the
        CBPC product. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment, the reaction rate of the acid-base
        reaction in the formation of an iron-based CBPC product made
        from magnetite was controlled by adjusting the concentration of
        the phosphoric acid solution and the pH. Although it is known to
        use phosphoric acid (H.sub.3 PO.sub.4) having a concentration of
        50 wt %, magnetite or FeO may be reacted with a dilute H.sub.3
        PO.sub.4 solution that is between about 30 and about 40 wt %.
        The H.sub.3 PO.sub.4 solution may also be partially neutralized
        using oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, or anhydrous phosphates
        prior to the acid-base reaction with FeO or Fe.sub.3 O.sub.4 to
        reduce the rate of the reactions for forming the iron-based CBPC
        products. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>An iron-based chemically bonded phosphate ceramic product was
        formed from magnetite and a pH adjusted phosphoric acid. 50 wt %
        concentrated phosphoric acid was mixed with 5 to 15 wt %
        potassium carbonate (K.sub.2 CO.sub.3). 100 g of magnetite
        having a particle size of between 10-50 .mu.m was thoroughly
        stirred in the pH adjusted phosphoric acid solution, in a ratio
        of powder to solution of 1:2, forming a thick, pourable paste.
        The paste hardened after 1 hour and was completely set in 24
        hours. The iron-based CBPC product had a black color, and was
        dense with negligible porosity. X-ray diffraction indicated the
        existence of glassy and crystalline phases. A similar material
        was also made using 50 wt % class F fly ash in the binder
        powder. Analysis of the iron-based CBPC products made from
        magnetite indicated that a considerable amount of unreacted
        magnetite remained in the CBPC product. </p>
      <p>Stabilization of Metal Anions </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, radioactive and/or hazardous waste
        materials containing metal anions are stabilized in CBPC
        products by the addition of a reducing agent to the waste and/or
        phosphate ceramic ingredients. The waste is generally waste
        containing nitrates, chlorides, sulfates, silicates, salts,
        heavy metals, any type of inorganic waste, and/or combinations
        thereof. Addition of the reducing agent to the metal anions,
        oxide or hydroxide powders, and/or phosphoric acid or soluble
        acid phosphates reduces the valency of the metal anions to a
        lower oxidation state during formation of the CBPC product.
        Incorporation of the reducing agent into CBPC formulations
        solves the problems experienced in the art due to the presence
        of metal anions in the waste stream by stabilizing the metal
        anions within the CBPC product in an insoluble form. </p>
      <p>The reducing agent is preferably selected from a group
        including, but is not limited to, sodium monosulfide (Na.sub.2
        S), potassium monosulfide (K.sub.2 S), calcium sulfide (CaS),
        iron sulfide (FeS), iron sulfate (FeSO.sub.4.7H.sub.2 O), sodium
        thiosulfate (Na.sub.2 S.sub.2 O.sub.5), sulfur dioxide
        (SO.sub.2), sodium borohydride (NaBH.sub.4), hydrazine, sodium
        bisulfite (NaHSO.sub.3), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH).sub.2),
        sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium carbonate (Na.sub.2 CO.sub.3),
        sulfuric acid (H.sub.2 SO.sub.4), and formic acid (HCOOH), among
        others. Preferably, the reducing agent is a stannous salt, such
        as tin chloride (SnCl.sub.2). Table II below provides a summary
        of preferred reducing agents depending upon the content of the
        metal waste. More than one reducing agent may be used where the
        waste is known to contain various metal contaminants. </p>

      <p>The reducing agent may be added to the heavy metal waste,
        starter powder, and/or acid solution, in any combination.
        Preferably, the reducing agent is initially added to the heavy
        metal waste, resulting in the precipitation of the hazardous
        metals, and subsequently mixed with the CBPC powder and acid
        solution. The addition of the reducing agent to the waste and/or
        ceramic binder ingredients is largely dependent upon the type of
        reducing agent and its reactivity with the phosphates. For
        example, if a reducing agent is very strong, it is preferably to
        add the reducing agent to the waste-ceramic slurry early in the
        mixing step. In general, two to three times more than the
        stochiometric amount of the reducing agent is used, depending on
        the amount of metal present in the waste. The addition of the
        reducing agent results in reduction of the metal anions to their
        lower oxidation states, and in some cases to cations, such that
        the reduced metal ions are more stable and/or more readily react
        with the phosphate ions to form insoluble metal species,
        including oxides and hydroxides of the metals. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
      <p>In this non-limiting example, the stabilization of chromium
        anions was improved in magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP)
        ceramics by incorporating waste containing chromate (Cr.sub.2
        O.sub.7.sup.2-) into an MKP binder powder including a tin
        chloride (SnCl.sub.2) reducing agent. Addition of the reducing
        agent results in the reduction of the valency of the chromium
        anions from +6 to +3, thus decreasing the leachability of the
        chromate from the MKP ceramic product. In addition, the
        reduction of the chromate may increase the reactivity of the
        chromium ions with the phosphate ions in the acid solution,
        promoting the formation of insoluble chromium phosphate. </p>
      <p>MKP ceramic composites loaded with 58 wt % and 70 wt % nitrate
        waste were fabricated by incorporating nitrate waste containing
        chromium into MKP binder materials, both with and without the
        presence of a tin chloride reducing agent. </p>
      <p>The 58 wt % waste loaded MKP ceramic product was fabricated by
        first adding 50 g of the waste to 0.17 g of the reducing agent
        sodium monosulfide (Na.sub.2 S) and 12 g of water. About 0.5 g
        of boric acid may also be added as a retarder. Next, 0.86 g of a
        second reducing agent, tin chloride (SnCl.sub.2), was added to
        the waste slurry and mixed for 5 minutes. Fractions of the
        ceramic binder ingredients, including 4.67 g of water and a
        mixture of 7.69 g of magnesium oxide (MgO) and 25.64 g of
        potassium dihydrogen phosphate (K.sub.2 HPO.sub.4), were then
        added to the waste slurry in 5 minute intervals. </p>
      <p>The 70 wt % loaded MKP ceramic waste product was fabricated by
        the same steps, except the amounts of ceramic binder ingredients
        used were 12 g water, 4.95 g MgO, and 16.48 g KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4.

        improvements in leach resistance in MKP ceramic products
        fabricated in accordance with the present invention. Without the
        reducing agent, the MKP ceramic product failed the leaching

        ceramic product that is well below allowable EPA regulatory

      <p><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
      <p>Technetium-99 (.sup.99 Tc) is present in some high-level wastes
        (HLW), in addition to other volatile fission products, including
        cesium-137 (.sup.137 Cs) and strontium-90 (.sup.90 Sr). Under
        oxygen-containing conditions, the predominant form of technetium
        is the pertechnetate anion, TcO.sub.4.sup.-, which is highly
        soluble in water and readily mobile in the environment.
        Immobilization of technetium-99 is of critical concern, because
        of its high leachability and long half life (e.g.,
        2.13.times.10.sup.5 years). Technetium-99 was successfully
        stabilized in the MKP ceramic product, in accordance with the
        present invention, in that the addition of stannous chloride
        reduced the oxidation state of technetium-99 from +7 to +4. The
        waste solution used in this example was a stripping solution
        generated by a complexation and elution process developed at the
        Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to separate technetium-99
        from HLW, and contained approximately 20 ppm to 150 ppm of
        technetium-99. </p>
      <p>In a first approach, eluted aqueous waste was directly
        stabilized, such that the water in the waste was used in the
        CBPC fabrication process. CBPC products were fabricated with and
        without the addition of the reducing agent, tin chloride
        (SnCl.sub.2). MKP ceramic products were formed from 19.973 g of
        LANL stripping solution containing about 40 ppm .sup.99 Tc by
        adding the stripping solution to a binder mixture including 2.48
        g SiO.sub.2, 8.38 g of MgO, and 28.28 g of KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4,
        and mixing the mixture for 20 minutes, resulting in a fine
        slurry. The reducing agent, 1.16 g of tin chloride (SnCl.sub.2)
        was added to the mixtures after 18 minutes of mixing. No water
        was added during the process. MKP ceramic products were
        similarly formed, by the same process, from 1.712 g of LANL
        stripping solution that did not contain any .sup.99 Tc. </p>
      <p>The resulting fine slurries were transferred into molds, and
        allowed to set. The typical temperature rise during setting was
        between about 55.degree. C. to about 70.degree. C. The slurries
        hardened into a dense monolithic MKP ceramic products in about 2
        hours. After at least 14 days of curing, the resulting MKP
        ceramic products fabricated directly from the LANL elution
        solution had a density of 1.8 g/cm.sup.3, a very low open
        porosity of 4%, and a compression strength of 30.+-.6.7 MPa, a
        compression strength significantly higher than the land disposal
        compression strength requirement of 3.4 MPa, demonstrating the
        MKP ceramic product's superior dense, hard, high-strength
        structure. The MKP ceramic products were tested for strength,
        leaching, and water immersion, evidencing that the addition of
        the reducing agents helped to maintain the .sup.99 Tc in its
        relatively insoluble cationic form, Tc.sup.+4. The optimal
        loading of the elution solution in the MKP ceramic product was
        35%, and the concentrations of the .sup.99 Tc in the MKP ceramic
        products were in the range of between about 20 to about 150 ppm.
      </p>
      <p>The leachability of .sup.99 Tc is highly dependent upon its
        oxidation state, and, therefore, it is important to establish
        redox conditions in the phosphate slurry during fabrication of
        the MKP ceramic product. FIG. 1 is a graphical illustration of
        an Eh/pH diagram for both a Re--O--H and a Tc--O--H system in
        the pH range of 5 to 10. Also shown are experimentally
        determined Eh values as a function of pH for the MKP slurries
        containing eluted waste, measured at various elution solution
        loadings, wherein rhenium was added to the elution solution as a
        substitute for .sup.99 Tc. For example, FIG. 3 shows that the Eh
        and pH values of the slurry with 36% .sup.99 Tc elution solution
        loading under the normal setting conditions are +225 mV and 6.5,
        respectively. In the pH range of 5 to 10 pH, Eh values of Re are
        in the highly soluble heptavalent oxidation state. For a pH of
        less than 7, Eh values of .sup.99 Tc are in the insoluble
        TcO.sub.2 (Tc.sup.+4) oxidation state, while for a pH of greater
        than 7, .sup.99 Tc is present as TcO.sub.4.sup.- (Tc.sup.+7).
        The MKP slurry and setting conditions prescribed by the present
        invention (e.g., 36% loading, 6 to 7 pH, Eh +225 mV) are highly
        conducive to maintaining .sup.99 Tc in the insoluble +4
        oxidation state. Importantly, the addition of a reducing agent
        to the slurry critically aids in the reduction of
        TcO.sub.4.sup.- (Tc.sup.+7) to its stable and insoluble +4
        oxidation state. </p>
      <p>In a second approach, technetium-99 was precipitated from the
        eluted solution by heating in the presence of zinc and 4 M
        hydrochloric acid, and the precipitated technetium-99
        (TcO.sub.2.2H.sub.2 O) was incorporated into the MKP ceramic
        product. The loadings of the technetium-99 in the MKP ceramic
        products were as high as 900 ppm. Since it is well known that
        TcO.sub.2.2H.sub.2 O is highly insoluble, with a solubility of
        10.sup.-7 to 10.sup.-8 mol/L in water under mildly reducing
        conditions, precipitation of the technetium-99 as the highly
        insoluble TcO.sub.2.2H.sub.2 O, followed by encapsulation in the
        MKP matrix, yields a superior, stabilized phosphate ceramic
        product, with a higher loading than that accomplished by the
        direct elution method of the first approach. </p>
      <p>Technetium-99 is generally precipitated from LANL stripping
        solutions by adding zinc to the LANL stripping solution, adding
        HCl to the mixture, and boiling the mixture at about 70.degree.
        C. for about 45 minutes. This process results in the
        precipitation of TcO.sub.2.2H.sub.2 O with about a 40% recovery
        of .sup.99 Tc. </p>
      <p>Table IV below provides results of diffusivity and leachability
        testing of the MKP ceramic products loaded with .sup.99 Tc,
        fabricated with and without the reducing agent step. These
        results demonstrate that the MKP ceramic products fabricated
        with the addition of the reducing agent (SnCl.sub.2) provide
        significantly improved retention of contaminants within the MKP
        matrix. </p>

      <p>Table V below provides results of Product Consistency Test
        (PCT) conducted on the MKP ceramics fabricated according to the

        .sup.99 Tc, after a 7-day test period at room temperatures,
        e.g., 25.degree. C., were reported as low as 1.times.10-3
        g/m.sup.2 -d. At an elevated temperature, e.g., 90.degree. C.,
        the dissolution rate of the matrix increases, and, therefore,
        the normalized leaching rate for .sup.99 Tc also increased to
        the 10.sup.-2 to 10.sup.-1 g/m.sup.2 -d range. Significantly,
        for both the room temperature and elevated temperature testes,
        the MKP ceramics with the highest .sup.99 Tc loadings
        demonstrated the lowest normalized leaching rate. The PCT test
        was initially designed to evaluate chemical durability of
        crushed borosilicate glass. A comparison between PCT test
        results at 90.degree. C. for high-temperature encapsulation of
        .sup.99 Tc in borosilicate glass, resulting in a leach rate as
        low as 10.sup.-2 g/m.sup.2 -d, versus the low-temperature
        encapsulation of .sup.99 Tc within MKP ceramics stabilized with
        a reducing agent, as reported in Table IV, show that the present

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the use of chemically bonded
        phosphate ceramics (CBPCs) for immobilizing large volumes of
        low-level mixed waste material, and, in particular, to a
        polymeric coating that increases the leach resistance in CBPCs
        encapsulating waste containing salt anions. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Low-level mixed waste streams are composed of aqueous liquids,
        heterogeneous debris, inorganic sludge and particulates, organic
        liquids, and soils. Of particular concern are low-level mixed
        waste streams that are high in salt content, especially those
        salt waste streams generated as sludge and solid effluents in
        nuclear processing applications. For example, the extraction of
        plutonium and uranium from their ore matrices by the use of
        strong acids or precipitation techniques produces nitrate salt
        and heavy metal waste. Chemical compositions typically found in
        salt waste streams, either high in chloride or high in nitrate,
        include aluminum trihydroxide, sodium phosphate, MicroCel E
        (CaSiO.sub.3), water, sodium chloride, trichloroethylene,
        calcium sulfate, sodium nitrate, and oxides of lead, chromium,
        mercury, iron, cadmium, and nickel, among other compounds. </p>
      <p>Stabilization of salt waste requires that the contaminants and
        soluble salt anions are effectively immobilized. No single
        stabilization and solidification technology is known to
        successfully treat and dispose of salt waste, due to the
        physical and chemical diversity of salt waste streams.
        Generally, stabilization refers to the conversion of the waste
        into a less soluble form, while solidification refers to the
        micro-encapsulation of the waste in a monolithic solid of high
        structure integrity. Conventional thermal waste treatment
        methods, such as incineration or vitrification, are expensive
        and largely unsuitable for the treatment of salt waste streams
        because of their reliance on high temperature steps that risk
        the release of volatile contaminants and the generation of
        undesirable (e.g., pyrophoric) secondary waste streams. In
        addition, thermal treatments produce hot spots that affect the
        quality of a solidified final waste form. </p>
      <p>A low-temperature approach is to stabilize hazardous waste by
        using inorganic (e.g., pozzolanic) binders, such as cement,
        lime, kiln dust, and/or fly ash. Disadvantages of this approach
        include a high sensitivity to the presence of impurities, high
        porosity, and low waste loading volume. Organic binders (e.g.,
        thermosetting polymers) are used even less frequently, because
        of cost and greater complexity of application. Organic binders
        are not compatible with water-based wastes, unless the waste is
        first pre-treated and converted to an emulsion or solid, and
        organic binders are subject to deterioration from environmental
        factors, including biological action and exposure to ultraviolet
        light. </p>
      <p>Recently, an alternative non-thermal, low-temperature approach
        has been developed at Argonne National Laboratory for
        stabilizing and solidifying low-level mixed waste by
        incorporating or loading the waste into a phosphate ceramic
        waste form having a high structural integrity. This technique
        immobilizes the waste by solidification, such that the waste is
        physically micro-encapsulated within the dense matrix of the
        phosphate ceramic waste form, and/or stabilizes the waste by
        converting the waste into their insoluble phosphate forms.
        Ceramic encapsulation systems are particularly attractive given
        that the bonds formed in these systems are ether ionic or
        covalent, and hence stronger than the hydration bonds in cement
        systems. Also, the ceramic formulation process is exothermic and
        economical. </p>
      <p>Phosphates are particularly good candidates for stabilization
        of radioactive and hazardous waste, because phosphates of radio
        nuclides and hazardous metals are essentially insoluble in
        groundwater. A salient feature of the low-temperature ceramic
        phosphate formulation process is an acid-base reaction. For
        example, magnesium phosphate ceramic waste forms have been
        produced by reacting magnesium oxide (MgO) with phosphoric acid
        to form a phosphate of magnesium oxide, Newberyite, as
        represented in the chemical equation (1), below. </p>
      <p>The acid-base reaction results in the reaction of the waste
        components with the acid or acid-phosphates, leading to chemical
        stabilization of the waste. In addition, encapsulation of the
        waste in the phosphate ceramic results in physical containment
        of the waste components. The reaction represented above in
        Equation (1) occurs rapidly and generates heat, and upon
        evaporation of the water, a porous ceramic product results. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,518 issued to Wagh, et al., incorporated
        herein by reference, describes in detail the process steps for
        setting liquid or solid waste in CBPC products using acid-base
        reactions. Accordingly, the process involves mixing ground solid
        waste, including salt waste spiked with heavy metals, with a
        starter powder of oxide and hydroxide powders of various
        elements; slowly adding the waste-powder mixture to an acid
        solution of phosphoric acid or soluble acid phosphates;
        thoroughly mixing the waste-powder-acid mixture for about a half
        hour to an hour at ambient temperatures (less than 100.degree.
        C.), such that the components of the mixture chemically react to
        form stable phases and a reacted viscous slurry or paste
        results; and allowing the slurry or paste to set for a few hours
        into the final CBPC product. Liquid waste is similarly
        stabilized by mixing the liquid waste with the acid solution
        (preferably 50:50), and then reacting the waste-acid mixture
        with the starting powders. The maximum temperature for the
        process is about 80.degree. C. The CBPC products attain full
        strength in about three weeks, and exhibit a complex structure,
        including a major crystalline phase, e.g., Newberyite
        (MgHPO.sub.4.3H.sub.2 O), and an insoluble, stable phase. The
        waste components are generally homogeneously distributed within
        the phosphate ceramic matrix. Unfortunately, however, the porous
        product (Newberyite) is unsuitable for waste treatment on a
        large scale. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,815 issued to Wagh, et al., incorporated
        herein by reference, describes improving the CBPC fabrication
        process by incorporating two temperature control processes for
        both reducing heat generation during the encapsulation
        (reaction) steps and moderating pH conditions (some wastes are
        unstable at a low pH). The first temperature control process
        involves pre-treating the phosphoric acid with a carbonate,
        bicarbonate or hydroxide of a monovalent metal (e.g., K, Na, Li,
        Rb) prior to mixing with an oxide or hydroxide powder so as to
        buffer the acid. In particular, potassium containing alkali
        compounds (e.g., K.sub.2, KHCO.sub.3, KOH) result in a more
        crystalline waste form, and the higher the concentration of
        potassium in the potassium containing compound, the more
        crystalline the final product, resulting in a higher compression
        strength, lower porosity, and greater resistance to weathering,
        compressive forces, and leaching. The second temperature control
        process involves bypassing the use of the acid and mixing the
        oxide powder with dihydrogen phosphates of potassium, sodium,
        lithium, or other monovalent alkali metal, to form a ceramic at
        a higher pH. </p>
      <p>Neutralizing the phosphoric acid solution in equation (1) by
        adding potassium hydroxide (KOH), as represented in the chemical
        equation (2) below, reduces the reaction rate and heat
        generation, and results in the formation of a superior magnesium
        potassium phosphate (MKP) mineral product, MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2
        O (magnesium potassium phosphate hexahydrate), as represented in
        chemical equation (3) below. </p>
      <p>The chemically bonded ceramic phosphate (CBPC) waste form (e.g,
        MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O) is a dense, hard material with excellent
        durability and a high resistance to fire, chemicals, humidity,
        and weather. The low-temperature (e.g., room-temperature)
        process encapsulates chloride and nitrate salts, along with
        hazardous metals, in magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP)
        ceramics, with salt waste loadings of up to between
        approximately 70 weight percent and approximately 80 weight
        percent. This durable MKP ceramic product has been extensively
        developed and used in U.S. Department of Energy waste treatment
        projects. </p>
      <p>Phosphates in general are able to bind with hazardous metals in
        insoluble complexes over a relatively wide pH range and most
        metal hydroxides have a higher solubility than their
        corresponding phosphate forms. In addition to the magnesium and
        magnesium-potassium phosphate waste products discussed above,
        known waste encapsulating phosphate systems include, but not
        limited to, phosphates of magnesium-ammonium, magnesium-sodium,
        aluminum, calcium, iron, zinc, and zirconium (zirconium is
        preferred for cesium encapsulation). A non-exclusive summary of
        known phosphate systems and processing details is provided in
        Table I below, selected according to ready availability of
        materials and literature about the materials, in addition to low
        cost. </p>

        is typically applied to the reacted paste, about 1,000 to 2,000

        to reduce the reaction rate, or by adding powder to the acid

        widely used cation or anion exchange resins, water, NaCl,
        Na(NO.sub.3).sub.2, Na.sub.3 PO.sub.4, and Na.sub.2 SO.sub.4.
        The salt waste may be reacted with phosphoric acid to any
        consume carbon dioxide (CO.sub.2) present, prior to mixing the
        salt waste with the oxide powders or binding powders, as the
        evolution of CO.sub.2 results in very porous final ceramic
        products. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, however, encapsulation of low-level mixed waste
        into CBPC products is currently of limited practical use for
        waste that is predominantly comprised of salts, such as
        chlorides, nitrates, and sulfates. Efforts to encapsulate salt
        waste in phosphate ceramic products are hampered by low maximum
        waste loading capacities, because of interference of the salt
        anions with ceramic-setting reactions, leaching of soluble salt
        anions from the resulting highly porous ceramic product
        (especially in aqueous environments), and rapid structural
        degradation of the ceramic product caused by the high leach
        rates. Also, environmental stresses degrade the integrity of
        known CBPC waste forms over time. For example, exposure to
        repeated cycles of wetting, drying and/or freezing, or acidic or
        other conditions conducive to leaching may affect the long term
        effectiveness of waste encapsulated CBPC waste forms. </p>
      <p>A need in the art exists for a method for disposing of salt
        waste that involves a low-temperature stabilization process and
        improves resistance to leaching, without degrading the integrity
        of the ceramic phosphate product. </p>
      <p>The present invention is a process and product for safely
        containing radioactive and/or hazardous waste comprised of salt
        anions in a phosphate ceramic product, involving a new and
        surprisingly effective immobilization technique. The invented
        process and product involves the application of a specific
        polymer coating to the exterior surface of a phosphate ceramic
        composite encapsulating waste, such that the polymer coating
        infiltrates the surface structure and adheres to and/or bonds to
        the phosphate ceramic composite matrix, effectively isolating
        the waste from the environment and improving the leach
        resistance of the phosphate ceramic composite. The polymer
        coating contains at least one inorganic metal compound,
        preferably an inorganic metal oxide of magnesium or silicon. </p>
      <p>Therefore, in view of the above, a basic object of the present
        invention is to provide an improved process and product for
        immobilizing hazardous, radioactive, and/or mixed salt waste in
        phosphate ceramic composites. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to provide a safe, low
        temperature, economical process and product for immobilizing
        salt waste in a phosphate ceramic product that increases the
        loading capacity and improves the leach resistance of the salt
        waste within the phosphate ceramic product. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to provide process and
        product for immobilizing large volumes of salt waste in a
        durable, long term storage phosphate ceramic product. </p>
      <p>Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the

        become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of
        the description below and/or by practice of the invention. The
        objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention may be
        realized and attained by means of instrumentation and
        combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Briefly, the present invention is a surprisingly effective
        process and product for immobilizing waste having a high
        concentration of salt in chemically bonded phosphate ceramic
        (CBPC) products. The invention involves a new coating step,
        wherein a select polymer coating is applied to the surface of a
        fabricated salt waste loaded CBPC product, such that the coating
        infiltrates the surface structure of the CBPC product and
        adheres to the phosphate ceramic matrix, thereby isolating
        soluble salt anions from the environment and ensuring long-term
        integrity of the phosphate ceramic system. The fabricated salt
        waste loaded CBPC product is formulated by methods known in the
        art. </p>
      <p>A critical feature of the invention is the selection of the
        polymer coating, which contains at least one inorganic metal
        compound. Preferably, the polymer coating is a polymer resin
        comprised of fine powders of magnesium oxide and/or silicon
        oxide. The powders of the coating material act as wetting agents
        that apparently cause mechanical and/or chemical bonding between
        the phosphate ester in the surface structure of the CBPC product
        and the polymer coating composition. The polymer coating
        infiltrates and macro-encapsulates the CBPC product to improve
        durability and leach resistance. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an improved process and
        product for immobilizing waste in a chemically bonded phosphate
        ceramic (CBPC) waste form. As described in detail in the
        background section above, although methods for fabricating CBPC
        products encapsulating waste materials are well known, the known
        CBPC encapsulation methods are ineffective for containing wastes
        having a high concentration of salt. </p>
      <p>The present invention modifies known CBPC encapsulation methods
        and products to include a unique immobilization step that
        specifically addresses problems experienced in the art due to
        the presence of soluble salt anions in the waste stream.
        According to the present invention, a polymer coating is applied
        to the exterior surface of the CBPC product to infiltrate the
        complex surface structure of the CBPC product and bond and/or
        adhere thereto, such that salt waste is effectively
        macro-encapsulated with in phosphate ceramic matrix and isolated
        from the environment. Advantageously, the polymer surface
        coating protects the CBPC waste form from environmental stresses
        by providing a greater resistance to air, water, organic
        liquids, acids, and alkalis, among other conditions. The polymer
        surface coated CBPC waste form also has improved mechanical
        properties, such as greater hardness and high abrasion
        resistance. </p>
      <p>The polymer coating has three main components: the binder, the
        pigment, and the solvent. The binder provides adhesion and
        cohesion between the coating and the CBPC surface, the pigment
        is a fine powder that provides the coating with color and
        hardness, and the solvent is a volatile liquid for dissolving
        solid or semi-solid binders. The pigment has considerable
        influence on the consistency of the properties of the polymer
        coating and contributes to its abrasion and weather resistance.
      </p>
      <p>A feature of the invention is the inclusion of at least one
        inorganic metal compound in the binder component of the polymer
        coating. Preferred inorganic metal compounds are inorganic metal
        oxides, such as magnesium oxide (MgO) and/or silicon oxide
        (SiO.sub.2). These inorganic metal compounds may be in the form
        of magnesite (MgCO.sub.3), talc (Mg.sub.2 (Si.sub.2
        O.sub.5).sub.2.Mg(OH).sub.2), or borosilicate glass (i.e.,
        silicate glass with at last 5% boron oxide). These ceramic
        materials provide an excellent interface adhesion between the
        polymer coating and the surface and infiltrated structure of the
        CBPC product, apparently caused by mechanical and chemical
        interactions between the phosphate ester comprising the CBPC
        product and the ceramic coating composition. Polymer coating
        materials that do not contain ceramic, inorganic metal compounds
        peel off of the surface of the phosphate ceramic product after
        curing. </p>
      <p>The most preferred polymer material is a commercially available
        thermoset polyester resin that is comprised of a polyester resin
        binder, magnesite, talc, or soda-lime glass pigment, a styrene
        monomer solvent, and also a benzoyl peroxide initiator.
        Generally preferred polymer coatings are comprised of
        unsaturated polyester resins that are straight-chain polymers
        having reactive double bonds at intervals along the chain. In
        their popular form, unsaturated polyester resins are supplied as
        solutions in vinyl monomer (e.g., styrene), and copolymerization
        is activated by the addition of an initiator (e.g., organic
        peroxides or hydroperoxides) and promoters (e.g., metallic
        dryers, cobalt octoate, naphthenate). Copolymerization results
        in the cross-linking of polyester chains by the formation of
        polmerized vinyl monomors. </p>
      <p>According to the preferred method of the present invention, the
        polymer material is applied to the exterior surface of a
        phosphate ceramic product as a thin film by adding the initiator
        to the pigment and the binder, mixing the
        initiator-pigment-binder composition for a few minutes to form a
        slurry, uniformly coating the exterior surface of the phosphate
        ceramic product with the slurry, and chemically drying the
        coating by allowing sufficient time for the slurry to infiltrate
        the phosphate ceramic product surface, such that the slurry
        completely wets and adheres to the surface. Although the polymer
        coating hardens in about ten minutes, a curing time of 24 hours
        is preferred. The polymer coating is subjected to a chemical
        drying step, e.g., curing, a process in which the molecules of
        the binder chemically react with one other to form bonds within
        the film by primary valences. These bonds are very strong and
        not susceptible to dissolution by the action of solvents. Thus,
        a feature of the invention is the subjection of the surface
        coated CBPC product to a chemical drying step that converts the
        coating from a fluid to a solid state, wherein chemical
        reactions occur to anchor the thin film coating to the CBPC
        surface. </p>
      <p>Table II below provides the results of the American Nuclear
        Society's ANS 16.1 Standard Test for nitrate and chloride loaded
        polymer coated MKP ceramic products. Generally, the ANS 16.1
        Standard Test studies leachability of contaminants contained in
        matrices in an aqueous environment over time and evaluates
        retention rates by calculating a leachability index value from
        the test data. (The leachability index is the negative logarithm
        of the effective diffusivity coefficient). Sample polymer coated
        salt loaded MKP ceramic products were placed in the leaching
        solution for a fixed period of time, after which the leaching
        solution was analyzed for specific ions. As shown in Table II,
        the chloride leaching was excessively low, with the chloride ion
        reading below the detection limit even after a cumulative 96
        hours of exposure. The nitrate leaching was relatively higher. </p>

      <p>Salt waste is generally highly reactive and therefore its
        flammability is of concern, in view of transportation and
        storage issues. Department of Transportation (DOT) oxidation
        tests conducted on polymer coated salt loaded phosphate ceramic
        products demonstrated that because phosphate ceramics are
        inorganic ceramic-type materials, they advantageously inhibit
        the spread of flames and are an excellent solidification medium
        for flammable salt waste. </p>
      <p>The resulting phosphate ceramic materials may be used to
        produce building and construction materials, e.g., engineering
        barrier systems. </p>

      <p>Surrogate waste having the composition listed below in Table
        III was prepared in the laboratory and mixed for 72 hours using
        mixing rollers. The surrogate waste was chemically treated by
        mixing the surrogate waste first with an aqueous solution
        containing a small amount of sodium monosulfide (Na.sub.2 S) for
        about 8 to 10 minutes to efficiently convert mercury (Hg) into
        its most stable form of mercury sulfide (HgS), and next treating
        the surrogate waste with tin chloride (SnCl.sub.2) for about 5
        minutes to reduce the valency of chromium from +6 to a less
        toxic, less water soluble oxidation state of +3. </p>

      <p>Magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP) ceramic waste products
        incorporating the surrogate waste were fabricated by methods
        generally shown in FIG. 1 for waste loadings of 58% and 70%.
        Accordingly, a binder was formed by spontaneously reacting a
        stoichiometric amount of well mixed, calcined magnesium oxide
        (MgO) powder and monopotassium phosphate (KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4),
        under aqueous conditions and constant stirring, in four
        successive batches at one minute intervals, to produce magnesium
        potassium phosphate (MgKPO.sub.4.6H.sub.2 O), according to
        Equation (3) above. The resulting binder has a highly
        crystalline ceramic structure and a solubility product constant
        as low as 10.sup.-12. </p>
      <p>The chemically treated surrogate waste and binder were combined
        to form a slurry that initially experienced a few degrees
        decrease in temperature due to the dissolution of the phosphate
        crystals in the water. Upon dissolution of the phosphate, the
        temperature increased to about 35.degree. C., and the slurry
        having a pH of about 6 to 7 was stirred thoroughly for about 18
        to 20 minutes, or until the slurry started to set. The slurry
        was hardened in molds for about 2 to 5 hours, resulting in
        dense, monolithic, chemically bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC)
        waste products. After 14 days of curing, the CBPC waste products
        were subjected to variance performance tests, including
        strength, leaching and characterization. </p>

        microscopy (SEM) photomicrograph of a fractured surface of a
        magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP) ceramic waste product loaded
        with 58% surrogate salt waste. The photomicrograph shows a very
        dense, crystalline structure with a small amount of pores. Pores
        allow water to penetrate the waste form, causing nitrates to
        (e.g., NaNO.sub.3) to dissolve and leach into the environment. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention, a select number of the CBPC
        waste products were coated with an unsaturated polyester resin
        system to further immobilize the surrogate waste within the CBPC
        waste products. FIGS. 3 and 4 show high (2000.times.) and very
        high (7500.times.) magnification SEM photomicrographs,
        respectively, of the polymer coated surface of a CBPC waste
        product. The photomicrographs show a very smooth, substantially
        pore free surface structure, demonstrating a very low
        possibility for water to penetrate into the polymer coated CBPC
        waste product through its surface structure, and the prevention
        of nitrate dissolution and subsequent leaching. FIGS. 5 and 6
        show low (350.times.) and high (2000.times.) magnification SEM
        micrographs of the interface between a CBPC waste product loaded
        with surrogate waste and a polymer coating applied thereon. As
        shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the polymer coating has completely wet
        and adhered to the phosphate ceramic surface, resulting in a
        CBPC waste product having superior leaching performance. The
        polymer coating-CBPC waste product interface also appears to be
        essentially free of cracks demonstrating high compression
        strength and excellent compatibility between the polymer coating
        and the CBPC waste product. </p>
      <p>Table IV below provides the results of density and compression
        strength tests conducted on the uncoated and polymer coated
        magnesium potassium phosphate (MKP) ceramic products loaded with
        58 weight percent and 70 weight percent nitrate salts. The
        compression strength of the waste forms are well above of the
        Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) minimum requirement of 500
        psi. </p>

      <p>FIG. 7 is a graphical illustration of cumulative nitrate
        leaching for nitrate loaded MKP ceramic products with and
        without the polymer (unsaturated polyester resin) coating. As
        depicted, the polymer coated nitrate loaded MKP ceramic product
        immobilized the nitrate ions significantly more effectively than
        the uncoated nitrate loaded MKP ceramic product. A comparison of
        the leachability index for the polymer coated nitrate loaded MKP
        ceramic product versus an uncoated nitrate loaded MKP ceramic
        product is provided in Table V, below. The calculated
        leachability index for the polymer coated nitrate loaded MKP
        ceramic product was greater than 12, substantially above the ANS
        16.1 standard leachability index of at least 6.0. Generally, the
        leachability index is related to the effective diffusivity in
        that the higher the leachability index, the lower is the
        effective diffusivity, resulting in a more favorable retention
        of a contaminant within a matrix. These results demonstrate that
        the essentially pore free surface structure of the polymer
        coated salt waste loaded MKP ceramic product provides superior
        immobilization of the waste salts than uncoated salt loaded
        phosphate ceramic products currently known in the art. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a pumpable/injectable ceramic, and
        more particularly this invention relates to a ceramic
        composition that maintains low viscosity for extended periods of
        time to allow the composition to be pumped or injected into hard
        to reach geologic or manmade locations. </p>
      <p><b>2. Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Disposal of hazardous waste, low-level radioactive waste or
        benign waste continues to present problems. Landfill space is
        becoming more scarce so that only nonrecyclable material or
        nonbiodegradable material is often considered the only
        candidates for land filling. </p>
      <p>When hazardous material is land filled, care must be taken to
        prevent destabilization of the material, so that leaching will
        not occur. </p>
      <p>Aside from land filling, efforts have been made to combine
        to-be-disposed-of-material with cement so as to form solid
        monoliths or waste forms for burial or for use as structural
        products. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,432,666 to Frey et al.,
        discloses using cement and other water repellant binders to
        dispose of waste thought to be damaging to the environment.
        However, cement is unstable in many situations, for example when
        attempts are made to encapsulate halogenated materials. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,093,593 to Arrance discloses a method for
        vitrifying silicate materials to encapsulate radioactive waste.
        However, temperatures of up to 1,400.degree. C. are required to
        produce final waste forms. </p>
      <p>In U.S. Pat. No. 5,645,518, awarded to the instant Assignee, a
        method to stabilize low-level mixed wastes, such as radioactive
        medical wastes and other such materials, is provided, wherein
        phosphate ceramics physically and chemically stabilize the waste
        at ambient temperatures. However, in such endeavors, final waste
        forms rapidly set. This rapid-setting feature causes various
        degrees of unworkability to the process, particularly in
        situations where low viscosity and long operational times are
        required. Such situations include where the material is to be
        blown, poured or injected into deep wells or crevices, in-situ
        stabilization of buried wastes, remediation at nuclear-accident
        and waste spillage sites, and pumpable refractory applications.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the drawbacks of the above-mentioned processes,
        commercially supplied materials for use as components
        (particularly the oxides) of the above processes are in forms
        adverse to formulating flowable mixtures. As a result,
        exothermic reactions become uncontrollable, leading to thicker
        slurries, with the final product lacking homogeneity. Also, the
        resulting rapid setting time of the ceramic does not provide
        adequate working time. </p>
      <p>A need exists in the art for a formulation and a waste
        encapsulation process to accommodate stabilization of a myriad
        of waste materials in a myriad of deposition scenarios. The
        formulation and process should provide waste liquors having
        protracted, workable consistencies or viscosities to accommodate
        currently available pump- injection-, or spray
        application-equipment. The process should also provide a
        protocol for selecting and preparing components of the
        formulation so as to tailor the formulation for situations
        requiring varying degrees of viscosity. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a
        formulation comprising waste and waste-encapsulation material
        that overcomes many of the disadvantages of the prior art. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide a
        method for using waste as a bulk-component in pumpable hardening
        agents. A feature of the invention is the use of additives to
        slow the reaction between components of the hardening agents. An
        advantage of the invention is the extension of time of
        workability. Another advantage is the employ of heretofore
        unusable waste. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        means for converting commonly available oxides into a component
        in pumpable hardening agents. A feature of the invention is
        calcining the oxides and then mixing the calcined oxides with
        coating agents. An advantage of the invention is the reduction
        in reaction rate of the calcined oxide in relation to the other
        components of the hardening agents, leading to extended
        workability time of the hardening agent prior to curing. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to provide
        selection criteria for oxides to be used in the production of
        pumpable ceramic hardening formulations. A feature of the
        invention is the use of solubility, porosity and morphology
        characteristics of the oxides to differentiate acceptable oxides
        from unacceptable oxides. An advantage of the invention is that
        the characteristics are determinable prior to mixing or forming
        of waste forms. Another advantage is that oxides having the
        desired characteristics can be produced via calcination. </p>
      <p>Briefly, the invention provides pumpable ceramic composition
        comprising an inorganic oxide, potassium phosphate, and an oxide
        coating material. </p>
      <p>Also provided is a pumpable ceramic-based waste formulation
        comprising 7 to 14 weight percent MgO, 25 to 40 weight percent
        KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4, 15 to 50 weight percent ash, 1 to 4 weight
        percent boric acid, 0.5 to 2 weight percent lignosulfonate, and
        15 to 25 weight percent water. </p>
      <p>The invention also provides a method for preparing pumpable
        ceramic-based waste forms comprising selecting inorganic oxides
        based on solubility, surface area and morphology criteria;
        mixing the selected oxides with phosphate solution and waste to
        form a first mixture; combining an additive to the first mixture
        to create a second mixture; adding water to the second mixture
        to create a reactive mixture; homogenizing the reactive mixture;
        and allowing the reactive mixture to cure. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The inventors have found a method for incorporating wastes into
        pumpable or sprayable mixtures which in turn are used to fixate
        the wastes in hard-to-reach locations. Also, solely the binders
        from such mixtures can be utilized and combined with waste in
        situ for encapsulation, particularly in situations wherein the
        waste is located in inaccessible or dangerous areas such as the
        sarcophagus of a contaminated nuclear power plant, or waste
        spillage sites. Generally, the method retards the setting action
        of phosphate ceramics and also reduces the overall viscosity of
        the phosphate ceramic slurry or the phosphate ceramic/waste
        slurry long enough to allow the slurry to be pumped, sprayed or
        otherwise transported to final points. Ultimately, the method
        produces a hard, impenetrable waste form rivaling the durability
        of concrete forms, and without the addition of heat. </p>
      <p>The inventors also disclose herein a process for selecting
        appropriate oxides for use as a component of the free flowing
        binder. Also disclosed is a process for pretreating common
        oxides for subsequent use as a component of the free-flowing
        binder, as mentioned supra. </p>
      <p>As to the first aspect of the invention, pumpable ceramic,
        waste-encapsulating binder has been developed. The inventors
        have found that the addition of certain compounds coats the
        components of waste binders and serves to slow the
        setting-reaction to the point where setting or curing is
        retarded long enough for the reacting ceramic-waste liquor to be
        pumped, sprayed, or otherwise deposited in its final resting
        place. Once deposited, the ceramic waste liquor is allowed to
        cure or set up to its very dense, final form. Despite the use of
        coating materials to slow reaction speeds, the final product
        proves to be harder than those produced using Portland cement.
        Compression strengths of more than 4,000 pounds per square inch
        are typical. </p>
      <p>Fabrication of the pumpable waste-encapsulation material is
        shown schematically as numeral 10 in FIG. 1. Briefly, oxide
        powder 12 is mixed with phosphate powder/solution 14 and
        previously sized waste material 16 in a first mixing process 17
        and in various proportions. </p>
      <p>Waste material of a size less than 200 microns is suitable. A
        myriad of phosphate solutions can be utilized including
        phosphates having cation moieties selected from the group
        consisting of potassium, sodium, calcium, zirconium, iron,
        magnesium-ammonium, and combinations thereof. A suitable
        concentration of phosphate solution is one which creates a
        slurry which when combined with other ingredients enumerated
        below, provides a liquor with a centipoise value that
        facilitates easy dispersion. Once such phosphate concentration
        is where the weight ratio of water to KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 is
        approximately 0.66. </p>
      <p>The mixing of the oxide powder, the phosphate solution and the
        waste creates a first mixture or slurry 18. Optionally, the
        oxide powder is subjected to a pretreatment process 11 prior to
        mixing with the phosphate solution and waste material. Details
        of the oxide pretreatment process are disclosed infra. </p>
      <p>Suitable oxide: phosphate: waste weight proportions range from
        1:3.4:1.45 to 1:3.4:6.6. When MgO is utilized as the oxide,
        KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 as the phosphate and ash as the waste
        material, a particularly suitable MgO:KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 :Ash
        weight ratio is 1:3.4:1.45. </p>
      <p>In one exemplary procedure, the slurry 18 is contacted with
        additives 20 comprising various coating agents and water
        "getters" to create a second mixture 21. However, the additives
        could be added at separate points in the mixing process. For
        example, coating agents, including but not limited to citric
        acid or boric acid, can be added directly to the oxide powder 12
        prior to the formation of mixing of the oxide with the phosphate
        solution and waste material. Then, a water getter such as a
        lignosulphonate can be added after the above three components
        are thoroughly mixed together. </p>
      <p>After integration of the additives, water 22 is added to the
        resulting mixture and the now-hydrated liquor is mixed in a
        second mixing stage 23 to create a homogenous, reacting liquor
        25. Mixing times of approximately 20 minutes to 60 minutes are
        typical. </p>
      <p>The addition of water begins the reaction process 24. It is
        during the reaction process 24 that the now-reacting liquor 25
        can be pumped, jet grouted or otherwise manipulated 26 prior to
        final setting occurring. Setting, stabilization or curing 28 of
        the liquor 25 occurs no earlier than 2 hours after the water
        addition step 22, discussed above. </p>
      <p>A salient feature of the invented process is that no
        externally-applied heat is required to effect reaction, pumping,
        transporting and ultimately curing of the ceramic-waste liquor.
      </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that additives are used to fluidize the
        reaction liquor, the resulting final, cured waste form exhibits
        superior qualities. For example, and as depicted in FIG. 2, the
        process yields a waste form primarily comprising magnesium
        potassium phosphate crystalline phase, whereby the crystalline
        phase is represented by sharp peaks on the graph. </p>
      <p><i>Oxide Preparation Detail</i> </p>
      <p>A myriad of oxides are suitable powders for the invention.
        Calcium oxide, sodium oxide, zirconium oxide, iron oxide,
        magnesium oxide and combinations thereof are all appropriate
        starter powders. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that pretreatment 11 of the oxide
        often enhances the flowability of the resulting ceramic
        binder-waste mixture. However, pretreated oxide as supplied by
        commercial suppliers does not provide the desired enhancements
        to flowability. Rather, the invented calcining process disclosed
        herein yields a binder with optimal properties such as high
        strength and low porosity. Setting rates of approximately two
        hours, low exothermicity (i.e., low heat generation) even during
        setting, and a very homogenous structure result from employing
        the invented oxide pretreatment process 11. </p>
      <p>To produce suitable ceramic-binder, the oxide component should
        have the following properties: </p>
      <p>1. Average oxide particle sizes should be approximately 8 to 10
        microns. Each particle should be dense, crystalline, and free
        from any amorphous coating. </p>
      <p>2. The oxide particles used should not result in substantial
        heating of the ceramic binder-waste mixture during mixing. Also,
        the oxide particle selection should not result in slurry
        thickening. </p>
      <p>3. The final product should be a homogenous ceramic and should
        not result in precipitates forming in the slurry. Ultimate
        compression strength should be at least 3,500 pounds per square
        inch. Open or connected porosity of the product should be
        approximately less than 10 percent by volume of the entire
        monolith as formed and cured. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that oxides which do not satisfy the
        above enumerated parameters are not suitable for use in the
        stabilization of radioactive waste, or in applications for
        producing high volume structural products. As such, the
        following three test criteria have been developed for
        determining the suitability of oxides. The criteria can be
        applied to oxides provided by typical suppliers, or can be
        applied to determine the efficacy of oxide pretreatment methods
        employed on site by end users or others. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in the decision tree depicted in FIG. 5, all
        three of the following criteria should be satisfied to qualify
        an oxide as a suitable component in a flowable ceramic binder
        for waste: </p>
      <p>A.) Surface area: Surface area of the powder should be in the
        range of 0.3 to 0.55 m.sup.2 /g. Otherwise, the inventors have
        found that lower surface area results from agglomeration of the
        particles which in turn inhibits reaction between the oxide and
        other reactants. Surface areas above the desired range results
        in an accelerated reaction rate, leading to the slurry over
        heating, in some cases causing the slurry to boil. Surface areas
        of commercially available oxides are approximately 4 m.sup.2 /g.
      </p>
      <p>B.) Morphology: Under a high resolution microscope (i.e.,
        approximately 1500.times.), oxide particle surfaces should
        appear smooth and with striations indicating crystalline
        structure. Examples of acceptable and unacceptable morphologies
        are depicted as FIGS. 3A and 3B, respectively. </p>
      <p>Aside from visual, albeit microscopic inspection, of oxide
        candidates, x-ray diffraction analysis also allows determination
        of sufficient crystalline structure in the oxides. For example,
        suitable oxides (FIG. 4A) exhibit sharp peaks, indicative of
        crystalline structure, whereas unsuitable oxides (FIG. 4B)
        exhibit broad peaks, which is indicative of the presence of
        amorphous materials. Amorphous materials react fast and generate
        unwanted excess heat in the slurry. </p>
      <p>C.) Solubility: Solubility of the oxide in a solution of
        phosphoric acid also distinguishes between acceptable and
        unacceptable oxide. Generally, the less soluble the oxide is,
        the more suitable it is for producing a flowable ceramic
        material, which will solidify into an impenetrable mass. Lower
        oxide solubility results in more MgO particles present after
        reaction and therefore more nucleation sites existing in the
        reaction liquor. These nucleation sites help form individual
        centers of hardness which adds to the overall strength of the
        final waste form. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 depicts a graph showing two acceptable oxides (dotted
        lines) and two unacceptable oxides (solid lines). As
        illustrated, 20 percent more (by weight) of the acceptable
        oxides are necessary to bring an acid-oxide solution to pH 8
        compared to the amount required of unacceptable oxides. Initial
        impurity levels of the suitable oxides do not effect their
        solubilities. For example, the more soluble oxides (i.e., the
        acceptable oxides) depicted in FIG. 5 had varying levels of
        calcium contaminants with one oxide (analytical grade)
        containing 0.05 weight percent calcium and the other acceptable
        oxide (technical grade) containing 0.45 weight percent calcium.
      </p>
      <p>Solubility testing of oxide candidates are conducted as
        follows: A 30 milliliter solution of 5 percent H.sub.3 PO.sub.4
        in deionized water is kept in constant agitation, via a magnetic
        stirrer or other means. One gram of MgO is added to the solution
        and the resulting mixture is allowed to equilibrate, with pH
        recorded. Additional MgO is added, one gram at a time, with
        equilibration allowing to occur. The procedure is continued
        until the pH reaches 8. </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that one method for obtaining oxide
        satisfying criteria A-C stated above is through a calcining
        process. If commercial MgO is to be used, the oxide first must
        be sized to between 8 and 10 microns, as noted supra. Calcium
        content of the oxide should not exceed 0.5 weight percent. </p>
      <p>Once the calcium content and particle size of the oxide is
        determined to be suitable, the oxide is placed in a furnace
        maintained at 1,300.degree. C. The oxide could be placed in a
        "preheated" furnace or present during temperature ramp-up.
        Soaking or heating time of the oxide will vary depending on the
        source (and therefore impurity) levels of the oxide. Highly pure
        (analytical grade) oxide is soaked for approximately one hour
        while technical grade is heated for approximately three hours. </p>
      <p>After heating, the samples remain in the furnace during cool
        down. The resulting, now-cooled oxide usually presents as an
        agglomerated mass, which must be reground or sized to 8 to 10
        micron levels. </p>
      <p><i>Additive Agent Detail</i> </p>
      <p>As noted supra, a salient feature of the invention is the use
        of additives to stymie reaction and therefore extend workability
        of the reaction liquor 25. The additives can comprise two
        components: a coating agent and a water "getter" or water
        eliminating agent. As mentioned supra, suitable coating agents
        are selected from the group consisting of boric acid, citric
        acid, and combinations thereof. The coating component of the
        additives work by coating and therefore isolating the oxide
        particle from a complete exposure or contact by other reactants.
      </p>
      <p>Suitable water getters are derived from the class of polymeric
        organic compounds comprising the lignophosphonates. The
        lignophosphonate compounds serve to keep water from quickly
        reacting with the phosphates. In essence, these ligno-compounds
        scavenge up any water to prevent rapid hydration of the
        phosphate. Alkaline lignophosphonate compounds are preferable
        getters, particularly those selected from the group consisting
        of lignosulphonate, lignophosphonates and other hydroxylated
        organic compounds and combinations thereof. A suitable group of
        lignosulphonate compounds consists of sodium lignosulphonate,
        calcium lignosulphonate, potassium lignosulphonate and
        combinations thereof. One exemplary lignosulphonate compound is
        DARATARD 17.TM., available through Grace Construction Products
        of Cambridge, Mass. </p>
      <p>Weight percents of the additive agents to the final reaction
        liquor can vary, with values of between 0.5 percent and 3.5
        percent suitable. Generally, the additive is combined with the
        first mixture in an additive to oxide to phosphate weight ratio
        of between 1.83:10.3:35 to 2.1:10.3:34 </p>
      <p>The inventors have found that the water-isolating effect of
        lignosulphonate compounds is enhanced with the presence of boric
        acid, wherein boric acid is present in weight percents similar
        to those utilized for the lignophosphonates. </p>
      <p>The additive agent can be added anytime before or at the
        initiation of the reaction process 24, with exemplary results
        obtained when the additive is introduced as designated in FIG.
        1, that is, prior to the addition of water 22. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, proportions of each ingredient of the final,
        pumpable product are as follows: MgO (12 weight percent),
        KH.sub.2 PO.sub.4 (40 weight percent), fly ash (17 weight
        percent), boric acid (1 weight percent), lignosulfonate (1
        weight percent), and water (29 weight percent). This embodiment
        results in the slurry having the consistency of milk, and
        therefore easily pumped or grouted. After two to three hours,
        the slurry sets into a hard and dense ceramic. X-ray diffraction
        analysis of the final form, as depicted in FIG. 2. Along with
        hydrated magnesium potassium phosphate, also present is residual
        magnesium oxide. </p>
      <p>As can be determined in Table 1 below, a myriad of different
        slurry consistencies result from varying concentrations of the
        additives. Table 1 shows the viscosities in centipoises (cp) for
        additive concentrations of between 0.5 and 3.5 weight percent to
        the total slurry weight. </p>
      <p>TABLE 1 Viscosities of ceramic-waste liquors depending on
        variations in additive concentrations. Additive Initial Waste
        Particles Concen. Viscosity &lt;200 .mu.m Set Time Final
        Hardness (Wt %) (Centipoise) Wt % (Min) (Psi) 0.0 27,000 60 20
        &gt;8000 2.0 300 15 &gt;190 &gt;3000 2.5 3000 28 190 &gt;3000 </p>
      <p>Inasmuch as spraying and injection applications are enhanced at
        viscosity values less than 1,500 cp, formulations containing
        between 0.5 and 3 weight percent coating agent of additive
        (which comprises both a coating agent and a water "getter") are
        suitable. </p>
      <p>Several different types of waste material can be incorporated
        with the pumpable ceramic binder, either separately or combined,
        to form a waste form. Such wastes include, but are not limited
        to ash, saw dust, clay, soils, red mud, dust from metal
        industries, slags, and combinations thereof. Sizing, grinding or
        other pretreatment of the material may be necessary. Suitable
        micron sizes of the waste range from 10 microns to 200 microns.
      </p>
      <p>The resulting slurry, as described supra, can be utilized
        either neat to dispose of the already-incorporated waste
        particles in the pumpable liquor, or used as a sealant agent to
        stabilize other waste. For example, a slurry formulated with ash
        can be subsequently injected into contaminated soil for
        stabilization of the latter. Another application is the use of
        the invented waste-containing slurry as a pumpable refractory. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described with reference to
        details of the illustrated embodiment, these details are not
        intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined in the
        appended claims. <br>
