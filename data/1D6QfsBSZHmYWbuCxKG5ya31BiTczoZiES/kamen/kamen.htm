          <p><i>Inventor Dean Kamen wants to put entrepreneurs to work
              bringing water and electricity to the world's poor.</i> </p>
          <p><b>by</b> </p>
          <p><b><font size="+1">Erick Schonfeld</font></b> </p>
          <p>( <i>Business 2.0 Magazine</i> editor-at-large )</p>
        </center>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>San Francisco (Business 2.0)</i>
          --- Dean Kamen, the engineer who invented the Segway, is
          puzzling over a new equation these days. An estimated 1.1
          billion people in the world don't have access to clean
          drinking water, and an estimated 1.6 billion don't have
          electricity. Those figures add up to a big problem for the
          world --- and an equally big opportunity for entrepreneurs. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To solve the problem, he's invented
          two devices, each about the size of a washing machine that can
          provide much-needed power and clean water in rural villages. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Eighty percent of all the diseases
          you could name would be wiped out if you just gave people
          clean water," says Kamen. "The water purifier makes 1,000
          liters of clean water a day, and we don't care what goes into
          it. And the power generator makes a kilowatt off of anything
          that burns." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Light in the Darkness</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Kamen is not alone in his quest.
          He's been joined by Iqbal Quadir, the founder of Grameen
          Phone, the largest cell phone company in Bangladesh. Last
          year, Quadir took prototypes of Kamen's power machines to two
          villages in his home country for a six-month field trial. That
          trial, which ended last September, sold Quadir on the
          technology. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So much so in fact that Quadir's
          startup, Cambridge, Mass.-based Emergence Energy, is
          negotiating with Kamen's Deka Research and Development to
          license the technology. Quadir then hopes to raise $30 million
          in venture capital to start producing the power machines.
          (With the exception of the Segway, which Kamen's own company
          sold, Kamen has typically licensed his inventions to others.)
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The electric generator is powered
          by an easily-obtained local fuel: cow dung. Each machine
          continuously outputs a kilowatt of electricity. That may not
          sound like much, but it is enough to light 70 energy-efficient
          bulbs. As Kamen puts it, "If you judiciously use a kilowatt,
          each villager can have a nighttime." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A satellite picture of the earth at
          night shows swaths of darkness across Southeast Asia, the
          Middle East, and Africa. For the people living there, a simple
          light bulb would mean an extension of both their productivity
          and their leisure times. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Entrepreneurial Power</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The real invention here, though,
          may be the economic model that Kamen and Quadir hope to use to
          distribute the machines. It is fashioned after Grameen Phone's
          business, where village entrepreneurs (mostly women) are given
          micro-loans to purchase a cell phone and service. The women,
          in turn, charge other villagers to make calls. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"We have 200,000 rural
          entrepreneurs who are selling telephone services in their
          communities," notes Quadir. "The vision is to replicate that
          with electricity." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">During the test in Bangladesh,
          Kamen's Stirling machines created three entrepreneurs in each
          village: one to run the machine and sell the electricity, one
          to collect dung from local farmers and sell it to the first
          entrepreneur, and a third to lease out light bulbs (and
          presumably, in the future, other appliances) to the villagers.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Kamen thinks the same approach can
          work with his water-cleaning machine, which he calls the
          Slingshot. While the Slingshot wasn't part of Quadir's trial
          in Bangladesh, Kamen thinks it can be distributed the same
          way. "In the 21st century, water will be delivered by an
          entrepreneur," he predicts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The Slingshot works by taking in
          contaminated water --- even raw sewage --- and separating out
          the clean water by vaporizing it. It then shoots the remaining
          sludge back out a plastic tube. Kamen thinks it could be
          paired with the power machine and run off the other machine's
          waste heat. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Compared to building big power and
          water plants, Kamen's approach has the virtue of simplicity.
          He even created an instruction sheet to go with each
          Slingshot. It contains one step: Just add water, any water.
          Step two might be: add an entrepreneur. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Not required are engineers,
          pipelines, epidemiologists, or microbiologists," says Kamen.
          "You don't need any -ologists. You don't need any building
          permits, bribery, or bureaucracies." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>The Price of Freedom</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Still, even if some of the
          technical challenges have been solved ("I know the technology
          works and I'd fall on my sword to prove it," insists Kamen),
          the economic challenges still loom. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Kamen's goal is to produce machines
          that cost $1,000 to $2,000 each. That's a far cry from the
          $100,000 that each hand-machined prototype cost to build. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Quadir is going to try and see if
          the machines can be produced economically by a factory in
          Bangladesh. If the numbers work out, not only does he think
          that distributing them in a decentralized fashion will be good
          business --- he also thinks it will be good public policy.
          Instead of putting up a 500-megawatt power plant in a
          developing country, he argues, it would be much better to
          place 500,000 one-kilowatt power plants in villages all over
          the place, because then you would create 500,000
          entrepreneurs. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Isn't that better for democracy?"
          Quadir asks. "We see a shortage of democracy in the world, and
          we are surprised. If you strengthen the economic hands of
          people, you will foster real democracy." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Lights, water, freedom. Now that's
          entrepreneurial. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">A system for distributed utilities
          including electrical power and water. A generation device is
          provided for converting an available resource to a desired
          utility; the resource may be water in which case the generator
          is a purifier for purifying untreated water, or alternatively,
          the generator may convert a fuel to electrical power. In
          either case, an input sensor is provided for measuring input
          to the generation device, while an output sensor is provided
          for measuring consumption of output from the generation
          device. The monitoring system has a controller for
          concatenating measured input and consumption of output on the
          basis of the input and output sensors. Measured parameters are
          telemetered to a remote site where utility generation and use
          are monitored and may also be controlled. At least a portion
          of the electrical power capacity of the electric generation
          unit may power a water purification unit such as a vapor
          compression distillation unit, and heat input of the electric
          generation unit may supply heat to the water purification
          unit. </p>
