      <br>
      This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for activation
      or suppression of biological processes, especialy those processes
      substantially affected by high frequency electric fields.<br>
      <br>
      This method provides for practical treatment of substantial
      quantitites of stock by industrial concerns so efficiently that
      the benefits of such treatment are available to effect substantial
      industrial economy. For example, it is advantageous to treat <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">seed bean stock having an untreated
        germination factor of from 2 to 4 % and render that stock 40%
        germinative</span>. In like manner the method is effective in
      the activation or deactivation of fruits to accelerate or retard
      their life processes, and to delay the advance of their
      maturation, as well as to otherwise control plant life through
      promotion of plant health as by devitalization of parasitic,
      fungus, and insect pests.<br>
      <br>
      Industrial application of high frequency treatment requires the
      expensiture of large amounts of energy and equipment capacity not
      heretofore available.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the principles of my invention the materials to
      be treated are subjected to variable high voltage and high
      frequency electric fields, being passed therethrough for a period
      of time dependent upon empirical determination of effectiveness.
      The requisite energy capacity for industrial application is made
      available between two electrodes, or electrically conductive
      plates, the dimensions of which are so calculated with respect to
      the frequency of the electric field required that these two
      electrodes have resonant characteristics, that is to say, a
      maximum proportion of available energy is available for activation
      of the material between the plates.<br>
      <br>
      The frequency of the energy pulses supplied to the plates is
      preferably maintained by an electric oscillating circuit, an
      oscillator being so related to the electrodes that the voltage of
      the energy passing to the electrodes is varied in accordance with
      the oscillator energy wave, in such fashion that it is impractical
      to permit its flow in ordinary oscillating circuits such as
      heretofore been employed.<br>
      <br>
      In the drawing:<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 1</span> is a circuit
      diagram, partially fragmentarily elevational, of the apparatus;<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 2</span> is a fragmentary
      plan;<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3</span> is a voltage
      stress diagram.<br>
      <br>
      The materials <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> to be
      treated are carried by an endless belt 2, one each of which passes
      through an electric field produced by an oscillating voltage
      difference existing between a pair of conducting plates 4 and 6 to
      the adjacent ends 8 and 10 of each of which are attached a figh
      frequency electric energy supply, here comprising the plates P of
      power vacuum tubes 12 and 14. The filaments of these tubes are
      attached to the negative terminals of a power supply 16, the
      positive bus 13 of which supply is electrically conected to the
      remote ends 20 and 22 of plates 4 and 6 as by a slide contractor
      24.<br>
      <br>
      The distance between the points A and B in meters is calculated as
      300,000,000 divided by 4 times the frequency in cycles per second,
      or one-quarter wave length of the frequency to be used.
      Accordingly, if the frequency required for a particular processing
      is 15 MHz, the distance AB is 5 meters. As the frequency
      increases, AB becomes shorter and the slider 24 may be adjusted
      for this requirement, or plates of different lengths may be
      provided, integrated therewith at 20 and 22, for each frequency
      required.<br>
      <br>
      The energy passing to the plates 4 and 6 is controlled by the
      oscillator circuit grids G which form the termini of the variable
      oscillator circuit O, and which receives its energy from the
      direct current source 16-18.<br>
      <br>
      A variable capacitor VC adjusts the oscillator frequency and
      voltage thereof is applied on the grids G, which, in turn,
      influence the flow of current from the filaments F to the plates 4
      and 6 so that the natural or resonant frequency of the oscillator
      circuit is exactly equal to the resonant frequency of the lines 4
      and 6.<br>
      <br>
      If a larger capacity is desired the widths of the plates 4 and 6
      may be increased and the speed of travel of the belt 2 may be
      enlarged in accordance with the demand for additional capacity.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated, the field is created by a resonant line, short
      circuited at its remote end. Other resonant lines and oscillating
      circuits may be employed, with a generally like effect, but that
      described is preferable.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated, employing the paltes 4 and 6 alone, and moving the
      stock <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span> transversely to
      the length AB, it is evident that the voltage stress varies from A
      to B, being at all times a maximum at A and zero at B, and
      distributed according to the nature of the imposed sine wave from
      A to B. Accordingly, diverse portions of the material along the
      belt from A to B are subjected to different voltage gradients and
      this fact must be taken into account. If voltages between the
      limits are satisfactory, the position of the material on the belt
      may be specified for this exigency.<br>
      <br>
      If uniform treatment is desired, the material may be moved in the
      direction AB or BA, so that all of it passes through the same
      section across the line AB.<br>
      <br>
      Treatment between certain voltage limits is often satisfactory and
      in such instances the arrangement employing an additional set of
      plates 4'-6' which are shorted at B' and have input terminals at
      A', in opposed relation to AB, is useful. The material at the
      midpoint is subjected to the least stress, which would be the
      maximum available for any constant condition, while the maximum
      voltage would be available between the ends of the plate pairs
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of using the belt 2, the plates 4 and 6 may be juxtaposed
      in vertical planes, as imaginable in connection with Figure 2, and
      so proportioned with respect to velocity of free fall, or
      restrained fall, of material in process therebetween, that the
      required length of treatment is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      It has been pointed out that large quantities of energy may be
      usefully expended incident to the resonant condition between
      plates 4 and 6 without, however, dissipating excessive quantities
      of waste energy due to resistance and electromagnetic losses. This
      is made possible by the resonant characteristics of the plates,
      their large size in respect of the material to be treated, and
      their size in comparison with the wavelength...<br>
