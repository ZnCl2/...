        HENDERSON — Images of the suffering victims of Hurricane Katrina
        surrounded by fouled water they couldn’t drink will remain in
        America’s collective memory for some time. But a company with
        Longmont ties is hoping its invention will prevent such a
        scenario from happening in the future. Utah-based AquaMagic is
        in the midst of its “Hurricane Zone” tour, during which it is
        showing off its new HP120-DRU, a portable water generator able
        to make pure drinking water out of air. The tour started June 1
        in Houston and is slated to visit 183 Atlantic Coast cities by
        the time it wraps up in Washington, D.C., at the end of the
        summer. The official U.S. hurricane season is 183 days long. On
        hiatus from the tour, representatives from AquaMagic brought the
        HP120 on Thursday to Cummins Rocky Mountain, a company
        contracted to supply the 10-kilowatt diesel generators that
        power the HP120.<br>
        <br>
        AquaMagic has been developing the technology for some time, “but
        we focused on this (portable) size when we saw what was
        happening to the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,” said
        David Richards, in charge of marketing and innovation for
        AquaMagic. The mobile unit is being pitched as more efficient
        and cost-effective than traditional methods of supplying water
        in the wake of a disaster, such as trucking in bottled water.<br>
        <br>
        Using condensation techniques and its patent-pending AquaFlash
        technology, the HP120 can get 10 gallons of water for every
        gallon of diesel fuel it uses, according to John Tompkins, an
        engineer who works with Richards in Longmont. “You can pull in
        10 truckloads of water, or you can bring in one truckload of
        fuel and get 10 truckloads worth of water,” Tompkins said.<br>
        <br>
        AquaMagic was founded in Ogden, Utah, and Richards was a part of
        the original core team. He came to Longmont to take a job with
        Maxtor and continued to work with AquaMagic in his spare time.
        Richards then met Tompkins, another Maxtor engineer who began to
        work with AquaMagic in his spare time. The two have since left
        their jobs at the hard-drive company to work full time at
        AquaMagic.<br>
        <br>
        The two will be back on the road soon, taking the machine to New
        Orleans and along the Florida coast. “The intent is to have this
        go in and support first responders and evacuees,” Richards said.
        “If you need two gallons a day to stay hydrated in a hot, humid
        environment, this can serve 60 personnel a day.” Richards said
        the reactions of those to whom he has made presentations has
        been “first, disbelief. They say, ‘What? You’ve got to be
        kidding me.’ “That’s why we have to physically take it there and
        show it to them and let them taste (the water).”<br>
        <br>
        Local biologist Brent Cannell, who works with Richards and
        Tompkins as a consultant, has been key to making the water that
        comes out of the HP120 more pure than bottled water, Richards
        said. Longmont is “where the (research and development) will be
        done and will continue to be done” for AquaMagic’s products,
        Richards said. As big as the potential market for the HP120 is
        in this country’s hurricane-prone regions, Richards said he
        expects the international market could be even bigger.<br>

        TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — In a country like the United States, the
        human body's most urgent need is taken for granted. It comes
        easily out of our faucets, and gallon jugs of it cost less than
        a dollar.<br>
        <br>
        Until something like a hurricane makes clean drinking water hard
        to find.<br>
        <br>
        But the Southeast's climate provides something besides
        hurricanes in summer. Humidity.<br>
        <br>
        As emergency officials ponder how to better help their residents
        after disasters, some companies are pushing machines that pull
        the humidity from the air and turn it into drinking water. A few
        are also touting the machines as a potential solution to the
        clean water shortages that plague the Third World, pushing aside
        concerns that the machines are inefficient and require fuel that
        also might be scarce.<br>
        <br>
        The biggest machines can make up to 5,000 liters of water a day,
        enough to provide about a gallon to 1,250 people. Small units
        cost several hundred dollars, while the biggest, most elaborate
        cost half a million.<br>
        <br>
        Anyone who's ever looked at an air conditioner or put a cold
        bottle of water in the sun and watched water bead up on it knows
        air can be condensed into water when it's cooled. The only
        questions are how efficient it is on a large scale, and whether
        it's clean enough to drink.<br>
        <br>
        A few companies are marketing portable condensers they say can
        make clean, drinkable water out of nothing but the air outside.
        At least one is marketing it as a tool for emergency responders.<br>
        <br>
        "Tap water systems get knocked out, bottled water often
        disappears even before the storm shows up ... so this becomes a
        way to get drinking water that you can count on no matter what,"
        said Jonathan Wright, president of Ogden, Utah-based AquaMagic,
        one of the companies selling the machines.<br>
        <br>
        The company recently towed a portable unit around the Southeast,
        visiting fire departments, rescue workers and city officials,
        trying to drum up interest.<br>
        <br>
        AquaMagic's unit is too small to provide water for a whole city,
        but could at least provide water for rescue and cleanup workers
        so they wouldn't have to cart in truckloads of water, Wright
        said.<br>
        <br>
        One potential buyer is David Roberts, who as fire chief in
        Biloxi, Miss., oversaw crews working in the aftermath of
        Hurricane Katrina, which leveled much of his city.<br>
        <br>
        "You don't realize how bad you need water until you don't have
        it," Roberts said. "In August, the humidity's 95% and its 95
        degrees, you can drink a quart of water and it goes right out of
        you in about 30 minutes."<br>
        <br>
        He called the AquaMagic machine "a great piece of equipment. The
        water tasted good, too."<br>
        <br>
        Most of the companies making the machines aren't focused on the
        U.S. market. Some are selling machines where clean drinking
        water is always hard to find — villages in the developing world.<br>
        <br>
        "Right now at any given time, there's about 1.2 billion people
        that are drinking contaminated water," said Ron Colletta, vice
        president of sales for the Island Sky in Hollywood, Fla.<br>
        <br>
        Scientists who study water shortages say that while the
        technology works simply and could be part of the solution, there
        are cheaper and easier ways to provide large-scale water
        purification if cleanliness is the issue.<br>
        <br>
        The simplest is boiling it to remove microbes, or treating it
        with chemicals like chlorine, said Dr. Mark Sobsey, a professor
        of environmental sciences and engineering at the University of
        North Carolina School of Public Health's Drinking Water Research
        Center.<br>
        <br>
        But boiling has a problem in some poor areas.<br>
        <br>
        "You've got to have fuel and to be able to pay for it," Sobsey
        notes.<br>
        <br>
        But the biggest obstacle to the machines' wider use is making
        them cost effective to fuel. Most are powered by diesel fuel.
        Some run on solar energy, but the panels require a costly
        initial investment.<br>
        <br>
        Michael Zwebner, the president of Miami Beach-based Air Water
        Corp., admits the power question is a big problem, but he says
        the machines can be useful where there isn't enough water to
        begin with — or where people can't afford to pump it from the
        ground and treat it.<br>
        <br>
        "In many parts of Africa, there is no water," Zwebner said.<br>
        <br>
        Until recently, there's been little interest in the technology
        because water is generally easy to get from streams or
        underground wells and, even in poor countries, it's cheap.<br>
        <br>
        "It's been really only in the last 10 years that water scarcity
        has been appearing in a lot of places, mainly due to the growth
        of the human population ... and pollution," explained Roland
        Wahlgren, a physical geographer who studies water supply and is
        working to develop air-to-water systems with a Canadian company
        called Wataire Industries. "Groundwater and surface water
        supplies have decreased in quality."<br>
        <br>
        Aquamagic's envisioned niche notwithstanding, the systems still
        aren't generally economically feasible on a large scale in
        developed countries with plentiful clean water like the United
        States.<br>
        <br>
        And emergency managers ask: If you're going to truck diesel fuel
        into a storm-hit area to run the machines, why not just truck in
        water?<br>
        <br>
        The answer, AquaMagic's Wright says, is that for one gallon of
        diesel, you can make 10 gallons of water. So one small truck of
        fuel would provide the amount of water you'd need 10 trucks to
        bring in.<br>
        <br>
        Air Water's machine was used after the 2004 Asian tsunami, and
        the military in India has recently signed on to send it into the
        field with troops.<br>
        <br>
        "In some countries in Africa they actually see this machine as
        an act of God," Zwebner said.<br>

        A water purification device including a water inlet that
        receives water generated by a condenser. The water purification
        device has a water heating apparatus that receives water from
        the water inlet. The water heating device has a thermal energy
        source that can pasteurize or flash pasteurize the water by
        heating the water to a predetermined temperature for a
        predetermined length of time. The water heating device expels
        the water at the end of the predetermined length of time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0001] Many municipal water systems struggle with the ever
        increasing demand on available potable water supplies.
        Additionally, natural inventories of water available for
        treatment are diminishing and require more treatment than ever
        before. Indeed, many areas of the world currently do not have
        adequate water treatment systems, water utility systems, or
        basic access to potable water.<br>
        <br>
        [0002] For example, even though approximately 75% of the earth's
        surface is water, ninety-seven percent of this water is in
        saline oceans, and is therefore undrinkable and unsuitable for
        most uses. Of the remaining three percent that is considered
        fresh water, two-thirds is suspended in glaciers and the polar
        ice caps, and one-sixth is trapped beneath the earth's surface.
        Of the final one-half of one percent of the earth's water, a
        substantial amount has been chemically or biologically
        contaminated by industrialization and development. This
        contamination has made significant inroads into underground
        water sources in the latter half of the twentieth century, and
        has made drinking water contamination one of the highest ranking
        environmental risks. Clean and pure drinking water is,
        consequently, in great demand throughout the world, and has
        rapidly become one of the earth's most prized resources. Yet,
        billions of people lack a reliable water supply.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] Nearly all fresh water on the earth is created and
        sustained through the hydrologic cycle. In the hydrologic cycle,
        heat from the sun evaporates ocean water, which falls back to
        earth as precipitation. Because of the hydrologic cycle, there
        is a continuous exchange of moisture between the oceans, the
        atmosphere, and the land. In the atmospheric stage of the cycle
        there are continually many billions of gallons of water in the
        air available for harvesting.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0004] The present invention provides a water purification
        device including a water inlet that receives water generated by
        a condenser. The water purification device also has a water
        heating apparatus that receives water from the water inlet. The
        water heating device has a thermal energy source that can flash
        pasteurize the water by heating the water to a predetermined
        temperature for a predetermined length of time. The water
        heating device expels the water at the end of the predetermined
        length of time. A water outlet releases water from the water
        heating apparatus after the water has been elevated to the
        predetermined temperature for the predetermined time.<br>

        principles of the inventions as illustrated herein, which would
        occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession
        of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the
        invention. The following detailed description and exemplary
        embodiments of the invention will be best understood by
        reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein the elements and
        features of the invention are designated by numerals throughout.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] The present invention is generally directed to a water
        purification system that purifies water generated by equipment
        that uses a condenser such as dehumidifiers, air conditioners,
        freezers, refrigerators, and the like. The water purification
        device receives water that is generated and discharged by the
        condenser containing equipment and may filter the water with a
        pre-filter to remove large contamination, such as dust, pollen,
        mold, spores, bacteria and the like, from the water. The water
        purification device can heat, or pasteurize the water in a flash
        pasteurization process to destroy living contaminants not
        extracted by the sediment filter. The flash pasteurization
        process may elevate the temperature of the water to a
        predetermined temperature for a predetermined time in order to
        kill, or render inactive, living contaminants. The predetermined
        time of the flash pasteurization process may be a relatively
        short time and varies depending on the predetermined
        temperature. An ozonator may be used to generate ozone that may
        be injected or vacuumed into the pasteurized water to further
        purify the water. An activated carbon filter may remove organic
        and inorganic contaminants and other chemicals from the water
        before sending the water to a storage tank. Ultraviolet light or
        ozone can then be used periodically to maintain the purity of
        the water in the storage tank.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] As illustrated in FIG. 1, a water purification device,
        indicated generally at 10, in accordance with the present
        embodiment is shown for use in purifying water generated by a
        condenser. The water purification device 10 has a water inlet 20
        to receive water generated by a condenser.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] For purposes of the present embodiments, a condenser can
        be any type of equipment that generates or condenses water
        during its operation. It will be appreciated that a condenser
        can be a part of a larger piece of equipment such as an air
        conditioner, a dehumidifier, a refrigerator, or a freezer. For
        example, dehumidifiers use condensers to extract water vapor or
        moisture from the air, thereby reducing the humidity of the air.
        Moreover, air conditioners, refrigerators and freezers use
        condensers to control temperature in a closed environment by
        extracting water vapor from the air in order to lower the dew
        point of the closed environment. Other condenser using
        equipment, as known in the art, can also generate water that is
        receivable by the water inlet 20 of the water purification
        device 10. In any case, condensers typically remove water vapor
        from the surrounding air by condensation and discharge the water
        in a liquid state.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] It will also be appreciated that millions of industrial
        sized air conditioners and dehumidifiers are in use throughout
        the world every day for the purpose of creating more comfortable
        environments in which to live, work, shop, and play. As
        described above, these air conditioners and dehumidifiers lower
        humidity levels indoors by drawing air across a condensing
        apparatus that extracts water vapor from the air and condenses
        the vapor into liquid water. Unfortunately, the liquid water
        generated by these air conditioners and dehumidifiers is not
        safe for human consumption and is referred to as gray water.
        Typically, this gray water is sent down drains contributing yet
        more water to over-burdened water treatment facilities.
        Advantageously, the water purification device 10 can receive and
        purify liquid water discharged from a condenser or condenser
        containing equipment, in order to make the water potable, or
        suitable for human consumption.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] While much research has been conducted in the areas of
        dehumidification, gray water purification and water filtration;
        little, if any research has been focused on retrofitting
        dehumidifiers or aftermarket mechanisms designed to purify the
        gray water discharge from dehumidifiers. While some
        technologists have developed and patented equipment for
        capturing water vapor, like a dehumidifier, and then purifying
        the captured water into drinking water, these machines have been
        custom built for the purpose, and hence often only the
        financially elite who can afford the benefit of this technology.<br>
        <br>
        [0020] Additionally, the purification of gray water in such
        systems is typically accomplished by means of a carbon
        filtration apparatus, a UV light source, or a combination of
        these processes to kill any germicidal organisms. However, both
        activated carbon filtration and UV light purification have
        limitations. For example, activated carbon filters become
        burdened with time and need to be replaced in order to maintain
        their effectiveness. UV lamps can become dull with age, as well
        as from particulate buildup. With time both devices may loose
        their effectiveness unbeknownst to their operator. Consequently,
        water could pass by these systems untreated. Furthermore, the
        effectiveness of UV light purification is subject to the
        wavelength and intensity of the UV light source, the clarity of
        the water, as well as the distance of the light source to the
        microorganisms being treated. Even under normal operating
        conditions, organisms furthest from the UV source may receive
        minimal or no effects from the irradiation.<br>
        <br>
        [0021] Therefore, it is a particular advantage of the present
        invention that the water purification device 10 can be
        retrofitted or added after-market, to a piece of condenser
        containing equipment. Thus the present invention can take
        advantage of the millions of condensers already in the market
        place and can be used to purify the water generated by already
        existing condensers. Additionally, the water purification device
        10 can be manufactured with new condenser containing equipment.<br>
        <br>
        [0022] Regardless of whether the water purification device 10 is
        retrofit to a condenser or manufactured along with a condenser,
        the water can be delivered from the condenser to the water
        purification device by either a pump or gravity fed plumbing.<br>
        <br>
        [0023] The water purification device 10 can also have a water
        heating apparatus 30. The water heating apparatus 30 can receive
        water from the water inlet 20. The water heating apparatus 30
        can also have a thermal energy source 34 to pasteurize or flash
        pasteurize the water by heating the water to a predetermined
        temperature for a predetermined length of time.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] The water heating apparatus 30 can flash pasteurize
        discharged liquid water from a condenser. Generally,
        pasteurization is a purification process that uses heat to kill
        microorganisms by destroying the cytoplasmic membranes, or inner
        cell structures of the microorganisms. Pasteurization also kills
        microorganisms by denaturing proteins essential to microorganism
        survival. Flash pasteurization, or high-temperature short-time
        pasteurization, rapidly elevates the temperature of the water
        and maintains the temperature for a predetermined relatively
        short duration in order to kill or render undesirable
        microorganisms inactive. Thus, by heating the condenser
        discharge water to a predetermined temperature for a
        predetermined time, the water heating apparatus can eliminate
        pathogens from the water.<br>
        <br>
        [0025] The water heating apparatus 30 provides several
        advantages over other types of purification devices and
        processes. For example, the water heating apparatus 30 can
        uniformly distribute heat throughout the condenser generated
        water in order to destroy microorganisms regardless of where the
        microorganism is positioned within the water mass. Consequently,
        purification of water by other more traditional filtering
        mechanisms.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] The water heating apparatus 30 of the water purification
        device 10 can flash pasteurize discharged liquid water from a
        condenser. In one example, the predetermined temperature can be
        at least 161 degrees F. (72 degrees C.) and the predetermined
        length of time can be at least 15 seconds. In another example,
        the predetermined temperature can be at least 212 degrees F. and
        the predetermined time can be 0.01 seconds. The heated water can
        be expelled from the water heating apparatus 30 through a water
        outlet 22. It will be appreciated that other time and
        temperature combinations can be used, but generally the higher
        the temperature, the less time is needed to complete the
        pasteurization. Additionally, it has been found that
        temperatures below 161 degrees F. are not effective at
        neutralizing undesirable microorganisms.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] The water heating apparatus 30 provides several
        advantages over other types of purification devices and
        processes. For example, the water heating apparatus 30 can
        uniformly distribute heat throughout the condenser generated
        water in order to destroy microorganisms regardless of where the
        microorganism is positioned within the water mass. Consequently,
        water purification of the present invention is not dependent on
        penetration of light as in an ultraviolet purifier.<br>
        <br>
        [0028] Additionally, the water heating apparatus 30 of the
        present invention uses readily available thermal energy to
        purify the condenser discharge water, and so the water heating
        apparatus 30 does not require any specialized non-renewable
        equipment such as an ultraviolet light source or activated
        carbon filters. Furthermore, the heat transfer process of the
        water heating apparatus is not adversely affected by particulate
        buildup as is ultraviolet purification and activated carbon
        filter processes. Consequently, cleaning and maintenance of the
        apparatus can be minimized.<br>
        <br>
        [0029] It will be appreciated that the thermal energy source 34
        can be a conductive heat source such as an electrical heating
        element, a hot water jacket, a steam jacket, a fire, or a
        combination of these various heat sources. Additionally, the
        thermal energy source can be an emissive thermal heat source
        such as an electrical heating element, a flame, a chemical
        reaction, or a combination of these various heat sources. Other
        thermal energy sources, as known in the art, can also be used to
        heat the water in the water heating apparatus 30.<br>
        <br>
        [0030] The water heating apparatus 30 can also include a heat
        exchanger 40 that can transfer thermal energy from the thermal
        energy source 34 to the water received from the water inlet 20.
        As shown in FIG. 1, the heat exchanger 40 can include a tube 42
        heated by the thermal energy source 34. In use, water can pass
        through the tube 42 and heat can be transferred from the tube 42
        to the water. In this way, the water can continue to increase in
        temperature as the water travels through the tube 42 until a
        point near the end of the tube 42 where the water temperature is
        at the predetermined temperature. The temperature can be
        maintained at the predetermined temperature for the
        predetermined time, at which point the water can be discharged
        from the tube 42 and to a water outlet 22.<br>
        <br>
        [0031] Referring to FIG. 2, a water purification device,
        indicated generally at 100, is shown that is similar in many
        respects to the device described above. The water heating
        apparatus 130 can have a heat exchanger 140 that can include a
        plate 144, or a plurality of plates (not shown) that are heated
        by the thermal energy source 134. In use, the water surrounds
        the plate 144 and the temperature of the plate 144 is raised.
        The plate 144 can radiate or conduct the heat to the water to
        elevate the temperature of the water to the predetermined
        temperature for the predetermined time.<br>
        <br>
        [0032] Referring to FIG. 3, a water purification device,
        indicated generally at 200, is shown that is similar in many
        respects to the devices described above. The water heating
        apparatus 230 can have a heat exchanger 240 with a coil 246 that
        is heated by the thermal energy source 234. The coil 246 can
        transfer heat to the water to elevate the temperature of the
        water to the predetermined temperature for the predetermined
        time. Other types of heat exchangers, as known in the art, can
        also be used to transfer thermal energy in the form of heat from
        the thermal energy source 34 to the water.<br>
        <br>
        [0033] Illustrated in FIG. 4, a water purification system,
        indicated generally at 300, in accordance with the present
        invention is shown for use in purifying water generated by a
        condenser 312. The water purification system 300 includes a
        filtration chain, shown generally at 310. Water from a condenser
        312 can be directed through the filtration chain 310 in order to
        make the water potable. As noted above, the condenser 312 can be
        a part of another piece of equipment such as an air conditioner,
        a dehumidifier, a refrigerator, and a freezer.<br>
        <br>
        [0034] The filtration chain 310 can have a pre-filter 320 that
        can receive water generated by a condenser 312. The pre-filter
        320 can filter relatively larger contaminants from the water.
        The pre-filter 320 can include a particulate screen 324 for
        removing particles larger than a predetermined size from water
        passing through the pre-filter 320. The pre-filter 320 can also
        include an activated carbon filter 328 for reducing
        environmental and biological contaminants in the condenser
        discharge water.<br>
        <br>
        [0035] The filtration chain 310 can also have a water heating
        apparatus 330 that is similar in many respects to the water
        heating apparatus described above. The water heating apparatus
        330 can have a thermal energy source 334 to pasteurize, or flash
        pasteurize, the water by heating the water to a predetermined
        temperature for a predetermined length of time. Thus, the water
        heating apparatus 330 can receive water from the pre-filter 320,
        and can flash pasteurize the water by heating the water to a
        predetermined temperature for a predetermined length of time. In
        one embodiment, the predetermined temperature can be at least
        161 degrees F. (72 degrees C.) and the predetermined length of
        time can be at least 15 seconds. In another aspect, the
        predetermined temperature can be at least 212 degrees F. and the
        predetermined time can be 0.01 seconds. The heated water can be
        expelled from the water heating apparatus 30 through a water
        outlet 22. It will be appreciated that other time and
        temperature combinations can be used, but generally the higher
        the temperature, the less time is needed to complete the
        pasteurization. Additionally, it has been found that
        temperatures below 161 degrees F. are not effective at
        neutralizing undesirable microorganisms unless longer treatment
        times are permitted.<br>
        <br>
        [0036] The water heating apparatus 330 can receive water from
        the pre-filter 320. The water heating apparatus 330 can include
        a heat exchanger 340 that can transfer thermal energy from the
        thermal energy source 334 to the water received from the
        pre-filter 320. The heat exchanger 340 can transfer heat from
        the heat exchanger 340 to the water. In this way, the water can
        continue to increase in temperature as the water travels
        through, or about the heat exchanger 340 until the temperature
        throughout the water, or throughout a cross section of the water
        mass, is at least at the predetermined temperature. It will be
        appreciated that water nearer the heat exchanger 340 can have a
        higher temperature than the predetermined temperature when water
        farther from the heat exchanger 340 is at the predetermined
        temperature. Thus, the temperature throughout the water mass can
        be maintained at least at the predetermined temperature for the
        predetermined time.<br>
        <br>
        [0037] The water heating apparatus 330 can expel the water at
        the end of the predetermined length of time into a cooling unit
        350. The cooling unit 350 can reduce the temperature of the
        water.<br>
        <br>
        [0038] Biofilms (colonized layers of microorganisms) can form
        when bacteria, and other microorganisms adhere to each other and
        to the surfaces to which they come into contact with. Biofouling
        (acid production, equipment corrosion, toxin production, etc.)
        can result within the water purification system 300 if these
        biofilms are allowed to grow. Under normal equipment operation,
        it is anticipated that biofilms will develop within the water
        collection system, water purification train, and water storage
        container. Thus, from time to time, as the water purification
        device operates, it will need to be flushed and sanitized to
        eliminate these biofilms to safe levels.<br>
        <br>
        [0039] Ozone (O3) is lethal to microbes, viruses, parasites,
        pesticides and the like. Ozone is also a very effective
        disinfectant. Ozone is highly reactive and once it comes into
        contact with organic or inorganic matter ozone reacts with the
        matter and reduces the unstable triatomic oxygen (O3) back to
        diatomic oxygen (O2). In the presence of bacteria, ozone
        attaches to the cell wall of the organism causing the cell to
        lyse (rupture). It has been shown that ozone can be more than
        3000 times more effective at destroying undesirable water
        contamination than chlorine sanitizers. Additionally, ozone can
        also be produced readily in remote locations with the use of
        ambient air and is very cost effective.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] Thus, an ozonator 360 can be used to further purify the
        water in the water purification system 300 by releasing ozone
        into the water. It will be appreciated that the ozonator 360 can
        be placed in the cooling unit 350 as shown in FIG. 4, as well as
        in a variety of other locations along the filtration chain 310.
        Additionally, ozone can be injected into multiple locations in
        the filtration chain. Ozone can also be used to periodically
        re-purify stored water as well as periodic sanitization of the
        water purification system 300.<br>
        <br>
        [0041] The filtration chain 310 can also have a post cooling
        purifier 370 that can receive water from the cooling unit 350
        and reduce remaining contamination from the water. The post
        cooling purifier 370 can include an activated carbon filter 374
        that can further reduce environmental contaminants from the
        water. The post cooling purifier 370 can also include an
        Ultraviolet (UV) light source 378 for further purification of
        the water. The UV light source purifier 378 can reduce
        biological contaminants from water from the carbon filter.<br>
        <br>
        [0042] Referring to FIG. 5, a block diagram illustrates the flow
        path, indicated generally at 400, of water from a condenser
        through the water purification filtration chain 310 of the water
        purification system 300 discussed above. Water can be discharged
        from the condenser 312 and received by the pre-filter 320 which
        filters larger contaminants such as dust, pollen, spores, and
        the like from the water. The water then flows to the water
        heating apparatus 330 where the water is heated to a
        predetermined temperature and maintained at the predetermined
        temperature for a predetermined time so that the water is
        pasteurized or flash pasteurized. The water then flows to a
        cooling unit 350 or tank where an ozonator 360 can inject ozone
        into the water to further purify the water. The water then flows
        through post cooling purifier 370 that can have an activated
        carbon filter 374 for further filtering environmental
        contaminants and an ultraviolet light purifier 378 that can
        reduce biological contaminants. The water can then be used in
        potable water applications or the water can be stored for future
        use.<br>
        <br>
        [0043] In the case where the water is stored for future use,
        additional purifying processes can be used periodically to
        maintain the purity of the stored water. For example, an
        Ultraviolet light source 378 can be used to periodically
        irradiate the stored water to reduce development of
        contamination in the stored water.<br>
        <br>
        [0044] It will be appreciated that some of the elements of the
        flow path described above can be eliminated or duplicated as
        circumstances may require. Additionally, the sequence of the
        elements of the flow path can be rearranged in a variety of
        orders to accommodate particular purification needs. For
        example, referring to FIG. 6, a block diagram illustrating a
        water flow path 500 in accordance with another embodiment of a
        water purification system is shown that is similar in many
        respects to the water purification system described above. In
        this flow path, water flows into a prefilter 520 from the
        condenser 512 and from the prefilter 520 to the water heating
        apparatus 530. Water then flows from the water heating apparatus
        530 to a post filter 570 that has only an activated carbon
        filter. As another example, the water could be sent through the
        water heating apparatus 630 twice to ensure thorough
        pasteurization, as shown in the water flow path 600 of FIG. 7.
        Thus, the filtration train can be tailored to meet the needs of
        a particular filtration application.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] The present invention also provides for a method for
        purifying water, including obtaining water from a condenser and
        filtering the water with a pre-filter to remove larger
        contaminants from the water. The water can be heated with a
        water heating apparatus to a predetermined temperature for a
        predetermined length of time to reduce active biological
        contaminants in the water. The water heating apparatus can
        include a thermal energy source and a heat exchanger for
        transferring heat from the thermal energy source to the water.
        The water can be cooled in a cooling unit. The water can also be
        filtered with an activated carbon filter to decrease
        contaminants in the water.<br>
        <br>
        [0046] The method of purifying water or sanitizing the unit can
        also include ozonating the water by injecting ozone from an
        ozone source into the water or unit.<br>
        <br>
        [0047] The step of obtaining water from a water source can also
        include extracting water from surrounding air with a condenser
        in an air conditioner or dehumidifier. Additionally, the step of
        filtering the water from the cooling unit can also include
        passing the water through an activated carbon filter to decrease
        contaminants in the water. Moreover, the step of filtering the
        water from the cooling unit can also include exposing the water
        from the activated carbon filter to an ultraviolet light source
        to reduce active biological contaminants in the water.<br>
