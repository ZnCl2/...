      Hermann Plauson was an Estonian professor, engineer and inventor.
      Plauson investigated, among other things, the production of power
      based on atmospheric electricity.<br>
      Biography<br>
      <br>
      Plauson was the director of the Fischer-Tropsch "Otto Traun
      Research Laboratories" in Hamburg, Germany during the Weimar
      Republic of the 1920s. He built on Nikola Tesla's idea for
      connecting machinery to the "wheelwork of nature". Plauson's
      patent no. 1540998 describe methods to convert alternating radiant
      static electricity into rectified continuous current pulses. His
      systems mainly involved needle &amp; radium- coated electricity
      conducting balloons or aerostats which were connected to complex
      converting systems consisting of coils, capacitors, spark gaps
      etc. He developed an electrostatic generator called Plauson's
      converter. In 1920, Plauson published a research journal on the
      subject, titled "Production and Utilization of the Atmospheric
      Electricity" (Gr., Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphärischen
      Elektrizität). A second, expanded edition of his journal was
      published later the same year. A copy of that edition is in the
      British Library at shelf mark 8754.b.36. A copy is also available
      in PDF-format, complete with Optical Character Recognition,
      through the books2ebooks service, here.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that Plauson was related to Gertrud Plauson (the
      exact relationship is unknown; she may have been his wife)...<br>

      </b><b>Use of Beta-rays and X-rays in Synthesizing Liquid
        Hydro-carbons From Gaseous Compound</b>s<br>
      <br>
      Liquid hydrocarbons are synthesized by subjecting gaseous carbon
      compounds; such as are contained in water gas, coke oven gas,
      natural gas and gases produced by cracking heavy oils, to the
      action of rapidly moving electrons (#-rays) or the joint action of
      #-rays and X-rays. The reaction may be assisted by rotating
      electric and/or electromagmetic field and by catalyst in
      suspension in the reacting gases. The velocity of the rays should
      exceed one half the velocity of light and is suitably 200,000 to
      260,000 kilometres per sec. The gases after exposure to the rays
      remain in a reactive condition the effect of which is obtained by
      circulating the gases under pressure. In addition to hydrocarbons,
      ketones, alcohols &amp;c. are obtained particularly if the gases
      contain water vapour. Higher boiling point hydrocarbons may be
      obtained by subjecting those of lower boiling point to the
      radiations. According to an example water gas after subjection to
      radiations is compressed to 800-1000 atmospheres and maintained at
      this pressure for a time depending on conditions of radiation,
      temperature and the type of hydrocarbon to be produced. The
      hydrocarbon produced is mainly of saturated nature. The addition
      of ethylene, acetylene or other unsaturated hydrocarbons to the
      water gas shortens the process.<br>

      </b><b>Historical Research</b><br>
      <br>
      The leader in this field before the Second World War appears to
      have been Dr Hermann Plauson. Dr Plauson was an Estonian citizen
      who lived in Hamburg and Switzerland. He carried out experiments
      in Finland with aerostats manufactured from magnesium-aluminium
      alloy, covered with electrolytically deposited needles. The
      needles were further doped with a radium compound to increase
      local ionisation of the air. (This was the era in which the hands
      of watches were hand painted with radium to make them luminous in
      the dark).&nbsp; Zinc amalgam patches were also painted onto the
      aerostats.&nbsp; Plauson obtained a power output of between 0.72kW
      and 3.4kW from one and two aerostats 300m above ground level. Dr
      Plauson filed patents in the USA, Great Britain and Germany in the
      1920s. His book "Gewinnung und Verwertung der Atmosphärischen
      Elektrizität" is the most detailed known account of the
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      Other atmospheric electricity researchers contemporary to Dr
      Plauson included Walter Pennock and MW Dewey in the USA, Andor
      Palencsar in Hungary and Dr Heinrich Rudolph in Germany.&nbsp;
      Hippolyte Charles Vion in Paris predated them all, putting forward
      proposals in the 1850s and 1860s.<br>
      <br>
      Heinrich Rudolph made an interesting contribution to the design of
      the aerostat collectors.&nbsp; In 1898 he designed an elliptical
      aerostat made up of faceted surfaces to minimise the effect of
      wind.&nbsp; The design bears a strong resemblance to Northrop's
      2003 UCARS unamnned helicopter UAV project.&nbsp; The design uses
      the Coanda Effect to help keep the aerostat on station and
      minimise wind effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MIR's Research Programme</b><br>
      <br>
      Since 1997 we have been carrying out theoretical research into
      conversion of atmospheric electricity into useable electrical
      power.<br>
      <br>
      From a low level (5m high) simple zinc antenna we are able to
      obtain sufficient charge to light a number of white power LEDs.
      Further experimental investigations with metallic aerostat
      collectors and cavity resonant slow wave antennae concepts are
      ongoing.<br>
      <br>
      A number of programmes are underway in developing countries to
      provide remote communities with LED lighting instead of
      conventional incandescent lighting. LEDs are a very efficient way
      to provide lighting for minimal electrical power
      requirements.&nbsp; Atmospheric electricity would be ideally
      suited to powering domestic LED lighting or low energy neon
      lighting.<br>
      <br>
      There is every reason to believe from our experimental tests and
      earlier research by Plauson, Jefimenko and others that Atmospheric
      Electricity will be able to provide practically useful levels of
      electrical power particularly suited for off-grid applications in
      the developing world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages of Atmospheric Electricity</b><br>
      <br>
      Simple and robust technology<br>
      Low Cost technology - much cheaper than photovoltaics or wind
      turbines<br>
      Available day and night in all weather conditions - in fact, more
      power is produced at night than during the day<br>
      Available at any point on the Earth's surface...<br>

      HERMANN PLAUSON, Harmburg 1920<br>
      <br>
      Vorwort.<br>
      <br>
      Motto: Wem es gelang in ein Geheimnis der Natur zu dringen Und
      dies in Menschenpflicht der Menschheit darzubringen, Der betet die
      Natur und ihrer Wunder Fülle an.Verfasser.<br>
      <br>
      Es ist schwierig und wenig dankbar, ein Buch über ‘ein Gebiet zu
      schreiben, das bis heute fast noch gänzlich unberührt ist.<br>
      <br>
      Obwohl die Lehre über atmosphärische Elektrizität an und für sich
      schon in gewissen Kreisen bekannt und einigermaßendurchforscht
      ist, auch sogar einige theoretische Abhandlungen über dieses
      Gebiet geschrieben sind, so ist umgekehrt auf dem Gebiete der
      technischen Gewinnung, Umwandlung und Verwertung von
      atmosphärischer Elektrizität bis jetzt nochnichts bekannt. Es kann
      sogar festgestellt werden, daß einige Wissenschaftler eine
      Gewinnung und Verwertung deratmosphärischen Elektrizität in der
      Praxis überhaupt bestreiten.<br>
      <br>
      Wenn nun trotzdem der Verfasser dieses Wagnis unternommen hat, so
      trieb ihn vor allen Dingen die außerordentlicheWichtigkeit der
      Lösung dieser Frage für die Menscheit hierzu und dann die auf
      Grund von Versuchen erhaltenepersönliche Überzeugung, daß bei
      Verwendung aller wissenschaftlichen Errungenschaften und
      Forschungsergebnisse derletzten Jahre auf dem Gebiete der
      atmosphärischen und statischen Elektrizität, bei Benutzung der
      Erfahrungen auf demGebiete der drahtlosen Telegraphie und
      Telephonie, wie der Erzeugung von ungedämpften Schwingungen
      überhaupt,ferner unter Zugrundelegung der Lehre über
      radioaktive’Erscheinungen und deren Folgen viel größere
      Energiemengengesammelt werden können, als bisher nach den
      theoretischen Berechnungen zu erwarten war, die auf Grund
      desnormalen, vertikalen Leitungsstromes gelten die Erde, sowie auf
      Grund der Gesamtladung der Erde angestellt wurden.<br>
      <br>
      s wurde vom Verfasser festgestellt, daß dies erreiCht wird sowohl
      durch Erhebung voll metallischen Ballons mitradioaktiven
      Substanzen und elektrolytisch hergestellten Nadeln usw., als auch
      durch geeignete weitere Verwendung undVmwandlungsart dieses
      Stromes (Umwandlung statischer Elektrizität in mehr oder weniger
      hochschwingendedynamische) sowie durch Verwendung geeigneter
      Kondensatorenbatterien und dereff Einschaltungsweise und
      zuletztdurch geeignete Schaltungsschemata. Versuche ergabeff aber,
      daß noch zahlreiche neue Vorfragen zu lösen waren, und datl der
      Ausbau des Problems, Verwertung der atmosphärischen Elektrizität,
      auf ganz neuen Grundlagen erfolgen mußte. Der Verfasser hofft
      durch diese Schrift den Beweis zu erbringen, daß er auch dieses
      erreichtoder wenigstens die Wege dazu angegeben hat.<br>
      <br>
      Das zweite Ziel des Verfassers ist, durch baldiges Erscheinen
      dieses Buches breite Kreise der Wissenschaft und Elektrotechnik
      fürdiese Frage zu interessieren, und durch die im Buche
      angegebenen Anregungen möglichst viele Mitarbeiter zu gewinnen.<br>
      <br>
      Es sei ferner noch gesagt, daß das Buch nicht eine abgeschlossene
      Forschungsarbeit zu sein beansprucht, sondern vielmehr als
      ersterVersuch, als Wegweiser in der vorliegenden Frage zu
      betrachten ist. Es bleibt sowohl in der Schreibart als auch in der
      Anordnung desMaterials noch viel zu wünschen übrig, da das Buch
      zum Teil aus Patentschriften des Verfassers entstanden ist, zum
      Teil aus einemVortrag über atmosphärische Elektrizität, den der
      Verfasser vor einer Versammlung von Fachleuten gehalten hat, um
      den Bau einerMusteranlage zu propagieren.<br>
      <br>
      Veranlaßt durch das rege Interesse größerer Kreise für diese
      Frage, läßt der Verfasser dieses Buch sich seinen Weg selbst
      bahnen undbittet, etwa infolge der Eile sich fühlbar machenden
      Mängeln gegenüber nachsichtig zu sein.<br>
      <br>
      Bei der Zusammenstellung dieses Buches wurde folgende
      Literaturbenutzt:<br>
      <br>
      Mache &amp; Schweidler: “Die atmosphärische Elektrizität”Dr. I.
      Zenneck: “Elektromagnetische.Schwingungen und drahtlose
      Telegraphie”<br>
      Dr. M. Dieckmann: “Experimentelle Untersuchungen aus dem
      Grenzgebietzwischen drahtloser Telegraphie und Luftelektrizität”I.
      Teil Teil (Zeitschrift fÜr Luftfahrt und Wissenschaft,2. Heft).<br>
      <br>
      Für Leser, die dieses Gebiet nicht völlig beherrschen oder
      Einzelhejten darüber wissen wollen, sei zum besseren Verständnis
      dieserAbhandlung empfohlen, vorgenanntes Werk: Mache &amp;
      Schweidler .Die “atmosphärischeElektrizität”, VerlagVieweg &amp;
      Sohn,Braunschweig, durchzulesen.<br>
      <br>
      Es ist dem Verfasser zum Schluß eine angenehme Pflicht, Herrn H.
      Otto Traun für die ihm erwiesenen Unterstützungen seineDankbarkeit
      auch an dieser Stelle auszudrücken.<br>
      <br>
      Ferner möchte der Verfasser nichtversäumen, Herrn Max Thorn zu
      danken für die erste Anregung, die gesammelten Erfahrungen
      undKenntnisse der Allgemeinheit nicht länger vorzuenthalten, und
      für die Bemühungen zur Finanzierung einer hoffentlich irn Jahre
      1920 zu erbauenden Versuchsanlage, wodurch dieWichtigkeit dieses
      Problems irn Großen praktisch vor Augen geführt werden soll.<br>
      <br>
      Schließlich spricht der Verfasser Herrn Dr.-Ing. Gerhard Schmitt
      und seiner Assistentin, Fräulein Gertrud Hildenbrandt,für
      freundliche Übernahme der Korrektur, sowie Herrn Ing. Hans Koop
      für Ausfertigung der Zeichnungen an dieser Stelleseinen wärmsten
      Dank aus.<br>

      Der Verlagsbuchhandlung sei für die anerkennenswerte Ausstattung
      des Buches und besonders für die guteAusführungder Figurentafeln
      hiermit der besondere Dank des Verfassers ausgedrückt.<br>

      The production and utilization of atmospheric electricity for the
      well-being and prospering of mankind is a goal of scholars and
      researchers; the implementation remained however until today a
      pious desire, and it did not succeed to somewhat really reach [
      WertvoJles ] and for industrial purposes usable.<br>
      <br>
      The cause for this is not to be looked for in the fact that the
      electricity freely available in atmospheric air is not to be
      exploited at all, but primarily in that the science before
      solution of this problem had to solve a set from preliminary
      questions to, by their clarifying only the possibility of an
      utilization of atmospheric electricity became at all conceivable.<br>
      <br>
      Only in the last years their utilization could be made due to new
      experiences and investigations on that areas of the atmospheric
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      If we try many ages [ zurückwand~rn ] and to investigate the past
      according to data concerning atmospheric electricity then we must
      notice with being astonished the fact that nothing is new in the
      world that for a long time, for a very long time before the
      knowledge of the electricity at all admits the features of the
      atmospheric electricity was and that they, what appears still less
      [ glaublich ] were even used.<br>
      <br>
      The knowledge of the effect and utilization of atmospheric
      electricity hand back already many thousand years, as we can infer
      from the holy writing. Thus we read all geweihten persons, with
      exception of the upper priest in the Bible Moses that the
      tabernacle in all-holiest of the temple Jehova possessed the power
      to kill when affecting by a thunderbolt or a fire. Furthermore we
      read that 40 priests had dared enter in the absence of Moses and
      Aaron, and that from the tabernacle lightning drove out, which
      killed all 40 priests. If we experience now far from the books of
      the kings the design of the new temple by king Salomon, then from
      the electrotechnical point of view can only come only to a
      conclusion that Moses and Aaron knew already at that time as one
      could collect an unknown godlike power from the tabernacle, as one
      had to [ aurbewahren ] the same, and as it worked, because
      of-today's point of view of the Wissenschart regarded the federal
      drawer can have been nothing else as a Leyden bottle or a
      condenser of very large capacity, which by means of arranged
      points was loaded with atmospheric electricity . The fact that the
      charge kept itself good and worked well is only the constant shop
      with atmospheric electricity to attribute as well as the dry
      climate in Palestine.<br>
      <br>
      It comes out from the Biblical description that the ssundeslade
      out well isolationable noble wood had fitted made and also gold
      and such a thing from the inside and outside. Thereby all
      conditions were erffillt rur a good electrical condenser or a
      Leyden jar.<br>
      <br>
      E.G. the gentleman writes the Moses forwards (2. Book Moses,
      Chap.25, verse 10-15) <br>
      <br>
      Furthermore still is given the description of the building in the
      Chap.37-38. An electrical engineer could not make it better
      nowadays, wanted it follows a Leyden jar to build for the purpose,
      humans a [ göttliche Kraft ] the Ungeweihte to kill immediately
      can to lead before eyes or to&nbsp; pretend.<br>
      <br>
      The charge of the federal drawer with atmospheric electricity in
      the all-holiest was obtained by many columns and golden points. In
      addition, the whole temple was, as from the description
      hervorgehl, provided with hundreds of gilded points, by presenting
      gold on zedern and acacia wood bars.<br>
      <br>
      03<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The fact that here really electrical discharges took place can do
      out following in 2. Book of the Chronicles, Chap.7, verse 3,
      described place to be taken DAuch saw falling down all children
      Israel the fire and the glory of the gentleman over the house, and
      fell to their knees, with the face to the earth and prayed on and
      thanked the sir, it good-naturedly are eternal and its mercy lich
      last. “People saw here the impact of lightning into the lightning
      conductor established on the temple. DI1ss the collection and
      Aufbewl1hrung of the atmospheric<br>
      <br>
      Electricity much gefäh " to be rlich could, if someone did not
      understand with the federal drawer to deal, read 'we further in
      the 3. Book Moses, chapter 10, where the sons Aarons, Nl1dl1b and
      Ahibu wanted to bring, d~m Mr. Freudenfeuer, what the Mr. them not
      ordered hatteWir to read that a fire proceeded from the gentleman
      and it verzehrte, so that they died before the gentleman.<br>
      <br>
      From everything it is evident that Moses were and its
      contemporaries the first connoisseurs and Ausnutzer of the
      atmospheric electricity. Were not natural them, how us, which
      admits to electrical laws separate only the effects of these
      mystischen Kraft. These features are probable the culturally more
      highly standing Egyptians even already admit been, and Moses may
      have bring along its knowledge of the priests from Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      From this time to the attempts Frl1nklins with BJitz the
      production of atmospheric electricity made only small progress for
      arresters and Rimans attempts. With the study of the meteorology
      the large interest in the atmospheric electricity was again
      excited, and in the last 30 years several times the thought
      stepped to light to use it. Which was already done in this regard
      by other researchers, I try to describe in the connection hieran
      briefly, by lighting up this question I1m of best patents spent
      through in former times.<br>
      <br>
      The first patent, that according to indication German realm Reich
      office, is that is given D.R.P. No. 98180 of the t9. January 1897.

      Description.<br>
      <br>
      Net for collecting atmospheric electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The subject of available invention forms, with approximately 3.6
      million needles an occupied, ungefäh~ 9 hectars large and net
      which can be held by a kite chain balloon in 1000~2000 rn heavy
      against 700 kg for height for accumulating atmospheric electricity
      together with the mechanisms erforderiichen for isolated
      derivative For the clarification of the state of affairs is
      emphasized that those.<br>
      <br>
      For the clarification of the state of affairs is emphasized that
      those Franklin attempts the possibility of the derivative of
      atmospheric electricity for the earth long did that it concerns
      however with the voriiegenden invention particularly around the
      described mechanism, such, which suggests a commercially usable
      amount of energy of the derived atmospheric electricity. Which
      concerns the aids to the commercial utilization of the net
      described in being inferior, then is referred to the patent No.
      98288 standing with available article in closest Zusammenhange. In
      the enclosed design a such net is together with the kite chain
      balloon in Fig. 1 in front view represented, Fig. a side view
      shows 2, while the Fig. 3-5 details represent.<br>
      <br>
      A such net N (Fig. 1) can be manufactured by means of two ungerahr
      300 rn long casting steel tubes R R, by 1 mm of wall thickness and
      2 cm diameters, which will receive the same by Ineinanderschieben
      of individual pipes from production length and fastening by small
      steel pins with screwed on safeguard panels. These pipes are to
      form the two horizontal sides of the square net, between which
      about 1200 vertical bronze wires of 300 are to be stretched rn
      length and 0.04 qmm cross section in distances of 0,25 rn. Since
      rn much purifies the thin wires in distances of 0,1 and length
      sharpens needles of 1 cm carry must, then they are wound meanwhile
      before slowly on Rol) EN and the needles with the help of a
      springy eye open at their lower end are touched down. The eye must
      selbs (understandably the wire size so adapted to be that it
      wedges deQ wire and that the needles sit sufficient firmly. Also
      rolling up must happen sufficient loosely, so that the put on
      needles do not break. The main difficulty such a square network of
      300 rn side length offers an installing and a removing the same,
      the whatever latter in Ausnahmerallen becomes necessary - can. Is
      necessary for it a number of man-high posts (p), in<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      05<br>
      <br>
      Rn lineally and all two axle camps I are one behind the other set
      up to distances from 7 to 8 possess (Fig. 3). Built up on the same
      the two 300 rn are enough for Slahlrohre R R, and provided with
      the necessary hooks, by lelztere safeguard panels small by
      boreholes of the pipes put, and become screwed on!? n. Whereupon
      wires are to be stretched from Pfoslen to posts, on which the
      necessary number of roles with the needle-occupied bronze wires
      is. The ends of the same are raised to the hooks a Slahlrohres
      geknlipfl and the latter by the Fesselballon, which is to carry
      the net, so that the bronze wires of the roles complete
      themselves. So that the dlinne steel tube no bend experience, it
      is carried by 40 Gussslahldrähten, which hang on the hook for the
      chain cable and branch out toward their lower end three-way, so
      that they can be befesligt in distances of approximately 2.5 rn at
      the mentioned pipe. Dieseiben are in their length like that
      abzugleicheil that they form approximately an equal-leg triangle
      of 250 rn for height, whose basis is the pipe carried by them also
      they need to have only 1 qmm cross section against the center,
      during toward the ends of the pipe a Quersc--hnitt of 2 qmm
      necessarily isl.<br>
      <br>
      If the needle-occupied bronze wires are completed, then they
      become to the zweile steel tube geknüpfl. After 31 bronze wires of
      0,13 qmm Querschnilt without NadelQ, further on the opposite side
      of this pipe in distances of 10 rn, are beftlstigt for the
      derivative of the Elektrizilät, the net so because is lifted,
      until about 1000 rn the chain cable by the hoist of an anchor car
      it is completed, on which to the cable it fastens the bronze wires
      jointly but becomes only so loosely strained that the net
      down-hangs almost vertically, with its surface senkrechI the
      Windrichlung. If the net is to be removed again, then
      approximately in reverse way, only with the difference that
      thereby small electric motors at each second post step into
      activity, those will proceed by wheels with a removable Cutout, by
      which they can be touched down easily on the lower pipe, the
      latter in revolution to shift and the needle-occupied wires to the
      same to complete.<br>
      <br>
      It can occur however the case that for the acceptance of the net
      in this way sufficient Zeil does not remain, if approaching storm
      with a larger wind force than 25 rn the rapid salvage of the
      Fesselballons behind a wind protection with the help of, the
      electrically operated Anke running on rails " rwagens makes
      advisable. Then \ ias net on a sufficient even must Place easily
      on the ground to be established,<br>
      <br>
      06<br>
      <br>
      similarly as one things materials in folds puts, then it could be
      lifted later again intact into air.<br>
      <br>
      In order to be able to notice also a large wind force in 1000 to
      2000 rn height with relative peace at the soil, a Federdynamometer
      put onable in any place without detachment of the chain cable must
      steadily the tension of the latter anteigen. If such a case of
      strong upper wind arises, then the bare short binding is naturally
      already sufficient to the safety device of the balloon and net<br>
      <br>
      Which concerns the potential of the atmospheric electricity, then
      a potential gradient of 150 V for I is rn as always available to
      regard after numerous observations. For 1500 rn height would
      result in that 225000 V. If one wants to charge a battery with the
      received river from 20000 one behind the other switched
      accumulators, then it requires a charging voltage of 45-50000 V,
      for which straight still the isolation can be accomplished. From
      it a voltage drop of 175000 V in the environment of the net, which
      after the observations over the conductivity of air with
      grösserern potential gradient a sufficient river secures, results
      particularly due to the 3.6 million of fine points of the net and
      the constant continuation of the unloading air layers from the
      wind. So that the electricity collected by the net can be derived
      now in addition, isolated, about 100 rn a long silk rope T by
      sixfold security, which is protected from wetness by an india
      rubber casing, must be switched on, into the chain cable F, and,
      be led the electricity by a special cable G of 5 qmm for casting
      steel cross section and 2 qmm copper soul downward below the
      place, where the bronze wires are fastened to the chain cable.<br>
      <br>
      While now the cable G after a well embodied, hollow iron mast M,
      is the chain cable leads to the electrically operated hoist Weines
      of anchor car fastened, which, according to kind the mobile crane
      with swivelling upper rack, provides jib and counterweight, on a
      circular rail gel ice with approximately 20 rn radius around the
      mentioned hollow mast to move can, so that it is able to follow
      each change of the wind direction. The jib of the anchor car
      serves to keep the lower horizontal part so high the Seilkurve
      described by the Fesselballon over that ground that it does not
      schJeift.<br>
      <br>
      It is necessary that cables and chain cables are from each other
      distant in air always far for enough, in order to prevent an upper
      jumping of the high voltage stream. That is possible by a tauter
      tension of the easier Lejtungska~~ls. DeshaJb goes this, after it
      by a slip ring G carried by e1nem Olisolator<b> </b>is led, by an
      isolating india rubber pipe, by about 10 rn high mast down to a
      hand winch w present under oil, whose drum provided with steel
      axle is formed by porcelain or ebonite, so that one can with each
      change of the length of the chain cable for the case of zero wind
      or storm also the cable accordingly stop and again stretch<br>
      <br>
      From the hollow mast M out the line goes underground through one.
      Channel up oil insulators under the gel ice for the anchor car
      away and then as high voltage air line after the battery station,
      which can be established also for several balloon stations
      together.<br>
      <br>
      There a double battery of 20000 small accumulators each is to be
      set up, from which always a battery delivers river, while the
      other one is loaded. For this purpose one must be able to switch
      everyone one behind the other into approximately 300 groups at
      will neben¬ and. The accumulators must rest by groups on racks,
      which are carried by oil insulators.<br>
      <br>
      From apparatuses are on a battery station except usual flat

      depending upon current direction in or to other sequence in

      <br>
      The last device is particularly important for the utilization of
      the extraordinary, but sign after rapidly changing electrical
      tensions of the thunderstorm and heap clouds, that large Konduk
      gates and condensers of the atmospheric electricity.<br>

      secured against each destructive spark discharge All apparatuses
      except 2, 4 " and 5 must have contacts from platinum and for
      preventing of sparking and fusion under oil are. All work on the
      high voltage transmission line before by means of laliger ebonite
      seaweeds ground fault is made, whereby for preventing of
      short-circuit the line must be interrupted at the same time to the
      battery thus the tension sinks on zero. On the balloon stations
      are necessary: the apparatuses I, 4, 5 and 6, the latters however
      without dare and only with electromagnet in that Ground conductor
      to the Unterbl echung (Fig.4). The Schienerigeleise must on. the
      ground conductor of the balloon station put its, füi' the case
      that once the cable puts over the anchor car or the chain cable
      affected.<br>
      <br>
      If one takes now managing patent application under the magnifying
      glass of the criticism, then it must be stated that the
      Erfindungsgedanke for the following reasons cannot be
      lebensflihig:<br>
      <br>
      # The balloons must possess very large volume, since they are to
      carry d1e of large heavy nets and the strong rope. The latters
      must be strong, so that they are not torn up by the storm.<br>
      <br>
      # The expansion of such a plant over large surfaces - z. B. IQO
      qkm - is therefore: A) commercially impossible, because a great
      many balloons of this kind were needed, which would be enormously
      expensive, and B) practically not executably, because one cannot
      secure such large balloons in large heights sufficient before
      storm also the same, there made of things, ground very fast leaky.
      From it large dangers for humans, the result if such a balloon
      tear off and from leak from on earth fall, became a Kurzschussnt
      stand, the tremendous disaster, which death of many humans could
      entail.<br>
      <br>
      For above reasons already this patent is not usable nevertheless
      is it interesting because of the attempt, which so collected
      electricity to the charge of a double battery of over 20000 small
      accumulators, from which the energy delivers, while the other one
      is loaded. Such a system would be the most ideal solution of the
      Transforming of atmospheric electricity into low tension usable
      for the technology. Because of the isolation difficulties it is
      however unfortunately impossible to load 20000 elements with
      approximately 50000 V 1 more user that the initial costs of the
      40000 elements would be too expensive, completely apart from the
      fact that the maintenance of these batteries do not only require
      many people, but also with large danger for the supervision
      personnel it would be connected.<br>

      derivative of the atmospheric electricity must the same now of the
      water droplets ab¬leiten. This is way-reached after available
      invention on the following<br>
      <br>
      With pointed needles of provided catching bodies of mög lchst
      large surface becomes into higher air-laminated? moved, however by
      a suitable heating device continual warms up. By the heat water
      droplets become! dey the catching bodies directly surrounded, the
      capacity the same evaporates decreases aJI¬mählich, and thus the
      tension of the charge rises.<br>
      <br>
      It is now easy evidently that the whole charge of the droplets, as
      soon as the same evaporated, on which catching body Über¬gehen
      becomes, from which it be derived can. U m however the evaporated
      and their charge robbed droplets by new and loaded to replace,
      becomes the catching body the surrounding enclosed design
      schematically represented, in Pig. 6 and 7 by the opinion and the
      cut of the catching balloon. Pig. the deriving device, Pig.9 the
      regulation device, pi shows 8! (. 10 and II a shovel in their two
      positions, Pig. 12 and 13 the circuit way of the rheostatischen
      machine in their two air in relative motion shifts. A remark
      example of the invention article is up positions.<br>
      <br>
      The pre-adjust consists of a double-walled balloon I, 2, the light
      wire nets, favourably from aluminum wire, occupied with one with
      needles, covered is. The balloon carries also the net 3, on which
      the ring 4 made from firm, but light material (wood, pipe etc.) is
      fastened. The latter carries the basket 6 by means of the cords 5.
      In the level of the ring 4 still the ring 7, that is by those
      easily swivelling gelagenen shovels (9) spread and by dle cords 8
      in its position held w! about SI haufeln of covered framework with
      light material, whose turn in both directions is limited by the
      notices 10, consists. The shovels form with the vertical one
      appropriately an angle from 60 to 70 degrees. All wire nets,
      cords, rings and shovels can be covered? with small Metallna'deln,
      which are connected among themselves leading. Of the area II fühn
      of the deepest point the pipe 26, formed by dje Doppel¬wände of
      the balloon, too, which in the 'basket 6 untergebrach1en coiled
      tube 12, which is again with your in the upper Tei, 1 of the
      intermediate area II connected to flowing pipe 13. The coiled
      tube: becomes by means of a suitable heating source it heats up
      whereby between the Dappelwänden of the balloon continual warm
      gases vein air flow rotates.<br>
      <br>
      Under the basket with the wire nets leiiend ver¬bundene ball
      bearings 14 are attached, its tap with sorgi: iltig isolated, easy
      and sufficient is connected for firm cables 15 leading.<br>
      <br>
      On the surface of the earth the hoist 16 (Fig.6) is, by means of
      which the balloon can be down-pulled and brought to the rise, as
      soon as the internal balloon with illuminating gas or hydrogen is
      gefüljt.<br>
      <br>
      With the increase of the balloon the carried out over liquid work
      can be stored in any accumulator and be made usable with the
      Niederziehen of the balloon. The end of the cable core is at one
      at the axle of the hoist isoJiert attached collector firmly, from
      which the electricity is derived by means of a sliding contact.
      Collecting the electricity takes place by means of the fact that
      the balloon is down-moved by means of the hoist continual up and.<br>
      <br>
      With this movement the balloon receives a turn, which will not
      change its sense by the shovels 9, since during the transition of
      the rise to sinking the balloon or turned around the shovels are
      tilted by air resistance, and therefore the balloon the turning
      movement in the same sense to give. In order to avoid here a turn
      of the cable, the ball bearing 14 is intended. The fact that the
      turn of the balloon takes place with on and descending in the same
      direction illuminates from the following.<br>
      <br>
      The shovels 9 are easily swivelling, whereby the axis of rotation
      does not fall into the center line the same. Hierdl1rch places
      itself the shovel with the downward course of the balloon in in
      Fig. 10 drawn position, and der' balloon is from right to left
      turned. During the upward course the shovel tilts, b it the lower
      notice 10 limited (Fig. I). IE one sees, takes place the drive
      from above after air flow arranged downward again from left to
      right, the balloon can thus its direction of rotation maintained.
      By this up and Niederbewegen and tricks of the balloon the purpose
      that the same with as much as possible water particles floating in
      air into contact comes, is reached.<br>
      <br>
      Of collector rings 17 derived electricity nJn a too high and much
      too much a changing tension possesses, in order to be able to be
      veaertet directly. Since one maintains accumulators too ladan and
      only the easily adjustable river with an irregular
      Elektrizitätsquelle first the same further used, then one must to
      the shop of the accumulators the electricity on more constant,
      derived from the collector 17, stretches! to receive lng. search
      and those<br>
      <br>
      12<br>
      <br>
      Tension also into belleutend a lower transform. Since one has to
      do it however in this Fa1le with a direct current, then usual
      transformers can not be used for this purpose. In addition the
      Electricity in this case possesses a much to large tension, so
      that when using common transformers the largest part of the
      collected electricity would come again into loss. 'The only
      applicable method is for this purpose the transformation by means
      of the planning ashes rheostaischen machine, by this high-tension
      electricity almost completely without loss transforj11iert will
      can. Thereby the question of the transformation would be solved
      only the preservation of the constant tension remains for more.
      This is reached in the following way:<br>
      <br>
      Rheostatische machine 18 or only one part of the plates stands for
      the latter change-over of the rheostatischen machine with any
      charge measurer (electrometer) in connection, whose mobile part
      closes one, contact, what is caused, how the same unloaded. The
      potential sinks, and the ElektromeIer takes its initial position,
      whereby the Slrom umschailung the causative Elektromagnelen
      becomes interrupted and the P'atten of the rheoslatischen machine
      tension geschaltel. Then now to the erneulen charge ferlig and is
      again unloaded with the beslimmten tension. This play repeats
      itself continual, so long the apparatus in the enterprise stehl.<br>
      <br>
      To the easier understanding the pattern of the rheoslatischen
      machine is indicated. Fig. the load position shows 12. The panel
      42 is connected with the Fesselballon, while the last panel is led
      to the earth. Fig. the unloading position shows 13. In Fig. the
      rheostalische machine is drawn 8 in the load position, and that
      simplicity half is not the connection of the panel of 42 with that
      contacts 17 gezeichnt just like also the contacts for the
      unloading position (Fig. 13) is omitted.<br>
      <br>
      With the elektrostalischen Schaltapparat' (Fig. 9) combined effect
      of the mechanism is the following:<br>
      <br>
      The contact roller 27 (Fig. ) always one brings to 9 by the
      feather/spring 37 into the load position. In addition axle a
      Electromagnet 35 is gekeilt, and at the rack the firm magnet 36
      attached on d1e. If now the electromagnet 35 is energized, it
      turns the contact roller under Überwindung of the spring action
      into the Enlladestellung. Damil the excitation 'umschallende?
      Electromagnets selbs, ttälig with a certain tension take place, is
      a elektrostalischer switch (Fig.9) indicate-indicating eight.<br>
      <br>
      That mil the earth connected voucher of the letzlen or the voucher
      of any other condenser is not with the balls 29 and 32 connected.
      If now into the Ladestellung¬ the potential rises, then the balls
      push off each other more and more, until the mobile ball 32
      provided with the fork 33 dips into two Queck¬silbernäpfchen and
      thus the river exciting from the battery 3 supplied and the
      swivelling electromagnets 35 closes or this current conclusion by
      means of relays cause lets.<br>
      <br>
      One can regulate the amount of the tension, with which this
      current conclusion and thus the unloading of the rheostatischen
      machine take place, mittel~ the adjustable weights 38 and 39. The
      apparatus is provided to the protection with the glass fall 40.
      Within the fall also one is with Chlorkalzium gefUIlte bowl 41.<br>
      <br>
      As long as the tension at the balls 29 and 32 remains constant,
      the outflow, concomitantly the excitation of the magnet continues
      the accumulators receive the utilizable stream. If the condensers

      play of neuern can begin. At larger electric charges which can be
      derived two rheostatische machines can work abaechselnd, so that,
      while the one will unload, which can be loaded others. It is now
      easily evident that, if the capacity of the rheostatischen machine
      is not changed switching will always take place via the
      electrometer with the same potential of the rheostatischen machine
      " and the number of plates, thus the transformation relationship

      Execution of the Erhilzung in practice, and it is at all
      questionable whether the desired result is to be obtained thereby
      in addition are the large balloons from things with heavy metal
      nets and - sharpen to and for itself a thing offering no
      prospects.<br>
      <br>
      In the further the American patent is 1014719 from 16. January
      1912 inventors: Walter L. Pennock, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
      mentions. The patent claim reads in the translation about follows
      dermasseri: The patent protection becomes geforden for a
      collecting tank for electrical charges, which consists of a number
      of carriers and a metal net, which are held in such a way by these
      carriers that it is appropriate for particular the carrier
      mentioned above, which furthermore anchor devices possesses in one
      level and in approximately even distance, from everyone, which
      with gemein¬samen points after everyone the carrier mentioned goes
      out, which furthermore a device, the carriers in their normal
      position possesses to hold, and in addition a device attached
      between everyone of the mentioned carriers and the net, which
      permits each carrier to adapt fast and independently each changes
      of the air flow.<br>
      <br>
      Also after this patent one lets balloons from silk and such
      materials, which carry metallic collecting TZE, ascend into air.
      As is shown by the patent claim, the patent protection sought for
      the kind of the execution of the balloon herab¬hängenden leader.
      Because of this small difference of the previous patents I refrain
      from a more exact explanation.<br>
      <br>
      Would last be that D.R.P. 248580 of the 22.Juni 1912 Inventor:
      Heinrich Johannsen, Luebeck to state. its patent claim reads as
      follows: . Procedure for catching Luftelektrizilät by means of
      senk¬rechter or diagonal leaders, thereby ge marks that into the
      line a high-tension power source is switched on, for the purpose,
      the point resistance to lower. “ Patent specification. . Procedure
      for catching atmospheric electricity by means of more
      perpendicular or diagonal leaders.<br>
      <br>
      15<br>
      <br>
      Further nothing is well-known over the atmospheric electricity,
      apart from the fact, .dass in newspapers publications of shining
      successes of an inventor appear here and there, the one new
      invention to the Nutzbarmar: hung of atmospheric electricity to
      have ago made wants and for these purposes money searches.<br>
      <br>
      Tried one, with these people in connection to set, then always
      turned out that either large sums had to be paid before, in order
      at all only something details too experienced, or the invention
      always existed in gleir: hen thoughts: A balloon from silk was
      suggested, for which a net with many needles should carry. In
      which way the Anlj! ge before lightning or overvoltage to be
      g~schützt or like the transformation of the Electricity in a
      technically useful form as well as their adjustment be made
      should, of it knew itself the gentlemen neither one seriously
      thought conception out to make, still for it proofs furnish.<br>
      <br>
      From above-said it follows clearly that the attempts to win
      atmospheric electricity thereby that air balloons rise as
      collecting tanks are left, those on a non-metallic envelope of the
      ballon --herein all inventors agree - a metallic Ergebnie of the
      preliminary tests<br>
      <br>
      16<br>
      <br>
      Sammel1: 1etz carried, to the goal to lead could not. The balloon
      had to large loads to carry and received therefore to large
      extent. Large attack regions, so that surely tearing the whole
      collecting TZE was to be foreseen had storm, Regenund other
      atmospheric influences, without talking about the fact to that
      such large envelopes of the balloon lost dauarnd large quantities
      gas by diffusion. Thus its use and Rentabllitat were impossible,
      even if a collection of atmospheric electricity möglfch seems to
      in this way actually be.<br>
      <br>
      The second error of the past attempts was that all inventors the
      atmospheric Electricity eusserst directly as statisihen direct
      current of high tension and Ieiner Stromsterke to use wanted.
      Nearly insurmountable difficulties of the isolation and adjustment
      face this application. Procedures, which permit, this kind
      Electricity into another, less gerährliche form, which was not
      technically usable commodity, too yerwandeln, yet well-known,
      which had everything only is found.<br>
      <br>
      All this had to be found only.<br>
      <br>
      Hauptgrllnde of the blherlgen failures<br>
      <br>
      The principal reasons of the past failures can in the following
      general points to be summarized:<br>
      <br>
      All inventors thought for attaching heavy metallic nets on
      individual air balloons from nonconductive, tear upable and the
      gas letting through materials as collecting tanks.<br>
      <br>
      No means had been used, in order to increase the ionization of the
      collection coefficients of the collector nets by artificial means
      (radioactive substances, photoelectrically working substances,
      devices for the education of ultraviolet jets etc.).<br>
      <br>
      No inventor has an attempt with balloon collecting tanks made from
      sheet metal.<br>
      <br>
      such metallic balloon collecting tanks however rolgende important
      possess and aur other way not advantages which can be reached:
      aluminium the metallic coverings is impenetrably for helium and
      Wasserstoff' them places gJeichzeitig Erosse metallic, weather
      remainders of Collector surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Radioactive means etc. can be easily attached inside or outside,
      whereby the ionization and thus also the collected quantity of the
      atmospheric electricity is substantially increased.<br>
      <br>
      Such balloon collecting tanks made of light alloy do not need to
      be large, since they must carry Dur their own small weight and
      that of the wring lead.<br>
      <br>
      The whole system offers therefore storm and wind w~nig to attack
      regions and becomes resistant and stable.<br>
      <br>
      One can lift and lower balloon easily by a hoist, So that all
      repairs, Nachrüllen etc., safely wlhrend the work are auaführbar.<br>
      <br>
      17<br>
      <br>
      4. No inventor recognized importance and meaning of an antenna
      collecting tank net from several individual collecting tanks,
      which are connected among themselves by electrical conductor,
      spread over the earth in air.<br>
      <br>
      5. No inventor recognized the importance of the use such high
      capacities for these purposes until today as means for the
      increase of the capacity used with production of atmospheric
      electricity condenser batteries, whose correct engagement
      conditions aus¬gearbeitet, as well as at all. (Consequence of the
      fact is that to today only extremely small electric charges and
      these in a practically useless type of current were available.)<br>
      <br>
      6. All inventors were always anxious to convert the collected
      static electricity of air directly into mechanical energy which
      encountered evenly insurmountable difficulties.<br>
      <br>
      7. So far no devices were used or intended against overvoltages,
      lightning danger etc. by the inventors. Gleichfalls was possible
      an adjustment of such an energy in no way. It is impossible to use
      the atmospheric electricity as long as the obstacles given after 1
      to 7 are not eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      The collection of the atmospheric Electricity can with the
      comparison of the...&nbsp; also on hot summer days, in a boiler,
      its ifeen iitee: Surface the sunbeams is evenly suspended, the
      water of the suns to energy-to cooking bring, although the sun mix
      also large warmth delivers.<br>
      <br>
      If one would concentrate those sunbeams however by large lenses,
      which must be substantially larger than the boiler surface, on
      essel, then one could bring the water not only to cooking, but
      even to evaporation. Without collection of the jets the
      Wärmedichte is not sufficient on given square a surface for
      heating.<br>
      <br>
      The same applies in similar sense also to the atmospheric
      electricity. If one sets up only a Antenna, then only those parts
      of the atmospheric electricity are tightened, which are in the
      proximity of the antenna. Since the density and movement speed of
      the electrically charged particles of the Atmosphere are only
      small however, then also the induced tension will be in the
      antenna wire kJein and mit¬hin also the amperage.<br>
      <br>
      The ring or netlike arranged, strongly ionizing collecting systems
      in accordance with available invention permit however to collect
      larger electric charges there it electrically charged particles
      over a surface of 1, 10, to tighten 100 or more qis fortunes. Must
      rate however here a number of other conditions considered, which
      are to be described on the basis designs later more near.<br>
      <br>
      The collection of the atmospheric electricity by means of large
      antenna system has the comparison example mentioned above
      (collection of the solarly power) opposite the following two
      advantages, which understood tons use so far nobody recognized
      and: 1. the application of large collecting surfaces (the
      individually lenses and/or mirror surfaces, which find during
      utilization OF solarly heat to application, one can emergency as
      make large, as the collecting system) 2. the large capacity of the
      collecting apparatuses for the atmospheric electricity (by the
      lenses or hollow mirrors one can affect emergency as large of
      surfaces, as with the antenna system).<br>
      <br>
      If one counts the other difficulties, which the utilization of the
      solar power in the way, like changes of the seasons, change of the
      position of the sun to the Zenith, still in addition, then it
      results that conditions for the collection of atmospheric
      electricity lie substantially more favorably. The latter is also
      not to those Application of compact collecting surfaces or at
      certain locations or such restrictions binds. It supports itself
      rather by arbitrary ring or netlike arranged wire communication,
      which are carried for set up strongly ionizing collecting antennas
      in arbitrary headroom of, ground of in even distances been
      suitable and these among themselves to connect.<br>
      <br>
      The openings such shape of set up rings or nets know all the the
      vertical antennas are more largely its, the higher, since the
      whole line delivers neither warmth nor light shade. The static
      electricity is continued to store owing to its special
      characteristics by condenser effect in the antenna wire, and it is
      possible to distribute it evenly by g~eignete engagements of
      special condenser batteries for Jn the net and to receive
      kolossale charge capacities in this way, for which there is no
      analogy with the collection of the solar power.<br>
      <br>
      For aforementioned reasons it can be counted on the fact that
      available procedure the production and Nutzb!}rmachung the
      atmospheric electricity really on a cheap and a comfortable Way
      will make possible. A lack, which adhered to all past inventions,
      was that that always one tried to transfer the electricity
      immediately into mechanical. Even if it e.g. succeeded to design
      an electrostatic generator from large strength to then would be
      nevertheless its application because of that<br>
      <br>
      19<br>
      <br>
      Difficulties of the saftey, as well as the isolation of the axles
      and other parts not possibly. Such uncommonly large tensions would
      be possible that short-circuit and spark copy could not be
      avoided. Likewise it is impossible, such large [unknown] to switch
      off (regate safely and or adjust for even load to feed engines
      with high-tension rivers foreseen from manifold other obstacles,
      which forbid at all. After available invention the atmospheric
      electricity becomes [unknown] of the new [unknown] into mecamsce
      nergle umgewan et, which differentiated EN aupt palnzips from the
      past inventions on this areas forms, [unknown], those separate the
      static electricity by antenna lines in more mospärlscher.
      Electricity in the form of direct current of very high tension and
      small amperage [unknown] runs, converted into electro-dynamic
      oscillation [unknown] energy of high Wechselzahl. Thereby many
      advantages it is enough and eliminated all disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      The electro-dynamic oscillation energy formed in closed,
      oszillatorischen electric circuits produces built machine in
      another electric circuit, e.g. in one been suitable, by
      resonance:. effect electromagnetic waves of desired size and
      mechanical effect. Furthermore the resonance effect of such rivers
      permits, , in simple and comfortable way a starting, the
      adjustment and the disconnection of such machines to cause, this
      takes place simply by means of tendency and/or detuning of the
      resonance in the transformer circle and the river flowing in the
      coil of the machine. Such rivers, except for engine enterprise,
      are further f Urverschiedene other areas derTech.nik directly
      zuyerwenden, e.g. : Lighting, production of warmth and Elektroche
      I1ie.<br>
      <br>
      In addition one knows with such rivers a set of Apparatuses
      without direct firm current inlet, completely apart from the
      possibility, they feed f Ur wireless telegraphy and telephone to
      use. In practice large difficulties were to be overcome, because
      it was not well-known, how one should design such large machines,
      and how the electromagnetic oscillations necessary for the supply
      could be adjusted by so high Wechselzahl.<br>
      <br>
      In the following a specification is to be given, how these
      questions were solved. In Fig. a simple pattern is represented 14
      for the transformation of static electricity into dynamic energy
      of high frequency. For clarity of the design is calibrates an air
      antenna, but a lnfluenzmaschine accepted. 13 and 14 ssind

      the static electricity the lnfluepzmaschine. 7 and 8 is spark
      discharge contacts, 6 and 5 switched on condensers, 9 switched on
      inductive primary coil, 11 and 12 line ends of the secondary
      winding 10. If the disk of the static electrostatic generator is
      set by a mechanical Kraft in turn, then comb collects the
      positive, the A! 1dere the negative electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The allocations of the condensers 5 and 6 are so long loaded,
      until the screen end becomes so large Spannungserhöhung that the
      spark gap will pierce 7 to 8. Since over spark gap 7 and 8, over
      condensers 6 and 5 and inductive resisted themselves 9 a closed
      electric circuit forms, so entsteheQ, as well-known, into this
      circles electromagnetic oscillations.<br>
      <br>
      High Wechselzahl<br>
      <br>
      The produced high-swinging rivers in primary circles induce rivers
      with the same frequency, jedoce of already completely
      electromagnetic nature in the secondary circle. The
      electromagnetic oscillations will maintain by new charges of the
      static electricity. If the number of turns of the primary and
      Sekundärkreises stands to each other in correct relation, which
      one can compute with correct application of the resonance
      coefficients (capacity, inductance and resistance), then one can
      convert the rivers of the primary circle with high tension in such
      arbitrarily low tension and higher amperage.<br>
      <br>
      If oscillation unloadings become weaker in primary circles or to
      diminish completely, begin more wiedrer the charge of the
      condensers with static electricity, until the spark gap will again
      pierce. All of this repeats itself so long, when of the static
      machine electricity is produced by supply of mechanical energy. It
      is not to be maintained that this application of the static
      machine and the transformation of the produced electricity do not
      admit according to above pattern in former times were such remarks
      were described already often applied and. It is stressed only
      priority on the fact that in this invention first these.<br>
      <br>
      Experimental assembly for the production of atmospheric
      electricity for practical purposes brought in application and that
      the machines (engines), necessary for such rivers, were designed,
      as well as their circuit and adjustment patterns. By this
      invention alone the possibility is given to make really
      atmospheric electricity energy source usable for the technology as
      practically comfortable 'without by the plant mortal danger for
      those people exists. It is further only by transforming the static
      atmospheric electricity been into electromagnetic oscillations
      possible, the difficulties of the isolation, the building
      construction, the adjustment, to become starting and switching
      gentleman off.<br>
      <br>
      From Fig. is evident to 15, how the arrangement for production and
      transforming of the atmospheric electricity, shown in pattern 14,
      can be used. Particularly emphasized sei' the main difference
      between these and other earlier inventions. It consists of it that
      two parallel spark gaps are an¬gewendet, from which the one as
      work distance (7) and the other one for the safety device against
      overvoltages serves.<br>
      <br>
      The latter consists of several individual Funkenstrecken with
      larger total distance than the work distance, arranged in series
      connection, and is bridged with very small capacities (aluminium,
      bl, Cl), which has the purpose to make the even sparking possible
      in the safeguard distance Continues to mean in Fig. 15 A an air
      antenna for the collection of atmospheric electricity
      (specification follows still), 13 connection of the safeguard
      spark gap with the earth, 5 and 6 condensers, 9 primary coil.<br>
      <br>
      If now by antenna A the positive, atmospheric electricity is
      anxious with the negative charge of the earth to adjust, then the
      Luftzwischenraum between the spark gaps prevents itself this
      reconciliation. How evidently from the design, the resistance of
      the spark gap is 7 lower than with that! , ndern spark gap, the
      spark gaps switched from three into series exists and consequently
      one three times larger air intermediate distance to overcome has.
      , Thus, as long as the resistance of the spark gap does not become
      7 Überlastet, unloadings take place only concerning this.<br>
      <br>
      However if the tension increases by any influences so much that it
      could become dangerous for the allocation of the condensers 5 and
      6 or for the isolation of the windings 9 and 10, then a
      non-inductive unloading takes place to the earth when correct
      regulating the resistance of the second spark gap by means of
      these, without the machine is endangered. ühne this second
      parallel arranged spark gap also larger resistance than the work
      spark gap is it possible to collect and make large quantities of
      electricity usable safely. In Fig. the simplest is selected 1,5
      represented pattern and only, in order to explain the basic
      principle. For practice ~ind more complicated patterns
      necessarily, from those the most important for usevdifferent
      intended purposes are prepared and in the following to be
      described.<br>
      <br>
      Explanation of the principle of the transformation electromagnet
      punch oscillations into meehanlsche energy<br>
      <br>
      The impact of the closed oscillation circles, consisting of spark
      gap 1 and two condensers 5 and 6, the primary coil 9, like also
      the secondary winding 10, is exactly the same, as described 14 for
      pattern. Are further in Fig. 15 schematically two motor types
      represented, which serve high Wechselzahl for the transformation
      of electromagnetic oscillations received from static electricity
      into mechanical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla Engines<br>
      <br>
      Also on that areas of the high-swinging rivers were to be solved
      difficult questions. So far only the engine system was Tesla
      admits (schematically in Fig. to 15 by 16 and 17 represented), on
      the features of the Hysteresis is based. The engine is compound
      from iron pins and metallic disks. If on the same electromagnetic
      oscillations of high Wechselzahl influence, a rotary movement is
      produced. The description of this pattern serves only for the
      explanation of the basic principle it does not have however in the
      execution of large machines any practical interest because of the
      impossibility of the adjustment and because of the low
      effectiveness<br>
      <br>
      Resonant Engines<br>
      <br>
      According to available invention all are overcome these
      difficulties by construction of a machine, which is applicable for
      elektro¬magnetische energy high change number of more or less
      absorbed nature. Mg. the first form of a such machine shows 15.
      The difference between the principle of the Bau'es of these
      engines opposite the used so far consists of the fact that the
      engine contains keide magnets and not alone on the principle is
      based to the magnetic induction (like all current engines and also
      the Tesla engines), but on combination of the pure static
      induction with the electromagnetic in the static field. Since the
      engine is intended for high-swinging rivers, then must be as
      iron-free as possible er' and manufactured made of well leading
      metal. It was now shown that for the supply of such engines
      without magnet metal rivers of more or less absorbed N cannot only
      be used atur, to switch off but that also due to their special
      characteristics opposite electromagnetic reesonance features the
      possibility is given, the engines simply and safely in and and to
      adjust. These motor types can be called about this resonance
      engines. In Pig. 15 attached engine consists in his main parts of
      individual oscillation circles briefly closed in itself. The
      electromagnetic oscillation poles both the stator (un¬beweglicher
      part of the engine) and the rotor (mobile part of the engine) are
      radially embedded or fastened in a suitable firm insulator.
      Sämlliche of oscillation circles become from the Hauplstromleitung
      of a eleklromagnetischen source of oscillation suitable frequency
      and more or less absorbed nature gespelsl. Everyone such
      oscillatory circuit exists for itself of a closed oscillation
      circle, given by self induction, Kapazitäl and Ohm's resistance.
      From it results:<br>
      <br>
      #) a Mögiichkeit to operate also with electromagnetic
      “oscillations of high Wechselzahl engines of arbitrarily high
      horse power since a sufficient number of such oscillation circles
      can be planned parallel in the engine<br>
      <br>
      #) a possibility of designing for the enterprise with
      eleklromagnetischen oscillations of high Wechselzahl also
      asynchronously working engines (for similar purposes, for those
      the current synchronous engines for usual alternating currents or.
      Three-phase alternating current to be used)<br>
      <br>
      #) a possibility of being able to count not only on a desired
      number of horse power in advance to obtain but also a
      widerslandsiähige and a simply executable construction form<br>
      <br>
      #) an ideal Ein and elimination and an adjustment of such Moloren
      by change of the resonance i.e. by change of the capacity or the<br>
      <br>
      self induction coefficient of the energizing current the more or
      less good resonance of the individual oscillation circles in
      relation to the main stream is destroyed or manufactured.<br>
      <br>
      Determined by attempts that the same machine works accordingly
      differently, ever more or less the mechanical components with
      their natural oscillations of the natural oscillations of the
      energizing current to differ. After a set of attempts the engine
      received in Fig. 15 drawn, simplified execution form. By the wring
      leads (14 and 15) the engine from the source of the
      electromagnetic Schwjngungen is fed by high Wechselzahl.<br>
      <br>
      The wring leads are with the secondary transformer 10 over two
      condensers - A and 6a connected. In certain cases the condenser
      batteries ä and 6a can be replaced by a parallel switched battery
      18 (dots drawn). The stator can be designed in different way. From
      the stator line (thick Linienzug 11 and I) e.g. twelve branchings
      go into twelve short circuit oscillation circles, which are
      radially into the stator surface embedded.<br>
      <br>
      Everyone of these oscillation circles possesses a certain given
      capacity and self induction, which are so selected that they adapt
      to the wavelength of the energizing current. These twelve
      oscillation circles form the twelve electromagnetic fields.
      Between these twelve oscillation circles, which are connected with
      the main line, are twelve other oscillation circles, which are
      been correct on same wavelength, i.e. the same induction
      coefficients as well as those<br>
      <br>
      same capacity possess, but are connected with the feeder not
      directly. The oscillation circles connected directly with the
      feeder are named b and other with A. generally speaking receive
      the stator twenty-four individual oscillation circles. The first
      twelve oscillation circles are however not directly metallically
      connected, 'separate by a cylindrical staff b a surface induction
      are caused. In order to describe before the saying more near, are
      in Fig. 16 four such individual oscillation circles and their
      connections with the main line 14 dargeslellt. Hierflir becomes in
      this invention a neuarliger condenser benutzl, which is
      characterized by the fact that it possesses three vouchers. As
      from Fig. 16 to see is, becomes the short circuit oscillation
      circle consisting of the two condenser vouchers I and 2, which are
      short circuit with a metal leader 4 of ineiner turn, by the drilte
      allocation 3 erregl, which is metallically with the Hauplleilung
      connected direkl. If the capacity and the
      Selbstinduktionskoeffizienl are so computed in this drilten line
      that the own oscillations are in resonance with the oscillations
      of the main line, then the maximum at electromagnetic energy is
      supplied to the short circuit oscillation circle...<br>
      <br>
      Wavelength entsprichl.<br>
      <br>
      In practice führl one the KoQdensalorbelege in the form of
      metallic tubes out (Fig. 17). As the third condenser surface,
      which is to be considered as exciters, slehl in the Mitle (in Fig.
      15 by 3 and b, b, b bezeichnel) a Slab or a tube. Between the
      individual tubes and also between the exciter electrodes is a
      guler insulator. Thus one receives a very fesles and comfortable
      system from oscillation circles for high-swinging rivers both up
      the stator, and on the rotor discs. These must be made of well
      isolating material, best from particularly for this worked on art
      wood and or paper without structure, since usual Holzund paper
      pulps does not exhibit usually necessary firmness and
      Isolierrahigkeit.<br>
      <br>
      After the execution described above one receives with good
      electrical insulating capacity a mechanical firmness, which to all
      requirements of the art of building of engines correspond, to t.
      All individual connecting wires 4 (Fig. 16) can also by a strong
      metallic ring 4 (Fig. 15}, which is fastened on the stator and
      serves as document for eJnzelne metallic staffs, replace will. Of
      course must be isolated for special cases of the leaders 4 by
      isolation disks from the ring. ,<br>
      <br>
      Having such three pole oscillation circles with the same capacity
      a very high induction to exhibit, then instead of smooth metal
      cylinders spirals are rolled up in cylinder form, whereby the
      further execution of the individual induction condenser vouchers
      has to happen completely exactly according to pattern 16. In the
      last case one obtains the mechanical firmness thereby that one
      manufactures the insulating layer from ebonite, fiber or similar
      material with high firmness and rolls the turns up on such tubes,
      these however in metallic rings into the stator surface embeds
      firmly.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. 17 is the connections of the particulars oscillation
      circles shown if no third electrode is necessary, and the
      oscillation circle only for the purpose of the phase shift is
      used. In the same way two-pole oscillation circles are embedded
      also in the rotor disc, in the same amount of more ocler also only
      half as much as in the stator surface. They must possess however
      the the same capacity and self induction coefficient as the stator
      oscillation circles.<br>
      <br>
      The individual oscillation circles in the rotor can either. from
      each other to be isolated, or, as in the description of stator. by
      a metal ring (4, Fig. 15) to be short circuit with one another. On
      Fig. 18 and 19 is perspectively represented, like individual S {:
      hwingungskreise onto the rotor disc to be installed and by rings
      short circuited. The individual oscillation circles exist (as from
      Fig. 17 evidently) from two into one another pushed, but from each
      other isolated metal cylinders (on Fig. 18 with 1 and 2
      designation), those, by V erbindungsleitung3 short circuit, an
      oscillation circle closed in itself form.<br>
      <br>
      The cylinders become with their two ends on the rotor basis (not
      drawn overview for the sake of) in two rings from IsoliermateriaJ
      (fiber etc.) with the taps fastens A, A, b, b.<br>
      <br>
      In practice are this-struggle however not necessarily, since the
      tubes more.der whole length are simply embedded after into the
      cylindric base of the rotor from IsoIiermaterial, which is
      fastened a metal cylinder on the rotor axis, on dyrselben axle
      (isolates or also short circuit) are two metallic rings 6 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      By the special feeder line 4 one half of the oscillation circles
      is in the same way metallically continued to connect with ring 6,
      and by the lines 4a the other half with ring 7. In addition, one
      can connect all ends with a ring or all with both, furthermore
      even all feeder lines can be switched off, if one regards the axle
      as a common connecting leader, want one the self induction of the
      individual oscillation circles to increase, then the rings must be
      isolated from the axle 6 and 7, and the feeder line 3 is not short
      circuit as on Fig. the connecting leader 3 can be put to 18, but
      her between the condenser vouchers I and 2 and the connecting
      leaders 4 and 4a with the ring 6 and 7 on the rotor axis into some
      WindungeR (Fig.1 9), here lies.<br>
      <br>
      By Auewahl of suitable capacity and self induction the individual
      oscillation circles of the rotor must brought to the resonance.
      become with the energizing current on the stator, this type of
      rotor resembles very the famous asynchronischen type of the rotors
      used in three-phase engines, the so-called squirrel wheel. Also
      the connection of the individual Schwjngungskreise can take place
      parallel not only with one another, but also in series and
      Gruppenscha4ung, exactly the same as with usual three-phase
      engines, only that instead of direct leaders always individual
      oscillation circles from condenser surfaces and induction

      are continued to call primary and in the second circle (A A A) as
      secondary oscillations furthermore the oscillations in the third
      electrode load oscillations and the Schwillgungen in the rotor
      rotor vibrations are called.<br>
      <br>
      If now in the two groups of oscillations of A and b oscillation
      care produced, then one receives generally speaking to
      Zusammenhange on the stator an electromagnetic rotary field,
      similar to as one with usual two-phase alternating currents by
      current shift around 1. Period an electromagnetic rotary field
      receives. The individual closed primary oscillation circles form
      here the similar elektroinagnetischen change poles, and the
      secondary oscillations cause the necessary electromagnetic shifts
      of these poles. The electromagnetic rotary field is formed here
      not by electromagnets, but oscillation fields.<br>
      <br>
      Each oscillation circle is to be regarded as an electromagnet fed
      by alternating current. This electromagnetic rotary field formed
      on the stator induces electromagnetic oscillations of same kind in
      on the rotor discs fastened and on same wavelength the tuned
      oscillation circles. As on the stator an electromagnetic rotary
      field is formed by cooperation of the individual electromagnetic
      oscillation circles, then also a same rotary field in the rotor is
      produced and thus obtains a torque after nearly exactly the same
      basic laws, as with usual wechseistrom engines.<br>
      <br>
      The resonance engine begins to rotate and can work 1eisten. je'
      the resonance between the charge stream and the primary and
      secondary oscillation circles on the stator and on the rotor is
      better, the more ideally is the effectiveness and the initial
      torque. The engine can be adjusted by tuning and/or detuning of
      this resonance both and switched off and easily, by obtaining
      another Eigenschwingungsperiode and thus another wavelength and
      frequency by change of the capacity or self induction.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig. the Zuführungsle exists 15! tung II from a simple circle
      line. In practice however it can be put into some turns to receive
      to umzwischen two oscillation circles a determining tension. In
      addition, one can get along with a turn, if one attaches an
      electromagnetic counterweight for the third electrode in the form
      of capacities (represented by S or M). Instead of producing by
      secondary induction in the stator a rotary field, one knows this
      through-direct induction also in the Schwingungskreise. For the
      purpose one branches a second ring circuit from the main line
      before the third electrode off (Fig. ) and an adjustable
      Selbstinduktionsspule (16) in series connection attaches 21 to
      this branching a capacity or.<br>
      <br>
      The river runs then from the Heuptleitung 15 partly without
      induction resistance into the ring circuit II and excites without
      delay a number of Schwin gungskreise (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14a, 15a
      and 16a), about the self induction resistance 16 by the ring
      circuit I. by the self induction this part around 1/e period is
      partly retarded (during correct attitude of the resistance) or
      around 1/e period ahead accelerated (if the phase shift by
      condensers is caused). Thus however another set of oscillation
      circles in the stator received (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), of them
      charge around 1/e period is late or accelerated takes place.<br>
      <br>
      Thus in the stator a rotary field is produced, that the rotor in
      rotation to bring and. Work to carry out can. The individual
      oscillation circles are as in Fig. 16 and 17 implemented, only
      becomes the individual groups of I to 8 (Fig. 21) by ring b and 9
      to 16a by a second ring A short circuit, during after Fig. 15 all
      oscillation circles by a ring to be short circuit. It is possible,
      on this principle. to build not only asynchronous engines, but
      also-synchronously working. Then m, uss however the stator line

      Then that part of the oscillation circle e.g. on the rotor, which
      forms side on the rotor disc the capacity, comes (on Fig.
      designates 17 with I and 2), diametrically more gegen¬über the
      feeder line which is on the other side of the rotor disc (Fig. 17
      with 3 designates), or with multipolar rotors with desired
      bending. If one half of the rotor disc is suction-wound, then one
      winds the other half likewise, but in reverse sense, so that
      between the feeder lines the capacities forming pipes come here,
      whose feeder lines come the first half between the capacities
      rolled up first, similarly “, oie with the Haefner Alteneck system
      the direct current coil are implemented, only with the difference
      that the individual sections consist here of individual
      oscillation circles, there however only briefly closed wire coils.<br>
      <br>
      In the same way like the rotor one knows also the stator wickelll.
      N ur the feeder lines at the end must become the side gebogeIl.
      Such types permit a special utilization of the Verbindungsleiters
      of the individual oscillation circles. It continues to be possible
      after this coil system to switch two or four etc.<br>

      appropriate for first same condenser tube. Both condensers
      becomeal at the ends by lines switched into series with one
      another.<br>

      #) all condensers are switched to two series and such series again
      in 2, 3 or 4 and more parallel groups with the axle are connected.<br>
