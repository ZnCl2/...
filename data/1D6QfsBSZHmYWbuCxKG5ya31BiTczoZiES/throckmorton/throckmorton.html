      Ram Pumps can pump water to a decent height powered by nothing
      other than the movement of the water that its sitting in. Yes, it
      is a true free energy pump since we don’t have to pay for energy
      to run it, but it has its limitations. The volume of water that it
      moves is not very much and there is a limit to the height.<br>
      <br>
      This is where Al Throckmorton’s development in this area not only
      shines, but completely reinvents the ram pump into something that
      was never thought possible.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Al Throckmorton’s Pump</b><br>
      <br>
      The pump consists of a chamber of water filled to a certain height
      while electrolyzed water gas fills the area above the water. There
      are two check valves so water can go into the chamber from one
      direction and leave the chamber in another direction. When there
      is enough water gas in the area above the water, a plasma ignition
      is triggered, which ignites the water gas and this creates a very
      high pressure explosion that pushes the water through the output
      check valve at over 200 psi!<br>
      <br>
      A pressure relief valve then opens to release that pressure so
      more water can flow into it from the input check valve and the
      cycle repeats. This allows water to be pushed up to great heights
      under great pressure at a very high efficiency and the
      implications are profound.<br>
      <br>
      Here is one of the old prototypes blasting water into the air with
      this process:<br>

      RE: Lord's Pump Project<br>
      <br>
      Dear Friend,<br>
      <br>
      A small isolated village of 2500 people in northern Uganda without
      potable water, electric power, access to fuel or funds asked for
      help.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of the community is made up of grandmothers and their
      grandchildren; their own sons and daughters having been massacred
      in the great slaughter that occurred under their president Idi
      Imin a number of years ago.<br>
      <br>
      Christ Aid was raising funds to help the 150 or so grandmothers.
      Water from a small mountain stream located miles away and behind a
      500 ft. ridge was carried back to the village daily in 5 gallon
      plastic pails.<br>
      <br>
      Christ Aid asked for help. A survey revealed the following; at 10
      gal/day/person was required. (100 gal, day is the US standard)
      total 25,000/day. No power available. Limited funds. Plenty of
      labor. Adequate water from the stream year around. Plastic pipe
      was available and inexpensive. How to pump water 500 feet high to
      the village?<br>
      <br>
      As a consequence The Lord’s Pump Project was started. This
      presentation presents the inspired answer: A plastic pump
      operating at 260 psi using the water pumped as the fuel. The
      plasma ignition system ignites this water gas pushing the water
      out and up to heights thought to be impossible by conventional
      thinking.<br>
      <br>
      This presentation also includes techniques for liberating
      explosive gas from water as well the creation of other elements in
      the plasma and the impact on our present model of the cosmos.<br>

      Good progress has been made the past few months.<br>
      <br>
      A plasma ignition system has been created that overcomes the
      intermittent fouling of the standard auto spark plug ignition
      system. The system has now operated several hours continuously
      without difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      Ongoing research has uncovered several improved techniques to
      split water into explosive gas, decreasing the energy
      requirements.<br>
