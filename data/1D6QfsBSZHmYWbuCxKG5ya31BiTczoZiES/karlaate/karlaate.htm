    <blockquote><b><i>&nbsp; The American's Bulletin</i></b>, July 2008
      <p><b>The future has arrived with the solution to our world's
          energy needs.</b> The Aerodynamic Air Turbine Engine (AATE),
        aptly named "The Crystal Ion", will be the energy revolution we
        have been waiting for. Clean energy utilizing the force of
        nature to create powerful and sustainable motion with no
        detrimental environmental impact is here. The air we breathe is
        the same air that drives the AATE; no wind required. This is not
        a perpetual motion machine. When I first learned of Rockwell
        Scientific Research L.L.C. (RSR) and the AATE, I was very
        skeptical. The more I thought about it the more my feelings
        mixed. Can this be real? My thoughts torn between my disbelief
        and belief. I became more exhilarated as the myriad of potential
        uses flooded my neuron pathways; an engine that runs on ambient
        air, without any air tanks, combustion or fuel cells, producing
        no exhaust. The thoughts thrilled me to no end. I just had to
        see the engine for myself. </p>
      <p>I will forever remember the day I actually saw the engine
        running with my own eyes. As un-believable as it first appeared
        my skepticism quickly turned to enthusiasm that was so totally
        overwhelming I nearly wet myself. Here was the future, right
        before me. The engine hummed along at 30k plus RPM without any
        fuel or exhaust. The clear design of the casing afforded a
        detailed view of the interior. There were no electronics inside
        except for the LEDs. As the throttle revved the engine up and
        down it was clear to me that this was genuine and not a hoax. </p>
      <p>What really boggled my mind was the fact that there were no
        investors beating down the door to become a part of this new
        energy revolution. Here was the absolute answer to the energy
        crisis we are currently facing. What is wrong with Americans
        today? Why would everyone be so willing to continue down the
        pathway paved by oil, coal and nuclear technologies when that
        path results in torturing common citizens, reaching deep into
        their pockets? Why are so many of our fine young men and women
        dying needlessly for the right to oil? Why are billions of
        dollars being spent trading Carbon Credits and where is all that
        cash going? Are people really concerned about their living
        environment? Politicians are quick to blame industries for what
        is really political failure. </p>
      <p>So how was the AATE re-born? In late April 2005 Ron Rockwell,
        of RSR, was invited to meet with inventor Haskell Karl who
        claimed to have built an engine powered only by air. Ron met
        with Haskell in person and after reviewing all his material
        (consisting only of photographs, drawings and sketches) and
        detailed phone discussions. Ron decided to rebuild the engine
        using current technology. I am sure that skepticism reigned
        high. However, Ron believed this technology had substantial
        merit and invited his trusted colleague, friend and fellow
        machinist Cliff Cruz, to join his team in re-creating the
        engine. Through twelve years of research and development of
        various devices in the high tech industry, RSR has developed the
        AATE. </p>
      <p>In the early 1960's, Haskell took the original engine he built
        for testing to Wyle Testing Laboratory. They could not figure
        out how it worked and requested that he leave it with them so
        they could further analyze the engine. Haskell refused and
        headed home with the invention. The AATE was scheduled to be
        presented to President Kennedy at a special meeting. Before this
        presentation could take place, the people who worked with Mr.
        Karl on the engine mysteriously disappeared. Shortly thereafter,
        the engine also disappeared. There was also talk that China was
        willing to pay 100 billion dollars for the engine but the deal
        fell through when a key individual died from a massive heart
        attack. Haskell Karl went into hiding, keeping with him the
        documents, original drawings, and numerous photos of how he
        built the engine. Now 40 some years later, the engine is
        re-born. </p>
      <p>Although the concept and science behind the engine (Vortex Air
        Implosion Technology) was not fully understood at that time, the
        determination was made that a new prototype based on
        discussions, drawings and photos, could be built. The task was
        undertaken. </p>
      <p>The machine shop of RSR started the initial construction in May
        of 2005. Work was arduous. Unique parts needed to be
        manufactured. In order to do so, new tools also needed to be
        machined in order to manufacture these parts. There was no
        manual, guidebook or instructions. Instead Ron and his team had
        to rely on their knowledge, ingenuity and creativity to build
        the engine. With the latest technology available today, Ron was
        able to redesign and improve things that could not be done back
        in the 60's. Through trial and error (not much of the latter)
        and 3 million dollars later, they finally completed the first
        functioning prototype in the fall of 2006. </p>
      <p>Ecstatic with the results, arrangements were made to travel to
        Washington DC to present the engine to the Department of Energy
        in hopes that they would embrace this unprecedented technology.
        Unfortunately, Mr. Rockwell and Dr. Beverly were met with
        bureaucratic indifference. Need more be said? The people needed
        to know that a solution to the world's energy was available and
        a press release was issued in November to over 200 newspapers
        and magazines. Again there was huge indifference by the press
        who were more focused on news of the war and elections. Case in
        point. That day in Washington at Fox News Channel 5, they spoke
        with a woman named Sheila who said "unless [they] had a story
        about the Iraq war or the upcoming elections that Fox probably
        wouldn't run a story on it", "those [are] the 2 most pressing
        issues that people wanted to hear about". Unbelievable! It is
        this kind of attitude and indifference towards true solutions
        for peace and clean energy that have prevented this country and
        our world from realizing its full potential. </p>
      <p>As with any technology that promises huge gains, security is an
        issue. There have been several security breaches over the course
        of development. Thankfully, they were discovered early enough to
        thwart them. One lengthy breach occurred in the summer of 2007
        when 2 individuals (referred to as "vultures") attempted to
        "take-over the technology". They began contacting Haskell,
        eventually coercing him to denounce Mr. Rockwell and promising
        him quick profit. They also contacted Ron's chief machinist and
        met with him several times to engage him in assisting them to
        develop the engine without Ron.<i> Despite knowing that they
          were being videotaped, </i>they continued their discussion
        with Cliff to bring him on board and away from RSR and the
        engine project. These individuals are under criminal
        investigation. The result of this breach caused a serious delay
        in the completion of the engine. Security is now tighter than
        ever. </p>
      <p>A number of individuals came forward claiming to be investors,
        venture capitalists and personally wealthy. Many of these
        individuals were not investors but brokers, agents or
        individuals that knew someone who wanted to invest and really
        had nothing to offer. This was also a source of lost time. </p>
      <p>The purpose of seeking investment was to develop, market and
        support innovative cost-effective clean energy devices, products
        and services; especially those made available through its
        proprietary technology designs. RSR will offer the Ultimate
        Solution to the growing world energy problem. The end of fossil
        fuel use, preserving natural resources, create low cost clean
        energy (zero emissions), create independence from foreign oil
        use, non-degenerative and non-destructive energy forces from the
        technology use, while creating worldwide demand for this
        Ultimate Solution. </p>
      <p>Ron and his team made some substantial technical discoveries
        and potential problems with the current design and proceeded to
        re-build the AATE with new specifications. Noise level was
        substantially reduced and overheating was no longer any concern.
        Haskell met the improvements in the design with great joy. What
        remains to be done is more testing and validation from a
        government source (Wyle Testing Laboratory) that the AATE
        performs as described and is sustainable. </p>
      <p>In early 2008 there had been an invitation by a government
        department to apply for a number of grants that were available
        only for new energy projects. Sounded more promising than the
        first encounter with the government. The applications were
        arduous and requested very specific and detailed specifications
        of the engine. It was not acceptable to provide the government
        with those specifications. Another individual with high status
        in the Mexican Government offered to set up a meeting with the
        President of Mexico. At first it sounded very good to Ron. As
        the time approached, the meeting was postponed and Ron began to
        feel something was not right. This trip did not happen either.
        As it turned out, this individual was in a financial bind and
        planned no introduction to President of Mexico. The promised
        trip to Washington was actually a scheduled NAFTA meeting not a
        special meeting for Ron. </p>
      <p>So what exactly is the AATE? It is a mechanical device built to
        spin at high revolutions without the need for any fuel,
        combustion or compressed air. This device is a sophisticated
        application of a simple scientific principle long known in the
        alternative energy field, Vortex Implosion Air Technology
        (VIAT). Viktor Schauberger first discovered the principle of the
        Vortex and developed technology for moving water more
        efficiently. The same principle can be applied to airflow. The
        RSR AATE runs on ambient air; the very air we breathe, using no
        air tanks and no other power source other than air. A tornado is
        created in the engine that implodes on itself which actually
        speeds up and sustains the airflow back into the tornado. </p>
      <p>We see what is wrong with our energy policies every time we go
        to the pump, buy groceries, pay our bills and of course all the
        news that bombards us daily. Perhaps it is a good thing that
        huge caverns (many times the size of the Grand Canyon) are being
        created beneath the earth surface. When the current trend of
        melting glaciers and icebergs continues, the land will cave in
        and fill those caverns. We will not have to worry about flooding
        the land we live on. </p>
      <p>Enough is enough America. Take the time to contact your
        politicians and let them know that you know the time for
        positive change is now. Forget those hybrid cars, wind
        generators and solar cells. The costs of implementing these
        technologies will never be recovered in your lifetime but you
        and your children will be paying for them without any true
        benefit.Anton Bernhardt </p>
