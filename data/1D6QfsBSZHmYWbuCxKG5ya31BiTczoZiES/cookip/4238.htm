      <p><b>Description</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a device for the conversion of
        centrifugal
        force to linear force and, therefore, linear motion. The device
        may be
        used to propel any common vehicle such as automobiles, rail
        cars, and marine,
        aviation and space carriers, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>As enunciated by Sir Issac Newton, an object directed along a
        curved
        path will exert a force against the retraining or directing
        item. In other
        words, a force is produced by an object that constantly changes
        direction,
        since a change in speed or direction constitutes acceleration.
        As is well
        known, the centrifugal force is directly proportional to the
        mass of the
        object, or the radius of the circle through which the object
        moves, or
        the square of the angular velocity of the spinning object.
        Therefore, doubling
        the number of revolutions per minute of the object, will
        increase the centrifugal
        force by a factor of four (4).
      </p>
      <p>Centrifugal force often expressed in the amount "times" the
        normal pull
        of gravity or "g's", may produce a surprisingly large force. For
        example,
        an object following a circular path having a radius of ten
        centimeters,
        at a rate of six hundred revolutions per minute, generates a
        centrifugal
        force which is 41 times gravity.
      </p>
      <p>As can be surmised, a device that enables the transformation of
        the
        centrifugal force produced by a rotating body into a linear
        force, with
        only a modest efficiency, may be applied to any mode of vehicle
        travel.
      </p>
      <p>In the past, various attempts have been put forth to reap the
        advantages
        of the powerful and easily generated centrifugal force by
        effecting such
        a transformation. For example, these apparatuses have rotated
        mass members
        and shifted the center of gravity relative to the axis of
        rotation. The
        result has been the development of a centrifugal force greater
        where the
        mass has shifted, than the remainder of the rotational cycle. In
        essence,
        the length of the radius of the arm has been changed. As is well
        known,
        the conservation of angular momentum would tend to
        correspondingly decrease
        the speed of the mass shifted.
      </p>
      <p>As an example of a successful machine of this type, reference
        is made
        to U.S. Pat. No. 3,683,707, issued on Aug. 15, 1972, to
        applicant. However,
        machines of this type, although workable, are not efficient
        enough to produce
        the desired linear force to warrant general use.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b>
      </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a device for converting the
        force of
        a spinning or rotating mass into a linear component of force
        usable to
        propel a vehicle in a linear path.
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, a first rotating arm
        is provided,
        moving about an axis of rotation. A pair of balanced masses
        rotates at
        the terminus of the arm in a plane perpendicular to the plane of
        the first
        arm. A second arm counter-rotates about the same axis with
        respect to the
        first rotating arm and moves within a plane parallel to the
        plane of rotation
        of the first arm. A mechanism cooperative between the first and
        second
        arms permits the transfer of one of the balanced weights from
        the first
        arm to the second arm. At a selected point in the rotational
        path of both
        arms, one of the masses transfers causing cancellation of the
        centrifugal
        force produced by the first rotating arm. The mass again
        transfers from
        the second arm to the first arm after one hundred eighty degrees
        of circular
        travel of both arms. At this point, there is a centrifugal force
        bias in
        favor of the arm having the masses which continues for another
        one hundred
        eighty degrees of arcuate travel, when compared to the prior
        semicircle
        traveled. In other words, the net result of the arm having the
        pair of
        masses is an imbalanced centrifugal force during half of the
        circular path
        of both arms.
      </p>
      <p>The resultant imbalance may be transmitted into a linear
        uni-directional
        component of force by mounting both rotating arms on a rail or
        frictional
        wheel carriage.
      </p>
      <p>Usage of two synchronized sets of counterrotating arms to a leg
        connecting
        both axes of rotation, necessarily eliminates the deflecting
        component
        of the centrifugal force along the axes of the counter rotating
        arms. In
        this case, the rail and frictional wheel carriage would not be
        required
        since a true linear force has been fashioned.
      </p>
      <p>It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide
        a device
        that efficiently converts centrifugal force from rotating
        members into
        linear force and linear movement.
      </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
        device
        useable as a source of motivation for any vehiclar means by the
        employment
        of rotational motion which is converted into linear motion.
      </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an
        imbalanced
        centrifugal force in a given semicircle of the rotational cycle
        of an object
        and the usage of the linear components of the centrifugal force
        produced
        to propel a vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to combine the
        effects
        of a plurality of devices producing a biased centrifugal force
        to cause
        linear motion without the necessity of frictional engagement of
        the vehicle
        with a surface of travel.
      </p>
      <p>The invention possesses other objects and advantages as
        concerns particular
        features and characteristics, thereof, which will become
        apparent as the
        specification continues. For a better understanding of the
        invention, reference

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>With reference to the drawings, the device or apparatus as a
        whole is
        depicted in its entirety by reference character 10. FIG. 1 shows
        the device
        10 which includes a first arm 12 and a second arm 14 which
        counter rotate
        with respect to one another about an axle 16, FIGS. 1 and 2. The
        circular
        paths of the arms 12 and 14 lie in parallel planes such that the
        arms are
        positioned in overlying alignment twice during the rotational
        cycle of
        both arms 12 and 14. As shown by FIG. 1, in partial phantom, the
        alignment
        of the two arms takes place one hundred and eighty degrees
        (180.degree.)
        apart and these positions are denoted as the "transfer points I
        and II",
        a fuller explanation of which will be hereinafter provided.
      </p>
      <p>In the present embodiment, the device 10 is contemplated for
        use on
        a surface, but the device may be employed for any method of
        travel including
        travel in water, air and space media. As shown, the device 10
        travels on
        a rail track 18 by the use of wheels rotating about spindles 22
        that support
        frame 24, via forks 26, which are fixed by attached to frame 24
        and spindle
        22. The frame 24 secures to axle 16 by the use of flange 28 by
        any suitable
        means, such as welding.
      </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 2, driving shaft 30 turns by the energy
        derived
        from any source of power (not shown). Block portion 32 and
        bearings 34
        support shaft 30 to allow smooth axial turning of the shaft,
        well known
        in the art. Shaft 30 includes a miter gear 36, on the end
        nearest axle
        16, which meshingly engages bevel gear 38 integral with bushing
        40, which
        is free to slide about the bearing surface 52 circumferentially
        affixed
        to axle 16. Flanges 42 and 44 afix to arm 14 such that the
        rotation of
        bushing 40 rotates arm 14 about the axis of axle 16. The upper
        end of bushing
        40 connects to bevel gear 46 which meshingly engages miter gear
        48. Stud
        50 fixedly engages axle 16 and bearing 54 circumscribes the stud
        50. Miter
        gear 48, thus rotates about the fixed axis of stud 50. C-rings
        56 and 58
        prevent the movement of stud 50 and miter gear 48.
      </p>
      <p>Bevel gear 60 meshingly engages miter gear 48 and rotates in
        the direction
        opposite to bevel gear 46. Flange 62, depicted as integral with
        bevel gear
        60, affixes to arm 12 such that arm 12 rotates opposite to arm
        14.
      </p>
      <p>One end of arm 12 includes a bearing mount 64 which
        circumferentially
        holds shaft 66. Pin 68 positions shaft 66 within bearing 64
        which has a
        seal 70. Miter gear 72 affixes to shoulder 74 which
        surroundingly engages
        shaft 66. Miter gear 72 meshingly engages bevel gear 76 and
        turns shaft
        66. Flanges 78 and 80 join to hold bevel gear in a stationary
        position
        with respect to miter gear 72. Stiffeners 82 and 84 strengthen
        the interconnection
        of flanges 78 and 80 to the frame 24.
      </p>
      <p>Universal joint 86 affixes shaft 66 to shaft 88 which passes
        through
        bearing mount 90. Stub 92 affixes to base plate 94 which secures
        to bearing
        mount 90. Stub 92 passes through an arcuate slot 96 in arm 12,
        best depicted
        in FIG. 3; the purpose of which will be described in detail as
        the specification
        continues. The lower end of stub 92 is capped by washer 98 and
        nut 100.
        Stub 92 may travel within the confines of arcuate slot 96
        subject to dampening
        by spring 124.
      </p>
      <p>Shaft 88 engages bearing 102 which fits within hub 104 having
        wings
        106 and 108. Bars 110 and 112 affix to wings 106 and 108
        respectively on
        one end and to masses 114 and 116 on the other end. Masses 114
        and 116
        are preferably of equal size; mass and weight, therefore,
        balance one another
        when shaft 88 rotates bars 110 and 112 (which are of equal
        length) and
        the masses 114 and 116. The hub 104 also functions to dampen
        oscillations
        upon the transfer of one of the weights, as will be discussed in
        detail
        hereinafter. Arm 14 has a U-shaped channel 118 between
        partitions 128 and
        129 corresponding in the width dimension to the width of mass
        114 or 116.
        Opening 120 and 122 receive the fingers (not shown) of mass 114
        or the
        fingers of mass 116 (only exemplar finger 130 shown) dependent
        upon which
        mass is transferred from arm 12 to arm 14.
      </p>
      <p>Pin 132 rides on cam follower 134 which travels a flexible
        circular
        cam on track 136. Cam track 136 is supported by a plurality of
        blocks,
        including blocks 138, 140, 142, and 144. Block 140 includes an
        inclined
        surface having a handle structure 144 thereattached, such that
        the circular
        track 136 may be lowered to the same level at block 140 as it is
        at block
        138.
      </p>
      <p>The mechanism involved in the actual transfer of one of the
        masses 114
        or 116 may be more clearly explained by FIGS. 4-10. As an
        example, mass
        116 may be employed, as depicted in phantom on FIG. 2, as the
        transferred
        mass. FIG. 4, showing the mechanism in the activated position,
        includes
        bar 112 having a plate 150 which fits into arcuate channel 152.
        Bar 112
        affixes to plate 150. The combination is capable of holding
        weight 116
        while revolving about hub 104. As depicted by FIG. 5, the pin,
        when elevated
        by the track 136, runs through partially V-shaped channel 154.
      </p>
      <p>The mass 116 includes two equal portions 156 and 158, each
        portion respectively
        enclosed by caps 160 and 162, having a slidable relationship
        therebetween.
        Finger 130 of mass portion 158 slides within openings 164 and
        into slot
        120 when the mass 116 transfers from arm 12 to arm 14. Spring
        means 166
        urges mass member 158 away from slot 120 while the movement of
        pin 132
        in channel 154 urges mass member 158 toward slot 120. Mass
        portion 156
        also includes a finger, spring means, and opening arrangement
        (not shown)
        identical to mass portion 158 such as finger 130, spring means
        166, and
        opening 164, for use with opening 122 (FIG. 2).
      </p>
      <p>Pin 132 includes a slot 168 and a key 170 in arm 14 to prevent
        rotation
        of the pin 132 in the vertical plane during transfer of the mass
        116. Mass
        114 contains the same mechanism as mass 116 for the purposes of
        the transfer,
        from arm 12 to arm 14, and the masses be substituted freely to
        perform
        the transfer function to evenly distribute wear and tear and the
        like.
      </p>
      <p>In operation, the device 10 has two counter rotating arms 12
        and 14
        that are synchronized to vertically align at two positions
        within their
        rotational cycles, where either mass 114 or 116 transfers to and
        from the
        first arm 12. As heretofore explained, mass 116 has been
        arbitrarily chosen,
        but proper calibration may employ mass 114 in the transfer
        mechanism herein
        described.
      </p>
      <p>Power from a source drives driving shaft 30 which turns miter
        gear 36
        and bevel gear 38. Arm 14 affixed to bushing 40 rotates in a
        plane substantially
        horizontal to the axis of driving shaft 30. Bevel gear 46 turns
        miter gear
        48 which spins bevel gear 60. Arm 12 attached to flange 62,
        integral with
        bevel gear 60, rotates in a plane parallel to the plane of arm
        14 and in
        an opposite direction to the path of rotation of arm 14 through
        gearing
        arrangements arms 12 and 14 vertically align at "transfer points
        I and
        II", shown on FIG. 1.
      </p>
      <p>Miter gear 72 and bevel gear 76 rotate shaft 88 and turns
        masses 114
        and 116 in a vertical plane as arm 12 rotates in a horizontal
        plane. At
        transfer point I, depicted in FIG. 2, the mass 116 fits between
        partitions
        128 and 129, shown in phantom, of arm 14. At this point, the
        mass 116 the
        end of arm 14 has no relative motion therebetween. Just prior to
        that point,
        pin 132 enters channel 154 because of the rise in track 136 and
        spreads
        portions 156 and 158 apart. Fingers, shown by exemplar finger
        130, enter
        openings 120 and 122, and bar 112 with affixed plate 150 rotates
        out of
        arcuate channel 152. Thus, mass 116 has been transferred to arm
        14, FIGS.
        4-6.
      </p>
      <p>Arm 12 continues its rotation with only mass 114 for one
        hundred and
        eighty degrees to "transfer point II". It should be noted that
        hub 104
        preferably dampens the oscillating motion produced by mass 114
        on the arm
        12 by being of a weight equal to the combined weight of masses
        114 and
        116. Likewise partitions 128 and 129 should be equal in weight
        to hub 104,
        such that the sum of the weight of masses 116 and partitions 128
        and 129
        equals the sum of the weight hub 104 and weight 114. Thus, the
        device 10
        is balanced during the portion of the cycle of arm 12 between
        the "transfer
        points I and II".
      </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3, the stub 92 bears on spring 124 such
        that
        the oscillation force of mass 114 on arm 12 is dampened in one
        direction
        to help smooth the motion of arm 12 as it rotates.
      </p>
      <p>When "transfer point II" is reached, the transfer mechanism
        reverses,
        FIGS. 7-10. Pin 132 lowers from channel 154 because of the
        position of
        track 134. Fingers, shown by exemplar 130 remove from openings
        120 and
        122. Plate 150 engages portions 158 and 160, FIG. 9, and mass
        116 again
        rotates on bar 112 with mass 114.
      </p>
      <p>The mechanical components of device 10 may be sealed in a
        vacuum with
        shaft 30 and handle structure 148 extending therethrough to
        reduce the
        effect of air friction on the rotating arms.
      </p>
      <p>When arm 12 includes both masses 114 and 116, axle 16 receives
        a force
        along arm 12. This specifically occurs counterclockwise between
        "transfer
        point II" and "transfer point I". This linear force may be
        broken into
        two component forces, one in the direction of the arrow 172 and
        the other
        in a force horizontally disposed. The horizontal force, a
        deflecting force,
        is absorbed by the rigidity of rail track 18. Thus, device 10
        moves along
        track 18 in the direction of the arrow 172. It should be noted
        that a plurality
        of pairs of arms identical to arms 12 and 14 may be placed on
        axle 16 to
        create a steady force in the direction of arrow 172. The device
        10 alone
        will produce a pulse force during the time arm 12 travels from
        transfer
        point II to transfer point I. The transferring mechanism may be
        deactivated
        by pulling handle mechanism 148 and therefore the lower portion
        of bock
        140. The sliding of the upper and lower portions of block 140 on
        surface
        146, lower arm track 136 such that pin 132 does not enter
        channel 154 and
        transferring of mass 116 does not occur. Similarly the raising
        of track
        136 one hundred and eighty degrees from block 146 would reverse
        the transfer
        mechanism such that the device 10 would travel in a direction
        opposite
        to arrow 172. In other words, raising the track 136 to activate
        pin 132
        opposite block 140 would brake device 10 moving in the direction
        of arrow
        172 or cause device 10, at rest, to move in a direction opposite
        to arrow
        172.
      </p>
      <p>Device 10 may be used with an identical device to eliminate the
        need
        for rail track 18 and its equivalent. Applicant hereby
        incorporates, by
        reference, the specification of his U.S. Pat. No. 3,683,707,
        issued Aug.
        15, 1972, wherein applicant describes the cancellation of
        horizontal forces.
        In particular, column 8, lines 9-38, describes the resolution of
        forces
        in the Y axis and cancellation of the forces in the X axis.
      </p>
      <p>By analogy, a set of devices identical to device 10 may be
        placed together,
        preferably side-by-side, with a leg 174 connecting identical
        axles 16 such
        that identical arms 12 are located at transfer point I on the
        first device
        and transfer point II on the second device FIGS. 11 and 12.
      </p>
      <p>While in the foregoing specification embodiments of the
        invention have
        been set forth in considerable detail for purposes of making a
        complete
        disclosure of the invention, it will be apparent to those of
        ordinary skill
        in the art that numerous changes may be made in such details
        without departing
        from the spirit and principles of the invention.
