              Flaming Jets Drive Novel Aircraft</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        Driven by blast nozzles, a rocket-like airplane designed by a
        French inventor is declared to make possible speeds of 600 miles
        or more an hour. A mixture of fuel oil and compressed air is fed
        to these nozzles and ignited, and jets of flaming and expanding
        vapor spurt rearward with terrific force, the recoil driving the
        machine forward. To supply air at high pressure, the inventor
        has devised a novel method that dispenses with conventional
        compressors. It employs, instead, a jet of steam from an
        oil-fired boiler, which entrains outside air and forces it under
        pressure into the supply system, the steam being condensed and
        the water drained off before the air reaches the burners. Since
        there are virtually no moving parts, the novel power plant is
        declared to offer practically no chance of mechanical failure.
        The plane has no motor in the accepted sense of the word. </p>

      <p>The attempt to produce aircraft capable of flying in the
        stratosphere, where the air is exceedingly thin and offers
        little resistance, causes the rocket planet to be looked upon
        with exceeding interest. For the ordinary type of propeller
        cannot take hold of the near vacuum of the upper air, until it
        whirls at a dangerously high speed; vibration and centrifugal
        force are troublesome. On the other hand, the rocket is not very
        efficient near the ground; because its effectiveness begins only
        when its speed forward approaches that of the gas which ejects
        backward --- some hundreds or even thousands of miles an hour. </p>
      <p>To run a rocket, of great weight, with gunpowder is not
        economical. It offers the same handicap as running a steam
        engine with gunpowder; it can be done, but does not pay. One
        reason is that the gunpowder is composed, principally --- not of
        fuel, but of chemicals supplying oxygen. A rocket traveling in
        the space between planets would have to carry its oxygen, for
        there is none in outer space; but, even in the thinnest part of
        the atmosphere where a plane can be expected to fly, there is
        enough oxygen to work an engine. So we have the air-and-fuel oil
        rocket planet as the obvious solution of high-speed flight at
        the highest altitudes. To accomplish this a French engineer, M.
        Melot, has designed apparatus on the principle shown in the
        diagrams and, after tests, is proceeding with its construction.
        The fuel tubes serve to carry oil and air under great pressure
        into a combustion chamber, where they meet and burn with great
        fierceness; the result, just as in the cylinder of a gasoline or
        Diesel engine, is to produce a mixture of the nitrogen in the
        air with water vapor and carbon dioxide at a very high
        temperature. The expansion of gases caused by this heat creates
        pressure, and this pressure causes the gases to fly backward
        with enormous velocity. </p>
      <p>In the ordinary firework rocket, this pressure is so great that
        it punches a hole in the air, so to speak. The velocity of the
        ejected gas is too high. But in the Melot reaction tube
        (following the curve of expansion named for Venturi) is open
        behind the flame blast, and, since the velocity of this blast is
        so great as to create a partial vacuum, it sucks in air from
        behind it (ahead in the direction of the plane’s flight) and
        blows it out behind. This slows down the velocity and pressure
        of the ejected gases, but it correspondingly increases their
        mass and, consequently, the forward push. It also helps the
        plane ahead by its suction, which lessens the air pressure
        resisting its flight. </p>
      <p>In the design of this propulsion system, a problem encountered
        was that of supplying enough air to the engine. In high
        altitudes, engines use superchargers, which are really only air
        compressors, giving the carburetors air at sea level pressure or
        higher. This design was superseded by one without mechanical
        parts, working on a well-known principle --- that of the
        injector. A boiler (see diagram B) blows the high-pressure steam
        through a pipe, and through air holes, sucks in air --- just as
        does the big reaction tube of the plane. The mingled air and
        steam rushes with very high velocity through a cooling coil; the
        steam turns back to water, but the air rushes on through its
        pipe to the fuel chamber, where it supports combustion. </p>
      <p>Another interesting compressor model (Diagram C) was tested out
        which operates on the principle of the steam pump, but with
        fewer parts. A piston, without any rod, is blown by firing a
        charge of gas, to one end of a double cylinder. It compresses
        the air at that end; sets off a second charge and goes back
        again; this time compressing air at the opposite end, and
        producing a nearly steady blast, from one end or the other of
        the cylinder. The effect is very much as when a standard gas
        engine is used for an air compressor (which it will serve for,
        as a makeshift; but the design eliminates piston rods,
        crankshafts, etc. It was found, however, that the steam blast
        compressor has the advantage of greater simplicity. </p>
      <p>In the laboratory, the model of Venturi tube adopted for
        propulsion (Diagram A) has been tested, to secure data on its
        performance. It is considered possible that later models will
        produce a speed of 900 miles an hour, letting a plane cross the
        Atlantic in 4 hours (which would mean arriving in New York an
        hour earlier than leaving Paris); yet, because of the ultimate
        simplicity of the design, the rocket plane would cost less than
        the present engined type, and be much lighter and more
        efficient. The problem is one to learn the most economical
        operation of the flame blast for optimum elevation; and much
        work must be done off the ground --- in the stratosphere --- to
        perfect it. The theory appears complete. </p>
      <p>Other experimenters work on the same problem. Dr Albert C
        Erickson, an assistant of Dr Goddard, the American pioneer
        rocket experimenter, has, it is said, developed an engine in
        which added force is obtained by the use of a rotary disk in the
        exhaust. This, like a television disk, scans the explosion, so
        to speak; changing it from a constant blast to a series of
        puffing explosions. They might be apparently continuous, to the
        ear, at a rate as high as 600 a second. This, he believes, is
        more effective than a steady push. Developments may be eagerly
        awaited. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Propelling Ejector</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to a propelling device of the kind
        described in US Patent # 1,375,601, in which a motive fluid is
        sent through a plurality of ejector tubes in series draws
        atmospheric air and causes between the front a rear ends of the
        ejector tubes a difference of pressure producing a thrust on the
        tubes, so that when the latter are mounted on a terrestrial
        vehicle, a marine vessel or an aircraft the thrust causes
        propulsion thereof. In accordance with the present invention, in
        order to improve the efficiency of such devices, the first
        ejector tube of the series are of greater length than the
        following ejector tube so as to provide a sufficient distance
        way for the high speed mixture of motive fluid and air aspired
        to have proper time to expand and carry along the maximum amount
        of air. </p>
      <p>The accompanying drawing shows diagrammatically an axial
        section of an embodiment of the invention. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1493-1.jpg" height="515" width="247"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The injection nozzle a receives motive fluid from any
        generating device such as for example that described in my
        application Serial No 679,784. Said device is designated on the
        drawing by the letter A and is not claimed herein. Nozzle&nbsp;
        a opens into the first ejector tube b which is open to the
        atmosphere at c. Each following ejector tube b1, b2 is of lesser
        length than the preceding tube or of equal length. </p>
      <p>The air drawn in at c mixes with the motive fluid injected
        through the nozzle a and the mixture whose initial speed is very
        high is able to apply itself against the inner walls of the
        ejector tube b and has time to expand properly owing to the
        great length of said tube. When the fluid reaches the second
        ejector tube b, its speed is slower and it is not necessary to
        have it follow such a great axial distance as in the first tube
        for it to have the requisite expansion and produce the maximum
        reaction on the surrounding atmospheric air. The same effect
        occurs with the following ejector tubes. </p>
      <p>It may happen that the passage areas in the last ejector tube
        becomes too great with respect to their length. In such case,
        according to the invention, a needle d having a suitable profile
        is placed inside the ejector tubes and the nozzle if required,
        so as to give them the proper passage areas. Said needle may be
        made movable in the axial direction so as to permit of
        regulating the areas. </p>
      <p>The invention may also be applied to ejector tubes in series
        supplying gas turbines or securing the blast of metallurgical
        apparatus. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to an improved device for atomizing
        liquid fuel and assuring intimate mixture thereof, in a constant
        proportion, with the air necessary to support combustion. </p>
      <p>To this end and in accordance with this invention, a liquid
        fuel burner is provided with a fixed nozzle inside which rotate
        a series of concentric jets constituting a vacuum intensifier.
        These jets, which may be integral with a rotary tube, are
        rotatable about a fixed tube with is maintained in communication
        with a tank containing the liquid fuel at a constant level which
        is slightly lower than the axis of said fixed tube. </p>
      <p>By means of this arrangement the air passing into the fixed
        nozzle and the rotary jets, carries along an amount of liquid
        which is constantly proportional to said air. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the centrifugal effect due to the rotary jets
        supplements the transporting effect due to the passage of the
        air, so as to produce perfect atomization at all speeds. </p>
      <p>The accompanying drawing illustrates, by way of example, an
        embodiment of a triple-action device although the rotary jets
        may vary in number. Figure 1 is an axial section of the atomizer
        mounted at the intake of the burner. Figure 2 is a cross-section
        on the line 2-2 Figure 1, showing a detail of the apparatus, and
        Figure 3 is an axial section on a vertical plane of the burner
        proper, on a smaller scale. </p>
      <p>Disposed at the intake of the actual burner <i>a</i> are a
        fixed nozzle <i>b</i> and a series of rotary jets <i>c</i>,
        integral with a rotary tube <i>d</i> and arranged in such a
        manner that the inner extremity of the rotary tube <i>d</i>
        opens into the neck of the first jet <i>c</i>, the inner
        extremity of the first jet <i>c</i> opening into the neck of
        the second jet <i>c</i>, and so on… the inner extremity of the
        last jet <i>c</i> corresponding with the inner extremity of the
        fixed nozzle <i>b</i>. This unit (jets and rotary tubes) is
        rotated by a pulley <i>e</i> and belt <i>f</i> or any other
        suitable means. Inside the rotary tube and serving as a bearing
        therefore is situated one branch of a fuel feed pipe <i>g</i>
        the terminal orifice of which may be controlled by a needle
        valve <i>h</i>. The liquid is drawn into the other branch of
        the pipe <i>g</i> from a constant level tank <i>i</i> open to
        the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The air reaches the nozzle by way of an annular passage <i>j</i>
        which may be provided with guide vanes <i>k</i> adapted to
        direct the streams of air parallel with the axis. </p>
      <p>In this device the final section of the rotary tube <i>d</i>
        is exposed to the vacuum obtaining in the neck of the first jet
        <i>c</i>, the other end of said tube being subjected to
        atmospheric pressure. Consequently an outflow of the liquid
        occurs, the amount of which increases when the vacuum increases,
        whilst the vacuum in the neck, itself, increases when the
        delivery of air increases.. </p>
      <p>The laws of deliveries in relation to pressures being the same
        for the two fluids, air and liquid, calculation reveals that, if
        the level of the liquid coincides with the axis, the relation of
        fuel to air is substantially constant. In practice, a gap of
        several millimeters is left between the liquid level and the
        axis, to prevent siphoning on stopping, and this will not
        appreciably modify the ration of fuel to air. </p>
      <p>In this manner, automatic proportionality is established
        between the air and the fuel within the two limits that have
        been fixed for the working of the burner. </p>
      <p>In order to obtain correct atomization by the action of the air
        alone, it would be necessary that, with the burner operating at
        its lowest rate, the velocity of the air at the neck of the
        first jet <i>c</i> should already be considerable, with the
        result that a very high pressure would be required for operating
        the burner at its maximum rate, it being known that the pressure
        increases as the square of the delivery rate. </p>
      <p>The rotary device of this invention, however, intended to
        obviate this serious inconvenience which causes noise and a
        waste of energy, ensures atomization at low speeds, a low air
        velocity being sufficient to carry the atomized liquid towards
        the burner proper. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the effect of the centrifugal action on the
        liquid diminishes with increased delivery rate and for a given
        angular velocity of the tube <i>d</i> and rotary jets <i>c</i>,
        because as the quantity of liquid increases, a greater portion
        of liquid slides in relation to the rotary jets and the liquid
        is but partly set in rotation. The result is a slower specific
        velocity of the liquid and a progressively less effective
        atomization. Consequently, the rotary device by itself is
        favorable for small deliveries, but its action is&nbsp;
        diminishes when the delivery increases. </p>
      <p>However, so far as the effect of the air, by itself, is
        concerned, the atomization obeys a converse law and is the more
        complete as the air delivery increases. </p>
      <p>The superimposition of these two opposed phenomena gives, as
        the resultant, a constant effect, that is to say, perfect
        atomization at all rates, without necessitating a high air
        pressure. </p>
      <p>It should also be remarked that, even at high operating rates,
        the part played by the rotary device is always highly
        advantageous, for, if it no longer atomizes directly, it assists
        the work of the air in distributing the liquid to the necks of
        the several jets. Moreover, at all operating rates, since the
        liquid presents itself in the form of thin films a right angles
        to the direction of the air, the latter is compelled, in order
        to pass, to cut these several successive layers, with the result
        that the mixture is rendered strictly homogeneous. </p>
      <p>The proportioning of the mixture is obtained, once for all, by
        means of the needle valve h so that, by means of a single
        control, a throttle l or the like, the device enables the power
        of the burner to be modified whilst maintaining the fuel-air
        ratio constant. This also does away with micrometric orifices. </p>
      <p>With the object of lessening the noise due to the combustion,
        and also to facilitate the latter at low rates, the upper part
        of the burner proper a is considerably cut away as at m (Figures
        1 and 3), thus giving the burner the form of a scoop, in order
        to destroy the acoustic effect which occurs when the combustion
        takes place inside a tube which is open only at one end. A
        second advantage is to allow the flame to spread when operating
        at low rates, thereby increasing the activity of radiation. </p>
