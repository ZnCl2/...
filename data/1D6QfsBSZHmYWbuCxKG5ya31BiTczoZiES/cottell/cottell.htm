        </div>
        <p align="left">In the wake of the energy-crisis a 50-year-old
          British-born inventor named Eric Cottell has come up with an
          ingeniously simple and economically practical solution -- one
          that is now exciting industry and government officials alike.
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the conventional combustion process, fuel is
          combined with air and turned. The result is carbon dioxide,
          water vapor and heavy oxides of nitrogen, which are a prime
          cause of chemical smog. Cottell reasoned that if water could
          largely replace air as a source of oxygen in combustion, this
          would avoid the large amounts of nitrogen introduced by the
          air -- and thus eliminate much of the noxious nitrogen oxides.
        </p>
        <p align="left">To accomplish this, he turned to a device he had
          patented 22 years ago -- an ultrasonic reactor that emulsifies
          heavy liquids and is widely used today to prepare such
          products as Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, cosmetics and
          paint. By refining the reactor, Cottell was able to break
          water into particles about one fifty-thousandth of an inch in
          diameter and to disperse them evenly in oil (or gasoline) to
          create an emulsion that was 70 percent oil and 30 percent
          water. When this emulsion was burned, Cottell found : </p>
        <p align="left">(1) that there were far fewer waste products and
        </p>
        <p align="left">(2) that the small water droplets expand on
          heating, then explode into steam, in turn shattering the oil
          into even finer particles, and thus increasing the surface
          area of the fuel exposed for burning. </p>
        <p align="left">Last month Cottell divided his time between
          Washington, in talks with officials of the Federal Energy
          Office, and Detroit, where he consulted with engineers working
          to meet the tight 1976 automobile-emission requirements. So
          far, auto tests have shown that with an ultrasonic reactor
          attached to a carburetor, a car can get almost DOUBLE the
          normal miles per gallon of gasolinge -- with neglible
          exhausts. Cottell's company, Tymponic Corp. of Long Island,
          N.Y., is also about to produce units for home oil burners that
          will be no larger than a flashlight and cost $100 to $150. </p>
        <p align="left">Last winter, two Long Island schools converted
          to Cottell's system, and both reduced their fuel usage by
          about 25%. Adelphi University reports that it saved more than
          3,500 gallons of oil per week! -- and reduced soot output by
          98 %." </p>

            combustion system makes it possible to ‘burn’ emulsions of
            fuel and water. It works in a car engine as well as an oil
            furnace – and cuts pollutants, too.</i> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">It’s impossible. An
          oil burner simply can’t run on a fuel that is one-third water
          -- tap water, at that. But I recently saw it done. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The demonstration was
          at the Bayville, NY home of Eric C. Cottell, a British-born
          engineer and inventor. The gadget that made the "impossible"
          happen is a Cottell invention called the Ultrasonic Reactor --
          a device resembling a long, slim electric motor. It contains a
          crystal stack at one end and a mixing chamber at the other. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">When a 60-cycle
          current is applied, the crystals vibrate at 20,000 cycles per
          second, turning the reactor into a "super-blender". As shown
          in the diagram, oil and water (70% oil, 30% water) flow into
          the reactor, where a terrific vibrating force causes water and
          oil molecules to rupture. The two liquids form an emulsion in
          which tiny particles of water are dispersed throughout the
          oil. When this happens, says the inventor, the surface area of
          the water is increased millions of times. Thus, when the
          emulsion hits the furnace’s combustion chamber, the water
          "explodes" into superheated steam, adding to the energy ouput
          of the oil. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In hundreds of tests
          of his system, Cottell has found that ordinary boilers run at
          efficiencies close to 100% -- as astounding result that
          neither he nor leading combustion experts can explain. In the
          demonstration I saw, gauges indicated that the emulsion
          produced the same amount of heat as a 100% oil fuel. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">In addition to
          stretching fuel, the system reportedly produces fewer
          pollutants than standard oil combustion. The fact that
          one-third less oil is burned is a key anti-pollution factor. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">Though Cottell sees
          many potential applications for the reactor -- in auto, ship
          and plane engines, for example -- he thinks the best immediate
          application is in heating plants of large apartment buildings.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">"This is by far my
          most exciting invention", says Cottell, who holds patents in
          the fields of ultrasonics, hydraulics, and chemistry. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract --- </b>A combustion
          apparatus and process in which a water-in-oil emulsion of
          liquid fuel, such as liquid hydrocarbons, containing from 10
          to 50 % water, the emulsion being produced without any
          substantial emulsifying agent and preferably by sonic
          agitation, is burned. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The combustion of liquid fuel, such
          as liquid hydrocarbons, is a standard method of power and/or
          heat generation. The combustion may be in a system where the
          heat is transferred to another medium, such as water, with or
          without boiling the water, or the fuel may be burned in
          various types of internal combustion engines, such as those
          operating on Otto, diesel, or other cycle. The amount of
          oxygen, usually air, is at least about theoretically
          sufficient for complete combustion of the fuel elements. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Considerable problems have arisen.
          If there is a very large excess of oxygen, the efficiency of
          the combustion process is lowered because a considerable
          amount of the air, including inert nitrogen, has to be heated
          up. In the case of an internal combustion engine, operating
          with excessive amounts of oxygen can result in slow
          combustion, which can overheat and burn out exhaust valves. If
          the combustion is with amounts of oxygen and fuel more nearly
          in balance, for example with only a small excess of oxygen,
          problems arise with incomplete combustion. This can result in
          excessive amount of carbon monoxide and/or incompletely burned
          fuel, which may show up as unburned hydrocarbons, soot and the
          like. Incomplete combustion lowers the combustion efficiency
          and can also contaminate the equipment. In the case of
          internal combustion engines, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon
          monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, generally symbolized by the
          formula NOx, are serious atmospheric pollutants as they give
          rise to photochemical smog and the like. Contamination of NOx
          from an IC engine usually results when combustion temperature
          is high. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has been proposed in the past to
          introduce streams of water into a burner or to inject water
          into an internal combustion engine as it operates. This has
          proven to reduce somewhat incompletely burned fuel deposited
          in the form of carbon, and in the case of IC engines this can
          lower NOx production and also in certain cases, such as
          aircraft piston engines, permit operating for short times at
          higher power outputs with very rich mixtures which would
          otherwise burn up the engine. Water injection, however, has
          serious drawbacks. In the first place, it is very difficult to
          control relative amounts of water and fuel precisely. Even if
          the control is maintained to a satisfactory degree, efficiency
          drops because the water has to be vaporized, with its
          extremely high latent heat, and heated up in the combustion,
          which takes further power because of the high specific heat of
          water vapor. As a result, water injection has only bee
          practically used in unusual circumstances. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Summary of the Invention</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention burns an
          extremely fine emulsion of water and liquid fuel, normally
          hydrocarbonaceous fuel, in which the water droplets are
          dispersed in an extremely fine average particle size. While
          the present invention is not absolutely limited to the method
          by which the emulsion is carried out, it is preferred to
          emulsify by using an ultrasonic probe or other device which
          agitates the fuel and water to produce an extraordinarily
          finely dispersed emulsion, because it is the fine dispersion
          that produces the important new results which will be set out
          below; mere presence of the water does not. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to the present invention,
          if a very fine emulsion is burned, which may have from about
          10% to as much as 50% water, extremely clean combustion
          results, contamination and pollution are minimized, and in a
          straight atmospheric burner up to 30% of water will give
          results in which the heat obtained by the combustion is
          substantially the same as if all hydrocarbon fuel were burned.
          In other words, with 70% fuel and 30% water, the emulsion will
          produce the same amount of heating. This surprising result has
          been repeatedly tested, and while I do not want to limit the
          present invention to any particular theory, it seems probable
          that the combustion of the emulsion is so complete that the
          smaller amount of fuel is completely burned and the same final
          heat is obtained as if there were no water present. The above
          statements are made with respect to a system in which the
          surfaces which are heated are at a sufficiently high
          temperature so that water vapor does not condense. In other
          words, no part of the new result is due to condensation of
          water vapor on cooler surfaces. In the case of the application
          to an IC engine, not only are the surfaces hot but the exhaust
          gases leave the engine cylinder greatly above the condensation
          point of water vapor. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the IC engine modification of
          the present invention, while the total amount of power may be
          as great or, under certain circumstances, even greater, the
          peak flame temperature is usually lower, and it seems probable
          that the reduced emission of NOx results primarily from this
          factor. However, this is not known, and the water vapor
          present in larger amounts as compared to carbon dioxide may
          also play a part. Therefore, it is not intended to limit the
          invention to any particular theory, and the above statements
          are made because I think the factors mentioned are at least
          some, and conceivably the only, factors involved. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention is not limited to the
          time in the whole operation when the very fine water-in-oil
          emulsion is actually produced. This may be at the point where
          atomization takes place just prior or at the point of
          ignition. This, however, is not necessary, and the emulsion
          may be performed and conveyed to the burner nozzle in a
          preformed state. Particularly with the referred emulsions
          obtained by sonic agitation, the emulsion is quite stable and
          so it can be produced at a point remote from the actual burner
          itself, and such a modification is of course included. It is
          also possible to have the emulsion formed by flowing water and
          oil over the emulsifying point, so that the emulsion is formed
          at the same place, or practically at the same place, as
          atomization into the flame takes place. In the case of the use
          of sonic atomization, particularly for IC engine use, it is
          almost always preferable to have the streams of water and fuel
          unite just prior to the point of atomization. It is possible,
          of course, to feed to the sonic atomizer an already formed
          emulsion, but this requires a separate step and the results
          are not significantly better. Therefore, particularly in the
          case of sonic atomization for combustion, and even more
          particularly in the case of IC engines, it is generally
          preferred to have the emulsion formed at the point and as a
          part of the atomization or atomizing device. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is an important advantage of the
          present invention that it is not necessary to use any
          emulsifying agent, particularly when sonic emulsification is
          used. This eliminates the added step and, therefore, cost of
          the emulsion is reduced, although in a broader aspect the
          present invention does not exclude an emulsion which has been
          made in the presence of a small amount of an emulsifying
          agent, such as a small amount, usually a fraction of a
          percent, of a dialkyl sulfosuccinate or other well known
          emulsifying agent capable of facilitating the formation of
          water-in-oil emulsions. The invention in this aspect, which is
          normally not preferred, may use any known emulsifying agent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Ordinarily more problems are
          presented with the burning of heavy residual fuel oil, and
          this frequently requires steam heating. In the case of the
          present invention, however, the heavy oil emulsifies more
          readily than light oil, and when emulsified with a
          considerable amount of water, the viscosity is low enough so
          that it can be burned without preheating. This is an
          additional advantage for use with heavier oils. Why the heavy
          oil emulsifies more readily and to a lower viscosity has not
          been fully determined. It is possible that the heavy fuel oil
          contains contaminants which aid in the emulsification which
          are not present in the purer lighter fuel oils. It is not
          intended, however, to limit the present invention to any
          theory of action. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While, as has been stated, the
          invention is not limited to any particular method, sonic
          emulsification is greatly preferred. It produces emulsions of
          maximum fineness at very low costs, and so in one further
          aspect of the invention there is included the combination of
          forming ultrasonically a fine water-in-oil emulsion and then
          introducing this into a burner. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Description of the Preferred
            Embodiments</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Figure 1 a sonic generator 1 is
          shown powering a sonic probe 2 in the form of an acoustic
          transformer, the end 9 of which extends into a chamber 3
          through a flexible seal 4 located substantially at a nodal
          point of the sonic probe. A stream of fuel, such as house
          heating fuel oil, is introduced through a conduit 5 and a
          stream of water joins it through a conduit 7 with a fail safe
          valve 18 opened by fuel pressure. These two streams strike the
          vibrating end 9 of the sonic probe, as can best be seen in
          Figure 2 where a portion of the chamber 3 is shown in section.
          The violent sonic agitation emulsifies the two streams, which
          then leave axially through an outlet conduit 6 in a plate 10
          which is located closely adjacent to the vibrating end 9 of
          the sonic probe. Fro the outlet conduit 6 the emulsion passes
          into a convenient burner 8 in a combustion chamber (not
          shown). Air is introduced at 20 and a flame results. While the
          proportion of fuel and water can vary over a wide range, for
          example fro about 10 % water to about 50 % water, a very
          suitable mixture is about 70 % fuel and 30 % water. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The sonic probe 2 is of
          conventional design with a stack of piezoelectric plates (not
          shown), which are energized through cable 12 by a suitable
          high frequency oscillator (not shown), which may operate, for
          example, at a frequency of approximately 20,000 Hz. The plate
          9 at the end of the sonic probe 2 may be a flat plate or it
          may also be provided with a suitable baffle, for example a
          spiral baffle, to extend the period of residence in the
          violent agitation field. The sonic generator illustrated
          diagrammatically is of common a commercial type sold by the
          Branson Instruments under their trade name Sonifier. The
          particular design of the sonic emulsifier ahs nothing to do
          with the present invention and the illustration shows merely a
          typical one. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figures 4 and 5 illustrate a
          unitary emulsifier and burner for furnace use. The same
          elements are given the same reference numbers as in Figures 1
          to 3. The end of the Sonifier tip if of the general shape
          shown in Figure 3m which will be described further below, and
          the parts bear the same reference numbers there as in Figure
          3. It will be seen tha in Figure 4 there is an overall housing
          through which a blast of air passes from the blower 13. This
          air flows over the ultrasonic generator, thus cooling it,
          which is desirable in a large sized burner, and finally passes
          over the end of the housing 15. The fuel and water streams
          flow into an annular space between the housing 15 and the
          Sonifier probe. The latter is provided with an end plate 10
          which has a series of small annular depressions 11 with a
          central projection 12 forming the inside of the annulus. This
          can be seen in Figure 5. The clearance between the end of the
          housing and the plate 10 is quite narrow and is shown somewhat
          exaggerated in Figure 4 for the sake of clarity. A film of
          fuel and water flows over the plate, where it is emulsified
          and atomized and thrown some distance to the right, forming a
          flame, which is diagrammatically shown at 19. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Combustion results in a boiler were
          measured in relative times to bring the water in the boiler
          jacket from a particular temperature to a temperature just
          below its boiling point. The test accurately measures the
          relative heating efficiencies and is shown in the following
          table, which illustrates the results of 8 tests, test 1 to 5
          being with straight No. 2 domestic heating oil and tests 6, 7,
          and 8 with a mixture of 70% oil and 30% water. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Boiler surfaces were carefully
          examined in the tests and were clean. A flame was produced
          which was whiter; there was no visible smoke from the chimney,
          and stack gas analysis showed a more complete and perfect
          combustion. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figure 3 illustrates a modification
          particularly useful for IC engines. The Sonifier with its
          probe carry the same reference numerals as in Figures 1 and 2,
          but, as in Figures 4 and 5, the shape of the end of the probe
          is a little different, being expanded out into a plate 10. The
          plate is flat instead of provided with annular depressions as
          in figure 4. Gasoline was introduced through the conduit 14
          into an annular space between the probe and a housing 15, and
          water was introduced through conduit 13. The two liquids flow
          down until they come to the edge of the expanded plate 10,
          where they proceed to flow along the top of the plate and are
          atomized and emulsified at the same time. Air is introduced
          adjacent the atomized emulsion through an air conduit 16 and
          the resulting mixture is fed into the manifold of an internal
          combustion engine (not shown). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The plate 10 projects beyond the
          housing, the clearance between housing and Sonifier being
          exaggerated as in Figure 4, and the violent sonic agitation of
          the pate throws a finely divided emulsion up from the upper
          surface of its projection. As Figure 3 is designed to connect
          with a manifold of an IC engine, there will usually be a
          certain amount of vacuum, and this causes the emulsion to be
          pulled around the edge pf the plate, as is shown by the
          arrows. Thorough mixing of the air takes place, but it is not
          necessary that the emulsion be thrown by sonic vibration into
          the manifold, whereas in Figure 4 with the horizontal burner
          this is necessary so that the fine emulsion atomized in the
          blast of air moves horizontally to form the burner flame. It
          is for this reason that the actual contact of the plate with
          the film of fuel and water flowing over it is on its forward
          face so that it will be thrown in the direction to form the
          burner flame, for of course in an ordinary burner there is not
          the vacuum which exists in an internal combustion engine
          manifold. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Figures 3 and 4 and 5 illustrate
          different forms of Sonifier and emulsion forming plate, but
          the invention is not limited to the exact shapes shown nor for
          that matter to the flat tip face as shown in Figure 2. These
          are simply illustrations of typical configurations, but the
          invention is not limited to the details thereof. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The IC engine fed with a gasoline
          and water emulsion atomized into the air ran with the same
          power as on straight gasoline, and pollutants were reduced,
          unburned hydrocarbons practically zero, and NOx still more
          reduced. The figures illustrate the pollutant concentrations,
          the engine running at about 5000 rpm under load. It will be
          noted that the pollutant concentrations are far below present
          emission standards and even meet more rigid standards proposed
          for later years. Carbon monoxide 0.94, unburned HC 0.0, NOx
          11.35 ppm. </p>

          coal is slurried with water then oil or if desired oil and
          pulverized alkalis preferably lime or limestone is added and
          the mixture subjected to sonic vibrations with an energy
          density of at least 11.625 watts per cm.sup.2. Liquid
          suspension is produced and any excess water or oil separates
          out as a separate phase. Normally excess oil is used and the
          excess oil phase can be recycled. The resulting dispersion is
          utilized and burned in a furnace. A clean flame is produced
          which has the characteristics of an oil flame and not a
          powdered coal flame. The addition of lime is optional as its
          purpose is to reduce sulfur dioxide in burning where the coal
          contains sulfur. If there is no sulfur or so little as to meet
          environmental standards the addition of lime may be omitted.
          The amount of lime is preferably at least about twice
          stoichiometric based on the sulfur content of the coal. Up to
          80% of sulfur dioxide produced on burning can react with the
          lime and the calcium sulfate produced removed by conventional
          particle separators. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Coal is usually burned either in a
          bed or if pulverized and atomized in the form of fine
          particles. When the coal contains substantial amounts of
          sulfur this is transformed into oxides of sulfur, mostly
          sulfur dioxide, during combustion. Sulfur oxides constitute
          serious atmospheric pollutants and in recent years quite
          stringent standards have been set in the United States for the
          concentration of sulfur oxides which can be vented to the
          atmosphere. This has required either low sulfur coal, about 1%
          or less, or the coal can be treated to remove excessive
          sulfur. In either case, there is a substantial penalty. It has
          therefore been proposed to mix finely divided lime or
          limestone with the coal and during burning a considerable
          amount of sulfur dioxide is oxidized in the combustion process
          which always has excess oxygen and calcium sulfate is
          produced. The removal of the particulate calcium sulfate can
          be effected by conventional means such as electrostatic
          precipitation. Combustion is not as complete as could be
          desired and unless there is a very large excess of lime the
          amount of sulfur oxides removed can be insufficient in the
          case of high sulfur coals. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is with an improved coal fuel
          that the present invention deals and problems such as
          explosion hazards in powdered coal plants that are not kept
          scrupulously clean are avoided. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the present invention pulverized
          coal is used particle sizes below 100.mu. and a considerable
          portion is normally much finer down to as fine as 1.mu.. This
          is approximately the same form of coal used for powdered coal
          burning. When the tiny coal particles are examined under a
          microscope the surface appears quite porous. The pulverized
          coal is slurried with water and then oil is added, such as
          ordinary heating oil and the slurry is then subjected to
          violent sonic agitation. Ordinarily the frequency is in the
          ultrasonic range, for example from 20,000-30,000 Hz., or even
          higher frequencies. While in practice frequently ultrasonic
          agitation is used high sonic frequency for example
          15,000-20,000 Hz. can be used, therefore throughout this
          specification the generic term "sonic" is used which covers
          both audible and ultrasonic frequencies. It should be realized
          that intense agitation which produces strong cavitation is
          necessary and this is measured as intensity and not as power.
          In the present invention the intensity should be at least
          11.625 watts per cm.sup.2. Commonly intensities of around
          38.75 to 54.25 watts per cm.sup.2 or a little less are
          employed. While there is a definite lower limit for sonic
          intensity below which satisfactory fuels will not be produced,
          there is no sharp upper limit. However there is no significant
          improvement above 54.25 watts per cm.sup.2 and higher
          intensities add to the cost of producing the fuel without
          resulting improvement. In other words, the upper limit is not
          a sharp physical limit but is dictated by economics. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">So long as the energy density meets
          the specifications above, it does not make much difference how
          the sonic energy is produced and the present invention is not
          limited to any particular apparatus. A very practical sonic
          generator is a so called sonic or ultrasonic probe.
          Longitudinal vibrations are produced as conventional, either
          by piezoelectric, magnetostrictive device or the like. The
          sonic generator proper is then coupled to a solid velocity
          transformer, sometimes called an acoustic transformer, which
          tapers down, preferably exponentially, ending in a surface of
          much smaller area than that coupled to the sonic generator. In
          accordance with the law of conservation of energy the
          distribution of the vibrations over the smaller surface
          requires that the surface move more rapidly. This results in a
          much greater energy density andd as the total power is being
          transformed from a larger area to a smaller area, this is
          referred to as a transformer by analogy with electrical
          transformers which can step up voltage. Sonic probes of the
          type described above are commercial products and sold, for
          example by Branson Instruments under their trade name of
          "Sonifier." This type of apparatus for producing high sonic
          energy density, which should not be confused with sonic power,
          is a very economical and satisfactory type of producing the
          necessary sonic energy intensity. In a more specific aspect of
          the present invention the use of this type of instrument is
          included but of course the exact way the vibrating surface is
          energized is not what distinguishes the present invention
          broadly from the prior art. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The high intensity sonic agitation
          appears to drive water into the pores of the porous coal
          particles and then produces a water-in-oil type of emulsion.
          This is not a true emulsion because it includes suspension of
          the tiny coal particles as well as a dispersion of oil and
          water. However, the behavior of the resulting product which is
          a somewhat viscous liquid is not that of a typical emulsion.
          In a typical water-in-oil emulsion, the continuous oil phase
          can be diluted with more oil to produce a more dilute
          emulsion. In the case of the present invention, however, when
          an excess of oil is used oil separates as a separate phase, in
          this case a supernatant phase. While it is theoretically
          possible with an exact ratio of coal, water and oil to produce
          a product that does not separate out any oil phase as a
          practical matter this is undesirable because the separation it
          too critical and it is much better to operate with a small
          excess of oil and separate and recycle the supernatant phase.
          Although, as has been pointed out above, the product of the
          present invention is not technically a water-in-oil emulsion
          it has some properties that are similar. Thus, for example,
          after removing a supernatant oil phase the remaining oil and
          water remains stable in and around the coal particles and the
          product can be stored for a reasonable time without further
          separation of the components. For this reason the product will
          be referred to in the specification as an emulsion even though
          technically it is not a true emulsion. It is, however, a
          dispersion of the coal particles and tiny water droplets and,
          as pointed out above, it is stable. When the product or fuel
          of the present invention is burned it burns very cleanly with
          a flame of the color and characteristics of an oil flame
          rather than a powdered coal flame. Apparently during
          combustions there is not a physical production of fine coal
          particles although the exact mechanism of combustion has not
          been completely determined and the present invention is
          therefore not intended to be limited to any particular theory.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The exact proportion of coal, water
          and oil is not critical, which is an advantage. It will vary a
          little with the gravity of the oil and with particular coal an
          excellent practical ratio is about 20 parts of pulverized
          coal, 15 parts of oil and 10 parts of water. This product
          settles out only a little oil as a supernatant liquid and a
          very stable dispersion results. However, somewhat more oil may
          be used and in some cases is desirable because the separated
          oil phase can easily be recycled, and therefore the above
          ratio of ingredients is illustrative of a typical useful
          product. It should be noted that if there is an excess of
          water this also can separate a portion of water as a separate
          phase. For practical operation it is usually desirable to have
          any excess in the form of oil. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The violent sonic agitation also
          performs an additional function. It reduces the particle size
          of the coal, possibly because of coal particles striking each
          other during the violent agitation. The exact amount of
          reduction of particle size depends both on the energy density
          of the sonic agitation and on the character of the particle
          coal. A more fragile coal will, of course, be reduced somewhat
          more but the final size range still remains between about
          1.mu. and about 100.mu.. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">While the dispersion is fairly
          viscous it still flows readily and does not have to be heated
          prior to supplying it to the burner. This is an advantage over
          burning highly viscous residual fuel oils which have to be
          heated by steam before being atomized in a burner. This is one
          of the advantages of the present invention as it permits
          eliminating heating equipment without eliminating its
          function. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The actual atomization in a burner
          is not what distinguishes the present invention from the prior
          art and any suitable form of a burner can be used. One such
          form is a sonic probe which atomizes the dispersion of fuel
          from its end. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Where the coal used is of low
          sulfur so that sulfur oxide emissions from a furnace stack are
          within environmental standards the fuel of the present
          invention may constitute only pulverized coal, oil and water,
          however, the present invention makes possible elimination of a
          large amount of sulfur oxides in a very simple and economical
          manner. This opens up cheap, high sulfur coal for use where it
          would otherwise not meet environmental standards. When it is
          desired to reduce sulfur oxide emissions preferably finely
          pulverized lime or limestone may be dispersed in the water.
          This will be generally referred to as lime and it may be
          introduced in the process of the present invention either
          before or after oil introduction, preferably it is introduced
          substantially simultaneously when feeding to the sonic
          emulsifier. It should be noted ordinarily pulverized lime will
          be fed in in the form of a water slurry and the water content
          must be taken into consideration in the total amounts of water
          in the final product. When the pulverized lime is introduced
          it forms part of the suspension and is stable and does not
          settle out on standing. This avoids any distinct problems and
          is a further advantage of the aspect of the present invention
          where sulfur oxides are decreased. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Lime is the preferred alkali to use
          when high sulfur coal is to be burned. It has many practical
          advantages such as low cost and the fact that the calcium
          sulfate which is produced in the flame has very low solubility
          in water. Other alkalis may be used such as for example sodium
          carbonate. Most of these other alkalis form sulfates which
          have considerable solubility in water. As water vapor is
          always produced in the burning of the fuel this can present
          problems particularly as at some stage of the stack gas
          treatment temperatures are reduced and liquid water may
          condense out. In such a case it can form somewhat pasty masses
          with alkalis, the sulfates of which are fairly soluble in
          water. This makes electrostatic precipitation more difficult,
          as the precipitator normally requires that the particles which
          it removes be dry. There is also a possibility in other parts
          of the combustion gas treatment equipment for deposition of
          pasty sulfates to result. This requires additional cost for
          cleaning and is one of the reasons why lime is the preferred
          alkali. However, other alkalis may be used and in its broadest
          aspect the invention is not limited to the use of lime
          although this is the preferred material. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The removal of sulfur oxides
          depends on the amount of lime or other alkali. The lime should
          normally be in excess over the stoichiometric value based on
          the sulfur content of the coal. The more lime used the greater
          reduction. For example with a 50% excess 50% of the sulfur
          oxides may be eliminated or rather fixed as calcium sulfate.
          When more lime is used the sulfur oxide reduction becomes
          greater reaching about 80% when the lime is in twice
          stoichiometric ratio. The additional removal of sulfur with
          still more lime occurs more slowly as the curve tends to
          asymptote and therefore ordinarily much greater excesses than
          twice stoichiometric are not economically worthwhile. With
          quite high sulfur coal the the approximate 80% reduction
          brings the fuel within environmental standards. Lime, while
          not a very expensive material still adds to the cost and in
          some cases with lower sulfur coals a 50% sulfur oxide removal
          brings the fuel within environmental standards and in such
          cases smaller excesses of lime may be used. This is an
          economic question and there is no sharp upper limit.
          Theoretically calcium sulfate (gypsum) which is recovered by
          electrostatic precipitation or other means can be sold.
          However, the cost of producing the recovered gypsum may be
          more than its sale price so, where unneeded for environmental
          purposes, smaller lime excesses can present an economical
          advantage and are of course included. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
            EMBODIMENTS</i> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIGS. 1 and 2 deal with an
          experimental set up in which the coal dispersion is burned in
          a bed. The coal dispersion is typically produced by dispersing
          20 parts of coal in 10 parts of water adding 15 parts of oil,
          such as No. 2 heating oil, and subjecting the product to
          violent ultrasonic agitation with an energy density of between
          38.75 to 54.25 watts per cm.sup.2. In order to permit rapid
          dispersion the thickness of the liquids in contact with the
          vibrating surface is of significance, for example, in an
          ultrasonic probe which will be described in combination with
          FIG. 4. The thickness of the liquid layer is not sharply
          critical, but should be normally considerably less than the
          diameter of the vibrating surface. If the thickness of liquid
          becomes much greater the output is reduced although if
          sufficient time is given a satisfactory dispersion can be
          produced in quite a thick liquid layer, however, this is
          economically undesirable. Obviously, of course, the thickness
          of the layer of the suspension between the vibrating surface
          and container must be greater than the dimensions of the
          largest coal particles. As has been stated above, the
          particular size range is from about 1.mu. to about 100.mu..
          Although it is not practical to get an exact measurement the
          dispersion appears to be fairly uniform. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention is not
          limited to any particular finely divided coal. Typical coals
          in the specific embodiments to be described are an eastern
          bituminous coal having from 1 to 2% of sulfur. Another typical
          coal is a western Kentucky coal having slightly more sulfur. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">To produce a coal dispersion which
          will reduce sulfur oxide production on combustion pulverized
          lime in a water slurry is introduced at about the same time as
          the oil. The water in this slurry must of course be taken into
          consideration for the water proportion. If the coal is very
          low sulfur a lime excess of around 50% of stoichiometric can
          be used. For higher sulfur coals, for which the present
          invention is particularly advantageous, the excess should be
          about twice stoichiometric. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Turning back to FIG. 1 the
          experimental furnace is shown at (1) and is preheated
          electrically as is shown by the wires going to a surrounding
          electrical heating jacket. In the experimental set up the
          furnace was a cylindrical furnace about 1.25 inches in
          diameter. The coal dispersion is introduced and forms a bed on
          a suitable burning grate (2). Air is introduced as is shown
          and the amount of air should be approximately that
          corresponding to most economical combustion, i.e. a slight
          excess of air. The gases from the burning bed pass into a
          sidearm testube (3) which is filled with glass wool. This
          removes some solids and other impurities and then passes into
          a water scrubber (4) which in the experimental set up contains
          water with about 3% hydrogen peroxide. Then the gases pass on
          to a trap (5) and to a water trap (6) both in the form of
          sidearm flasks, the latter containing glass wool. The gases
          are pulled through by a partial vacuum as indicated on the
          drawing from any source, (not shown). Flow is measured by a
          rotameter (7). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Results of the tests are shown in
          the following table 1: </p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It will be seen that Table 1
          includes a number of tests made with varying amounts of oil
          and water and in each case included no finely divided lime or
          the number given in the table 1. This table also gives the
          amount of fuel burnt and sulfur oxides were measured by
          titrating with a sodium hydroxide solution. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The first four runs were burned in
          a bed, the fifth run atomized the fuel from the end of an
          ultrasonic probe. The sulfur oxide removal versus lime is
          shown as a graph up to 50% excess in FIG. 2. When the excess
          becomes greater than twice stoichiometric the curve flattens
          out or asymptotes at about 80% removal. In other words, in
          such a range the curve is actually an S. Curve. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic
          illustration of a practical flow sheet for a large plant. In
          this case the combustion is by atomizing the fuel from an
          ultrasonic probe. Coal, as shown on the drawing, is pulverized
          in a ball mill and pulverizer (8) and reduced to a particle
          size of less than 100.mu., with some of the particles as small
          as 1.mu.. The coal is then fed by a vibro-feeder (9) into a
          stream of water flowing at a controlled rate into a slurry
          tank (10). Slurrying is effected by a conventional propeller,
          a vent to the air providing deaeration. The slurry then passes
          through a controller and oil controlled by controller (11) is
          introduced and a little further on a lime slurry passes
          through in the controller (11). The proportion of lime to
          sulfur in the coal is about twice stoichiometric. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The slurry is then premixed in a
          premixer (16). The premixed slurry is then introduced into a
          sonic disperser (13) in this disperser an ultrasonic probe
          operating at between 20,000-22,000 Hz of the type shown in
          FIG. 4 which will be described below and the end of the probe
          which is operated from the front of the container (13) to
          produce a thickness of liquid substantially less than the
          cross sectional dimension of the end of the probe. Violent
          sonic agitation with cavitation resulted in the energy
          intensity being about 38.75 to 54.25 watts per cm2. A stable
          dispersion is produced which flows into a separator (14)
          provided with a weir (15) this weir permits some supernatant
          oil to flow over into a compartment from which the recycling
          line (16) recycles it to the premixer (12). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The coal-water-oil-lime then flows
          into another ultrasonic probe housing (17) and is atomized
          from the end of the ultrasonic probe into a combustion chamber
          (18). It is burned and the flue gases pass through a
          particulate separator in the form of an electrostatic
          precipitator (19) this removes finely divided calcium sulfate
          which can be recovered and sold. With coal having 2-3% sulfur
          the removal of sulfur dioxide is about 80% which brings the
          flue gases to environmental standards. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 4 is a semi-diagrammatic
          showing of a typical ultrasonic probe (20). Ultrasonic
          vibrations from 20,000-22,000 Hz result from electricity at
          the same frequency which is shown coming in through wires. The
          vibration is in a piezo-electric stack (21) to which is
          coupled the broad end (22) of a steel velocity transformer
          which tapers exponentially to a small end (23). It is this end
          which agitates the dispersion in the agitator (18) on FIG. 3
          and a similar probe produces atomization as indicated at (17)
          in FIG. 3. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Combustion of the atomized fuel
          produces a flame which is clear and results in complete
          combustion and which does not have the appearance of a flame
          from pulverized coal combustion. The presence of water in the
          fuel dispersion is probably what assures the flamequality and
          which permits very complete combustion. The combustion is so
          complete that there is very little if any loss in heating due
          to the presence of water which, of course, is flashed into
          steam as the dispersion burns. </p>

          process in which a water-in-oil emulsion of liquid fuel, such
          as liquid hydrocarbons, containing from 10 to 50% water and
          preferably 10 to 30% water is burned. The emulsion is
          produced, with little or no added emulsifying agent, by sonic
          agitation, including a sonic generator and an acoustic
          transformer having a larger cross-section coupled to or in
          contact with the sonic generator than at its other end, at
          which emulsification takes place, whereby the sonic energy
          density is increased. With the increased sonic density an
          emulsion is produced which when burned produces a quality of
          burn such that the combustion is faster, more complete, and
          cleaner, with an increase in efficiency even up to 30% of
          water. The increase in efficiency often equals that obtained
          by the burning of the same weight of pure fuel in the
          conventional manner. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</i>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The combustion of liquid fuel, such
          as liquid hydrocarbons, is a standard method of power and/or
          heat generation. The combustion may be in a system where the
          heat is transferred to another medium, such as water, with or
          without boiling the water, or the fuel may be burned in
          various types of internal combustion engines, such as those
          operating on Otto, diesel, or other cycle. The amount of
          oxygen, usually air, is at least about theoretically
          sufficient for complete combustion of the fuel elements. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Considerable problems have arisen.
          If there is a very large excess of oxygen, the efficiency of
          the combustion process is lowered because a considerable
          amount of air, including inert nitrogen, has to be heated up.
          In the case of an internal combustion engine also operating
          with excessive excesses of oxygen can result in slow
          combustion, which can overheat and burn out exhaust valves. If
          the combustion is with amounts of oxygen and fuel more nearly
          in balance, for example with only a small excess of oxygen,
          problems arise with incomplete combustion. This can result in
          excessive amounts of carbon monoxide and/or incompletely
          burned fuel, which may show up as unburned hydrocarbons, soot,
          and the like. Incomplete combustion lowers the combustion
          efficiency and can also contaminate the equipment. In the case
          of internal combustion engines, unburned hydrocarbons, carbon
          monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, generally symbolized by the
          formula NO.sub.x, are serious atmospheric pollutants as they
          give rise to photochemical smog and the like. Contamination of
          nitrogen oxides from an internal combustion engine usually
          results when combustion temperature is high. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has been proposed in the past to
          introduce streams of water into a burner or to inject water
          into an internal combustion engine as it operates. This has
          proven to reduce somewhat incompletely burned fuel desposited
          in the form of carbon, and in the case of internal combustion
          engines this can lower nitrogen oxide production and also in
          certain cases, such as aircraft piston engines, permit
          operating for short times at higher power outputs with very
          rich mixtures which would otherwise burn up the engine. Water
          injection, however, has serious drawbacks. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Problems have arisen in the control
          of relative amounts of water and fuel precisely, and even if
          the control is maintained to a satisfactory degree, efficiency
          drops because the water has to be vaporized. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It has also been proposed to
          produce an emulsion of hydrocarbon fuel and water by sonic
          vibration and then to burn this emulsion in a burner. This is
          described, for example, in the U.S. Pat. to Duthion, No.
          3,658,302, Apr. 25, 1972. The Duthion patent utilizes a form
          of sonic agitation produced by impinging a jet of the liquids
          against the edge of a blade free to vibrate. This form of
          sonic device is known in the art as a liquid whistle and was
          developed by the inventor of the present application, whose
          earliest U.S. Pat. is No. 2,657,032, Oct. 1953. While the
          emulsion produced is capable, in some cases, of being burned
          in a burner, particularly when a considerable amount of
          surfactant is added, it does not burn completely and produces
          an amount of heat which is usually less than that obtained by
          burning the fuel content because with the poor quality of
          emulsion the heat required to vaporize the water reduces the
          efficiency. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention deals with an
          improved water-in-oil emulsion with which much higher
          efficiency is produced. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The present invention burns a
          sonically emulsified, extremely fine water-in-oil emulsion,
          normally of hydrocarbonaceous fuel, in which the water
          droplets are of extremely fine particle size. The emulsion is
          effected by sonic generator coupled to an acoustic
          transformer, with a larger cross-section coupled to or in
          contact with the sonic generator than at its other end where
          the emulsion of the present invention is produced. Because the
          sonic energy is distributed over a much smaller area, the
          energy density is greatly increased. Since the sonic generator
          is operated at a fixed, predetermined frequency, the
          transformation in the transformer causes the velocity of
          movement and also its path length at the small end to be
          increased in order to comply with the law of conservation of
          energy. For this reason the acoustic transformers of the type
          described above are often referred to in the art as velocity
          transformers and the two terms are synonymous. The small end
          of the acoustic transformer emulsifies fuel and water in a
          restricted space through which the two liquids flow. Energy
          densities of about an order of magnitude greater than those
          obtainable in the liquid whistle type of sonic agitator are
          readily obtained and produce an emulsion which is not only
          burnable but which when burned produces combustion efficiency
          such that the yield of useful heat, from say a conventional
          boiler, is almost the same as if pure oil had been burned.
          Therefore, improvements in efficiency of 10% to 30% are not
          uncommon. When used in an internal combustion engine, flame
          temperature is decreased but the total amount of power
          produced by the engine is as great as by burning a comparable
          amount of unemulsified fuel. The invention is not limited in
          its broadest aspect to a water content of from 10% to 30%
          water as emulsions having up to 50% water are still burnable
          though they do not produce as much heat as would be obtained
          by burning the same total quantity of unemulsified fuel. As is
          well known, acoustically it makes no difference whether the
          acoustic or velocity transformer has its large end in contact
          with the sonic generator or whether it is coupled to the sonic
          generator, for example through a resonant metal bar. In the
          claims the term "coupling" or "coupled" is used generically
          wherever the sonic energy is transmitted, substantially
          without loss, from the sonic generator to the large end of the
          transformer and is not limited to actual physical contact of
          the large end with the vibrating crystals or other elements of
          the sonic generator or through a coupling element. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The water content is not critical
          within its range, optimum results being obtainable with about
          30% of water in an ordinary burner and less when the emulsion
          is used in an internal combustion engine; for example, optimum
          results are obtainable with about 18% to 20% water. In every
          case very clean combustion takes place, minimizing
          contamination and pollution, and in an internal combustion
          engine emission controls are readily met. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The surprising result of obtaining
          as much heat from an emulsion as with unemulsified fuel has
          been repeatedly tested. While I do not want to limit the
          present invention to any particular theory of why this
          suprising result takes place, it seems probable that the
          combustion of the emulsion in which the microscopic water
          globules explode into steam is more complete. The surfaces of
          a furnace or boiler encountering the flame may be below the
          condensation point of water or above, the latter being more
          common unless hot water at fairly low temperature is to be
          produced. In the case of an internal combustion engine
          temperature, the inner surfaces of the cylinder and the top of
          the piston are always above the condensation point of water
          when the engine is operating. The tests made and described in
          a later portion of the specification were with furnaces and
          engines where the surfaces were at a temperature higher than
          the condensation temperature of water, and therefore the
          improved results do not depend on the condensation of water
          vapor on cooler surfaces. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I also do not want to limit the
          invention to any particular theory of why the optimum water
          contents are somewhat lower for an internal combustion engine
          than for a burner in an ordinary heating furnace. A possible
          explanation might be that the heating oils have an average
          boiling point above that of water and, therefore, in the flame
          are completely exploded into steam without significant
          vaporization of the hydrocarbon fuel. In the case of gasoline
          used in the internal combustion engine tests, which will be
          described below, the average boiling point of gasoline is
          lower than that of water, and therefore it is possible that
          there may be some vaporization of gasoline during combustion
          before all of the water has been flashed into steam. There has
          been no rigorous proof of the above explanations but they are
          plausible possibilities and may well be part or all of the
          explanations of the surprising results obtained by the present
          invention. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the internal combustion engine
          modification of the present invention, while the total amount
          of power may be as great or, under certain circumstances, even
          greater, the peak flame temperature is usually lower, and it
          seems probable that the reduced emission of nitrogen oxide
          results primarily from this factor. However, this is not
          known, and the water vapor present in larger amounts as
          compared to carbon dioxide may also play a part. Therefore, it
          is not intended to limit the invention to any particular
          theory, and the above statements are made because I think the
          factors mentioned are at least some, and conceivably the only,
          factors involved. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The invention is not limited to the
          time in the whole operation when the very fine water-in-oil
          emulsion is actually produced. This may be at the point where
          atomization takes place just prior or at the point of
          ignition. This, however, is not necessary, and the emulsion
          may be preformed and conveyed to the burner nozzle in a
          preformed state. The emulsions obtained by sonic agitation
          including the acoustic transformer are quite stable and so
          they can be produced at a point remote from the actual burner
          itself, and such a modification is, of course, included. It is
          also possible to have the emulsion formed by flowing water and
          oil over the emulsifying point, preferably the end of a sonic
          probe, so that the emulsion is formed at the same place, or
          practically at the same place, as atomization into the flame
          takes place. In the case of the use of sonic atomization,
          particularly for internal combustion engine use, which is
          described and claimed in my co-pending application, U.S. Pat.
          No. 3,756,575, issued Sept. 4, 1973, referred to above, it is
          usually preferable to have the streams of water and fuel unite
          just prior to the point of atomization. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It is an important advantage of the
          present invention that it is not necessary to use any
          emulsifying agent, particularly when sonic emulsification is
          used. This eliminates the added step and, therefore, cost of
          the emulsion is reduced, although in a broader aspect the
          present invention does not exclude an emulsion which has been
          made in the presence of a small amount of an emulsifying
          agent, such as a small amount, usually a fraction of a
          percent, of a dialkyl sulfosuccinate or other well known
          emulsifying agent capable of facilitating the formation of
          water-in-oil emulsions. The invention in this aspect, which is
          normally not preferred, may use any known emulsifying agent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Ordinarily more problems are
          presented with the burning of heavy residual fuel oil, and
          this frequently requires steam heating. In the case of the
          present invention, however, the heavy oil emulsifies more
          readily than light oil, and when emulsified with a
          considerable amount of water, the viscosity is low enough so
          that it may be burned without preheating, or with less
          preheating, or at a lower temperature where cold water is
          added. This is an additional advantage for use with heavier
          oils. Why the heavy oil emulsifies more readily and to a lower
          viscosity has not been fully determined. It is possible that
          the heavy fuel oil contains contaminants which aid in the
          emulsification which are not present in the purer lighter fuel
          oils. It is not intended, however, to limit the present
          invention to any theory of action. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><i>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
            EMBODIMENTS</i> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In FIG. 1 a sonic generator 1 is
          shown powering a sonic probe in the form of an acoustic
          transformer 2, the end 9 of which extends into a chamber 3
          through a flexible seal 4 located substantially at a nodal
          point of the sonic probe. A stream of fuel, such as house
          heating fuel oil, is introduced through a conduit 5 and a
          stream of water joins it through a conduit 7 with a fail safe
          valve opened by fuel pressure. These two streams strike the
          vibrating end 9 of the sonic probe, as can best be seen in
          FIG. 2 where a portion of the chamber 3 is shown in section.
          The violent sonic agitation emulsifies the two streams, which
          then leave axially through an outlet conduit 6 in a plate 10
          which is located closely adjacent to the vibrating end 9 of
          the sonic probe. From the outlet conduit 6 the emulsion passes
          into a conventional burner 8 in a combustion chamber, (not
          shown). Air is introduced at 26 and a flame results. While the
          proportions of fuel and water can vary over a wide range, for
          example from about 10% to about 50% water, a very suitable
          mixture is about 70% fuel and 30% water. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The sonic probe is of conventional
          design with a stack of piezoelectric plates, (not separately
          shown), which are energized through the cable 12 by a suitable
          high frequency oscillator, (not shown), which may operate, for
          example, at a frequency of approximately 20,000 HZ. The plate
          9 at the end of the sonic probe 2 may be a flat plate or it
          may also be provided with a suitable baffle, for example a
          spiral baffle, to extend the period of residence in the
          violent sonic agitation field. The sonic generator illustrated
          diagrammatically is of a common commercial type sold by the
          Branson Instruments under their trade name "Sonifier." The
          particular design of the sonic emulsifier has nothing to do
          with the present invention and the illustration shows merely a
          typical one. The combination of the sonic generator and
          acoustic transformer is essential to produce the increased
          energy density on which the results of the present invention
          depend. However, the invention may use any other design having
          a sonic generator and an acoustic transformer producing
          comparable energy densities. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 4 illustrates a more recently
          developed Sonifier by Branson Instruments which has certain
          practical advantages, at least for larger burners. It is shown
          in cross-section. 1 is the generator, which is a stack of
          conventional piezoelectric crystals. These crystals are not of
          as large cross-section as the corresponding generator in FIGS.
          1 and 2 because they are coupled to an acoustic transformer,
          which, as it performs the same function as the transformer in
          FIGS. 1 and 2, bears the same reference numeral 2. The
          coupling is through a half-wave resonant rod 17, which couples
          to the large end of the acoustic or velocity transformer 2.
          The large end is shown at 18, and the transformer can be
          clamped by the flange 25 where additional rigidity is
          desirable since the modified Sonifier is considerably longer
          in length than that shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The small end 32
          of the transformer is bolted to and therefore coupled to a rod
          21 at the end of which there is the same kind of plate 19 as
          is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The rod is provided with lands 24
          and elastomeric rings 23. This is the portion which is at an
          approximate quarter wavelength and which seals the container
          where the emulsion is produced. This container and associated
          elements are the same as in FIGS. 1 and 2. Therefore, they are
          not repeated in FIG. 4. The modified Sonifier has the
          advantage that it is not limited to a single size of acoustic
          transformer and can be used with transformers of various
          cross-sectional ratios. Also, it is provided with a clamping
          flange 25, as has been described, which permits much more
          rigid construction and makes it suitable for a longer probe.
          The operation is exactly the same. The vibrations produced by
          the vibrating crystals are coupled to the acoustic transformer
          2 and the energy density is increased in the same way as by
          the transformer in FIGS. 1 and 2. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The equipment of FIGS. 1 to 4
          produce the same increased energy density at the small end of
          the probe. It should be noted that this is energy density,
          i.e. violence of agitation, which is effected by longer paths,
          hence the alternative name of velocity transformer. It is
          energy density which is required in the present invention and
          not total power input. As has been stated earlier, the energy
          density is about an order of magnitude greater than can be
          produced in a liquid whistle, and in the probes of FIGS. 1 to
          4, for illustration, this energy density is approximately 37
          watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">As illustrated and described above,
          stable fuel and water emulsions of the water-in-oil type are
          produced, and when these emulsions are burned combustion
          results in a boiler were measured in relative times to bring
          the water in the boiler jacket from a particular temperature
          to a temperature just below its boiling point. The test
          accurately measures the relative heating efficiencies and is
          shown in the following table, which illustrates the results of
          eight tests, tests 1 to 5 being with straight No. 2 domestic
          heating oil and tests 6, 7 and 8 with a mixture of oil and
          water. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">Boiler surfaces were carefully
          examined in the tests and were clean. A flame was produced
          which was whiter; there was no visible smoke from the chimney,
          and stack gas analysis showed a more complete and perfect
          combustion. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Tests were made comparing
          water-in-oil emulsions produced in a standard commercially
          available liquid whistle which is similar to the design
          described in the first Cottell U.S. Pat. No. 2,657,021,
          referred to above, with emulsions produced by emulsifiers used
          in the present invention and described in FIGS. 1 to 3. Liquid
          pressure in the liquid whistle was 200 psi and the energy
          density level in the sonic emulsifiers was approximately 37
          watts/cm.sup.2 or about an order of magnitude greater than in
          the liquid whistle. The tests with various amounts of water
          and No. 2 heating oil were compared in two respects, one,
          stability, i.e. time for onset of emulsion inversion, and,
          two, flame characteristics. </p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">It will be seen that at all water
          contents much more stable emulsions were produced in the
          ultrasonic fuel reactor of the present invention and the flame
          was excellent whereas emulsions from the liquid whistle
          produced intermittent flame accompanied by smoke, and in the
          operation flame out actually occurred. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 illustrates a modification
          particularly useful for internal combustion engines. The
          ultrasonic probe carries the same reference numerals as in
          FIGS. 1 and 2, but the shape of the end of the probe is a
          little different, being expanded out into a plate 10. Gasoline
          was introduced through the conduit 14 into an annular space
          between the probe and a housing 15, and water was introduced
          through conduit 13. The two liquids flow down until they come
          to the edge of the expanded plate 10, where they proceed to
          flow along the top of the plate and are atomized and
          emulsified at the same time. Air is introduced adjacent the
          atomized emulsion through an air conduit 16 and the resulting
          mixture is fed into the manifold of an internal combustion
          engine, (not shown). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The plate 10 projects beyond the
          housing, the clearance between housing and ultrasonic probe
          being exaggerated and the violent sonic agitation of the plate
          throws a finely divided emulsion up from the upper surfaces of
          its projection. As FIG. 3 is designed to connect with a
          manifold of an internal combustion engine, there will usually
          be a certain amount of vacuum, and this causes the emulsion to
          be pulled around the edge of the plate, as is shown by the
          arrows. Thorough mixing of the air takes place, but it is not
          necessary that the emulsion be thrown by sonic vibration into
          the manifold, whereas in FIG. 4 with the horizontal burner
          this is necessary so that the fine emulsion atomized in the
          blast of air moves horizontally to form the burner flame. It
          is for this reason that the actual contact of the plate with
          the film of fuel and water flowing over it is on its forward
          face so that it will be thrown in the direction to form the
          burner flame, for of course in an ordinary burner there is not
          the vacuum which exists in an internal combustion engine
          manifold. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The internal combustion engine fed
          with a gasoline and water emulsion atomized into the air ran
          with the same power as on straight gasoline, and pollutants
          were reduced, unburned hydrocarbons practically zero, carbon
          monoxide greatly reduced, and nitrogen oxides still more
          reduced. The figures illustrate the pollutant concentrations,
          the engine running at about 5,000 rpm under load. It will be
          noted that the pollutant concentrations are far below present
          emission standards and even meet more rigid standards proposed
          for later years. Carbon monoxide 0.94% unburned hydrocarbons
          0.0, nitrogen oxides 11.35 ppm. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract ~ </b>The production
          of fuel comprising an emulsion of coal particles, oil and
          water or a dispersion of coal and oil in which pyrites, ash
          and other impurities are removed from the coal particles and
          the particles reduced in size by forming a slurry of
          contaminated coal particles and water and exposing that slurry
          to violent sonic agitation to cause the impurities to be
          detached from the coal particles and the particles to be
          reduced in size. The coal and impurities are thereafter
          separated and the coal subsequently incorporated into a fuel.
          The process may also be used to separate other minerals which
          are bonded mechanically as distinct from chemically, to each
          other. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract ~ </b>A coal slurry
          containing 10-60% solids by weight is optionally first
          coarsely ground to about 20-80 mesh. Contaminant matter
          released thereby, may be separated by conventional means such
          as froth flotation which would eliminate a large proportion of
          the ash which is energy consuming as well as abrasive in
          nature. The "clean slurry" would now have water added back and
          would be further ground to about 100-300 mesh particle size
          and would then be cavitated by sonic energy making the
          particle size even smaller and freeing any remaining
          contaminants including iron pyrites and ash. To this, a
          mixture of oil is added and the coal, oil mixture is then
          sonified during which process spherical agglomeration of the
          coal and oil occurs. The agglomerate and water mixture is
          screened to separate out most of the water leaving behind
          about 10-40% water in the coal, during which process the
          contaminants are also discharged with the water. The spherical
          agglomerates are mixed with a balance of oil to about 0.6
          times the weight of the coal to produce a stable thixatropic
          fuel with excellent pipe travel characteristics due to a
          migration of a thin film of water to the boundry layer between
          the bore of the pipe and the fuel. The process including the
          sonification steps is also useful generally in the separation
          of solids by agglomeration. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract ~ </b>A fuel supply
          system comprises a supply tank with a main fuel conduit
          leading to a combustion zone, such as an internal combustion
          engine, and a secondary fuel conduit with flow restriction
          means is provided leading from the lowermost region of the
          tank to rejoin the main fuel conduit prior to the combustion
          zone so that any water accumulating in the tank is mixed with
          fuel to be burned at the combustion zone. </p>
