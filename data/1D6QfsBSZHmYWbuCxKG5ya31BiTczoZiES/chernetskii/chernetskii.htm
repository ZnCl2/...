        A BREAKTHROUGH?<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        by <br>
        <br>
        Andrei Samokhin<br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The model of a plasma generator which can convert physical-vacuum
      energy into electricity has been developed under Prof. Alexander
      CHERNETSKI at the Moscow Georgi Plekhanov Institute of the
      National Economy.&nbsp; Such generators could lay the groundwork
      for the future environmentally-benign power industry.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Classical physics cannot explain what happens when a plasma
      discharger placed in the Chernetski circuit is started: for no
      apparent reason the ammeter pointer shows triple
      strength-of-current increase [sic] and energy output is several
      times above input.&nbsp; The plant's efficiency is much more than
      1.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      No magic is intended.&nbsp; Additional energy outputs at specific
      plasma discharges are fixed in several independent expert
      reportsby the Lenin All-Union Institute of Electrical
      Engineering.&nbsp; This effect has been checked by different
      methods. Whence this mysterious energy?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Self-generating discharge</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Prof Chernetski, the author of the first ever study paper on
      plasma-diagnotics equipment (he has been in this field fro 40
      years now) and 20 inventions, never knew what he was probing into
      specific unstable plasma states at strong-current discharges could
      have led to.&nbsp; In the early 70s, he and fellow-researcher Yuri<br>
      Galkin worked on a basically new type of high-frequency plasma
      generator which could at high power do without unwieldy energy
      converters.&nbsp; In one test, they discovered input-output energy
      gap. [sic]<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "I knew electron drift begins in plasma and sought to deduce a
      combination of variables in which fluctuating plasma instability
      emerged in discharge," Chernetski says.&nbsp; "Gas discharge was
      meant to serve as a powerful stimulator of electromagnetic modes
      and, all of a sudden and in defiance of the law of conservation of
      energy, a strange energy imbalance was produced.&nbsp; Repeated
      experiments with different circuits proved energy output to be
      always greater than input."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The mysterious discharge stimulating additional energy extraction
      was called the "self generating discharge (SGD)". Measurements
      showed that part of the discharge power went back into the network
      as if two series-connected electromotive forces were at work.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In a bid to try to explain the experimental data, the researchers
      actually tried to prove the impossible.&nbsp; One of their proofs
      was very "strong".&nbsp; The one-megawatt substation of the Moscow
      Aviation Institute, where Chernetski and Galkin were staging an
      experiment with a powerful plasma unit, burned out. When the
      dischrage currents reached criticality, superstrong current was
      "born" in the generator and went back into the network, playing
      havoc with the safety devices calculated for short-circuit.&nbsp;
      Later on, they read in books that earlier in the century the power
      plant of prominent Yugoslav electrical engineer Nikola Tesla
      caught fire under similar circumstances in the United
      States.&nbsp; Chernetski and Galkin were sure that Tesla was
      making such experiments, but did not publish the results.&nbsp;
      They are also sure that vacuum energy can explain this mysterious
      effect.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A Vacuum-Powered Lamp</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;<br>
      The researchers relied on the present-day quantum physics idea of
      "zero-point oscillations" in physical vacuum.&nbsp; Such
      oscillations signifying the birth and annihilation of virtual
      pairs -- the particle and anti-particle, distinguished from the
      normal elementary particles by a negligibly short life, a mere
      8.10/-21[sic] sec.&nbsp; Emerging below the zero energy level from
      "nothing" and returning to "nothing", virtual particles as if defy
      the law of conservation of energy.&nbsp; Quantum electrodynamics
      explains this paradox through the Heisenberg uncertainty
      principle.&nbsp; Under it all the precise particle characteristics
      cannot be learnt simultaneously and, therefore, one must not
      require from nature "punctual" abidance by the law during such a
      short time as the life of virtual pairs.&nbsp; The observer fails
      to notice anything, while every virtual pair is more than real,
      carrying an energy of more than half a million electron-volts
      during its lifetime.&nbsp; The potential energy in the electric
      bulb vacuum is enough to boil the earth's oceans, Americans John
      Wheeler and Richard Feynman have calculated.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Until recently the vacuum energy idea was only a daring hypothesis
      bordering on science-fiction.&nbsp; The lamp powered by vacuum in
      Chernetski's basement laboratory in the center of Moscow made it a
      reality.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This is how he explains his miraculous experiment: "The
      self-generating discharge emerges when the discharge current reach
      a definite critical density, when the magnetic fields they create
      ensure magnetisation of plasma electrons and they begin to perform
      mostly cycloid movements. The interaction of currents with their
      magnetic fields forces the electrons to deviate to the
      cylinder-shaped discharge axis and the electrical field emerges.
      It has proved to 'switch on' the physical vacuum: in this field
      the vacuum is polarised and consequently the virtual pairs begin
      to move in a definite direction, instead of chaotically. The
      virtual positrons accelerate plasma electrons, giving them part of
      their energy. The current in the circuit builds up and additional
      energy is discharged on the resistor switched into the discharge
      circuit. Clearly, only part of the tremendous vacuum energy is
      extracted.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "We've developed several circuit versions which can find
      application.&nbsp; In the later experiment with an input power of
      700 watts, that extracted by the generator loads resistance was
      three kilowatts, or nearly five times more. This is by far not the
      limit and with more powerful plants and the corresponding
      calculations megawatts of free electricity can be produced from a
      minimal power source."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Self-Generating-Discharge
        Plasmatron and Space Travel.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;<br>
      Yuri Galkin looks at the future of their discovery: "Its
      applications are wide-ranging. For example, engines based on the
      self-generating-discharge plasmatron. Until now all attempts to
      use plasmatrons as engines failed, because strong electron and ion
      bombardments rapidly burnt out the electrodes. Self-generating
      discharge leaves them inatct and such engines can be used in
      aircraft, trains and autos. It would be logical to create a new
      environmentally-wise power industry. Portable hydros, wind power
      plants and solar batteries boosted by self-generating discharge
      could become an enormous source of electricity. With time, they
      could edge out the costly and hazardous fuel-firing and hydraulic
      [hydroelectric?] facilities. Already now we can build a plant
      which would supply electricity for a township or factory.&nbsp; A
      vacuum power station comparable to giant facilities could be
      designed today. Our discovery can revolutionise cosmonautics."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Laboratory experiments have proved the possibility of using the
      kinetic effect of self-generating discharge for accelerating
      bodies in space. Galkin has calculated the parameters of a
      self-generating-discharge plasmatron that could serve as the
      propulsion engine of the future, replacing the present unwieldy
      rocket engines. Powered by a minor ten-volt source, it can deliver
      power enough for the takeoff of a large spaceship. Tapping the
      ambient space vacuum, it could fly eternally.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown Waves</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;<br>
      "We didn't think of only industrial applications," Chernetski
      recalls. "Self-generating discharge turned out to produce wave
      radiation which was hitherto unknown, but evidently existent at
      all times. Like sound waves, its waves have a longitudinal
      electric field component and a high penetrability through
      condcutive mediums, including metals. It turned out that these
      single waves, 'awakening' the hidden vacuum energy, can alter
      substance structure. "The experiment staged at the Burdenko
      Institute of Neurosurgery in Moscow several years ago showed that
      directional SGD radiation accelerated nuclear beta-decomposition
      by 5%-6%. This is only one example. We supposed that, like
      SGD-generator radiation, longitudinal electric-field component
      waves could also be produced by living beings, man in particular.
      Comparative experiments were staged to prove the impact on men
      with extrasensory perception and of our device on different
      objects. In both cases parallel impact on the high-stability
      quartz generator made its frequency 'drift' by several orders of
      magnitude. The filament resistance of the incandescent lamp
      decreased considerably. Probably we are on the road to explaining
      such mysterious things as extrasensory perception, telekinesis and
      bioenergy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vacuum-Ether</span><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The experimentally-verified concept of Chernetski claims to be a
      theoretical breakthrough in the basic quantum-physics idea of the
      energy structure of the Universe. It is generally recognised among
      physicists that all elementary particle interactions, and hence
      every existing phenomenon, occur with the help of virtual-particle
      exchange. How does it come about?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "Full annihilation of virtual pairs cannot take place in the event
      of partial energy extraction in self-generating discharge, because
      a 'certain' virtual dipole must emerge -- two separate charges
      with a<br>
      common negative energy. This means that together with energy
      extraction vacuum structurisation and ordering takes place.
      Actually, our concept is a return to the idea of the universal
      ether at an entirely new level. We say that the ordered dipole
      vacuum, or ether, is an all-penetrating energy medium in which
      processes occur which are related to virtual dipoles and subject
      to the uncertainty principle of modern physics."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Chernetski asks: if vacuum structurisation is a constant process,
      isn't this an opportunity to state the law of conservation of
      entropy in the Universe in opposition to the idea of its steadfast
      decrease?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      What if this work helps to clear up the nature of gravitation,
      which is as dim now as it was in the times of Newton? What his
      concept of the vacuum shows the road to the long-awaited
      explanation of the Grand Unification theory?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "As as experimental physicist I won't say our theory is 100
      percent correct," Chernetski declares. "It's much more an
      opportunity now to have indisputable experimental data to prove
      the opportunity of creating a basically new power industry."<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Only a rapid switch to new energy can save human civilization from
      ecological catastrophe.&nbsp; The research program must be
      developed immediately and a center set up to coordinate
      cooperation between world scientists. Natural and unlimited vacuum
      energy is at our doorstep.<br>

      I would like to present my comments on well-known paper by
      Alexander V. Chernetsky&nbsp; «About physical nature of biological
      energy phenomenons and its modeling» that was published in 1989
      [1]. He showed clear analogy between physical nature of&nbsp;
      telepathy and his discovery named as electrical «self-generating
      discharge» SGD.<br>
      <br>
      The SGD produce longitudinal electromagnetic wave that is not
      accepted in classical physics since it can be created only in some
      substance like the sound wave can be created in air. But it is the
      experimental fact and the substance we have to talk about is the
      ether or the material space. Alexander Chernetsky used the term
      «physical vacuum» to show principal difference between his
      «structured vacuum» and «vacuum as nothing».&nbsp; The waves we'll
      discuss are the energy density waves created locally in&nbsp;
      space so there is some volumetrical density of this energy. In
      other words, the space is product or result of some process and
      its energy density is depend of the parameters of the process.
      When we'll get the way to generate the wave it means to create
      some local change of the space or material object structure
      located in the area of the wave. The experiments proved it.<br>
      <br>
      The development of biological energy science is important
      direction of medical research in strength of the possibility to
      correct biological field of the object and it is the correction of
      the reason of the disease.&nbsp; Many scientists present the
      biological field like some special kind of the field but others
      think it is electromagnetic one.&nbsp; Academician Vernadsky
      developed the conception of global energy and information field of
      our planet that was named as «noosphere» and it is the result of
      any processes for all&nbsp; biological objects. In this case the
      biological field should be high penetrating field through any
      barrier or screen. Also it should be self-sustaining energy
      process to keep the information for a long time.&nbsp; By
      Chernetsky the energy field of biological objects can be produced
      by longitudinal electromagnetic waves and they are generating by
      means of movements of electrical charges (plasma) in energy
      centers and channels of human, animal or plant [2].&nbsp; The
      electrical plasma of SGD he investigated is similar to biological
      plasma and it demonstrate the negative electrical&nbsp;
      conductivity that is the condition for self-sustaining energy
      mode. So, the medical topic we started is connected with «free
      energy» topic also, i.e. the wave must be getting energy from
      surrounding medium to exist and this method can be developed in
      fuel-less source of energy&nbsp; technology. By this way of
      operation the space itself is the source and it become locally
      more «thin» or more «rare» when the energy is extracted directly
      from it. The term «rare» is connected with some frequency of the
      process and I would like to note once more: the space can be
      considered as some periodical process of some frequency and its
      energy density is depend of the frequency. The mechanical analogy
      is some «free energy system» that is taking energy from invisible
      rotation of surrounding substance. From my point of view, this
      frequency can be considered also as local rate of&nbsp; time flow
      and the «time machine» technology is not impossible idea and it
      does not require some tremendous power input but it is the
      secondary effects of the free energy device if it is an
      «extractor» of power from the process of the existence of the
      material space.<br>
      <br>
      One of&nbsp; many experiments by Chernetsky was dedicated to
      investigation of biological nature of the longitudinal
      electromagnetic wave. The experiment was made in Moscow by
      V.I.Dokutchaev [3], in Novosibirsk by Y.V. Tornouev, and in Moscow
      by A.V. Chernetsky. Small animal was killed and just at this
      moment the electrometer detected the changes of electrical field
      gradient. The animal was submitted in metal box so classical
      transverse electromagnetic wave (Hertz wave) should be screened
      and only longitudinal electromagnetic wave (Tesla wave) can
      penetrate the screen. I have to note the analogy with
      N.A.Kozyrev's experiments [4]. He investigated the wave that is
      produced by any non-reversible process, for example by dissipation
      process or by deformation of elastic matter. The wave was detected
      by several methods: electrical component of the wave was detected
      by electrometer. The mechanical effect was detected by special
      rotational&nbsp; weight system. The wave produce changes of
      structure and electrical conductivity of a matter and it can be
      detected by any balanced electronics circuit when one element of
      the circuit is placed in the area of the wave. N.A.Kozyrev named
      the waves as «density of time rate waves». He detected this wave
      also for the process of fading of the part of a plant. So, the
      seasonal and daily changes in the energy density of space were
      described by many scientists as changes of the ether density&nbsp;
      can be explained by the changes in biological activity. For some
      applications it is useful to consider the same wave as the flow of
      some particles, named as «chronons» by Academician Albert I.
      Veinik [5]. He detected local changes of the rate of the time by
      means of two equal quartz oscillators when one of them was
      submitted in the area of the generated «flow of chronons». Really,
      we have to talk about some changes in the matter structure (up to
      inter-atom distance) of the quartz that produce detected frequency
      difference. The same experiment was described by N.A.Kozyrev for
      his «wave of the density of the time». To use some common&nbsp;
      term let's name this wave as the Energy Density Waves (EDW) in
      difference from&nbsp; electromagnetic wave (EMW). It is the
      longitudinal wave, i.e. the energy density is modulated in the
      direction from the generator to infinity. The velocity of the wave
      is the question of investigation but if the space (the ether) is
      considered as some solid state matter&nbsp; there are no any
      doubts to take it as super-luminal or instantaneous velocity.
      Let's take an example: when one push the table at the same moment
      all points of the table are moving and the velocity is
      instantaneous. It is corresponding to Kozyrev's theory and he
      proved it in the experiments to detect real and imagine positions
      for&nbsp; a star. He got information about visible star position
      by means of electromagnetic waves are spreading with limited
      velocity of light and the real position was detected by the
      trajectory of «wave of density of time» that is instantaneous
      information signal without any spreading.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, we have to use four-dimensional view to consider
      three-dimensional world as the system of some density of energy
      and when one create the changes of the density this
      four-dimensional wave is not spreading along some spatial
      dimension but it is created in all points of the&nbsp; Universe at
      the moment of creation. Sure, the value of the change near of the
      generator and far from generator is different so it is local
      changes in some sense.<br>
      <br>
      N.Tesla investigate the standing wave of electrical nature like
      the wave he observed in process of natural storm. In 1932 he
      wrote: «...I showed that the universal medium is a gaseous body in
      which only longitudinal pulses can be propagated, involving
      alternating compression and expansion similar to those produced by
      sound waves in air.» [6].&nbsp; Now we have few different views to
      the ether: Is it absolutely solid state body or the gaseous one?
      There is fine solution to solve the problem and this approach is
      proved experimentally by A.M.Mishin, St.-Petersburg [7]. He
      published the results of long-time measurements he produced in his
      home laboratory. The equipment included&nbsp; special detector
      made as auto-oscillating electromechanical system with some
      biological element to get electrical signals from changes of
      biological plasma state. By Mishin, the system detected all
      turbulent disturbances (the temperature) of the ether, anisotropic
      properties (direction and polarization) of the ether and the ether
      fluxes (the ether winds). His conclusion is: the ether exist in
      different states and the state depend of the parameters of the
      turbulent disturbance. For ether-1 it is solid state body, ether-2
      is dense superfluid liquid, ether-3 is connected with molecular
      motion and it is gaseous body, ether-4 is stellar plasma state and
      ether-5 correspond to galactical processes. By this view the
      Tesla's understanding of the ether is true for certain energy
      level of process in the space. Kozyrev's instantaneous interaction
      by means of active properties of time is possible in solid state
      ether.<br>

      Let's consider the technology of SGD by Chernetsky to show the
      source of energy for it. At first, we have to suppose zero point
      oscillation reality, i.e. vacuum structure is some process of
      transformation from photons to virtual electron-positron pairs and
      from electron-positron pairs to photons. When strong electrical
      field is created on surface of the plasma the vacuum structure
      should be polarized and by this reason the movement of virtual
      particles acquire certain direction to increase electrical field
      intensity and to accelerate plasma electrons. By this way
      Alexander V. Chernetsky explained his over-unity experimental
      results. [1, p.16]. He wrote about some kind of radiation that is
      created in biological over-unity energetics process like SGD, so
      by his opinion the global energy-information field of the planet
      (noosphere) is created as superposition of these self-sustaining
      waves. Also he noted some telekinetic facts can be explained by
      the hypothesis of vacuum structuring if human brain can produce
      quite powerful image of some object and this image will get energy
      from vacuum to interact with real object [1, p.21].<br>
      <br>
      Let's note the term «holography» that is useful for any case of
      information reproduction when some small part of the
      interferention structure include information about all sources of
      the waves. Since the global information field is produced by&nbsp;
      energy density waves we discussed above the interferention image
      will be four-dimensional structure and the notion of «part of
      image» is different from ordinary holography. In a few words:
      three-dimensional holography is result of interferention of
      electromagnetic transverse waves and the information is submitted
      in thickness of the photography emulsion&nbsp; so any point of
      surface of holographical plate can be used to reproduce all image.
      It is necessary to use some coherent source of electromagnetic
      waves (laser). Similar technology can be used to reproduce
      information from four-dimensional interferention structure but it
      is necessary to use some coherent source of the energy density
      waves. Also there is the difference: information can be reproduce
      from any point of three-dimensional holography plate since there
      is some thickness of the plate, and information can be reproduces
      from any point of four-dimensional holography structure if we'll
      use some period of time. The time axis is the analogy for
      thickness in this case.&nbsp; This hypothesis include supposition
      about some elementary period of reproduction for all material
      structure of the Universe. The Planck constant and discrete laws
      of quantum world allow to calculate the period of time that is
      minimal part of four-dimensional structure to reproduce it at
      whole image. From this point of view any process that is creating
      the energy density wave also it is production of the «recording»
      into global energy-information structure. Medical application of
      this theory is quite simple: it is necessary to produce some
      compensation «recording» to remove the disease or aging process.<br>
      <br>
      If three-dimensional holography image is copy of real material
      object that create the interferention structure of electromagnetic
      transverse waves in thickness of the plate, so four-dimensional
      holography is copy of real energy process that create
      interferention structure of&nbsp; energy density waves in
      structured vacuum. When three-dimensional holography is reproduced
      it is possible to see image without real material object. When
      four-dimensional holography is reproduced the energy process can
      be detected without&nbsp; material structure of a «generator» that
      is connected with original process. The power of reproduced
      process is depend of used coherent source of energy density waves.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Technical aspects of experimental SGD device were not detailed by
      Chernetsky in [1] but he explained the ways to get SGD. By his
      definition, self-generating discharge is special type of
      electrical arc that can be created at certain value of density of
      discharge current. Since volt-ampere diagram of any arc consist of
      decreasing and increasing part, Chernetsky noted two ways for
      self-sustaining electrical oscillations: at first, small current
      way on the decreasing part of the diagram when the resistance of
      the arc is negative, and at second, great current way on the
      increasing part of the diagram when the arc plasma electrons are
      interacting with strong magnetic field of plasma (so called
      pinch-effect was found by Chernetsky in 1960th).&nbsp; First way
      seems me as most simple and effective way and there were produced
      some simple experiments to prove it [8]. But Alexander V.
      Chernetsky used the second way to get the self-sustaining
      oscillation in plasma. He noted: the pinch-effect produce the
      radial electrical field in the arc and corresponding radial
      magnetic field. In development of his explanation let me note:
      since the primary source create axial movement of changed
      particles between electrodes, the reason of&nbsp; radial
      separation and additional energy of the plasma particles is
      well-known Lorenz force. Positive feedback in this circuit is the
      next: pinch-effect compress the plasma in radial direction, then
      radial electromagnetic field interact with axially moving
      particles of plasma to increase radial separation, so the energy
      of plasma particles is increasing up to change of electrodes
      polarity that stop the arc process. The change is produced by
      plasma particle and the source is direct current source only. The
      changes of electrodes polarity are possible only if the energy of
      the particle is increased in process of the movement in the arc
      gap between electrodes. Capacity and inductive parameters of
      experimental device define the resonance frequency of the
      oscillations. Chernetsky tested 3MHz oscillations and duration of
      pulses was about 30 microseconds. He used voltage&nbsp; 600VDC
      (direct current source).&nbsp; The plasma was created in&nbsp;
      hydrogen at pressure about 0.1 T.<br>
      <br>
      To consider the mechanism of creation of longitudinal
      electromagnetic wave Alexander Chernetsky used Dokutchaev's theory
      of «charge equivalent» [3]. The effect is explained as result of
      relativistic changes of distances for two groups of electrical
      charges those are in relative motion. The distances between moving
      charges are less than the distances between charges in rest. This
      change in distances is equivalent to some additional electric
      charge and it is proportionally to the velocity of motion. The
      effect was tested in superconductivity circuit that was submitted
      in metal box (Faraday screen) and when the current was created in
      it the changes of electrical field were detected out of the box.
      It is possible only for longitudinal electromagnetic wave to pass
      through metal screen [3].<br>
      <br>
      I have to note some connection with gravity experiments by
      Podkletnov who is experimenting with superconductivity circuit.
      The changes of weight he detected can be explained by interaction
      with longitudinal electromagnetic wave. The wave is the energy
      density&nbsp; wave and in area of the wave all material things
      will change the structure and the weight. Sure, it can be used for
      gravity drive design.<br>
      <br>
      Dokutchaev's «charge equivalent» can be created both in
      superconductivity state metals and biological plasma, Chernetsky
      wrote. For the self-generating discharge the reason for
      longitudinal wave is radial component of the current (charges are
      moving both in axial direction between electrodes and they are
      oscillating in radial direction). Most important point is property
      of the wave to get energy from substance where the wave is
      created. It is based on negative conductivity of the substance
      Chernetsky calculated for the longitudinal wave. By this reason,
      the second law of thermodynamics can be discussed: if the vacuum
      consist of so called «virtual dipoles» so the structure of space
      can be ordered (structured) or disordered (unstructured).&nbsp;
      Chernetsky noted: the entropy is increasing in material world but
      this changes always is compensated by decrease of entropy
      (structuring) in physical vacuum. N.A.Kozyrev consider the same
      balance as changes of «density of time»: if some process, for
      example, crystallization or dissipation is created in matter, the
      corresponding compensation changes were detected&nbsp; in space
      near of the process [4, page 386].<br>
      The waves are generated by biological plasma produce the same
      structuring of the space and these «mind-forms» can demonstrate
      interaction with real material objects since the energy density
      wave are real energetically independent self-sustaining objects.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments were produced by A.V.Chernetsky, Y.A.Galkin,
      S.N.Kolokoltzev [1, p.84] to find changes in resistance of
      electronic circuit element if the element was submitted between
      plates of capacitor of self-generating discharge device. The same
      experiment was organized to show the changes of the oscillating
      frequency for quartz oscillator. The frequency was changed in 1000
      times and more. It is necessary to note that the changes were
      unreversible after the structure of the elements was changed by
      the energy density wave. Other interesting aspect is long-time
      structuring of the space that was experimentally proved by
      Chernetsky: the area of space between the plates of the capacitor
      produced the same effects to change the structure of matter after
      the capacitor was removed or disconnected from self-generating
      discharge device.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In this short review I tried to join some things to show real
      perspective ways for new technologies in most important
      applications for energetics, spacecraft industry, medicine and
      telecommunication. No matter if one consider it as far future
      fantastic perspective. It is reality and all you need is to create
      the arc by Alexander V. Chernetsky technology.<br>

      But the reason I'm writing about this, is because of a fascinating
      discovery made in Russia by Alexander Chernetski and tentatively
      called the PLASMATRON. In our past meetings we have discussed
      MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) and the possibilities it presented as
      an over-unity device.&nbsp; An ionized gas that was 'supercharged'
      with high density magnetic flux seems to exhibit certain
      properties which Chernetskii claims to take advantage of. <br>
      <br>
      His description of the process;<br>
      <br>
      "The self-generating discharge (SGD) emerges when the discharge
      current reaches a definite critical density, when the magnetic
      fields they create ensure magnetisation of plasma electrons and
      they begin to perform MOSTLY CYCLOID movements.&nbsp; The
      interaction of currents with their magnetic fields forces the
      electrons to deviate to the cylinder-shaped discharge axis and the
      electrical field emerges.&nbsp; It has proved to 'switch on' the
      physical vacuum; in this field the vacuum is polarized and
      consequently the virtual pairs begin to move IN A DEFINITE
      DIRECTION, instead of chaotically.&nbsp; The current in the
      circuit builds up and additional energy is discharged on the
      resistor (that is) switched into the discharge circuit
      (load).&nbsp; Clearly, only part of the tremendous vacuum energy
      is extracted."<br>
      <br>
      Note if you will, once the cycloid pattern is achieved, a specific
      direction of thrust is generated to force all loose electrons to
      be thrown off at whatever happens to be in its path, in the
      Chernetskii case, an energy collector absorbs the energy and then
      switches out the excess energy toload, such as a motor, light bulb
      or other device that performs a useful service.&nbsp; So, this is
      the same process as the inertial drive, except instead of using
      the rotation of a MECHANICAL part, we are using the spinning of
      the plasma, and instead of a weight, we are using a magnetic flux
      of a CRITICAL DENSITY...<br>

        <br>
        The present article discusses the extraction of excess power by
        means of an electric discharge (an arc). This extraction
        technique relies on the application of a field of electric
        potential (rather than current) for the creation of power.
        DEFINITIONS Energy is the ability to do work. Power is the
        process of work per unit of time. Potential is the value of
        energy that can be used to make the work. <br>
        <br>
        PREHISTORY <br>
        <br>
        It is clear that any experimental data can be interpreted in the
        light of different conceptions. Nikola Tesla's research work for
        wireless power transmission from the point of view of energetics
        can be described as the transformation of high-voltage and
        high-frequency electric field energy as output power to make
        produce useful work in a load. The direction of some of Tesla's
        patent research [1] was the derivation of excess power from
        electric discharges. Towards the end of the 1960s Prof.
        Alexander V. Chernetsky and Uri A. Galkin, Institute of
        Electrical Engineering, Moscow, carried out experiments using
        strong arc currents and observed a phenomenon they called, the
        "self- generating discharge". <br>
        <br>
        Figure 1 shows the voltage U and current I for this special case
        of arc.<br>

        <br>
        is the inflow into the system from an outside source. Detailed
        description of Chernetsky's experiments were published in
        English in [2] and [3]. Power output was up to 500 Kwatts and
        the proof of a reverse current from the experimental system into
        the electric station was detected. The Swiss M-L converter
        described in [4] and [5] uses a high potential source like the
        Wimshurst machine where it is connected to "spark gap
        cylinders". These devices are capacitors which have spires
        between the cylinders to create a "slow electrical arc" between
        the inner and outer cylinders. <br>

        from all the above technologies. Chernetsky's scheme was

      <alex@frolov.spb.su>A.V. Chernetsky used 5 lamps for 220 AC in
        series as the load. So, the stepup transformer was rated at
        220/1000 Volt, at 50 Hz. The discharge gap had carbon
        electrodes. When switch Sw1 is open the power in the load is
        increasing. I used a hand-made stepup transformer rated at
        28/2800 VAC at a 5 KHz input and using a high-voltage lamp as
        the load and metal electrodes. The gap was 2- 3 mm. A voltmeter
        and ammeter were used to check the input power. You will find in
        this experiment that the output power is increasing when the arc
        is energized, while the power in the primary circuit is
        decreasing. You can check that the Conservation Law is right:
        when Sw1 is closed and the current of conductivity is in force,
        the connection to the load will lead to an increase of the power
        consumed. So, the "plasma element" in the circuit allows for the
        extraction of additional power from OUTSIDE of the system and
        NOT from the primary source. Now let us consider another simple
        experiment that is closely connected with the scheme above. A
        more detailed description of it is published in [6]. <br>
        <br>
        Use a high voltage metal piece, for example a screw-driver and
        create an arc between the end of it and one wire of a
        high-voltage transformer. <br>

      <alex@frolov.spb.su><br>
        Check the power input and be sure that the power process of the
        arc is free from the input source. (I think he means no direct
        short) There will be no power consumption increase despite the
        powerful arc, which is sufficient to heat up the screwdriver.
        The next version of the experiment is possible if you have a
        single-polarity potential at the end of the wire for a pulsed
        current transformer. You will note that with a positive
        potential on one wire the arc is more powerful than for the
        other wire. This difference is not demonstrated using an AC
        transformer. Both ends of an AC coil can be used for creation of
        the arc. This difference will show the nature of this type of
        free power arc. Positive potential on the wire will provide for
        the attraction of free electrons from the metal of the
        screw-driver. It is not the current of conductivity that you are
        witnessing, but the DISPLACEMENT CURRENT. <br>
        <br>
        Application of the above effect into a useful form can be made
        like the well known Avramenko-Zaev-Lisin experiments [7]. <br>

      <br>
      <alex@frolov.spb.su>The alternating potential as measured at point
        A is sufficient to establish a current of conductivity in the
        closed circuit of VD1-VD2-R. This diode pair configuration is
        called 'Avramenko's plug'. I used for this scheme a 30 VAC
        hand-made generator (variable oscillator) to supply the input
        for L1, at a frequency of 10 KHz. The transformer was rated at
        30/3000 Volts and the diodes rated at 1.5 KV. The ammeter can be
        used as load R. Note that an ammeter placed between the
        transformer and point A does not show any current drain.
        CONCLUSIONS These circuits have experimentally proved the
        possibility of producing power in a load by means of POTENTIAL
        ONLY! Using a similar approach, mechanical motion, rotation and
        even a propulsion force can be created. So, free energetics can
        be formulated as the transformation of potential into power or
        Energy-Power Transformation. Since the power is a process, the
        question is the parameters of the process only. Alexander V.

        <span style="font-style: italic;">Vanguard Note.</span>.. If
        what this paper purports is true, then Bearden is correct in his
        theory that potential alone can drive a useable load. Many
        people have had problems with this claim, including me, because
        every power appliance we use requires current and not just
        potential (voltage). From my admittedly limited understanding of
        the matter, any energy can be 'translated' into a scalar form,
        which can be thought of as a stress soliton (bubble) in space,
        rather hyperspace. That soliton can simply exist in one
        location, can be 'thrown' like a ball, or sequentially streamed
        in a wavetrain to a given location where a receiver captures the
        solitons and translates them back into 3space. The nature of the
        energy sent using this method can be totally different from the
        nature of the energy received. Once translated to the 'base
        medium' of a scalar bubble (soliton), it can be re-translated
        from hyperspace to 3space in a form which is determined by the
        receiver characteristics. For instance, you could use magnetic
        energy to create the stress wave, send it to a receiver and
        re-translate it back into 3space IN THE FORM of light,
        electrical current, sound, heat, physical vibration, whatever
        you choose. To quote from an old book 'Light, when properly
        resisted, can be made to yield sound', from 'Dweller on Two
        Planets', available for about $18 from Health Research, PO BOX
        70, Mokelumne Hill, CA 95245. Ask for one of their superb
        catalogs. It is interesting to note the work of Hooper, who used
        a moebius form to produce what he called a 'motional field', a
        PURE ELECTRIC FIELD or wave if streamed in a wavetrain. Would
        not a pure electric field be pure potential? Such a signal is
        INVISIBLE to matter and normal instrumentation, therefore can be
        transmitted vast distances without loss of energy by inductive,
        capacitive or resistive sapping. I think there is a distinct
        possibility that a pure motional (electric) field is in fact, a
        scalar stress bubble! Our friend Peter Kelly, of Georgia, also
        indicates this by claiming 'information as energy' where the
        signature of a mass is held in a pure electric field. To alter
        (transmute) a mass, you must suppress the magnetic to allow
        access to the electric. Once the changes have been made in the
        electric field, you restore the magnetic and the mass slowly
        transmutes to fit its new pattern. So, the potential which
        Frolov refers to, is probably a pure electric field which is
        'translated' from its hyperspace form to CURRENT. Over the past
        couple of years, I have been toying with the idea that
        electricity is nothing more than a resistance to the flow of
        magnetic force and that electricity simply would not exist
        without resistance to its flow. But that's another tall
        tale.....have fun and please share your findings should you
        decide to experiment in this
        area!...............................thanks...&gt;&gt;&gt; Jerry

      By the ether concept, space is a physical substance that has a
      known (electric constant e and magnet constant m) and unknow, as
      of yet, properties. In any substance can be created so called
      longitudinal waves. In a general case, these are oscillations of
      the energy density in the direction of the wave spreading. In
      Alexander Chernetsky's paper "On the Physical Nature of Bioenergy
      Phenomenons and on their modeling", published in 1989, is
      described the properties of longitudinal waves which are created
      in so called "working bodies" (superconducting metal, plasma
      (electric discharge) and biological plasma). The theory of 1960,
      named as the "charge equivalent theory" was proposed by
      V.I.Dokutchaev, Russia (1932 - 1990). Relative motion of charges,
      according to Lorentz scale transformations, make the change of
      distance between charges of a moving frame of reference equivalent
      to an increase in charge density of the current. In a moving
      system there is created an additional equivalent charge:
      <center>q = (q<sub>0</sub> / 2) (u<sup>2</sup> / C) by Dokutchaev
      </center>
      where q<sub>0</sub> is the charge in a motionless system, u is the
      velocity of the system and c is the velocity of light.
      Dokutchaev's dissertation of 1970 described some experiments:
      superconductors were placed in an electromagnetically screened box
      (Faraday cage) but some signal was detected outside of the box
      when current was created in superconductor. The main conclusion
      is: longitudinal waves can be created in space (in vacuum) by
      means of electric energy and such sort waves is not screened by
      metal screens. Alexander Chernetsky also described some
      experiments in which longitudinal waves were created. In his
      version "the working body" is an electric discharge. There is a
      known pinch - effect (interaction between the electric current and
      magnetic field of this current) that leads to high frequency
      oscillations of the plasma. Radial components of the density
      current oscillations is responsible for longitudinal waves which
      are spreading in radial direction also [ 1 ]. More than 60 years
      ago Nikola Tesla wrote: " I showed that the universal medium is a
      gaseous body in which only longitudinal pulses can be propagated,
      involving alternating compressions and expansions similar to those
      produced by sound waves in the air. Thus, a wireless transmitter
      does not produce Hertz waves, which are a myth, but sound waves in
      the ether, behaving in every respect like those in the air, except
      that, owing to the great elastic force and extremely small density
      of the medium, their speed is that of light." It is part of
      N.Tesla's article "Pioneer Radio Engineer Gives Views on Power",
      published in New York Herald Tribune, Sept. 11, 1932, [ 2, p.94].
      American scientist Thomas E. Bearden explained this statement of
      Tesla in this way: An ordinary receiver uses so called "precessia
      of electrons" a phenomenon that is result of interaction between
      the electron gas of antenna metal wires and longitudinal waves [ 2
      ]. Tesla wrote about a great mistake of modern science: "The Hertz
      wave theory of wireless transmission may be kept up for a while,
      but I do not hestitate to say that in a short time it will
      recognized as one of most remarkable and inexplicable aberrations
      of the scientific mind which has ever been recorded in history",
      article "The True Wireless" [ 2, p.95 ]. The technology of Tesla
      requires high potential sources (up to millions of Volts) that
      produce high frequency oscillations. The terminals that creates
      the longitudinal waves are spherical metal surfaces (sphere
      capacitor). The synthesis of Tesla's scheme and Dokutchaev's
      concept allows us to make the conclusion: longitudinal waves are
      generated by means of a changing energy density (electric charge
      density). Let's call it the function r(t). In a Hertz transmitter
      there is a changing energy density also, but it is linear density
      r<sub>1</sub>(t): the density of electric current in the wire of
      the antenna. It is a one-dimensional density of energy. In Tesla's
      sphere capacitor there is a change of charge value that is placed
      on the surface of the capacitor. So, it is a two-dimensional
      density of energy r<sub>2</sub>(t). N.Kozyrev [ 3 ] created so
      called "waves of density of time" by means of non-electrical
      methods: rotation plus axial vibrations of a gyroscope,
      deformation of a material body, diffusion and dissolving or
      crystallization of the matter, fading of plants and so on.
      Different detectors for such sort waves were used: the electrical
      component of the was were detected by means of a galvanometer, the
      gravitational component of the wave was detected by means of the
      weighing-machine, the chronal component of the wave was detected
      by means of an electronic scheme that used so called "Winston
      bridge" since electrical properties of the electronics components
      are changing in the wave area. These three methods showed the
      next: any type of change of matter structure that can be presented
      as r(t) (i.e. a change of density of energy) is the method for
      generation of the longitudinal wave. For example, if it is a
      change of volume density of matter, we can write the
      three-dimensional density function r<sub>3</sub>(t). It is
      connected with the well-known Poisson equation for gravitation.
      There are more complex methods for longitudinal wave creation. R.
      Ziolkovsky, Physical Review A, vol.39, p.2005, wrote in the paper
      "Localized Transmission of Electromagnetic Energy" about his
      experiments. Before the electromagnetic version, R. Ziolkovsky
      created an analogy in liquid to study the properties of wave and
      to create an optimum antenna system. What method of the energy
      density modulation is the best for telecommunication systems? Some
      experiments prove the possibility that living biosystem create
      longitudinal waves [ 1 , p. 50 ]. By this analogy there is the
      possibility for creation of a technical system.

      ...In our investigations for increasing the functional activeness
      of plants, the quantum resonance radiator was used (Kovalev,
      Kalashnikov, Belov, 1998). The the field generated by the hydrogen
      gas discharging generator (HGG) has definite energy informational
      characteristics (power, frequency, periodicity and duration of
      radiation, wavelength), the change in the parameters of which
      ensures the address ness of its action and optimization of
      physiological biochemical processes considering the genetic
      features of the organism. The power of HGG flow onto the object
      constitutes - 0.5  1.5 W/m 2 in the field of invisible radiation
      with maximum 200  300 hm and frequency of waves from 10 to 100
      MHz.<br>
      <br>
      This electrophysical generator of action (patent of Russian
      Federation: No 2033200 dt 28.07.94, No 2045881 dt 28.11.94, No
      2057552 dt 19.04.95) presents an electron block, the purpose of
      which is the creation and maintenance of plasma of high frequency
      arc discharge (effect, invented by A. V. Chernetskii, 1989) in the
      mode of oscillatory arc discharge in hydrogen plasma, leading to
      the creation of electric field of larger intensities, directed
      perpendicular to the axis of discharge. The discharge is realized
      inside the ceramic bottle of cylindrical shape (discharge lamp).
      The acting factor, leading to the increase in the functional
      active ness of live organisms, shall be the signal of special form
      (SSF)*, which is translated with the help of informational 
      acting complex, presented as a device on the base of a LAPTOP type
      computer with original soft ware. The device has the provision of
      recording system and transfer of primary action of generator in
      time and space. The form, orientation and properties of reproduced

      ... A focus on the East must include the late Professor Aleksandr
      Chernetskii of Moscow. He developed a plasma generator said to
      convert vacuum energy into electricity. A press release at the
      time quoted Chernetskii as saying experiments with different
      circuits proved that the energy output was always greater than the
      input. The mysterious effect was called the self-generating
      discharge. One experiment with a powerful plasma unit burned out
      the huge megawatt electrical substation of the Moscow Aviation
      Institute. The discharge had reached a critical point in which
      superstrong current flowed from the generator and back into wires
      to the substation. In an experiment with an input of 700 watts,
      the generator produced nearly five times as much. <br>
