      <p>When Richard Palmer created d3o, a very cool advanced polymer
        with shear thickening properties, nobody thought it would work -
        and what good is it? </p>
      <p>Here's what you can do with d3o - you can make a supersuit, a
        flexible outfit that turns instantly as rigid as a tough
        fiberglass helmet. See Skiers Get d3o-based 'Impact Suits' for
        more information. </p>
      <p>What kind of guy would sell his house and car, and move into a
        friend's spare bedroom, and work until he made his dream a
        reality? Listen up: </p>
      <p>"It has been a battle against the odds to get this far. I've
        had to struggle against ignorance of the major players, work out
        of a back bedroom and beg, borrow and steal to keep development
        going, but I never doubted that it could be done," said Palmer.
      </p>
      <p>"What we've developed is already being incorporated into
        everything from police body armour to protective sportswear, and
        the number of applications is almost infinite. </p>
      <p>"At the moment a complete superhero suit made of our material
        would be a bit too heavy and far too expensive, but those
        challenges should be overcome within the next few years." </p>
      <p>Palmer was named the O2 X Entrepreneur of the Year award for
        2007 in a ceremony in London last week. A former DuPont
        scientist, he approached the world's largest polymer companies
        with his invention - and they said it was impossible. See

      <p>Inventors:&nbsp; Palmer, Richard Martin; (Herts, GB) ; Green,
        Philip Charles; (Herts, GB) </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This invention relates to energy absorbing materials
        e.g. of the kind employed in systems designed for the protection
        of humans, animals or objects from damage by impact; referred to
        hereinafter as impact protection systems. </p>
      <p>[0002] Conventionally, impact protection systems have employed,
        as the energy absorbing material, elastomer foams or similar
        relatively soft resiliently compressible materials. However only
        limited protection is achieved. In some systems, this energy
        absorbing material is employed in combination with a rigid
        member the purpose of which is to spread the impact force over a
        greater area and therefore reduce its effect. However, such
        systems tend to be inflexible and uncomfortable if in contact
        with a human body. Most vulnerable areas of the body which
        require protection, e.g. elbows and knees, undergo significant
        changes in geometry and thus any attempt to match a rigid
        load-spreading shape will usually fail. One solution is to
        introduce articulation into the rigid element but this can
        compromise performance and increases cost. </p>
      <p>[0003] More recently, proposals have been made for the use of
        shear thickening silicone putty materials, known as silicone
        dilatants, in or as energy absorbing materials in impact
        absorption systems. By a shear thickening material or dilatant,
        we mean a material which viscously flows at low rates of
        deformation but, at an elevated rate of deformation, undergoes a
        substantial increase in viscosity with rate of change
        deformation. At significantly higher deformation rates, such as
        those induced by impact, the material becomes substantially
        stiff or rigid. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,290 describes a
        bone fracture prevention garment which employs, as the dilatant
        or shear-thickening material, a dispersion of solid particles in
        a viscous fluid. GB-A-2349798 describes an energy absorbing pad
        including a putty-like dilatant. However, in both cases, the
        dilatant has to be contained in an envelope because of its non
        self-supporting nature. The resulting products therefore tend to
        lack flexibility and will require relatively complex and
        expensive manufacturing processes. </p>
      <p>[0004] JP 6-220242 discloses a shock absorbing material which
        consists of a flexible, three-dimensional mesh or foam body
        which has interconnected hollow spaces in its interior, and
        whose surface is coated with silicone bouncing putty. </p>
      <p>[0005] The present invention provides an energy absorbing
        material suitable for use in or as an impact absorption system
        and which is self-supporting. </p>
      <p>[0006] According to one aspect of the present invention, there
        is provided a self-supporting energy absorbing composite
        comprising: </p>
      <p>[0007] i) a solid foamed synthetic polymer, suitably an
        elastic, preferably an elastomeric matrix; </p>
      <p>[0008] ii) a polymer-based dilatant, different from i),
        distributed through the matrix and incorporated therein during
        manufacture of i); and </p>
      <p>[0009] iii) a fluid distributed through the matrix, the
        combination of matrix, dilatant and fluid being such that the
        composite is resiliently compressible, and preferably also
        flexible. </p>
      <p>[0010] By resiliently compressible we mean a resistance to
        compressive set. </p>
      <p>[0011] By a solid matrix, we mean a matrix material which
        retains its own boundaries without need of a container. Usually,
        the matrix will be elastic. </p>
      <p>[0012] According to a second aspect of this invention, there is
        provided a self-supporting energy absorbing composite
        comprising: </p>
      <p>[0013] i) a solid, closed cell foam matrix; </p>
      <p>[0014] ii) a polymer-based dilatant, different from i),
        distributed through the matrix; and </p>
      <p>[0015] iii) a fluid distributed through the matrix, the
        combination of matrix, dilatant and fluid being such that the
        composite is resiliently compressible. </p>
      <p>[0016] In addition to being self-supporting, the composite of
        the invention offers a degree of impact protection which can
        potentially exceed that of current rigid systems and moreover,
        in the preferred embodiment wherein it is both flexible and
        resiliently compressible, it has the ability to conform to the
        geometry of what it is designed to protect by maintaining
        intimate contact through relatively large changes in geometry.
        This is a key feature for the design of protective components
        because induced damage is a function of the maximum force
        resulting from the impact divided by the area over which this
        force is distributed. The composite of the invention enables
        both a reduction in the force and an increase in the area on
        which the force acts or is reacted, thereby significantly
        reducing the resulting pressure or stress transmitted for a
        given impact energy. It also offers the ability to exhibit some
        conformity to the impactor and thus produce additional force
        absorption as well as favourable geometry in terms of abrasion
        resistance. By means of the invention, it is also possible to
        achieve improved performance compared to the use of an
        equivalent mass of dilatant when used on its own. </p>
      <p>[0017] While it is to be understood that other solid materials
        may be suitable for use as the matrix, in one, preferred
        embodiment of the invention, the matrix is selected from
        elastomers. While natural elastomers, e.g. latex rubbers, may
        also be used, our preference is for synthetic elastomers,
        including synthetic thermoplastic elastomers. One preferred
        class of synthetic elastomers is elastomeric polyurethanes but
        it is expected that others such as silicone rubbers and EP
        rubbers, e.g. EPDM rubbers may also be suitable. </p>
      <p>[0018] In general, the resilient compressibility of the
        composite will be provided by the fluid which is dispersed
        throughout the matrix. Usually, the fluid will be substantially
        uniformly dispersed throughout the matrix but non-uniform
        dispersion may be desirable in certain cases. The resilient
        compressibility may be due to redistribution of fluid within the
        matrix and/or (in the preferred case wherein the fluid comprises
        gas) compression of the fluid. Thus, for example, the
        combination of matrix and fluid may advantageously be a foamed
        elastomer, e.g., a foamed polyurethane elastomer, the foam may
        be open-cell, closed-cell or part open, part closed. An
        important property of the foam is the rate at which it recovers
        after being subjected to compression. Preferably, recovery is
        complete or substantially complete within a few seconds, e.g. 5
        seconds or less, more preferably 2 seconds or less. However, a
        slower rate of return may actually be preferably for some
        applications. </p>
      <p>[0019] Any polymer-based dilatant that can be incorporated into
        the chosen matrix may be used. By a "polymer-based dilatant"it
        is meant a material in which the dilatancy is provided by
        polymer alone or by a combination of polymer together with one
        or more other components, e.g. finely divided particulate
        material, viscous fluid, plasticiser, extender or mixtures
        thereof, and wherein the polymer is the principal component. In
        one preferred embodiment, the dilatant is selected from silicone
        polymer-based materials exhibiting dilatant characteristics. The
        silicone polymer is preferably selected from borated silicone
        polymers. The dilatant may be combined with other components in
        addition to the components providing the dilatancy, e.g.
        fillers, plasticisers, colorants, lubricants and thinners. The
        fillers may be particulate (including microspheres) or fibrous
        or a mixture of particulate and fibrous. One class of
        particularly preferred dilatants comprises the borated
        siloxane-based material marketed by Dow Corning under catalogue
        no. 3179 where polyborondimethylsiloxane (PBDMS) constitutes the
        base polymer. </p>
      <p>[0020] Other polymer-based dilatant materials having similar
        dilatancy characteristics, e.g. a similar modulus at low rates
        of strain and a similar plot of modulus against strain rate are
        also included. </p>
      <p>[0021] The composite of the invention may be formed by
        combining a solid matrix, a polymer-based dilatant and a fluid
        whereby the dilatant and fluid are distributed, generally
        substantially uniformly, throughout the matrix to produce a
        resiliently compressible material. Where the matrix is chosen
        from synthetic elastomers, one suitable method comprises
        incorporating a polymer-based dilatant into a foamed synthetic
        elastomer. The dilatant may be incorporated during the formation
        of the foam. For example, the foam-forming ingredients may be
        reacted to form the foam in the presence of a solution or
        dispersion of the dilatant. Whatever method is used, however,
        while the dilatant may be incorporated into the pores of the
        foam, it is important that it does not completely displace the
        fluid from the pores. </p>
      <p>[0022] The composite of the invention may include components
        other than the dilatant and fluid, e.g., fibrous and/or
        particular fillers, plasticisers, lubricants, extenders,
        pigments, dyes, etc. If desired, the composite of the invention
        may be incorporated within an envelope which may be rigid or
        flexible, but this is not essential. Likewise, it may be
        associated with a rigid component but this is not essential for
        the use of the composite and may even compromise some of its
        properties. </p>
      <p>[0023] A coating may be applied to the composite, if desired. </p>
      <p>[0024] The actual constitution of the composite will be
        influenced by the intended application. Applications cover a
        wide range of uses and include impact protection for objects,
        animals and humans. Potential applications extend to any dynamic
        situation where the object may already be in contact with a
        surface and the combination of object and surface may undergo
        severe acceleration and/or deceleration, e.g. as in packaging
        for delicate equipment or a human body in a vehicle seat. Thus,
        the nature of resiliently compressible mass, the amount of fluid
        in the mass, e.g. as indicated by the density of the mass, and
        the choice and level of loading of the dilatant in the mass,
        will be determined by the requirements of the protective system
        in which the composite is to be employed. In general, the
        dilatant will form from 5 to 80%, preferably 10 to 50%, more
        preferably 20 to 40% (such as 15 to 35%) by volume of the
        composite, and the amount of fluid (in the preferred case where
        it is gas) will be such that the fluid content of the composite
        is preferably about 30 to 90% (such as 20 to 90%) more
        preferably about 45 to 90% (such as 30 to 80%) still more
        preferably about 55 to 85% (such as 40 to 70%) by volume. It
        should be noted that these proportions are excluding the use of
        any fillers or additional components. </p>
      <p>[0025] The energy absorbing composite of the invention may be
        employed in a wide variety of applications; for example in
        protective pads or clothing for humans and animals, in or as
        energy absorbing zones in vehicles and other objects with which
        humans or animals may come into violent contact, and in or as
        packaging for delicate objects or machinery. Specific examples
        of applications are in headwear and helmets; protective clothing
        or padding for elbows, knees, hips and shins; general body
        protection, for example for use in environments where flying or
        falling objects are a hazard, vehicle dashboards, suspension
        bushes, upholstery and seating. Other potential uses are in
        garments or padding to protect parts of the body used to strike
        an object e.g. in a sport or pastime; for example in running
        shoe soles, football boots, boxing gloves and gloves used in the
        playing of fives. This list is not intended to be exclusive and
        other potential uses will occur to the reader. </p>
      <p>[0026] The following Examples illustrate the invention in which
        dilatant materials were incorporated into a solid foamed
        synthetic polymer matrix during its manufacture. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0027] This example details the inclusion of the pure
        polyborondimethylsiloxane (PBDMS) dilatant during the
        manufacture of polyurethane (PU) foam. </p>
      <p>[0028] The base PU system is marketed by Jacobson Chemicals
        Ltd., Farnham, Surrey. The product is a modelling foam reference
        J-Foam 7087. This is a two part system which requires the mixing
        of two components, part A and part B in the ratio of 3 to 1
        respectively. This mix can then be cast into open or closed
        moulds to produce a shaped foam component. During the reaction
        of parts A and B a gas (believed to include carbon dioxide) is
        evolved to produce a closed cell structure in a PU soft foam. </p>
      <p>[0029] The PBDMS supplied by the Chemical Institute, Warsaw,
        Poland was pre-mixed with the J-Foam part A at room temperature
        in a polyethylene beaker by hand with the aid of a wooded
        spatula for approximately 15 minutes until the mix appear
        homogenous. Various ratios of PBDMS to part A were trialed and
        are detailed as follows: </p>
      <p>[0030] Trial 1-15 g PBDMS+40 g part A </p>
      <p>[0031] Trial 2-15 g PBDMS+30 g part A </p>
      <p>[0032] Trial 3-39 g PBDMS+50 g part A </p>
      <p>[0033] Each of the above pre-mixes was then mixed with part B
        using the same mixing method and maintaining the 3 to 1 ratio of
        part A to part B irrespective of the amount of PBDMS. This
        mixing time was typically around 10 seconds. These 3 component
        mixtures were next cast into a flat bottomed open polyethylene
        container and allowed to expand freely to produce the foams. </p>
      <p>[0034] As the PBDMS has a very much higher viscosity than
        either part A or part B, increasing the proportion of PBDMS
        produced a reduction in density of the resulting foam. The
        increased viscosity (melt strength) of the 3 component mix
        restricted the expansion of the mix during reaction and cure
        stage. To establish the effect of reducing the viscosity of the
        PBDMS/part A pre-mix by heating this pre-mix an additional batch
        of trial 3 was made with the pre-mix being heated to 65 degrees
        Celsius before mixing with part B. This sample was then cast
        immediately after mixing in the same way as previous specimens,
        but with the mould pre-heated to 65 degrees Celsius also. The
        resulting densities of foam were produced: </p>
      <p>[0035] Trial 1-400 kg/m.sup.3 </p>
      <p>[0036] Trial 2-500 kg/m.sup.3 </p>
      <p>[0037] Trial 3 (65.degree. C. pre-heated)-380 kg/m.sup.3 </p>
      <p>[0038] The densities were measured simply by weighing the
        samples and measuring the linear dimensions to establish the
        total volume and dividing this by the weight of the samples. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>[0039] The same technique as shown in Example 1 was applied to
        the manufacture of PU foam containing Dow Corning 3179 silicone
        dilatant. This dilatant is a filled PBDMS where the percentage
        of PBDMS is 65% by weight. This renders 3179 stiffer and
        stronger than the pure PBDMS. As a result of the presence of
        these fillers 3179 would not mix with J-Foam part A even with
        the assistance of an electric food blender. Using the electric
        blender 50 g of 3179 was dissolved in 40 g isopropyl alcohol
        (IPA), as solvent, then mixed with approximately 100 g of J-Foam
        part A. This produced a creamy emulsion. In order to minimize
        the amount of IPA present during the subsequent reaction with
        J-Foam part B the blender was left switched on with the 3179 and
        IPA and J-Foam part A mixture in a fume cupboard to encourage
        evaporation of the IPA. This was left for 1 hour. The
        evaporation of the IPA over this period of time caused the 3179
        dilatant to come out of the solution and to form solid globules
        of dilatant in the mix. The procedure was therefore repeated but
        during the evaporation stage the blender was stopped at 10
        minute intervals to observe visually the nature of the mixture.
        After 40 minutes tiny particles of 3179 dilatant in suspension
        were just detectable with the naked eye and at this stage part B
        was introduced into the mixture by hand and cast into an open
        container as before and again maintaining the 3 to 1 ratio of
        part A to part B. The resulting foam had a measured density of
        290 kg/m.sup.3 with a large closed cell structure (cell
        diameters approximately 0.7 to 1.2 mm). </p>
      <p>[0040] In order to increase the density of this foam the
        procedure was repeated with the addition of 35 g of PBDMS during
        the blending of the 3179 dilatant, IPA and J-Foam part A to
        increase the viscosity of the mix. The resulting foam was of
        much smaller cell size (cell diameters approximately 0.1 to 0.4
        mm) and of higher density--640 kg/m.sup.3. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This invention relates to applications where rate
        sensitivity can provide a performance advantage; e.g. energy
        absorbent impact systems designed for the protection of humans,
        animals or objects from damage by impact; these are referred to
        hereinafter as impact protection systems. </p>
      <p>[0002] Conventionally, impact protection systems have employed,
        as the energy absorbing material, elastomeric foams or similar
        relatively soft, resiliently compressible materials. However,
        only limited protection is achieved thereby. In some systems,
        this energy absorbing material is employed in combination with a
        rigid member the purpose of which is to spread the impact force
        over a greater area and therefore reduce its effect. However,
        such systems tend to be inflexible and uncomfortable if in
        contact with a human body. Most vulnerable areas of the body
        which require protection, e.g. elbows and knees, undergo
        significant changes in geometry and thus any attempt to match a
        rigid load-spreading shape will usually fail. One solution is to
        introduce articulation into the rigid element but this can
        compromise performance and increases cost. </p>
      <p>[0003] More recently, proposals have been made for the use of
        strain-rate sensitive shear thickening silicone putty materials,
        sometimes known as silicone dilatants, in or as energy absorbing
        materials in impact absorption systems. By a strain-rate
        sensitive shear thickening material or dilatant, we mean a
        material which viscously flows at low rates of strain
        deformation but, at an elevated strain rate of deformation
        undergoes a substantial increase in viscosity with rate of
        change of deformation. At significantly higher deformation
        rates, such as those induced by a sudden impact, the material
        becomes substantially stiff or rigid. For example, U.S. Pat. No.
        5,599,290 describes a bone fracture prevention garment which
        employs, as the dilatant or shear-thickening material, a
        dispersion of solid particles in a viscous fluid. GB-A-2349798
        describes an energy absorbing pad including a putty-like
        dilatant. However, in both cases, the dilatant has to be
        contained in an envelope because of its non self-supporting
        nature. The products therefore tend to have limited flexibility,
        are prone to damage by puncture, and require relatively complex
        and expensive manufacturing processes. These products also tend
        to be heavy due to the relatively high density of the dilatant,
        which can be above 1000 kg/m.sup.3, and suffer from migration of
        the dilatant within the envelope as the dilatant will exhibit
        viscous flow at even very low levels of loading. </p>
      <p>[0004] Other approaches for the utilisation of silicone
        dilatants have been to combine this material with a resilient
        carrier such as polyurethane foam. </p>
      <p>[0005] In our copending International patent publication WO
        03/055339 we have described and claimed a self supporting energy
        absorbing composite comprising: [0006] i) a solid foamed
        synthetic polymer matrix; [0007] ii) a polymer-based dilatant,
        different from i), distributed through the matrix and
        incorporated therein during manufacture of i); and [0008] iii) a
        fluid distributed through the matrix, the combination of matrix
        dilatant and fluid being such that the composite is resiliently
        compressible; and a self supporting energy absorbing composite
        comprising: [0009] i) a solid, closed cell foam matrix; [0010]
        ii) a polymer-based dilatant, different from i), distributed
        through the matrix; and [0011] iii) a fluid distributed through
        the matrix, the combination of matrix dilatant and fluid being
        such that the composite is resiliently compressible. </p>
      <p>[0012] The present invention provides an energy absorbing
        material suitable for use in or as an impact absorption
        material; and which is self-supporting and wherein the density
        can be tuned to specification applications; for example, from
        about 1150 kg/m.sup.3 in the as blended condition and any
        intermediate density down to 100 kg/m.sup.3 in the foamed form.
      </p>
      <p>[0013] According to the present invention, there is provided a
        composite material which is elastic, which exhibits a resistive
        load under deformation which increases with the rate of
        deformation, which is comminuted or uncomminuted and which
        comprises i) a first polymer-based elastic material and ii) a
        second polymer-based material, different from i), which exhibits
        dilatancy in the absence of i) wherein ii) is entrapped in a
        solid matrix of i), the composite material being unfoamed or,
        when foamed, preparable by incorporating ii) with i) prior to
        foaming. </p>
      <p>[0014] It is preferred that the composite material is resistant
        to permanent set under all types of loading; e.g. compression,
        tension or shear or any combination thereof. By a solid matrix
        is meant herein a matrix material which retains its own
        boundaries without need of a container. </p>
      <p>[0015] The composite material of this invention may be unfoamed
        as such or as a precursor to a composite material which is
        subsequently to be foamed (that is, foamed after ii) has become
        entrapped in a solid matrix of i)). </p>
      <p>[0016] Preferably, the first material i) and second material
        ii) are in intimate admixture; for example, as attainable by
        blending i) and ii) together. By blending is meant herein the
        mixing together of polymer based constituents i) and dilatant
        ii) in the semi-molten or molten state to form a composite
        material wherein the first material i) and the second material
        ii) are in intimate admixture. </p>
      <p>[0017] In addition to being self-supporting, the composite
        material of the invention offers a degree of impact protection
        which can exceed that of current rigid systems and moreover, in
        the preferred embodiment wherein it is both flexible and
        resilient under all types of loading, it has the ability to
        conform to the geometry of what it is designed to protect by
        maintaining intimate contact through relatively large changes in
        geometry. This is important for the design of protective
        components because induced damage is a function of the maximum
        force resulting from the impact divided by the area over which
        this force is distributed. The composite material of the
        invention enables both a reduction in the force and an increase
        in the area on which the force acts or is reacted, thereby
        significantly reducing the resulting pressure or stress
        transmitted for a given impact event. It also offers the ability
        to exhibit some conformity to the impactor and thus produce
        additional force absorption as well as favourable geometry in
        terms of abrasion resistance. By means of the invention, it is
        also possible to achieve improved performance compared to the
        use of an equivalent mass of dilatant when used on its own. </p>
      <p>[0018] The first material i) may be one wherein the polymer
        comprising the first material i) comprises EVA or an olefin
        polymer, for example polypropylene or an ethylene polymer such
        as high pressure polyethylene (LDPE), LLDPE or HDPE. </p>
      <p>[0019] Preferably, the polymer comprising the first material i)
        comprises an elastomer. While natural elastomers, e.g. latex
        rubbers, may also be used, our preference is for synthetic
        elastomers (such as neoprene), more preferably synthetic
        thermoplastic elastomers such as thermoplastic polyesters.
        Preferred classes of such elastomers include elastomeric
        polyurethanes and elastomeric EVAs (ethylene/vinyl acetate
        copolymers); others such as silicone rubbers and EP rubbers,
        e.g. EPDM rubbers may also be suitable. </p>
      <p>[0020] Other solid plastics materials may also be suitable for
        use as the polymer constituent of the first material i) provided
        that they too exhibit an appropriate level of resilience. Any
        polymer-based material, different from i), which exhibits
        dilatancy and can be incorporated into the chosen elastic
        constituents) of first material i) may be used as second
        material ii). By a polymer-based material which exhibits
        dilatancy is meant a material in which the dilatancy is provided
        by one or more polymers alone or by a combination of one or more
        polymers together with one or more other components, e.g. finely
        divided particulate material, viscous fluid, plasticiser,
        extender or mixtures thereof, and wherein the polymer is the
        principal component. In one preferred embodiment, the polymer
        comprising the second material ii) is selected from silicone
        polymers exhibiting dilatant properties. The silicone-based
        polymer is preferably selected from borated siloxane polymers.
        For example, the dilatant may be selected from filled or
        unfilled polyborodimethylsiloxanes (PBDMSs) or any number of
        polymers where PBDMS is a constituent. The dilatancy may be
        enhanced by the inclusion of other components such as
        particulate fillers. </p>
      <p>[0021] The dilatant may be combined with other components in
        addition to the components providing the dilatancy, e.g.
        fillers, plasticisers, colorants, lubricants and thinners. The
        fillers may be particulate (including microspheres or
        microballoons) or fibrous or a mixture of particulate and
        fibrous. One class of particularly preferred dilatants based on
        PBDMS comprises the borated silicone-based materials that are
        marketed under the generic name of silicone bouncing putties and
        are produced by various manufacturers. These include those by
        Dow Corning under product catalogue no. 3179; by Wacker GmbH
        under product numbers M48 and M29 and by The Polish Chemical
        Institute under the product name Polastosil AMB-12. Other
        companies such as Rhodia, GE Plastics, ICI have also produced
        these materials, and other polymer-based dilatant materials
        having similar dilatancy characteristics, e.g. a similar modulus
        at low rates of strain and a similar plot of modulus with
        respect to the applied strain rate. </p>
      <p>[0022] It is believed to be the presence of the borated
        cross-link within the composite material which enables it to
        exhibit a resistive load under deformation which increases with
        the rate of deformation. This type of cross-link is considered
        temporary because it is believed to form reversibly and only or
        mainly during high rates of deformation of the polymer. In the
        PBDMS polymer this effect inhibits the siloxane chains from
        sliding during high rates of strain thus instantaneously
        inhibiting viscous flow. In this condition the polymer will
        therefore behave more like an elastomer. The composite material
        of the invention also possesses the borated cross-links which
        enable it to exhibit the aforementioned behaviour. Other
        polymers that exhibit a temporary cross-link in the manner of
        PBDMS may also be used. </p>
      <p>[0023] The composite material of this invention is preferably
        comminuted for ease of handling; for example, in transportation
        or for moulding purposes. </p>
      <p>[0024] In accordance with another aspect of this invention,
        there is provided a process for the preparation of a composite
        material according to the hereindescribed invention which
        process comprises: [0025] a) melting the polymer intended to
        comprise the first material i); and [0026] b) blending the
        polymeric dilatant intended to comprise the second material ii)
        therewith. </p>
      <p>[0027] The polymer intended to comprise the first material i)
        is as hereinabove defined and/or the polymeric dilatant intended
        to comprise the second material ii) is as hereinabove defined. </p>
      <p>[0028] Preferably, the polymeric dilatant is melted prior to
        and/or during the blending step (b). Suitably, after blending
        and cooling, the composite material so formed is c) comminuted.
      </p>
      <p>[0029] One preferred method of forming the blend is first to
        form microspheres of second material ii) coated, for example
        with a polymer such as an elastomer, to prevent coalescence.
        These coated microspheres are then introduced into the first
        material i) which is either comminuted or in the melt. </p>
      <p>[0030] This invention further provides a composite material
        prepared by a hereindescribed process of this invention. </p>
      <p>[0031] In accordance with an important aspect of this
        invention, there is provided a composite material prepared by a
        hereindescribed process of this invention which has subsequently
        been foamed; suitably, the so-produced foam is a closed cell
        foam. Suitably, at least part of the polymeric dilatant ii) is
        included within cell walls of the foam. </p>
      <p>[0032] It is preferred that the cells include, as pneumatogen,
        a gas, vapour, supercritical liquid, or a precursor thereof; for
        example, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Usually, the gas or vapour
        will be substantially uniformly dispersed throughout the matrix
        but non-uniform dispersion may be desirable in certain cases.
        The contribution of the gas or vapour to the resilient
        compressibility may be due to redistribution of gas or vapour
        within the matrix or compression of the gas or vapour (or,
        indeed, both of these effects). The presence of the gas or
        vapour within the composite material not only significantly
        reduces the overall density of the composite but can also
        provide an amount of damping within the system due to pumping
        losses associated with a pneumatic effect. The compressive
        resilience will also be enhanced by a pneumatic effect which
        will increase with the ratio of closed to open cells in the
        foam. An amount of pneumatic damping is desirable when
        considering energy absorption during impact and will further
        enhance the reactive nature of the composite. </p>
      <p>[0033] An important property of the foam is the rate at which
        it recovers after being subjected to deformation, especially
        compression. Preferably, recovery is complete or substantially
        complete within a few seconds, e.g. 5 seconds or less, more
        preferably 2 seconds or less. In certain applications however a
        slower rate of recovery may be desirable. </p>
      <p>[0034] The foamed composite material of the invention may be
        prepared by combining the polymer intended to comprise the first
        material i); the polymeric dilatant intended to comprise the
        second material ii); and the gas, vapour, supercritical liquid,
        or precursor thereof, such that the dilatant and the gas or
        vapour are distributed, generally substantially uniformly,
        throughout the matrix to produce a resiliently compressible
        material which exhibits a resistive load under deformation which
        increases with the rate of deformation. Whatever process is
        used, however, while the dilatant may be incorporated into the
        structure of the foam it is important that it does not
        completely displace the gas or vapour from the pores. </p>
      <p>[0035] One such process comprises incorporating an unfoamed
        composite material, or a mixture of i) and ii), according to the
        hereindescribed invention in the barrel of an injection moulding
        machine including means for supplying a pneumatogen thereinto;
        bringing the material so defined to an elevated temperature and
        an elevated pressure such that it is in molten form; supplying a
        pneumatogen to the barrel; and reducing the pressure of the
        heated composite material thereby causing foaming of the
        composite material. </p>
      <p>[0036] The pressure may be reduced in this process by injecting
        the composite material into a mould or extruding the composite
        material, suitably at ambient pressure. Such a process may be
        operated on a continuous basis. </p>
      <p>[0037] Preferably the weight ratio of ii) to i) is from 4 to
        0.25, most preferably from 2.3 to 1. Preferably the elevated
        temperature is from 150.degree. C. to 240.degree. C., most
        preferably from 170.degree. C. to 210.degree. C. Preferably the
        elevated pressure at which the pneumatogen is injected is from
        1600 psi to 2000 psi, most preferably from 1700 psi to 1900 psi.
      </p>
      <p>[0038] Another such process comprises incorporating an unfoamed
        composite material, or a mixture of i) and ii), according to the
        hereindescribed invention into a hermetic container including
        means for supplying a pneumatogen thereinto; bringing the
        composite material to an elevated temperature at an elevated
        pressure; and injecting pneumatogen into the hermetic container.
        Suitably, the interior of the container is formed as a mould. </p>
      <p>[0039] Preferably the weight ratio of ii) to i) is from 4 to
        0.25, most preferably from 2.3 to 1. Preferably the elevated
        temperature is from 150.degree. C. to 240.degree. C., most
        preferably from 170.degree. C. to 200.degree. C. Preferably the
        elevated pressure is from 8000 psi to 12000 psi, most preferably
        from 9000 psi to 11000 psi. </p>
      <p>[0040] In such a process, the polymer-intended to comprise the
        first material i) and the polymer-based dilatant intended to
        comprise the second material ii) are combined to form an
        intimate admixture, and the resultant mix is then foamed to form
        the composite. The methods employed can be selected from a
        number of recognized industrial processes such as the various
        chemical or physical blowing methods. An additional preparatory
        process using a very high pressure nitrogen environment is also
        possible. This process uses a solid extruded section of the
        blend which is cross-linked (chemically or by irradiation) then
        subjected to a temperature and pressure cycle in an autoclave
        which is charged with nitrogen. The temperature will soften the
        material to aid solubility of the gas, which is at very high
        pressure (10,000 psi). This process may take several hours
        depending on the material and the thickness used. After this
        first autoclave process the resulting material has tiny bubbles
        of trapped nitrogen at very high pressure. A secondary lower
        pressure/temperature cycle then allows the trapped nitrogen to
        expand the surrounding material to form a foam. The exact
        pressure and temperature cycle of this second process will
        determine the final density of the foam produced. This process
        is used by Zotefoams, Croydon, UK. </p>
      <p>[0041] Another such process comprises incorporating with an
        unfoamed composite material, or with one or both components of a
        mixture of i) and ii), as hereinbefore defined microspheres
        comprising a plastic shell which hermetically encapsulates a gas
        or vapour; bringing the material so defined to an elevated
        temperature and pressure; and reducing the pressure of the
        heated composite material thereby causing the expansion of the
        microspheres and foaming of the composite material. The pressure
        may be reduced in this process by injecting the composite
        material into a mould or extruding the composite material,
        suitably at ambient pressure. Such a process may be operated on
        a continuous basis. </p>
      <p>[0042] In such a process according to the invention the foamed
        composite material of the invention may be prepared using, as
        pneumatogen, microspheres comprising a polymeric shell which
        hermetically encapsulates a gas (EXPANCEL by Akzo Nobel, for
        example). The microspheres may be mixed with the first material
        i) or coated with the second material ii) (or, indeed, both)
        before blending i) and ii). On heating the produced blend, the
        gas in the microspheres expands (the expansion may be ca
        40.times.) to create closed cells. </p>
      <p>[0043] Preferably the weight ratio of ii) to i) is from 4 to
        0.25, most preferably from 2.3 to 1. Preferably the elevated
        temperature is from 160.degree. C. to 230.degree. C., most
        preferably from 190.degree. C. to 210.degree. C. Preferably the
        elevated pressure is from 5000 psi to 8000 psi, most preferably
        from 6000 psi to 7000 psi, the autogenous pressure generated in
        an injection moulding machine or extruder. </p>
      <p>[0044] The composite material of the invention may include
        components other than the polymer intended to comprise the first
        material i), the polymer-based dilatant intended to comprise the
        second material ii) and the gas or vapour; e.g., fibrous and/or
        particulate fillers, plasticisers, lubricants, extenders,
        pigments and dyes. If desired, the composite of the invention
        may be incorporated within an envelope which may be rigid or
        flexible, but it is valuable feature of the invention that such
        containment is not essential. </p>
      <p>[0045] Likewise, it may be associated with a rigid or semi
        rigid component but this is not essential for the use of the
        composite and may even compromise some of its properties for
        certain applications. </p>
      <p>[0046] Furthermore, it may also be associated with a textile
        layer or similar where the textile has the facility to enhance
        the abrasion performance and in some cases the resistance to
        intrusion from sharp objects and/or assist in the attachment of
        the composite material to other systems or products. A
        stretchable textile backing will also serve to limit the
        elongation of the material and thereby provide durability. The
        textile may also serve as an antiballistic or stab-proof fabric
        such as certain woven grades of KEVLAR. </p>
      <p>[0047] In accordance with a further aspect of this invention,
        the final properties of the composite material as
        hereindescribed, such as resilience, strain rate sensitivity,
        tensile strength, hardness, elastic modulus, and creep modulus,
        may be carefully controlled by the use of compatibilisers or
        crosslinking (or indeed both). Crosslinking may be chemical
        crosslinking or physical crosslinking (such as by irradiating or
        by entanglement polymerisation) and may be undertaken on first
        material i) or the second material ii) (or, indeed, both). The
        first material i) may be crosslinked to the second material ii).
      </p>
      <p>[0048] In general, the composite material of the invention will
        exhibit resistance to creep and compression set. A low creep
        modulus of the composite modulus will be beneficial, but not
        essential, to imparting resistance to compression set. In some
        applications it may be preferred to allow the material to have
        high creep characteristics; for example, for sound insulation
        purposes. </p>
      <p>[0049] The actual constitution of the composite material of the
        invention will be influenced by the intended application.
        Applications cover a wide range of uses and include impact
        protection for objects, animals and humans. Potential
        applications extend to any dynamic situation where the object
        may already be in contact with a surface and the combination of
        object and surface may undergo severe acceleration and/or
        deceleration, e.g. as in packaging for delicate equipment or a
        human body in a vehicle seat. Thus, the nature of the composite
        material and the choice and blending ratio of the dilatant in
        the composite material and, where foamed, the amount of gas or
        vapour in the composite material, e.g. as indicated by the
        required density of the composite material, will be determined
        by the requirements of the protective system in which the
        composite material is to be employed. In general, the dilatant
        will form from 5 to 80%, preferably 10 to 50%, more preferably
        15 to 40% by volume of the composite, and where foamed, the
        amount of gas or vapour (in the preferred case where it is a
        gas) will be such that the gas or vapour content of the
        composite is preferably from 20 to 90%, more preferably from 30
        to 80%, still more preferably from 40 to 70% by volume. It
        should be noted that these proportions are excluding the use of
        any fillers or other additional components. </p>
      <p>[0050] Still further according to the invention there are
        provided shaped articles, e.g. extruded articles such as films,
        sheets, filaments and fibres, comprising the composite materials
        of the invention. Shaped articles such as textured sheets of the
        composite may have the texture geometrically configured such
        that compressive deformation will advantageously deform the
        elements comprising the texture to optimise the reactive nature
        of the composite. This is particularly beneficial in closed cell
        foam. The shaped article may, if desired, be produced in such a
        way as to include regions or layers in which the ratio of
        dilatant within the composite material differs from that in
        other regions or layers. In this way the distortion of the
        shaped article, e.g. fibre or filament, may be configured to
        facilitate maximum shear deformation shearing of the dilatant
        rich regions at the dilatant/matrix interface. </p>
      <p>[0051] The fibres or filaments may be woven, knitted or
        otherwise configured such as to incorporate air into the final
        product. When such a material is subjected to impact, the
        distortion of each fibre is facilitated by the air spaces to
        provide a large number of localised bending deflections, which
        is preferable for the efficient use of the composite material in
        absorbing impact. </p>
      <p>[0052] The choice and concentration of the first material i) is
        preferably such as to allow the shaping of the composite
        material e.g. into fibres or filaments. In low strain rate
        movements, the flexibility of a textile comprising fibres or
        filaments formed from the admixture composite blend may be
        provided by choice of fibre weave or knit. Other fibres or
        filaments may be included in the textile, if desired, e.g.,
        elastic fibres and/or abrasion-resistant fibres. </p>
      <p>[0053] The fibre which may be formed, for example, by extrusion
        or spinning may have an even distribution of second material ii)
        within first material i) or may be manufactured to create
        regions or layers where the second material ii) is more
        concentrated. </p>
      <p>[0054] In accordance with a still further aspect of this
        invention, there is provided a fibre which comprises a core of
        second material ii) within a sheath of first material i),
        wherein the first material i) and second material ii) are as
        hereindefined. The core may be hollow, preferably coaxially
        hollow. Such fibres may be made by coextrusion. Such a fibre is
        depicted in FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawings in which 1 is a
        core of second material ii), 2 is a sheath of first material i)
        and 3 is a hollow containing a gas (air). </p>
      <p>[0055] The energy absorbing composite material of the invention
        may be employed in a wide variety of applications; for example
        in protective pads or clothing for humans and animals, in or as
        energy absorbing zones in vehicles and other objects with which
        humans or animals may come into violent contact, and in or as
        packaging for delicate objects or machinery. Specific examples
        of applications are in headwear and helmets; protective clothing
        or padding for elbows, knees, hips and shins; general body
        protection, for example for use in environments where flying or
        falling objects are a hazard; vehicle dashboards, upholstery and
        seating. Other potential uses are in garments or padding to
        protect parts of the body used to strike an object e.g. in a
        sport or pastime; for example in footwear, such as running shoe
        soles, football boots, boxing gloves and gloves used in the
        playing of fives. The energy absorbing composite material of the
        invention may also be employed in non-impact situations; for
        example, in energy absorbing and damping materials such as
        automotive mounts, vibration isolation and sound insulation.
        This list is not intended to be exclusive and other potential
        uses will occur to the reader. </p>
      <p>[0056] Examples are depicted in FIGS. 2 and 4 inclusive of the
        accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p>[0057] FIG. 5 of the accompanying drawings illustrates an
        example of use in footwear. </p>

        more detail in Example 2; </p>

        in Example 4; and </p>
      <p>[0061] FIG. 13 depicts the results of Example 4. </p>
      <p>[0062] In order to provide favourable pressure characteristics
        and a greater level of support under shock loads transmitted
        through the sole of the foot during any type of active
        recreation, the composite material is utilised in the
        construction in the soles of footwear, e.g. innersoles, midsoles
        or outer soles. The example illustrates the use of the material
        between the ,innersole (1) and the outersole (2), where the
        interfaces between both the innersole and midsole (3) and the
        outersole and midsole are favourably contoured or textured to
        induce large amounts of shear deformation in the foamed
        composite material of the invention. This type of construction
        may be formed by incorporating the foamed composite material
        into the cavity between the inner and outer sole such that the
        resulting midsole solidifies and bonds to both the inner and
        outer sole. A similar structure is achieved as a one-part
        moulding whereby the material foams within a mould, the inner
        and outer soles being formed by the "skin" produced at the mould
        surfaces. </p>
      <p>[0063] A coating may be applied to the composite if desired. </p>
      <p>[0064] The following Examples illustrate the invention. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0065] The elastic polymeric constituent material selected for
        a precursor blend process evaluation was a linear low density
        polyethylene (Flexirene MR5O by Europa Polymeri). Three dilatant
        materials were selected for blending trials in different ratios.
        The three dilatant materials were the Dow Corning silicone
        dilatant 3179, Polastosil AMB-12 and pure PBDMS. These were
        blended with the LLDPE MR50 using a Shaws K1 3 litre intermix.
        The LLDPE was introduced into the mill in granular form first
        where the temperature generated through shearing the material
        rose to around 110.degree. C. The dilatant materials were then
        fluxed into the internal mixer in the ratios as specified below:
      </p>
      <p>1. 35% 3179 65% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>2. 50% 3179 50% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>3. 50% Polastosil ABM-12 50% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>4. 35% Polastosil ABM-12 65% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>5. 30% PBDMS 70% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>6. 35% PBDMS 65% LLDPE by weight. </p>
      <p>The above material blends were then dump extruded through
        4.times.2 mm diameter dies to form strands which were then
        pelletised. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0066] Having demonstrated the method of blending the dilatant
        and a thermoplastic polymer using standard industrial equipment
        in Example 1, Example 2 extends the processing route through the
        realization of a closed cell structure. </p>
      <p>[0067] One process found suitable for closed cell foam
        manufacture is a high-pressure gas solution process. This
        process subjects a block of solid polymer material to very high
        pressure in a gas (for example, nitrogen) filled autoclave at a
        controlled temperature to force the gas into the solid polymer.
        This block is then foamed under controlled high pressure and
        temperature, again using a gas filled autoclave. The advantage
        of the process for foam manufacture is the uniformity of the
        cellular structure and the lack of chemical deposition from
        conventional blowing agents. </p>
      <p>[0068] In order to confirm that such a manufacturing process is
        suitable it is necessary to demonstrate that the mixture will be
        stable at the elevated temperatures of the manufacturing
        process. This is necessary in order to consider replacing the
        polymer sheet or block in the experimental process with a
        prepared sample containing both the dilatant and the matrix
        material, as an intimate mix. The normal operating temperature
        of the process is around 165.degree. C. </p>
      <p>[0069] The polymer-based elastic matrix material chosen for an
        initial trial was Hytrel G3548L, which is a polyester based
        thermoplastic elastomer available from Du Pont. 50 grams of
        Hytrel and an equal weight of 3179 dilatant compound (see
        Example 1) were placed in a crucible in preparation of mixing at
        high temperature. A laboratory oven was preheated to 220.degree.
        C. and the crucible and contents placed in the oven and left for
        30 minutes. The crucible was then removed and the contents
        stirred with a metal spatula to mix the two materials. The
        resulting mixture was next replaced in the oven and heat soaked
        for a further hour at this temperature, before removing for
        investigation. The two materials mixed very well to produce an
        admixture that was solid at room temperature. The admixture was
        heated to 165.degree. C. in a laboratory oven and was found to
        be stable over a period of 8 hours, which is the duration of the
        high-pressure nitrogen gas solution process. The results
        indicate the potential suitability of the sample for foaming
        using a high-pressure gas (such as nitrogen) process or indeed
        other physical or chemical blowing processes. </p>
      <p>[0070] Having established the ability of the two materials to
        form an intimate admixture, the process was scaled to produce 30
        kg batches on industrial equipment using the method as described
        in Example 1. </p>
      <p>[0071] Hytrel grade G3548L was blended with Dow Corning Silicon
        dilatant 3179 to produce a precursor material. The two blend
        ratios chosen were 35/65 dilatant to Hytrel by weight and 50/50
        by weight, the blending process yielded around 30 kg of each
        blend ratio. </p>
      <p>[0072] As subsequent processing of these blends to produce
        closed cell foams via physical or chemical blowing techniques
        requires the material to be returned to the molten state a study
        of the effect of this on the structure of the material was
        undertaken. </p>
      <p>[0073] The blend materials (now in pellet form) were put onto
        non-stick vessels and subjected to a temperature of about
        200.degree. C. The pellets were left for one hour, after which
        time the material was molten; stirred; then left for an
        additional hour before removal from the oven. On cooling the
        mixes solidified. </p>
      <p>[0074] The solid shapes were then examined under a scanning
        electron microscope (SEM). To expose the structure of the
        material two techniques were employed--cutting with a razor
        blade and fracturing the samples by immersing them in liquid
        nitrogen and fracturing them at a notch (cut by a razor blade).
      </p>
      <p>[0075] The photomicrographs in FIGS. 6, 7, 8 and 9 represent,
        respectfully, the structure of a 50/50 blend at 25.times.
        magnification; the structure of a 50/50 blend at 83.times.
        magnification; the structure of a 35/65 blend at 33.times.
        magnification; and the structure of a 35/65 blend at 1200.times.
        magnification. FIGS. 6 and 8 were obtained from cut surfaces
        while FIGS. 7 and 9 were obtained from fractured surfaces. </p>
      <p>[0076] In addition to the photomicrographs an electron probe
        analysis was undertaken to establish the chemical make-up of the
        phases observed. </p>
      <p>[0077] The light areas shown in the photomicrographs are those
        of higher density material (the specific gravities of Hytrel
        G3548L and DC3179 are 1.15 and 1.14. However, the electron probe
        analysis shows a higher silicon content in the lighter regions
        and these are, therefore, assumed to be more chemically similar
        to the DC3179 dilatant than the Hytrel. Some silicon was also
        detected in the darker regions (assumed to be mainly made up of
        the Hytrel) and, under further investigation, these included a
        very fine dispersion of silicon based particles. These particles
        were originally a constituent of the dilatant in the form of
        crystalline silica (quartz) and so the original blend must have
        been a very intimate mixture of the dilatant and the Hytrel
        polyether ester copolymer. </p>
      <p>[0078] The phase separation is almost certainly due to the
        subsequent melting of the blend the higher the dilatant content
        the more separation is occurring i.e. the regions of higher
        density (dilatant) material in the 50/50 blend are much larger
        and vary in size and shape compared to that of the 35/65 blend.
        Both the cut and fractured sections (FIGS. 1 and 2) indicate
        poor adhesion between the two phases due to the presence of
        fissures at the interfaces between the phases. </p>
      <p>[0079] The phases present in the 35/65 blend are considerably
        finer (see FIG. 8). The second non-continuous phase is in the
        form of spherical particles which are typically 3 to 10 .mu.m in
        diameter (FIG. 9). The fracture has occurred across a plane
        which follows the interface between the two phases which again
        indicates poor adhesion between the phases. </p>
      <p>[0080] From the analysis it can be concluded that the blend
        materials before subsequent heating to the molten state were a
        very intimate dispersion of one phase in the other. This being
        indicated by the presence of crystalline silica in the Hytrel
        phase of the blend. The separation of the phases evident in the
        50/50 blend is due to the subsequent heating process. The amount
        of separation for the 35/65 blend having had the same heat
        treatment is considerably less and therefore phase separation
        appears to be dependent on the ratio of dilatant to Hytrel--the
        higher the dilatant content the greater the separation. </p>
      <p>[0081] If a finer dispersion of dilatant within a second
        material has advantages over a larger two phase structure
        consideration of the blend ratio and processing time in the
        molten state should be given. This is also the case if a
        structure such as that seen in the 50/50 blend offers
        advantages. The inference of this study is that the structure of
        the phases can be controlled by the blend ratios and heat
        treatments. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0082] The two batches of blend materials (the 35/65 and the
        50/50 blend) were further processed to produce a closed cell
        foam using the Expancel process. The particular grade of
        Expancel used was Akzo Nobel Expancel 092MB120 which was
        masterbatched with the same Hytrel grade to give a high
        concentration of Expancel in the masterbatch. The masterbatch
        was then mixed with the two blends to give a final percentage by
        weight of 8% of Expancel to the blend. </p>
      <p>[0083] The blends, as well as pure Hytrel with the same content
        of Expancel were then sheet extruded. This was done by using a
        heated screw feeder fed by a hopper containing the material in
        pellet form. As the pellets of material are screw fed down the
        barrel of the machine the heaters raise the temperature of the
        pellets to around 200.degree. C. which takes the material into
        the molten state. This temperature also activates the Expancel
        but the pressure in the barrel stops the material from forming
        cells at this stage. The molten material was then injected
        through an orifice around 4 mm wide by 180 mm long onto
        non-stick polished steel rollers. As the molten material flowed
        onto the rotating rollers to drop in pressure to atmospheric
        enabled the material to foam under the action of the Expancel
        system. The material was fed through another two rollers to
        produce a solid foamed material around 6 mm thick with a density
        of around 380 kg/m.sup.3. The final density and thickness are
        influenced by the relationship between the speed of the screw
        feeder and the rotational speed of the rollers. All three
        materials--the pure Hytrel, the 35/65 blend and the 50/50 blend
        felt relatively stiff. </p>
      <p>[0084] As the dilatant material is soft and flowable it was
        expected that the presence of this in the blends should have
        imparted some softness to the final foamed blend when compared
        to the foamed Hytrel material. </p>
      <p>[0085] It was unexpectedly noticed, however, that during
        subsequent repeated compression of the material that all of the
        foamed materials became softer. By undertaking a controlled
        amount of repeated compression on all materials the foams were
        "worked" into their softest state. This was done by passing the
        material through contra rotating steel rollers spaced at around
        3 mm. This was done slowly, the rollers being turned by hand,
        and repeated 20 times for each material. Softness measurements
        were made before and after this process using a hand held ASTM
        D2240 durometer to give a "Shore A" reading for the materials.
        These are shown in Table 1. TABLE-US-00001 TABLE 1 HYTREL FOAM
        35/65 BLEND FOAM 50/50 BLEND FOAM As extruded Softened As
        extruded Softened As extruded Softened Shore a 52 33 52 27 52 25
        hardness </p>
      <p>[0086] An explanation as to why the materials became softer
        after repeated compression is given by observing the structures
        before and after this softening process with the aid of SEM. It
        could be seen that it was the Expancel which was reinforcing the
        blend material. The Expancel manifests as discrete, relatively
        rigid, microballoons (FIG. 10: the internal structure was
        exposed by tearing the sample). The Expancel microballoons can
        be clearly seen intact. FIG. 11 shows the structure subsequent
        to softening process. The Expancel microballoons have collapsed
        to provide no cell reinforcement and so allowing the matrix
        material to define the softness of the foam. This change in
        structure was observed for all three materials. </p>
      <p>[0087] This charge in softness according to the amount of
        repeated compression of the material may provide benefits for in
        service use of such a material e.g. for insoles where the high
        pressure areas under feet will yield to allow the insole to
        "mould" to the shape of the underside of the foot. The same
        principle can be applied to ski boot liners. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>[0088] In order to assess the effect the dilatant material has
        on the impact properties of the Hytrel impact tests were
        performed. </p>
      <p>[0089] These tests were performed on a specially designed
        pendulum impact rig which is illustrated in FIG. 12, and
        essential features of which are listed in Table 2 below.
        Briefly, the apparatus comprises a gallows-shaped rigid support
        2 on the end of the horizontal arm 4 of which is freely
        pivotally mounted a swing arm 6 which is pivoted to swing in a
        vertical plane. On the free end of the swing arm is mounted an
        impact head 8 to which weights 10 may be attached. Located on
        the vertical arm of the rigid support at a position such that a
        sample (not shown) mounted on it will be struck by the impact
        head, is a hemispherical steel anvil 12. TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 2

      <p>[0090] Impact rigs are most commonly either of a drop weight
        design or of a swing pendulum design. In this case the swing
        pendulum design was chosen as it offers certain advantages for
        the purpose of development testing. The applied impact load for
        a pendulum rig is not followed by a residual creep load, as is
        the case for a drop weight design, where the impact head remains
        in contact with the tested sample after the impact event. This
        is particularly relevant in respect of impact testing where the
        use of pressure measuring devices are employed such as pressure
        sensitive film. These record peak pressure during the impact and
        any secondary strike or residual load may corrupt these
        readings. </p>
      <p>[0091] In any impact test the applied impact energy is equal to
        the net kinetic energy of the impact head immediately prior to
        impact, and in the case of a pendulum rig this is a function of
        the impact head speed and the rotational mass of the system. The
        impact rig was thus designed such that it was capable of
        applying a range of impact speeds, by adjusting the inclined
        angle of the pendulum prior to release and a range of rotational
        mass, through the addition and subtraction of weights near the
        impact head. The geometry of the impact head and anvil were
        chosen to replicate the EN 1621-1 1997 standard test for
        motorcycle body protection. </p>
      <p>[0092] The test procedure was to apply the material samples to
        the anvil in the orientation and position best representing the
        material's use on the body as body protection, and to fix this
        to the anvil with the use of adhesive tape. The impact swing arm
        was then retracted to a prescribed angle before release. During
        the impact event the force transmitted was measured dynamically
        with a calibrated piezo-electric load cell and the peak force
        recorded. This load cell is located behind the hemi-spherical
        dome of the anvil. Preload of the piezoelectric load cell was
        used according to best practice and reset to read zero. </p>
      <p>[0093] Additionally the pressure transmitted to the anvil
        during the impact was also recorded on Fuji pressure film
        attached directly to the anvil and affixed with masking tape at
        its edge. In order to simultaneously measure the pressure
        transmitted at the different pressure ranges, medium (1400-7000
        psi), low (350-1400 psi) and super low (70-350 psi) films were
        placed on top of one another in a stack and affixed to the rig
        simultaneously. All samples of film were pre cut to size and
        measured 5 cm wide and 5.5 cm high. They were placed on the
        anvil in a portrait orientation, with the masking tape applied
        at the top and bottom only. Fuji pressure film serves as a
        simple but effective way of indicating the peak pressure during
        the impact over the contact area under investigation. </p>
      <p>[0094] The standard EN 1621-1 test is not representative of
        real impact events to the human body as the anvil is part of an
        extremely rigid system and does not offer any compliance in the
        manner of the body. The criterion for passing the EN1621-1 test
        for motorcycle protection is that the peak load transmitted is
        less than 35 kN for the impact speed of 4.3 m/s and an impact
        energy of 50 J. However, a peak-transmitted force of 35 kN if
        actually applied to the body would cause severe injury. </p>
      <p>[0095] It is for these reasons that in addition to the
        specified speed and energy level an impact speed of 3.9 m/s and
        energy value of 20 J was also used. With the additional use of
        Fuji pressure film, it is also relevant to define more fully the
        performance of a material for which one of the proposed uses is
        body protection systems used for a variety of sports e.g. snow
        sports, skateboarding and downhill mountain biking. </p>
      <p>[0096] To obtain the two energy levels additional mass was used
        for the higher 50 J impact. This was added behind the striker so
        in order to calculate the angle from which to release the arm
        the new centre of mass was determined by measurement. This is
        shown in Table 3. TABLE-US-00003 TABLE 3 Angle of Energy of
        pendulum [deg] Impact Swing Arm Centre of Mass Impact (J) from
        horizontal speed m/s mass (kg) Radius (m) 20 22 3.9 4.055 0.805
        50 14.5 4.3 6.90 0.986 </p>
      <p>[0097] All three materials were tested as described above using
        two layers of the extruded sheet material the force results in
        both the as extruded and softened condition for the two impact
        energy levels are shown below in Table 4. TABLE-US-00004 TABLE 4

      <p>[0098] The performance of the materials with respect to
        pressure for the 50 J impact are shown in FIG. 13. </p>
      <p>[0099] From the results it has been shown that the blending of
        a dilatant material has a beneficial effect on the impact
        performance of the Hytrel polyester copolymer. The foamed blends
        were measurably softer than the pure foamed Hytrel material yet
        outperformed the Hytrel in terms of force and pressure
        transmission during impact. Specifically the pure Hytrel
        transmitted had a reduction of transmitted about 19% more force
        than the 65/35 blend. Although difficult to quantify the
        pressure signatures also show an improvement in performance; the
        very sensitive superlow film shows the two blends to have an
        increased area of contact, but for the less sensitive medium
        film the contact area is smaller. This suggests that a lower
        peak pressure was transmitted for the blends (less of the medium
        film area being saturated) with a corresponding greater area for
        the more sensitive film indicating that the blend material has
        stiffened during impact to transmit the load through a greater
        volume (and therefore area) of the material. It should also be
        bome in mind that the softer blend materials had a thickness of
        around 10% less than the pure Hytrel foam. </p>
      <p>[0100] Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed
        (though not ascertained) that because the second material ii)
        (which exhibits dilatancy in the absence of the first material
        i) is entrapped in the composite material of the invention in a
        solid matrix of i) its ability to flow is inhibited such that at
        high local deformation rate, its tendency to shear thicken is
        efficiently imparted to the unfoamed composite material which
        thereby exhibits a resistive load under deformation which
        increases with the rate of deformation. </p>
      <p>[0101] Furthermore, where the composite material is foamed the
        gas or air within the cell will, by reason of its
        compressibility, allow the composite material to undergo larger
        amounts of local deformation thereby extending the opportunity
        of the composite material to stiffen during impact. In the above
        case where the cells are closed cells it is believed that
        additional pneumatic stretching of the cell walls gives rise to
        greater local elastic deformation. </p>
