        <p><b><font size="+1">Magnipulsion is Answer to Energy Crisis
              --- Bob Teal</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">By Doris Morgan</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A retired enginer who works in a small shop at his home in
        Madison says he has invented a machine which might be the answer
        to the energy crisis. </p>
      <p>B.R.”Bob” Teal said he got the idea for what he calls his
        ‘magnipulsion’ engine when he was writing a still-unpublished
        science fiction novel. </p>
      <p>After retiring from an engineering post in Hawaii with Ling
        Temco Vought in 1972, Teal and his wife Beatrice moved to
        Madison where he decided to try out his idea. </p>
      <p>Entering Teal’s backyard workshop, you see two stainless steel
        contraptions with wires and switches stuck here and there, his
        latest magnipulsion engines. </p>
      <p>After explaining that the thing started with a car battery,
        Teal flips several switches which sends current to the magnets
        placed around the engine. </p>
      <p>The one horsepower engine which sounds like a sewing machine
        while operating is the sixth in a series of electromagnet
        machines which Teal has developed since he began in 1972. </p>
      <p>While the pistons pump up and down, much like a car engine
        through their magnetic cylinders, the pulleys spin around. Speed
        is reduced or increased by the flip of a switch that controls
        the power like the dimming of a light bulb. </p>
      <p>“As it is now the machine can power shop tools, water pumps, or
        conveyers”, Teal said. “You can add horsepower by adding
        magnets”. </p>
      <p>“I have built six engines and the latest will operate a 20-ton
        conveyer:, Teal said. He said he bought the car batteries more
        than a year ago and they have never been charged since. </p>
      <p>Teal says his invention could save coal and oil which are now
        required to create electricity. “A small magnipulsion engine
        could operate a home central air conditioner for about 50 cents
        per day”, he said. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Madison Man Builds New Engine</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By Elizabeth Butler</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The writing of a since fiction book eventually led a Madison
        resident to invent an electromagnetic engine which he says emits
        no pollution and takes little current to operate. </p>
      <p>B.R. “Bob” Teal, a retired electronics engineer and author, has
        one patent and two pending on his invention. </p>
      <p>“I wrote a science fiction book several years before retiring
        and I needed the story plausible --- an engine that emitted no
        pollution --- noise or air pollution --- so in my mind at the
        time I named it magnipulsion. </p>
      <p>“Then after retiring in Honolulu in 1972 we came to Madison to
        live and having nothing else to do, I decided to build the
        engine. I built it and it works.” </p>
      <p>Teal, 54, said scientists and engineers have come from all over
        the country and confirmed that it does what they consider to be
        impossible. </p>
      <p>“I have built six engines and the latest will operate a 20-ton
        conveyor”, said Teal, who was born in Morven, NC, about 60 miles
        from Charlotte. “It operates fro a standard car battery and
        draws an extremely small amount of current. I bought the car
        batteries over a year ago and they have never been charged but
        once.” </p>
      <p>Teal constructed his first engine of wood within a few weeks to
        see if it would work. The second engine was a crude one of metal
        and later he went to Jacksonville to get parts made for a
        prototype. </p>
      <p>“I have dreams of building one large enough to run cars and
        boats”, teal said. “Judging from what I have done so far, I
        guess it would cost $400 or $500. There are very few moving
        parts so you would not need highly trained mechanics.” </p>
      <p>Since the United Press International carried a story of his
        invention in May 1976, Teal has received hundreds of letters
        about the invention from around the world and has answered all
        of them. </p>
      <p>“I have been attempting to get the government interested in
        hopes of getting a grant to build a shop and hire qualified
        personnel”, he said. “If I don’t succeed in the very near future
        in getting the grant, my attorney is preparing to go public and
        sell stock”. </p>
      <p>Teal said telegrams from all over the nation and from foreign
        cities have been sent to President Jimmy Carter asking him to
        investigate the potential of the engine. </p>
      <p>The electromagnetic engine is not the first invention for Teal,
        While working as an RCA engineer and filling a contract with the
        Navy in 1964, he was responsible for a classified invention
        which related to radio frequency cables and was valued at $50
        million. “I didn’t get a penny for that”, said Teal, who has a
        letter from the navy Department giving him full credit for the
        invention. </p>
      <p>Teal, who attended Wofford College in Spartanburg SC, and the
        University of Hawaii, retired from the Coast Guard after 20
        years in 1962. He then worked for Ling Temco Vought, RCA, and
        finally went into Civil Service work with te Air Force, retiring
        in 1972. </p>
      <p>During 1975-76 he wrote a column, “Is Justice?” for the Madison
        Carrier and last year he published a book of poems. </p>
      <p>He is married to the former Beatrice Mae Cole of Baltimore MD,
        and they have two married children. </p>

        <b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a magnetically operable engine
        or power plant which, in a general way, functions in the manner
        of an internal combustion engine in that it employs a rotary
        crankshaft having offset cranks which derive their motion from
        power driven reciprocating members. Unlike a conventional
        combustion engine, the reciprocating members, instead of being
        motivated by the explosion of combustible gases in a combustion
        chamber, are caused to reciprocate by magnetic attraction, such
        members being in the form of cores or armatures which are
        associated with electromagnets, there being at least one magnet
        for each crank. Motivating current impulses are successively
        supplied to the various magnets by distributor means embodying
        respective normally open circuit making and breaking devices
        which are successively closed by one or more cams that rotate
        with the camshaft. The basic principle involved in thus applying
        torque to the crankshaft may appropriately be referred to as
        "magnipulsion" (a coined word) and such term may be employed
        where appropriate throughout this specification. </p>
      <p>The present magnetically operable engine or power plant is
        capable of being used as a power source in connection with a
        wheeled automotive vehicle of either the passenger-carrying type
        or as a toy automobile. It is also capable of being used as a
        fixedly mounted power plant for driving adjacent machinery of
        various sorts but, irrespective of the particular use to which
        the invention may be put, the essential features thereof are at
        all times preserved. </p>
      <p>The provision of an engine which is extremely simple in its
        construction and which therefore may be manufactured at a low
        cost; one which is comprised of a minimum number of parts,
        particularly moving parts, and which therefore is unlikely to
        get out of order; one which is rugged and durable and which
        therefore will withstand rough usage; one which is smooth and
        silent in its operation; one which is capable of ease of
        assembly and disassembly for purposes of inspection of parts,
        replacement or repair thereof; and one which otherwise is well
        adapted to perform the services required of it are further
        desirable features which have been borne in mind in the
        production and development of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The provision of an engine or power plant such as has briefly
        been outlined above, and possessing the stated advantages,
        constitutes the principal object of the invention. Numerous
        other objects and advantages of the invention, not at this time
        enumerated, will become readily apparent as the nature of the
        invention is better understood. </p>

        this specification, one illustrative embodiment of the invention
        has been shown . </p>

      <p>Referring now to the drawings in detail, and in particular to
        FIGS. 1 and 2, a power plant or engine constructed according to
        the invention is designated in its entirety by the reference
        numeral 10 and it embodies in its general organization a chassis
        or framework 12 which serves to rotatably support an elongated
        crankshaft 14 on which there is mounted a relatively massive
        flywheel 16 in the medial region thereof. A pair of pulleys 18
        on opposite sides of the flywheel 16 have associated therewith
        respective drive belts 20 which may extend to a suitable
        transmission (not shown) in the case of a wheeled automative
        vehicle, or to the input drive element in the case of a
        stationary equipment which is to be driven by the power plant. </p>
      <p>The framework 12 is comprised of an upper rectangular frame
        having longitudinal frame members 22 and 24 and transverse frame
        members 26 and 28, and a lower rectangular frame having
        longitudinal frame members 30 and 32 and transverse frame
        members 34 and 36. The framework 12 further includes a pair of
        intermediate posts 40 and front and rear vertical intermediate
        posts 42 and 44 respectively. A series of longitudinal struts 46
        and transverse struts 48 extend variously between the posts 38,
        40, 42, and 44 and establish an intermediaterectangular frame a
        slight distance above the lower rectangular frame 30, 32, 34 and
        36. </p>
      <p>A pair of bearing assemblies 50 are supported upon transverse
        support bars 52 and 54 and serve to rotatably support the
        crankshaft 14. Such crankshaft is provided with crank arms 56
        and 58 on opposite sides of the flywheel 16 and with offset
        cranks 60 and 62. The crank 62 is connected by means of
        connecting rods 64 and 66 to respective electromagnets M1 and M2
        which are fixedly mounted on the framework 12, while the crank
        arm 60 is similarly connected by connecting rods 68 and 70 to
        respective electromagnets M3 and M4, all in a manner that will
        be made clear presently. </p>
      <p>The various electromagnets M1, M2, M3 and M4, together with
        their associated connecting rods 64, 66, 68 and 70 are
        substantially identical and therefore a description of one of
        them will suffice for them all. Accordingly, the magnet M1 (see
        also FIG. 5) embodies a magnet casing or shell 72 within which
        there is disposed a magnet winding 74. An armature or core 76 is
        slidably disposed within the casing 72 and is pivotally
        connected as indicated at 78 to the associated connecting rod
        64. The remaining magnets M2, M3 and M4 are similarly connected
        to their associated connecting rods </p>
      <p>The magnet M1 is mounted in a vertical position upon an upper
        shelf member 80 while the magnet M2 is mounted in a slightly
        inclined position upon a lower shelf member 82. As best shown in
        FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, the magnet M2 is seated upon a wedge-shaped
        base plate or block 84 which serves to misalign the axis of the
        magnet M2 from the axis of the magnet M1 by a small angle for a
        purpose that will be made clear presently. The magnet M3 is
        mounted in a horizontal position by means of a support member 86
        while the magnet M4 is similarly mounted in a substantially
        horizontal position by means of a support member 88, the axis of
        the magnet M4 being slightly misaligned with respect to the axis
        of the magnet M3 likewise for a purpose that will be set forth
        subsequently. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2, 3 and 4, one end of the flywheel 16
        carries a cam 90 which is designed for successive engagements
        with a pair of substantially diametrically opposed microswitches
        S1 and S2 which are carried at the ends of a pair of horizontal
        supporting bars 94 and 96 respectively. Similarly, the other end
        of the flywheel 16 carries a cam 92 which is designed for
        successive engagement with a pair of substantially horizontally
        opposed microswitches S3 and S4 which are carried at the ends of
        a pair of horizontal supporting bars 98 and 100 respectively. As
        will become more readily apparent when the operation of the
        herein described magnetically operable engine or power plant is
        set forth in connection with the circuit diagram of FIG. 6, the
        arrangement of the various cams and microswitches is such that
        upon rotation of the crankshaft 14 and flywheel 16, the contacts
        associated with the microswitches S1, S3, S2 and S4 will become
        individually closed, successively and in the order named. </p>
      <p>Considering now the operation of the herein described
        magnetically operable engine or power plant 10, and with
        reference to FIG. 6, it will be assumed that initially the
        position of the crankshaft 14 is such that, as shown in FIG. 3,
        energization of the magnet M1 will swing the crank 62 upwardly
        at such time as the cam 90 engages the microswitch S1. Closure
        of the C1 contacts associated with the switch S1 will establish
        a circuit leading from the negative side of the battery B,
        through the master switch MS, through leads 11, 13, magnet M1,
        leads 15, 17, contacts C1 of the switch S1, and leads 19, 21, 23
        and 25, back to the positive side of the battery B. Energization
        of the magnet M1 will draw the core or armature 76 (FIG. 5) into
        the shell 72 and thus place the connecting rod 64 under tension
        so as to pull the crank 62 upwardly, thereby placing the
        crankshaft under torque for motivating purposes. </p>
      <p>At approximately 90.degree. in the engine cycle, the cam 90
        will engage the switch S3 and closure of the contacts C3 thereof
        will establish a circuit from the master switch MS through lead
        27, magnet M3, leads 29, 31, C3 contacts of the switch S3, and
        leads 33, 35 back to the battery B, thus applying torque to the
        crankshaft 14 by placing the connecting rod 68 under tension. </p>
      <p>At approximately 180.degree. in the engine cycle, the cam 90
        will engage the switch S2 and closure of the C2 contacts thereof
        will establish a circuit from the master switch MS through leads
        11, 37, magnet M2, leads 39, 41, contacts C2 of the switch S2,
        and leads 43, 23, 25 back to the battery B, thus applying torque
        to the crankshaft 14 by placing the connecting rod 66 under
        tension. </p>
      <p>At approximately 270.degree. in the engine cycle, the cam 92
        will engage the switch S4 and closure of the contacts C4 thereof
        will establish a circuit from the master switch MS, through lead
        47, magnet M4, lead 49, C4 contacts of the switch S4, and leads
        51, 43, 23, 25 back to the battery B, thus placing the
        connecting rod 70 under tension and applying torque to the
        crankshaft 14. The cycle is repetitious. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, a control panel 102 is associated
        with a container or box 104 for the battery B and such panel may
        be provided with the aforementioned master switch MS and an
        indicator 106 which may disclose the amperage of current flowing
        from the battery B. Four push button switches PB1, PB2, PB3 and
        PB4 may also be provided on the control panel 102 and, as shown
        in FIG. 6, such push button switches are arranged so that they
        operate upon closure thereof to establish shunts across the
        respective microswitches S1, S2, S3 and S4 so that an initial
        momentary closure of a selected push button switch on a trial
        and error basis may cause torque to be applied to one or the
        other cranks 60 or 62 for initial application of torque to the
        crankshaft 14 in the event that neither crank is in a favorable
        position for engine starting at the time that the master switch
        MS is initially closed. </p>
      <p>It is to be noted at this point that although the cams 90 and
        92 are disclosed in FIG. 2 as being disposed at approximately
        180.degree. from each other on the flywheel 16, such cams appear
        in FIG. 6 as being 90.degree. apart. It should be understood
        however that the disclosure of FIG. 6 is purely schematic and is
        intended to illustrate only the sequence of operation of the
        four switches S1, S2, S3 and S4 under the control of the cams 90
        and 92 and that the front and rear end faces 16F and 16R shown
        in FIG. 6 rotate in the same direction since they do not
        represent front and rear end faces in the sense that they are
        illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. In other words, FIG. 6 is
        predicated solely upon the sequence of microswitch operation and
        does not represent a true positioning of parts such as is
        disclosed in FIGS. 1 to 4 inclusive. It is also to be noted that
        by reason of the slight axial misalignment of the magnets M1 and
        M2, and of the magnets M3 and M4, continuous crankshaft movement
        is effected since at no time will the engine or power plant 10
        attain a position of dead-center where closure of the master
        switch crankshaft 14. </p>
      <p>The invention is not to be limited to the exact arrangement of
        parts shown in the accompanying drawings or described in this
        specification as various changes in the details of construction
        may be resorted to without departing from the spirit of the
        invention. For example, the precise placement of the various
        cams 90 and 92 and microswitches S1, S2, S3 and S4 on the
        flywheel 16 and framework 12 may be varied if desired as regards
        their angular relationship with respect to one another, the only
        criteria being the attainment of sequential operation of the
        switches in such a manner that torque is applied to the
        crankshaft 14 at all times by at least one of the four
        connecting rods. Furthermore, if desired a greater or lesser
        number of electromagnets suitably mounted on the framework 12,
        together with a commensurate modification of the nature of the
        crankshaft 14, may be resorted to if deemed appropriate.
        Therefore, only insofar as the invention has particularly been
        pointed out in the accompanying claims is the same to be
        limited. </p>

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to devices changing electrical
        energy into mechanical energy in a form which may be used to
        power useful work applications. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>A common problem with known type devices for converting
        electrical energy into mechanical energy is that they often
        times are very inefficient and waste a lot of energy in the
        conversion process. This is a great disadvantage in today's age
        when conservation of energy is extremely important. </p>
      <p>Another problem with known type engines utilizing electrical
        magnets for part of their structutre is that the associated
        slidable solenoid mechanism is normally used just for converting
        the electrical energy into mechanical drive output without any
        direct actuation of useful work structure directly from the
        movable solenoid armature. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>An object of the present invention is to provide an electrical
        magnetic operated power engine for converting electrical energy
        into useful mechanical energy. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnet
        powered engine having a plurality of electromagnetic solenoids
        with electrical coils and movalbe solenoid armatures therewithin
        arranged in substantially the same plane and connected with
        associated mechanical transfer mechanism to convert the movement
        of the electric solenoid armatures into the desired mechanical
        power. A suitable timer structure is also associated with this
        mechanical structure for controlling the time and degree of
        energization of the respective electric-magnet coils for the
        various electro-magnetic solenoids. </p>
      <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide an
        electro-magnetic solenoid engine structure which incorporates
        and has combined therewith a mechanical sturcture for
        compressing air at atmospheric pressure to a greater pressure
        for direct conversion of the electrical source power into a
        useful product. </p>
      <p>An additional further object is to provide an electromagnetic
        type engine which includes a plurality of electromagnetic coils
        in assoicated timing structure arranged in substantially the
        same plane, with two or more of these structures being stacked
        one upon the other in order to greatly increase the overall
        output of the entire structure. </p>
      <p>The magnet power engine and air compressor combination of this
        invention has a number of new and unique features not known or
        used before. A basic support structure is provided having at
        least one bank of electro-magnetic solenoids arranged in
        substantially the same plane thereon. Each electro-magentic
        solenoid has a slidable and movable solenoid armature
        therewithin which is mechanically operated and connected to
        associated mechanical structure for converting the slidable
        movement thereof into a rotary shaft power output. A timing
        mechanism is also associated with this mechanical structure for
        appropriately connecting the electrical power source to at least
        one electromagnetic coil, and preferably a plurality of same, so
        that they will operate in proper timing for directing the
        slidable movement of the solenoid armature back and forth within
        the solenoid electro magnetic coil. </p>
      <p>Also preferably combined with the aforesaid structure is an
        attachable cylindrical sleeve structure having a slidable piston
        therewithin and appropriate air valves for connection with the
        slidable solenoid armature so that useful work may be directly
        accomplished such as by compressing atmospheric air to a much
        higher desired pressure. This structure may be provided for each
        of the electro-magnetic solenoids, or on less than all of same.
      </p>
      <p>These together with other objects and advantages which will
        become subsequently apparent, reside in the details of
        constructuon and operation as more fully hereinafter described
        and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings
        forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts
        throughout. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>Looking at FIG. 1 of the drawings, reference numeral 10
        indicates one bank of the electro-magnet motor of this
        invention. Looking at FIG. 2, two banks, one being stacked on
        top of the other may be seen. </p>
      <p>Each bank basically is provided with a support structure 12
        approximately square in shape with two of said support squares
        being provided for each engine bank. Appropriate spaces separate
        these support squares and together with nuts and bolts 14 form
        the basic support for each engine bank. As may be best seen in
        FIG. 2 the lower must bank is supported from any desired support
        surface by means of another support structure 22 with
        appropriate bolts 24. Support brackets 17 appropriately mounted
        on the respective squares 12 support the respective
        electro-magnet coils 18 therebetween. As seen in FIG. 1, this
        bank is provided with four electro-magnets appropriately spaced
        at the four corners of the square support frame. It has been
        discovered in actual practice that a bank of four
        electro-magnets works extremely well and provides a fairly
        balanced power output. Each electro-magnet coil 18 is provided
        with a suitable number of coil windings to effect the slidable
        movement of a centrally mounted solenoid armature 28
        therewithin. </p>
      <p>As best seen in FIG. 3, the one end of the solenoid armature 28
        is appropriately center tapped for reception of a threaded screw
        32 therewithin. This threaded screw 32 appropriately secures a
        block of aluminum or other non magnetic material 30 to this end
        of the armature. The block 30 forms a connecting link through
        suitable apertures provided therewithin and by means of a
        connection of a pin 34 with locknut 36 thereon to a connecting
        rod portion 38. This connecting rod 38 is suitably pivoted at 39
        to the disc 35 which is mounted so as to transfer power to the
        connecting rod crank 25. The connecting rod crank 25 is suitably
        formed at appropriate points along a crank-shaft 15 as best seen
        in FIG. 2. If only a single engine bank is to be used just a
        single crank-shaft throw 25 is necessary, but for an engine
        having two engine banks as seen in FIG. 2, two such throws are
        required and as the number of banks increases, the corresponding
        number of crank-shaft throws is necessitated. </p>
      <p>In operation as the electro-magnets are energized in proper
        sequence, the electrical input will be transformed into
        mechanical output through the afore described mechanism. In
        order to assure that the electro-magnets are operated in proper
        time relationship a timing mechanism is also provided. Such
        timing mechanism is indicated in general by reference numberal
        50 in FIG. 2, and shown in enlarged detail in the
        cross-sectionalview of FIG. 4. </p>
      <p>A mechanical coupling unit 51 appropriately supports the timing
        mechanism at one end of the electro-magnet motor and by means of
        appropriately threaded bolts 54 support plates 52 therefrom. The
        plates 52 are spaced from each other and each supports thereupon
        insulator blocks 58. These blocks support electric connectors 56
        which in turn connect with bias springs 57 and electrical
        brushes 61. The insulating blocks 58 are fixed upon the supports
        52 and are non-roatable, but the center disc 59 supported
        therebetween is mounted for driven connection from the end of
        the crankshaft 15. Each side of the rotatable disc 59 is
        provided with conducting segments 63 which are internally
        connected to each other so that the electrical energy connected
        to input contacts 56 on the upper side of the timing mechanism
        may be appropriately transferred through springs 57, brushes 61
        through the segment 63 to the lower brushes 61, springs 57' and
        contacts 56' which are appropriately connected to the respective
        electro-magnets of the engine. Of course the segment 63, 63' are
        appropriately designed for the number of electro-magents used
        for the respective banks as well as the total number of such
        banks and are connected by appropriate wiring, not shown, in
        such a manner that each electromagnet will be energized for
        substantially the full stroke of its slidable solenoid armature
        and thus transfer the maximum of energy from electrical form to
        mechanical form. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows an electrical schematic with one of the
        electro-magnet solenoids having coils 18 and 18' indicated and
        with contact brushes 61 and timing segment 63 indicated
        schematically. Also shown across the timing contact 61, 63 are
        resisters and capacitors in parallel. The purpose of this is to
        minimize arcing of the make and break contacts of the respective
        brushes and contact segments. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 shows an alternative form of energizing the
        electro-magnet solenoids which is generally referred to as a
        solid-state switching and which is actually performed by diodes
        67. The current entering the solenoids may be regulated by the
        rheostates 69 as shown in FIGS. 5 and 8. </p>
      <p>Looking at FIG. 2 on the right side thereof, an air compressor
        sleeve 46 is shown appropriately secured by clamp means 66 to
        one of the electro-magnet structures. FIG. 6 shows this
        structure in enlarged detail. The outer end of the solenoid
        armature 28' is appropriately tapped for reception of a threaded
        bolt 72 therewithin The enlarged head of the threaded bolt
        together with a spacer sleeve 73 appropriately support a flat
        piston member 75. This piston member 75 may be appropriately
        provided with a compression ring 76 of conventional type. The
        clamp structure 66 to secure the sleeve 46 at the end of the
        electro-magnet is preferably provided with a thumb nut 68 or the
        like to secure same. The other end of the sleeve 46 has an
        outstanding flange periphery 47 for suitably securing a cylinder
        head 48 thereto. Appropriate bolts and nuts 49 together with
        suitable gaskets form an air-tight seal between the head 48 and
        the sleeve 46, 47. For proper compressing operation to be
        effected, it is necessary that suitable valve mechanism be
        associated with this compressor structure. This is in the form
        of a flexible diaphragm 86 which is secured around the
        circumference thereof between the head 48 and the flange bracket
        47. At the center of the flexible diaphragm 86 is mounted a cone
        shaped protrusion 87 which together with an aperture 88 provided
        in the center of the head 48 functions as a one way intake air
        valve. That is, when the piston 75 is moving away from the head
        and the diaphragm, air will be drawn into the inside of the
        cylinder sleeve 46 through the aperture 88, and then in turn on
        the compression stroke of the head 75 the protrusion 87 will
        seal aperture 88 and then the escape of air out this opening wil
        be prevented. Another outlet 90 appropriately connected by
        tubing 92 to a one way check valve 94 provides an outlet for the
        compressed air and yet prevents backflow thereof. All or some of
        the connecting tubing 92 may be of a flexible nature as desired.
      </p>
      <p>As can be readily envisioned, when one or a plurality of the
        electro-magnets are provided with such air compressor sleeves, a
        direct useful engine output in the form of air under high
        pressure is achieved. As so constructed, the entire apparatus
        may be used solely for providing compressed air for various
        useful purposes. However, by connecting suitiable work apparatus
        to the output of crank-shaft 15, near the timing mechanism 50,
        other devices may be driven from this electro-magnet structure.
      </p>
      <p>The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the
        principles of the invention. Further, since numerous
        modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in
        the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact
        construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly
        all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to,
        falling within the scope of the invention. </p>
