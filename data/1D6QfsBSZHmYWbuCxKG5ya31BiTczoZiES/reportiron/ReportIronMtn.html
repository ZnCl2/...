      <br>
      "John Doe," as I will call him in this book for reasons that will
      be made clear, is a professor at a large university in the Middle
      West. His field is one of the social sciences, but I will not
      identify him beyond this. He telephoned me one evening last
      winter, quite unexpectedly; we had not been in touch for several
      years. He was in New York for a few days, he said, and there was
      something important he wanted to discuss with me. He wouldn't say
      what it was. We met for lunch the next day at a midtown
      restaurant.<br>
      <br>
      He was obviously disturbed. He made small talk for half an hour,
      which was quite out of character, and I didn't press him. Then,
      apropos of nothing, he mentioned a dispute between a writer and a
      prominent political family that had been in the headlines. What,
      he wanted to know, were my views on "freedom of information"? How
      would I qualify them? And so on. My answers were not memor- able,
      but they seemed to satisfy him. Then, quite abruptly, he began to
      tell me the following story:<br>
      <br>
      Early in August of 1963, he said, he found a message on his desk
      that a "Mrs. Potts" had called him from Washington. When he
      returned the call, a MAN answered immediately, and told Doe, among
      other things, that he had been selected to serve on a commission
      "of the highest importance." Its objective was to determine,
      accurately and realistically, the nature of the problems that
      would confront the United States if and when a condition of
      "permanent peace" should arrive, and to draft a program for
      dealing with this contingency. The man described the unique
      procedures that were to govern the commission's work and that were
      expected to extend its scope far beyond that of any previous
      examination of these problems.<br>
      <br>
      Considering that the caller did not precisely identify either
      himself or his agency, his persuasiveness must have been a truly
      remarkable order. Doe entertained no serious doubts of the bona
      fides of the project, however, chiefly because of his previous
      experience with the excessive secrecy that often surrounds
      quasi-governmental activities. In addition, the man at the other
      end of the line demonstrated an impressively complete and
      surprisingly detailed knowledge of Doe's work and personal life.
      He also mentioned the names of others who were to serve with the
      group; most of them were known to Doe by reputation. Doe agreed to
      take the assignment --- he felt he had no real choice in the
      matter --- and to appear the second Saturday following at Iron
      Mountain, New York. An airline ticket arrived in his mail the next
      morning.<br>
      <br>
      The cloak-and-dagger tone of this convocation was further enhanced
      by the meeting place itself. Iron Mountain, located near the town
      of Hudson, is like something out of Ian Fleming or E.Phillips
      Oppenheim. It is an underground nuclear hideout for hundreds of
      large American corporations. Most of them use it as an emergency
      storage vault for important documents. But a number of them
      maintain substitute corporate headquarters as well, where
      essential personnel could presumably survive and continue to work
      after an attack. This latter group includes such firms as Standard
      Oil of New Jersey, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and Shell.<br>
      <br>
      I will leave most of the story of the operations of the Special
      Study Group, as the commission was formally called, for Doe to
      tell in his own words ("Background Information"). At this point it
      is necessary to say only that it met and worked regularly for over
      two and a half years, after which it produced a Report. It was
      this document, and what to do about it, that Doe wanted to talk to
      me about.<br>
      <br>
      The Report, he said, had been suppressed --- both by the Special
      Study Group itself and by the government INTERAGENCY committee to
      which it had been sub- mitted. After months of agonizing, Doe had
      decided that he would no longer be party to keeping it secret.
      What he wanted from me was advice and assistance in having it
      published. He gave me his copy to read, with the express under-
      standing that if for any reason I were unwilling to become
      involved, I would say nothing about it to anyone else.<br>
      <br>
      I read the Report that same night. I will pass over my own
      reactions to it, except to say that the unwillingness of Doe's
      associates to publicize their findings became readily
      understandable. What had happened was that they had been so
      tenacious in their determination to deal comprehensively with the
      many problems of transition to peace that the original questions
      asked of them were never quite answered. Instead, this is what
      they concluded:<br>
      <br>
      Lasting peace, while no theoretically impossible, is probably
      unattainable; even if it could be achieved it would almost
      certainly not be in the best interestes of a stable society to
      achieve it.<br>
      <br>
      That is the gist of what they say. Behind their qualified academic
      language runs this general argument: War fills certain functions
      essential to the stability of our society; until other ways of
      filling them are developed, the war system must be maintained --
      and improved in effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      It is not surprising that the Group, in its Letter of Transmittal,
      did not choose to justify its work to "the lay reader, unexposed
      to the exigencies of higher political or military responsibility."
      Its Report was addressed, deliberately, to unnamed government
      administrators of high rank; it assumed considerable political
      sophistication from this select audience. To the general reader,
      therefore, the substance of the document may be even more
      unsettling than its conclusions. He may not be prepared for some
      of its assumptions -- for instance, that most medical advances are
      viewed more as problems than as progress; or that poverty is
      necessary and desirable, public postures by politicians to the
      contrary notwithstanding; or that standing armies are, among other
      things, social-welfare institutions in exactly the same sense as
      are old-people's homes and mental hospitals. It may strike him as
      odd to find the probably explanation of "flying saucer" incidents
      disposed of en passant in less than a sentence. He may be less
      surprised to find that the space program and the "controversial"
      antimissile missile and fallout shelter programs are understood to
      have the spending of vast sums of money, not the advancement of
      science or national defense, as their principal goals, and to
      learn that "military" draft policies are only remotely concerned
      with defense.<br>
      <br>
      He may be offended to find the organized repression of minority
      groups, and even the reestablishment of slavery, seriously (and on
      the whole favorably) discussed as possible aspects of a world at
      peace. He is not likely to take kindly to the notion of the
      deliberate intensification of air and water pollution (as part of
      a program leading to peace), even when the reason for considering
      it is made clear. That a world without war will have to turn
      sooner rather than later to universal test-tube procreation will
      be less disturbing, if no more appealing. But few readers will not
      be taken aback, at least, by a few lines in the Report's
      conclusions, repeated in its formal recommendations, that suggest
      that the long-range planning--and "budgeting" -- of the "optimum"
      number of lives to be destroyed annually in overt warfare is high
      on the Group's list of priorities for government action.<br>
      <br>
      I cite these few examples primarily to warn the general reader
      what he can expect. The statesmen and strategists for whose eyes
      the Report was intended obviously need no such protective
      admonition.<br>
      <br>
      This book, of course, is evidence of my response to Doe's request.
      After carefully considering the problems that might confront the
      publisher of the Report, we took it to The Dial Press. There, its
      significance was immediately recognized, and, more important, we
      were given firm assurances that no outside pressures of any sort
      would be permitted to interfere with its publication.<br>
      <br>
      It should be made clear that Doe does not disagree with the
      substance of the Report, which represents as genuine consensus in
      all important respects. He constituted a minority of one -- but
      only on the issue of disclosing it to the general public. A look
      at how the Group dealt with this question will be illuminating.<br>
      <br>
      The debate took place at the Group's last full meeting before the
      Report was written, late in March, 1966, and again at Iron
      Mountain. Two facts must be kept in mind, by way of background.
      The first is that the Special Study Group had never been
      explicitly charged with or sworn to secrecy, either when it was
      convened or at any time thereafter. The second is that the Group
      had neverthe- less operated as if it had been. This was assumed
      from the circumstances of its inception and from the tone of its
      instructions. (The Group's acknowledgment of help from "the many
      persons....who contributed so greatly to our work" is somewhat
      equivocal; these persons were not told the nature of the project
      for which their special resources of information were solicited.)<br>
      <br>
      Those who argued the case for keeping the Report secret were
      admittedly motivated by fear of the explosive political effects
      that could be expected from publicity. For evidence, they pointed
      to the suppression of the far less controversial report of
      then-Senator Hubert Humphrey's subcommittee on disarmament in
      1962. (Subcommittee members had reportedly feared that it might be
      used by Communist propagandists, as Senator Stuart Symington put
      it, to "back up the Marxian theory that was production was the
      reason for the success of capitalism.") Similar political
      precautions had been taken with the better- known Gaither Report
      in 1957, and even with the so-called Moynihan Report in 1965.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, they insisted, a distinction must be made between
      serious studies, which are normally classified unless and until
      policy makers decide to release them, and conventional "showcase"
      projects, organized to demonstrate a political leadership's
      concerns about an issue and to deflect the energy of those
      pressing for action on it. (The example used, because some of the
      Group had participated in it, was a "While House Conference" on
      intended cooperation, disarmament, etc., which had been staged
      late in 1965 to offset complaints about escalation of Vietnam
      War.)<br>
      <br>
      Doe acknowledges this distinction, as well as the strong
      possibility of public misunderstanding. But he feels that if the
      sponsoring agency had wanted to mandate secrecy it could have done
      so at the outset. It could also have assigned the project to one
      of the government's established "think tanks," which normally work
      on a classified basis. He scoffed at fear of public reaction,
      which could have no lasting effect on long-range measures that
      might be taken to implement the Group's proposals, and derided the
      Group's abdication of responsibility for its opinions and
      conclusions. So far as he was concerned, there was such a thing as
      a public right to know what was being done on its behalf; the
      burden of proof was on those who would abridge it.<br>
      <br>
      If my account seems to give Doe the better of the argument,
      despite his failure to convince his colleagues, so be it. My
      participation in this book testifies that I am not neutral. In my
      opinion, the decision of the Special Study Group to censor its own
      findings was not merely timid but presumptuous. But the refusal,
      as of this writing, of the agencies for which the Report was
      prepared to release it themselves raises broader questions of
      public policy. Such questions center on the continuing use of
      self-serve definitions of "security" to avoid possible political
      embarrassment. It is ironic how often this practice backfires.<br>
      <br>
      I should state, for the record, that I do not share the attitudes
      toward war and peace, life and death, and survival of the species
      manifested in the Report. Few readers will. In human terms, it is
      an outrageous document. But it does represent a serious and
      challenging effort to define an enormous problem. And it explains,
      or certainly appears to explain, aspects of American policy
      otherwise incomprehensible by the ordinary standards of common
      sense. What we may think of these explanations is something else,
      but it seems to me that we are entitled to know not only what they
      are but whose they are.<br>
      <br>
      By "whose" I don't mean merely the names of the authors of the
      Report. Much more important, we have a right to know to what
      extent their assumptions of social necessity are shared by the
      decision-makers in our government. Which do they accept and which
      do they reject? However disturbing the answers, only full and
      frank discussion offers any conceivable hope of solving the
      problems raised by the Special Study Group in their Report from
      Iron Mountain.<br>

      [The following account of the workings of the Special Study Group
      is taken verbatim from a series of tape-recorded interviews I had
      with "John Doe." The transcript has been edited to minimize the
      intrusion of my questions and comments, as well as for length, and
      the sequence has been revised in the interest of continuity.
      L.C.L.]<br>
      <br>
      <i>HOW WAS THE GROUP FORMED?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      ...The general idea for it, for this kind of study dates back at
      least to 1961. It started with some of the new people who came in
      with the Kennedy administration, mostly, I think, with McNamara,
      Bundy, and Rusk. They were impatient about many things....One of
      them was that no really serious work had been done about planning
      for peace -- a long-range peace, that is, with long- rang
      planning.<br>
      <br>
      Everything that had been written on the subject [before 1961] was
      superficial. There was insufficient appreciation of the scope of
      the problem. The main reason for this, of course, was that the
      idea of a real peace in the world, general disarmament and so on,
      was looked on as utopian. Or even crackpot. This is still true,
      and it's easy enough to understand when you look at what's going
      on in the world today....It was reflected in the studies that had
      been made up to that time. They were not realistic.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of the Special Study, the exact form it would take, was
      worked out early in '63...The settlement of the Cuban missile
      affair had something to do with it, but what helped most to get it
      moving were the big changes in military spending that were being
      planned.....Plants being closed, relocations, and so forth. Most
      of it wasn't made public until much later.<br>
      <br>
      [I understand] it took a long time to select the people for the
      Group. The calls didn't go out until the summer......<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>WHO MADE THE SELECTION?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      That's something I can't tell you. I wasn't involved with the
      preliminary planning. The first I knew of it was when I was called
      myself. But three of the people had been in on it, and what the
      rest of us know we learned from them, about what went on earlier.
      I do know that it started very informally. I don't know what
      particular government agency approved the project.<br>
      <br>
      <i>WOULD YOU CARE TO MAKE A GUESS?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      All right---I think it was an ad hoc committee, at the cabinet
      level, or near it. It had to be. I suppose they gave the
      organizational job -- making arrangements, paying the bills, and
      so on -- to somebody from the State or Defense of the National
      Security Council. Only one of us was in touch with Washington, and
      I wasn't the one. But I can tell you that very, very few people
      knew about us... For instance, there was the Ackley Committee. It
      was set up after we were. If you read their report -- the same old
      tune -- economic reconversion, turning sword plants into plowshare
      factories... I think you'll wonder if even the President knew
      about our Group. The Ackley Committee certainly didn't.<br>
      <br>
      <i>IS THAT POSSIBLE, REALLY? I MEAN THAT NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT
        KNEW OF YOUR COMMISSION?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Well, I don't think there's anything odd about the government
      attacking a problem at two different levels. Or even about two or
      three [government] agencies working at cross-purposes. It happens
      all the time. Perhaps the President did know. And I don't mean to
      denigrate the Ackley Committee, but it was exactly that narrowness
      of approach that we were supposed to get away from.<br>
      <br>
      You have to remember -- you've read the Report---that what they
      wanted from us was a different kind of thinking. It was a matter
      of approach. Herman Kahn calls is "Byzantine" -- no agonizing over
      cultural and religious values. No moral posturing. It's the kind
      of thinking that Rand and the Hudson Institute and I.D.A.
      (Institute for Defense Analysis.) brought into war planning...
      What they asked up to do, and I think we did it, was to give the
      same kind of treatment to the hypothetical nuclear war...We may
      have gone further than they expected, but once you establish your
      premises and your logic you can't turn back....<br>
      <br>
      Kahn's books, for example, are misunderstood, at least by laymen.
      They shock people. But you see, what's important about them is not
      his conclusions, or his opinions. It's the method. He has done
      more than anyone else I can think of to get the general public
      accustomed to the style of modern military thinking... Today it's
      possible for a columnist to write about "counterforce strategy"
      and "minimum deterrence" and "credible first strike capability"
      without having to explain every other word. He can write about war
      and strategy without getting bogged down in questions or morality.<br>
      <br>
      The other big difference about or work is breadth. The Report
      speaks for itself. I can't say that we took every relevant aspect
      of life and society into account, but I don't think we missed
      anything essential...<br>
      <br>
      <i>WHY WAS THE PROJECT GIVEN TO AN OUTSIDE COMMISSION? WHY
        COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN HANDLED BY AN APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENT
        AGENCY?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      I think that's obvious, or should be. The kind of thinking wanted
      from our Group just isn't to be had in a formal government
      operation. Too many constraints. Too many inhibitions. This isn't
      a new problem. Why else would outfits like Rand and Hudson stay in
      business? Any assignment that's at all sophisticated is almost
      always given to an outside group. This is true even in the State
      Department, in the "gray" operations, those that are supposed to
      be unofficial, but are really as official as can be. Also with the
      C.I.A....<br>
      <br>
      For our study, even the private research centers were too
      institutional... A lot of thought went into making sure that our
      thinking would be unrestricted. All kinds of little things. The
      way we were called into the Group, the places we met, all kinds of
      subtle devices to remind us. For instance, even our name, the
      Special Study Group. You know government names. Wouldn't you think
      we'd have been called "Operation Olive Branch," or "Project
      Pacifica," or something like that? Nothing like that for us -- too
      allusive, too suggestive. And no minutes of our meetings -- too
      inhibiting... About who might be reading them. Of course, we took
      notes for our own use. And among ourselves, we usually called
      ourselves "The Iron Mountain Boys," or "Our Thing," or whatever
      came to mind.<br>
      <br>
      <i>WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I'll have to stick to generalities... There were fifteen of us.
      The important thing was that we represented a very wide range of
      disciplines. And not all academic. People from the natural
      sciences, the social sciences, even the humanities. We had a
      lawyer and a businessman. Also, a professional war planner. Also,
      you should know that everyone in the Group had done work of
      distinction in at least two different fields. The
      interdisciplinary element was built in.<br>
      <br>
      It's true that there were no women in the Group, but I don't think
      that was significant... We were all American citizens, of course.
      And all, I can say, in very good health, at least when we
      began.... You see, the first order of business, at the first
      meeting, was the reading of dossiers. They were very detailed, and
      not just professional, but also personal. They included medical
      histories. I remember one very curious thing, for whatever it's
      worth. Most of us, and that includes me, had a record of
      abnormally high uric acid concentrations in the blood... None of
      us had ever had this experience, of a public inspection of
      credentials, or medical reports. It was very disturbing.<br>
      <br>
      But it was deliberate. The reason for it was to emphasize that we
      were supposed to make ALL our own decisions on procedure, without
      outside rules. This included judging each others qualifications
      and making allowances for possible bias. I don't think it affected
      our work directly, but it made the point it was supposed to
      make... That we should ignore absolutely nothing that might
      conceivably affect our objectivity.<br>
      <br>
      [At this point I persuaded Doe that a brief occupational
      description of the individual members of the Group would serve a
      useful purpose for readers of the Report. The list which follows
      was worked out on paper. (It might be more accurate to say it was
      negotiated). The problem was to give as much relevant information
      as possible without violating Doe's commitment to protect his
      colleagues' anonymity. It turned out to be very difficult,
      especially in the cases of those members who are very well known.
      For this reason, secondary areas of achievement or reputations are
      usually not shown.<br>
      <br>
      The simple alphabetical "names" were assigned by Doe for
      convenient reference; they bear no intended relation to actual
      names. "Able" was the Group's Washington contact. It was he who
      brought and read the dossiers, and who most often acted as
      chairman. He, "Baker," and "Cox" were the three who had been
      involved in the preliminary planning. There is no other
      significance to the order of listing.<br>
      <br>
      "Arthus Able" is an historian and political theorist, who has
      served in government.<br>
      <br>
      "Bernard Baker: is a professor of international law and a
      consultant on government operations.<br>
      <br>
      "Charles Cox" is an economist, social critic, and biographer.<br>
      <br>
      "John Doe."<br>
      <br>
      "Edward Ellis" is a sociologist often involved in public affairs.<br>
      <br>
      "Frank Fox" is a cultural anthropologist.<br>
      <br>
      "George Green" is a psychologist, educator, and developer of
      personnel testing systems.<br>
      <br>
      "Harold Hill" is a psychiatrist, who has conducted extensive
      studies of the relationship between individual and group behavior.<br>
      <br>
      "John Jones" is a scholar and literary critic.<br>
      <br>
      "Martin Miller" is a physical chemist, whose work has received
      inter- national recognition at the highest level.<br>
      <br>
      "Paul Peters" is a biochemist, who has made important discoveries
      bearing on reproductive processes.<br>
      <br>
      "Richard Roe" is a mathematician affiliated with an independent
      West Coast research institution.<br>
      <br>
      "Samuel Smith" is an astronomer, physicist, and communications
      theorist.<br>
      <br>
      "Thomas Taylor" is a systems analyst and war planner, who has
      written extensively on war, peace, and international relations.<br>
      <br>
      "William White" is an industrialist, who has undertaken many
      special government assignments.]<br>
      <br>
      <i>HOW DID THE GROUP OPERATE? I MEAN, WHERE AND WHEN DID YOU MEET,
        AND SO FORTH?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      We met on the average of once a month. Usually it was on weekends,
      and usually for two days. We had a few longer sessions, and one
      that lasted only four hours. We met all over the country, always
      at a different place, except for the first and last times, which
      were at Iron Mountain. It was like a traveling
      seminar....Sometimes at hotels, sometimes at universities. Twice
      we met at summer camps, and once at a private estate, in Virginia.
      We used a business place in Pittsburgh, and another in
      Poughkeepsie, [New York]. We never met in Washington, or on
      government property anywhere. Able would announce the times and
      places two meetings ahead. They were never changed.<br>
      <br>
      We didn't divide into subcommittees, or anything else that formal.
      But we all took individual assignments between meetings. A lot of
      it involved getting information from other people... Among the
      fifteen of us, I don't thing there was anybody in the academic or
      professional world we couldn't call on if we wanted to, and we
      took advantage of it... We were paid a very modest per diem. All
      of it was called "expenses" on the vouchers. We were told not to
      report it on our tax returns... The checks were drawn on a special
      account of Able's at a New York bank. He signed them... I don't
      know what the study cost. So far as our time and travel were
      concerned, it couldn't have come to more than the low six-figure
      range. But the big item must have been computer time, and I have
      no idea how high this ran.<br>
      <br>
      <i>YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T THINK YOUR WORK WAS AFFECTED BY
        PROFESSIONAL BIAS. WHAT ABOUT POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL BIAS?
        IS IT POSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH QUESTIONS OF WAR AND PEACE WITHOUT
        REFLECTING PERSONAL VALUES?</i><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Yes, it is. I can understand your skepticism. But if you had been
      at any of our meetings you'd have had a very hard time figuring
      out who were the liberals and who were the conservatives, or who
      were hawks and who were doves. There IS such a thing as
      objectivity, and I think we had it... I don't say no one had any
      emotional reaction to what we were doing. We all did, to some
      extent. As a matter of fact, two members had heart attacks after
      we were finished, and I'll be the first to admit it probably
      wasn't a coincidence.<br>
      <br>
      <i>YOU SAID YOU MADE UP YOUR OWN GROUND RULES. WHAT WERE THESE
        GROUND RULES?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      The most important were informality and unanimity . By informality
      I mean that our discussions were open-ended. We went as far afield
      as any one of us thought we had to. For instance, we spent a lot
      of time on the relationship between military recruitment policies
      and industrial employment. Before we were finished with it, we'd
      gone through the history of western penal codes and any number of
      comparative psychiatric studies [of draftees and volunteers]. We
      looked over the organization of the Inca empire. We determined the
      effects of automation on underdeveloped societies... It was all
      relevant.<br>
      <br>
      By unanimity, I don't mean that we kept taking votes, like a jury.
      I mean that we stayed with every issue until we had what the
      Quakers call a "sense of the meeting." It was time-consuming. But
      in the long run it saved time. Eventually we all got on the same
      wavelength, so to speak.<br>
      <br>
      Of course we had differences, and big ones, especially in the
      beginning. For instance, in Section I you might think we were
      merely clarifying our instructions. Not so; it took a long time
      before we all agreed to a strict interpretation. Roe and Taylor
      deserve most of the credit for this. There are many things in the
      Report that look obvious now, but didn't seem so obvious then. For
      instance, on the relationship of war to social systems. The
      original premise was conventional, from Clausewitz. That war was
      an "instrument" of broader political values. Able was the only one
      who challenged this, at first. Fox called his position "perverse."
      Yet it was Fox who furnished most of the data that led us all to
      agree with Able eventually. I mention this because I think it's a
      good example of the way we worked. A triumph of method over
      cliche. I certainly don't intend to go into details about who took
      what side about what, and when. But I will say, to give credit
      where due, that only Roe, Able, Hill and Taylor were able to see,
      at the beginning, where our method was taking us.<br>
      <br>
      <i>BUT YOU ALWAYS REACHED AGREEMENT, EVENTUALLY?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Yes. It's a unanimous report... I don't mean that our sessions
      were always harmonious. Some of them were rough. The last six
      months there was a lot of quibbling about small points... We'd
      been under pressure for a long time, we'd been working together
      too long. It was natural that we got on each others nerves. For a
      while Able and Taylor weren't speaking to each other. Miller
      threatened to quit. But this all passed. There were no important
      differences.<br>
      <br>
      <i>HOW WAS THE REPORT ACTUALLY WRITTEN? WHO DID THE WRITING?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      We all a hand in the first draft. Jones and Able put it together,
      and then mailed it around for review before working out a final
      version... The only problems were the form it should take and whom
      we were writing it for. And, of course, the question of
      disclosure.... [Doe's comments on this point are summarized in the
      introduction.]<br>
      <br>
      <i>YOU MENTIONED A "PEACE GAMES" MANUAL. WHAT ARE PEACE GAMES?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      I wanted to say something about that. The Report barely mentions
      it. "Peace games" is a method we developed during the course of
      the study. It's a fore- casting technique, an information system.
      I'm very excited about it. Even if nothing is done about our
      recommendations -- which is conceivable -- this is something that
      can't be ignored. It will revolutionize the study of social
      problems. It's a by-product of the study. We needed a fast,
      dependable procedure to approximate the effects of disparate
      social phenomena on other social phenomena. We got it. It's in a
      primitive phase, but it works.<br>
      <br>
      <i>HOW ARE PEACE GAMES PLAYED? ARE THEY LIKE RAND'S WAR GAMES?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      You don't "play" peace games, like chess or Monopoly, any more
      than you play war games with toy soldiers. You use computers. It's
      a programming system. A computer "language," like Fortran, or
      Algol, or Jovial... Its advantage is its superior capacity to
      interrelate data with no apparent common points of reference... A
      simple analogy is likely to be misleading. But I can give you some
      examples. For instance, supposing I asked you to figure out what
      effect a moon landing by U.S. astronauts would have on an election
      in, say, Sweden. Or what effect a change in the draft law -- a
      specific change -- would have on the value of real estate in
      downtown Manhattan? Or a certain change in college entrance
      requirements in the United States on the British shipping
      industry?<br>
      <br>
      You would probably say, first, that there would be no effect to
      speak of, and second, that there would be no way of telling. But
      you'd be wrong on both counts. In each case there would be an
      effect, and the peace games method could tell you what it would
      be, quantitatively. I didn't take these examples out of the air.
      We used them in working out the method... Essentially, it's an
      elaborate high-speed trial-and-error system for determining
      working algorithms. Like most sophisticated types of computer
      problem-solving.<br>
      <br>
      A lot of the "games" of this kind you read about are just
      glorified and conversational exercises. They really are games, and
      nothing more. I just saw one reported in the Canadian Computer
      Society Bulletin, called a "Vietnam Peace Game." They use
      simulation techniques, but the programming hypotheses are
      speculative.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of a problem-solving system like this is not original
      with us. ARPA (the Advanced Research Projects Agency, of the
      Department of Defense DoD.) has been working on something like it.
      So has General Electric, in California. There are others... We
      were successful not because we know more than they do about
      programming, which we don't, but because we leaned how to
      formulate the problems accurately. It goes bck to the old saw. You
      can always find the answer if you know the right question.<br>
      <br>
      <i>SUPPOSING YOU HADN'T DEVELOPED THIS METHOD. WOULD YOU HAVE COME
        TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS IN THE REPORT?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Certainly. But it would have taken many times longer. .But please
      don't misunderstand my enthusiasm [about the peace games method].
      With all due respect to the effects of computer technology on
      modern thinking, basic judgments must still be made by human
      beings. The peace games technique isn't responsible for our
      Report. We are.<br>
      <br>
      <i>STATEMENT BY "JOHN DOE"</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Contrary to the decision of the Special Study Group, of which I
      was a member, I have arranged for the general release of our
      Report. I am grateful to Mr. Leonard C. Lewin for his invaluable
      assistance in making this possible, and to The Dial Press for
      accepting the challenge of publication. Responsibility for taking
      this step, however, is mine and mine alone.<br>
      <br>
      I am well aware that my action may be taken as a breach of faith
      by some of my former colleagues. But in my view my responsibility
      to the society for which I am a part supersedes any self-assumed
      obligation on the part of fifteen individual men. Since our Report
      can be considered on its merits, it is not necessary for me to
      disclose their identity to accomplish my purpose. Yet I gladly
      abandon my own anonymity it is were possible to do so without at
      the same time comprising theirs, to defend our work publicly if
      and when they release me from this personal bond.<br>
      <br>
      But this is secondary. What is needed now, and needed badly, is
      widespread public discussion and debate about the elements of war
      and the problems of peace. I hope that publication of this Report
      will serve to initiate it.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      To the convener of this Group:<br>
      <br>
      Attached is the Report of the Special Study Group established by
      you in August, 1963, 1) to consider the problems involved in the
      contingency of a transition to a general condition of peace, and
      2) to recommend procedures for dealing with this contingency. For
      the convenience of non-technical readers we have elected to submit
      our statistical supporting data, totaling 604 exhibits,
      separately, as well as a preliminary manual of the "peace games"
      method devised during the course of our study.<br>
      <br>
      We have completed our assignment to the best of our ability,
      subject to the limitations of time and resources available to us.
      Our conclusions of fact and our recommendations are unanimous;
      those of use who differ in certain secondary respects from the
      findings set forth herein do not consider these differences
      sufficient to warrant the filing of a minority report. It is our
      earnest hope that the fruits of our deliberations will be of value
      to our government in its efforts to provide leadership to the
      nation in solving the complex and far- reaching problems we have
      examined, and that our recommendations for subsequent Presidential
      action in this area will be adopted.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the establishment
      of this Group, and in view of the nature of its findings, we do
      not recommend that this Report be released for publication. It is
      our affirmative judgment that such action would not be in the
      public interest. The uncertain advantages of public discussion of
      our conclusions and recommendations are, in our opinion, greatly
      outweighed by the clear and predictable danger of a crisis in
      public confidence which untimely publication of this Report might
      be expected to provoke. The likelihood that a lay reader,
      unexposed to the exigencies of higher political or military
      responsibility, will misconstrue the purpose of this project, and
      the intent of its participants, seems obvious. We urge that
      circulation of this Report be closely restricted to those whose
      responsibilities require that they be apprised of its contents.<br>
      <br>
      We deeply regret that the necessity of anonymity, a prerequisite
      to our Group's unhindered pursuit of its objectives, precludes
      proper acknowledgment of our gratitude to the many persons in and
      out of government who contributed so greatly to our work.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      The Report which follows summarizes the results of a
      two-and-a-half-year study of the broad problems to be anticipated
      in the event of general trans- formation of American society to a
      condition lacking its most critical current characteristics: its
      capability and readiness to make war when doing so is judged
      necessary or desirable by its political leadership.<br>
      <br>
      Our work has been predicated on the belief that some kind of
      general peace may soon be negotiable. The de facto admission of
      Communist China into the United Nations now appears to be only a
      few years away at most. It has become increasingly manifest that
      conflicts of American national interest with those of China and
      the Soviet Union are susceptible of political solution, despite
      the superficial con-traindications of the current Vietnam war, of
      the threats of an attack on China, and of the necessarily hostile
      tenor of day-to-day foreign policy statements. It is also obvious
      that differences involving other nations can be readily resolved
      by the three great powers whenever they arrive at a stable peace
      among themselves. It is not necessary, for the purposes of our
      study, to assume that a general detente of this sort will come
      about -- and we make no such argument -- but only that it may.<br>
      <br>
      It is surely no exaggeration to say that a condition of general
      world peace would lead to changes in the social structures of the
      nations of the world of unparalleled and revolutionary magnitude.
      The economic impact of general disarmament, to name only the most
      obvious consequence of peace, would revise the production and
      distribution patterns of the globe to a degree that would make
      changes of the past fifty years seem insignificant. Political,
      sociological, cultural, and ecological changes would be equally
      far-reaching. What has motivated our study of these contingencies
      has been the growing sense of thoughtful men in and out of
      government that the world is totally unprepared to meet the
      demands of such a situation.<br>
      <br>
      We had originally planned, when our study was initiated, to
      address ourselves to these two broad questions and their
      components: What can be expected if peace comes? What should we be
      prepared to do about it? But as our investigation proceeded, it
      became apparent that certain other questions had to be faced.
      What, for instance, are the real functions of war in modern
      societies, beyond the ostensible ones of defending and advancing
      the "national interests" of nations? In the absence of war, what
      other institutions exist or might be devised to fulfill these
      functions? Granting that a "peaceful" settlement of disputes is
      within the range of current international relationships, is the
      abolition of war, in the broad sense, really possible? If so, is
      it necessarily desirable, in terms of social stability? If not,
      what can be done to improve the operation of our social system in
      respect to its war-readiness?<br>
      <br>
      The word peace, as we have used it in the following pages,
      describes a permanent, or quasi-permanent, condition entirely free
      from the national exercise, or contemplation, of any form of the
      organized social violence, or threat of violence, generally known
      as war. It implies total and general disarmament. It is not used
      to describe the more familiar condition of "cold war," "armed
      peace," or other mere respite, long or short, from armed conflict.
      Nor is it used simply as a synonym for the political settlement of
      international differences. The magnitude of modern means of mass
      destruction and the speed of modern communications require the
      unqualified working definition given above; only a generation ago
      such an absolute description would have seemed utopian rather than
      pragmatic. Today, any modification of this definition would render
      it almost worthless for our purpose. By the same standard, we have
      used the work war to apply interchangeably to conventional ("hot")
      war, to the general condition of war preparation or war readiness,
      and to the general "war system." The sense intended is made clear
      in context.<br>
      <br>
      The first section of our Report deals with its scope and with the
      assumptions on which our study was based. The second considers the
      effects of disarmament on the economy, the subject of most peace
      research to date. The third takes up so-called "disarmament
      scenarios" which have been proposed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth
      examine the nonmilitary functions of war and the problems they
      raise for a viable transition to peace; here will be found some
      indications of the true dimensions of the problem, not previously
      coordinated in any other study. In the seventh section we
      summarize our findings, and in the eight we set forth our
      recommendations for what we believe to be a practical and
      necessary course of action.<br>

        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      When The Special Study Group was established in August, 1963, its
      members were instructed to govern their deliberations in
      accordance with three principal criteria. Briefly stated, they
      were these: 1) military-style objectivity; 2) avoidance of
      preconceived value assumptions; 3) inclusion of all relevant areas
      of theory and data.<br>
      <br>
      These guideposts are by no means as obvious as they may appear at
      first glance, and we believe it necessary to indicate clearly how
      they were to in- form our work. For they express succinctly the
      limitations of previous "peace studies," and imply the nature of
      both government and unofficial dissatisfaction with these earlier
      efforts. It is not our intention here to minimize the significance
      of the work of our predecessors, or to belittle the quality of
      their contributions. What we have tried to do, and believe we have
      done, is extend their scope. We hope that our conclusions may
      serve in turn as a starting point for still broader and more
      detailed examinations of every aspect of the problems of
      transition to peace and of the questions which must be answer- ed
      before such a transition can be allowed to get under way.<br>
      <br>
      It is a truism that objectivity is more often an intention
      expressed than an attitude achieved, but the
      intention---conscious, unambiguous, and constantly self-critical
      -- is a precondition to its achievement. We believe it no accident
      that we were charged to use a "military contingency" model for our
      study, and we owe a considerable debt to the civilian war planning
      agencies for their pioneering work in the objective examination of
      the contingencies of nuclear war. There is no such precedent in
      the peace studies. Much of the usefulness of even the most
      elaborate and carefully reasoned programs for economic conversion
      to peace, for example, has been vitiated by a wishful eagerness to
      demonstrate that peace is not only possible, but even cheap or
      easy. One official report is replete with references to the
      critical role of "dynamic optimism" on economic developments, and
      goes on to submit, as evidence, that it "would be hard to imagine
      that the American people would not respond very positively to an
      agreed and safeguarded program to substitute an international rule
      of law and order," etc. Another line of argument frequently taken
      is that disarmament would entail comparatively little disruption
      of the economy, since it need only be partial; we will deal with
      this approach later. Yet genuine objectivity in war studies is
      often criticized as inhuman. As Herman Kahn, the writer on
      strategic studies best known to the general public, put it:
      "Critics frequently object to the icy rationality of the Hudson
      Institute, the Rand Corporation, and other such organizations. I'm
      always tempted to ask in reply, `Would you prefer a warm, human
      error? Do you feel better with a nice emotional mistake.'" And, as
      Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara has pointed out, in
      reference to facing up to the possibility of nuclear war, "Some
      people are afraid even to look over the edge. But in a
      thermonuclear war we cannot afford any political acrophobia."
      Surely it would be self-evident that this applies equally to the
      opposite prospect, but so far no one has taken more than a timid
      glance over the brink of peace.<br>
      <br>
      An intention to avoid preconceived value judgments is if anything
      even more productive of self-delusion. We claim no immunity, as
      individuals, from this type of bias, but we have made a
      continuously self-conscious effort to deal with the problems of
      peace without, for example, considering that a condition of peace
      is per se "good" or "bad." This has not been easy, but it has been
      obligatory; to our knowledge, it has not been done before.
      Previous studies have taken the desirability of peace, the
      importance of human life, the superiority of democratic
      institutions, the greatest "good" for the greatest number, the
      "dignity" of the individual, the desirability of maximum health
      and longevity, and other such wishful premises as axiomatic values
      necessary for the justification of a study of peace issues. We
      have not found them so. We have attempted to apply the standards
      of physical science to our thinking, the principal characteristic
      of which is not quantification, as is popularly believed, but
      that, in Whitehead's words, "...it ignores all judgments of value;
      for instance, all esthetic and moral judgments." Yet it is obvious
      that any serious investigation of a problem, however "pure," must
      be informed by some normative standard. In this case it has been
      simply the survival of human society in general, of American
      society in particular, and, as a corollary to survival, the
      stability of this society.<br>
      <br>
      It is interesting, we believe, to note that the most dispassionate
      planners of nuclear strategy also recognize that the stability of
      society is the one bedrock value that cannot be avoided. Secretary
      McNamara has defended the need for American nuclear superiority on
      the grounds that it "makes possible a strategy designed to
      preserve the fabric of our societies if war should occur." A
      former member of the Department of State policy planning staff
      goes further. "A more precise word for peace, in terms of the
      practical world, is stability... Today the great nuclear panoplies
      are essential elements in such stability as exists. Our present
      purpose must be to continue the process of learning how to live
      with them." We, of course, do not equate stability with peace, but
      we accept it as the one common assumed objective of both peace and
      war.<br>
      <br>
      The third criterion-breadth-has taken us still farther afield from
      peace studies made to date. It is obvious to any layman that the
      economic patterns of a warless world will be drastically different
      from those we live with today, and it is equally obvious that the
      political relationships of nations will not be those we have
      learned to take for granted, sometimes described as a global
      version of the adversary system of our common law. But the social
      implications of peace extend far beyond its putative effects on
      national economics and international relations. As we shall show,
      the relevance of peace and war to the internal political
      organization of societies, to the sociological relationships of
      their members, to psychological motivations, to ecological
      processes, and to cultural values is equally profound. More
      important, it is equally critical in assaying the consequences of
      a transition to peace, and in determining the feasibility of any
      transition at all.<br>
      <br>
      It is not surprising that these less obvious factors have been
      generally ignored in peace research. They have not lent themselves
      to systematic analysis. They have been difficult, perhaps
      impossible, to measure with any degree of assurance that estimates
      of their effects could be depended on. They are "intangibles," but
      only in the sense that abstract concepts in mathematics are
      intangible compared to those which can be quantified. Economic
      factors, on the other hand, can be measured, at least
      superficially; and international relationships can be verbalized,
      like law, into logical sequences.<br>
      <br>
      We do not claim that we have discovered an infallible way of
      measuring these other factors, or of assigning them precise
      weights in the equation of transition. But we believe we have
      taken their relative importance into account to this extent: we
      have removed them from the category of the "intangible," hence
      scientifically suspect and therefore somehow of secondary
      importance, and brought them out into the realm of the objective.
      The result, we believe, provides a context of realism for the
      discussion of the issues relating to the possible transition to
      peace which up to now has been missing.<br>
      <br>
      This is not to say that we presume to have found the answers we
      were seeking. But we believe that our emphasis on breadth of scope
      has made it at least possible to begin to understand the
      questions.<br>

          DISARMAMENT AND THE ECONOMY</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In this section we shall briefly examine some of the common
      features of the studies that have been published dealing with one
      or another aspect of the expected impact of disarmament on the
      American economy. Whether disarmament is considered as a
      by-product of peace or as its precondition, its effect on the
      national economy will in either case be the most immediately felt
      of its consequences. The quasi-measurable quality of economic
      manifestations has given rise to more detailed speculation in this
      area than in any other.<br>
      <br>
      General agreement prevails in respect to the more important
      economic problems that general disarmament would raise. A short
      survey of these problems, rather than a detailed critique of their
      comparative significance, is sufficient for our purposes in this
      Report.<br>
      <br>
      The first factor is that of size. The "world war industry," as one
      writer has aptly called it, accounts for approximately a tenth of
      the output of the world's total economy. Although this figure is
      subject to fluctuation, the causes of which are themselves subject
      to regional variation, it tends to hold fairly steady. The United
      States, as the world's richest nation, not only accounts for the
      largest single share of this expense, currently upward of $60
      billion a year, but also "...has devoted a higher proportion
      [emphasis added] of its gross national product to its military
      establishment than any other major free world nation. This was
      true even before our increased expenditures in Southeast Asia."
      Plans for economic conversion that minimize the economic magnitude
      of the problem do so only by rationalizing, however persuasively,
      the maintenance of a substantial residual military budget under
      some euphemized classification.<br>
      <br>
      Conversion of military expenditures to other purposes entails a
      number of difficulties. The most serious stems from the degree of
      rigid specialization that characterizes modern war production,
      best exemplified in nuclear and missile technology. This
      constituted no fundamental problem after World War II, nor did the
      question of free-market consumer demand for "conventional" items
      of consumption---those good and services consumers had already
      been conditioned to require. Today's situation is qualitatively
      different in both respects.<br>
      <br>
      This inflexibility is geographical and occupational, as well as
      industrial, a fact which has led most analysts of the economic
      impact of disarmament to focus their attention on phased plans for
      the relocation of war industry personnel and capital installations
      as much as on proposals for developing new patterns of
      consumption. One serious flaw common to such plans is the kind
      called in the natural sciences the "macroscopic error." An
      implicit presumption is made that a total national plan for
      conversion differs from a community program to cope with the
      shutting down of a "defense facility" only in degree. We find no
      reason to believe that this is the case, nor that a general
      enlargement of such local programs, however well thought out in
      terms of housing, occupational retraining, and the like, can be
      applied on a national scale. A national economy can absorb almost
      any number of subsidiary reorganizations within its total limits,
      providing there is no basic change in its own structure. General
      disarmament, which would require such basic changes, lends itself
      to no valid smaller-scale analogy.<br>
      <br>
      Even more questionable are the models proposed for the retaining
      labor for non=armaments occupations. Putting aside for the moment
      the unsolved questions dealing with the nature of new distribution
      patterns -- retraining for what? -- the increasingly specialized
      job skills associated with war industry production are further
      depreciated by the accelerating inroads of the industrial
      techniques loosely described as "automation." It is not too much
      to say that general disarmament would require the scrapping of a
      critical proportion of the most highly developed occupational
      specialties in the economy. The political difficulties inherent in
      such an "adjustment" would make the outcries resulting from the
      closing of a few obsolete military and naval installations in 1964
      sound like a whisper.<br>
      <br>
      In general, discussions of the problem of conversion have been
      characterized by an unwillingness to recognize its special
      quality. This is best exemplified by the 1965 report of the Ackley
      Committee. One critic has tellingly pointed out that it blindly
      assumes that "...nothing in the arms economy -- neither its size,
      nor its geographical concentration, nor its highly specialized
      nature, nor the peculiarities of its market, nor the special
      nature of much of its labor force -- endows it with any uniqueness
      when the necessary time of adjustment comes."<br>
      <br>
      Let us assume, however, despite the lack of evidence that a viable
      program for conversion can be developed in the framework of the
      existing economy, that the problems noted above can be solved.
      What proposals have been offered for utilizing the productive
      capabilities that disarmament would presumably release?<br>
      <br>
      The most common held theory is simply that general economic
      reinvestment would absorb the greater part of these capabilities.
      Even though it is now largely taken for granted (and even by
      today's equivalent of traditional laissez-faire economists) that
      unprecedented government assistance (and concomitant government
      control) will be needed to solve the "structural" problems of
      transition, a general attitude of confidence prevails that new
      consumption patterns will take up the slack. What is less clear is
      the nature of these patterns.<br>
      <br>
      One school of economists has it that these patterns will develop
      on their own. It envisages the equivalent of the arms budget being
      returned, under careful control, to the consumer, in the form of
      tax cuts. Another, recognizing the undeniable need for increased
      "consumption" in what is generally considered the public sector of
      the economy, stresses vastly increased government spending in such
      areas of national concern as health, education, mass
      transportation, low-cost housing, water supply, control of the
      physical environment, and, stated generally, "poverty."<br>
      <br>
      The mechanisms proposed for controlling the transition to an
      arms-free economy are also traditional--changes in both sides of
      the federal budget, manipulation of interest rates, etc. We
      acknowledge the undeniable value of fiscal tools in a normal
      cyclical economy, where they provide leverage to accelerate or
      brake an existing trend. Their more committed proponents, however,
      tend to lose sight of the fact that there is a limit to the power
      of these devices to influence fundamental economic forces. They
      can provide new incentives in the economy, but they cannot in
      themselves transform the production of a billion dollars' worth of
      missiles a year to the equivalent in food, clothing, prefabricated
      houses, or television sets. At bottom, they reflect the economy;
      they do not motivate it.<br>
      <br>
      More sophisticated, and less sanguine, analysts contemplate the
      diversion of the arms budget to a non-military system equally
      remote from the market economy. What the "pyramid-builders"
      frequently suggest is the expansion of space-research programs to
      the dollar level of current expenditures. This approach has the
      superficial merit of reducing the size of the problem of
      transferability of resources, but introduces other difficulties,
      which we will take up in section 6.<br>
      <br>
      Without singling out any one of the several major studies of the
      expected impact of disarmament on the economy for special
      criticism, we can summarize our objections to them in general
      terms as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. No proposed program for economic conversion to disarmament
      sufficiently takes into account the unique magnitude of the
      required adjustments it would entail.<br>
      <br>
      2. Proposals to transform arms production into a beneficent scheme
      of public works are more the products of wishful thinking than of
      realistic understanding of the limits of our existing economic
      system.<br>
      <br>
      3. Fiscal and monetary measures are inadequate as controls for the
      process of transition to an arms-free economy.<br>
      <br>
      4. Insufficient attention has been paid to the political
      acceptability of the objectives of the proposed conversion models,
      as well as of the political means to be employed in effectuating a
      transition.<br>
      <br>
      5. No serious consideration has been given, in any proposed
      conversion plan, to the fundamental nonmilitary function of war
      and armaments in modern society, nor has any explicit attempt been
      made to devise a viable substitute for it. This criticism will be
      developed in sections 5 and 6.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>SECTION 3</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>DISARMAMENT SCENARIOS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      SCENARIOS, as they have come to be called, are hypothetical
      constructions of future events. Inevitably, they are composed of
      varying proportions of established fact, reasonable inference, and
      more or less inspired guesswork. Those which have been suggested
      as model procedures for effectuating international arms control
      and eventual disarmament are necessarily imaginative, although
      closely reasoned; in this respect they resemble the "war games"
      analyses of the Rand Corporation, with which they share a common
      conceptual origin.<br>
      <br>
      All such scenarios that have been seriously put forth imply a
      dependence on bilateral or multilateral agreement between the
      great powers. In general, they call for a progressive phasing out
      of gross armaments, military forces, weapons, and weapons
      technology, coordinated with elaborate matching procedures of
      verification, inspection, and machinery for the settlement of
      international disputes. It should be noted that even proponents of
      unilateral disarmament qualify their proposals with an implied
      requirement of reciprocity, very much in the manner of a scenario
      of graduated response in nuclear war. The advantage of unilateral
      initiative lies in its political value as an expression of good
      faith, as well as in its diplomatic function as a catalyst for
      formal disarmament negotiations.<br>
      <br>
      The READ model for disarmament (developed by the Research Program
      on Economic Adjustments to Disarmament) is typical of these
      scenarios. It is a twelve-year program, divided into three-year
      stages. Each stage includes a separate phase of: reduction of
      armed forces; cutbacks of weapons production, inventories, and
      foreign military bases; development of international inspection
      procedures and control conventions; and the building up of a
      sovereign international disarmament organization. It anticipates a
      net matching decline in U.S. defense expenditures of only somewhat
      more than half the 1965 level, but a necessary redeployment of
      some five-sixths of the defense-dependent labor force.<br>
      <br>
      The economic implications assigned by their authors to various
      disarmament scenarios diverge widely. The more conservative
      models, like that cited above, emphasize economic as well as
      military prudence in postulating elaborate failsafe disarmament
      agencies, which themselves require expenditures substantially
      substituting for those of the displaced war industries. Such
      programs stress the advantages of the smaller economic adjustment
      entailed. Others emphasize, on the contrary, the magnitude (and
      the opposite advantages) of the savings to be achieved from
      disarmament. One widely read analysis estimates the annual cost of
      the inspection function of general disarmament throughout the
      world as only between two and three percent of current military
      expenditures. Both types of plan tend to deal with the anticipated
      problem of economic reinvestment only in the aggregate. We have
      seen no proposed disarmament sequence that correlates the phasing
      out of specific kinds of military spending with specific new forms
      of substitute spending.<br>
      <br>
      Without examining disarmament scenarios in greater detail, we may
      characterize them with these general comments:<br>
      <br>
      1. Given genuine agreement of intent among the great powers, the
      scheduling of arms control and elimination presents no inherently
      insurmountable procedural problems. Any of several proposed
      sequences might serve as the basis for multilateral agreement or
      for the first step in unilateral arms reduction.<br>
      <br>
      2. No major power can proceed with such a program, however, until
      it has developed an economic conversion plan fully integrated with
      each phase of disarmament. No such plan has yet been developed in
      the United States.<br>
      <br>
      3. Furthermore, disarmament scenarios, like proposals for economic
      conversion, make no allowance for the non-military functions of
      war in modern societies, and offer no surrogate for these
      necessary functions. One partial exception is a proposal for the
      "unarmed forces of the United States," which we will consider in
      section 6.<br>

        </b><b>WAR AND PEACE AS SOCIAL SYSTEMS</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      We have dealt only sketchily with proposed disarmament scenarios
      and economic analyses, but the reason for our seemingly casual
      dismissal of so much serious and sophisticated work lies in no
      disrespect for its competence. It is rather a question of
      relevance. To put it plainly, all these programs, however detailed
      and well developed, are abstractions. The most carefully reasoned
      disarmament sequence inevitably reads more like the rules of a
      game or a classroom exercise in logic than like a prognosis of
      real events in the real world. This is as true of today's complex
      proposals as it was of the Abbe de St. Pierre's "Plan for
      Perpetual Peace in Europe" 250 year ago.<br>
      <br>
      Some essential element has clearly been lacking in all these
      schemes. One of our first tasks was to try to bring this missing
      quality into definable focus, and we believe we have succeeded in
      doing so. We find that at the heart of every peace study we have
      examined--from the modest technological proposal (e.g., to convert
      a poison gas plant to the production of "socially useful"
      equivalents) to the most elaborate scenario for universal peace in
      out time -- lies one common fundamental misconception. It is the
      source of the miasma of unreality surrounding such plans. It is
      the incorrect assumption that war, as an institution, is
      subordinate to the social systems it is believed to serve.<br>
      <br>
      This misconception, although profound and far-reaching, is
      entirely comprehensible. Few social clichés are so unquestioningly
      accepted as the notion that war is an extension of diplomacy (or
      of politics, or of the pursuit of economic objectives). If this
      were true, it would be wholly appropriate for economists and
      political theorists to look on the problems of transition to peace
      as essentially mechanical or procedural -- as indeed they do,
      treating them as logistic corollaries of the settlement of
      national conflicts of interest. If this were true, there would be
      no real substance to the difficulties of transition. For it is
      evident that even in today's world there exist no conceivable
      conflict of interest, real or imaginary, between nations or
      between social forces within nations, that cannot be resolved
      without recourse to war -- if such resolution were assigned a
      priority of social value. And if this were true, the economic
      analyses and disarmament proposals we have referred to, plausible
      and well conceived as they may be, would not inspire, as they do,
      an inescapable sense of indirection.<br>
      <br>
      The point is that the cliché is not true, and the problems of
      transition are indeed substantive rather than merely procedural.
      Although was is "used" as an instrument of national and social
      policy, the fact that a society is organized for any degree of
      readiness for war supersedes its political and economic structure.
      War itself is the basic social system, within which other
      secondary modes of social organization conflict or conspire. It is
      the system which has governed most human societies of record, as
      it is today.<br>
      <br>
      Once this is correctly understood, the true magnitude of the
      problems entailed in a transition to peace -- itself a social
      system, but without precedent except in a few simple
      pre-industrial societies -- becomes apparent. At the same time,
      some of the puzzling superficial contradictions of modern
      societies can then be readily rationalized. The "unnecessary" size
      and power of the world war industry; the preeminence of the
      military establishment in every society, whether open or
      concealed; the exemption of military or paramilitary institutions
      from the accepted social and legal standards of behavior required
      elsewhere in the society; the successful operation of the armed
      forces and the armaments producers entirely outside the framework
      of each nation's economic ground rules: these and other
      ambiguities closely associated with the relation- ship of war to
      society are easily clarified, once the priority of war-making
      potential as the principal structuring force in society is
      accepted. Economic systems, political philosophies, and corpora
      jures serve and extend the war system, not vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      It must be emphasized that the precedence of a society's
      war-making potential over its other characteristics is not the
      result of the "threat" presumed to exist at any one time from
      other societies. This is the reverse of the basic situation;
      "throat" against the "national interest" are usually created or
      accelerated to meet the changing needs of the war system. Only in
      comparatively recent times has it been considered politically
      expedient to euphemize war budgets as "defense" requirements. The
      necessity for governments to distinguish between "aggression"
      (bad) and "defense" (good) has been a by-product of rising
      literacy and rapid communication. The distinction is tactical
      only, a concession to the growing inadequacy of ancient
      war-organizing political rationales.<br>
      <br>
      Wars are not "caused" by international conflicts of interest.
      Proper logical sequence would make it more often accurate to say
      that war-making societies require -- and thus bring about -- such
      conflicts. The capacity of a nation to make war expresses the
      greatest social power it can exercise; war-making, active or
      contemplated, is a matter of life and death on the greatest scale
      subject to social control. It should therefore hardly be
      surprising that the military institutions in each society claim
      its highest priorities.<br>
      <br>
      We find further that most of the confusion surrounding the myth
      that war-making is a tool of state policy stems from a general
      misapprehension of the functions of war. In general, these are
      conceived as: to defend a nation from military attack by another,
      or to deter such an attack; to defend or advance a "national
      interest" -- economic, political, ideological; to maintain or
      increase a nation's military power for its own sake. These are the
      visible, or ostensible, functions of war. If there were no others,
      the importance of the war establishment in each society might in
      fact decline to the subordinate level it is believed to occupy.
      And the elimination of war would indeed be the procedural matter
      that the disarmament scenarios suggest.<br>
      <br>
      But there are other, broader, more profoundly felt functions of
      war in modern societies. It is these invisible, or implied,
      functions that maintain war-readiness as the dominant force in our
      societies. And it is the unwillingness or inability of the writers
      of disarmament scenarios and re-conversion plans to take them into
      account that has so reduced the usefulness of their work, and that
      has made it seem unrelated to the world we know.<br>

        </b><b>THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      As we have indicated, the preeminence of the concept of war as the
      principal organizing force in most societies has been
      insufficiently appreciated. This is also true of its extensive
      effects throughout the many nonmilitary activities of society.
      These effects are less apparent in complex industrial societies
      like our own than in primitive cultures, the activities of which
      can be more easily and fully comprehended.<br>
      <br>
      We propose in this section to examine these nonmilitary, implied,
      and usually invisible functions of war, to the extent that they
      bear on the problems of transition to peace for our society. The
      military, or ostensible, function of the war system requires no
      elaboration; it serves simply to defend or advance the "national
      interest" by means of organized violence. It is often necessary
      for a national military establishment to create a need for its
      unique powers -- to maintain the franchise, so to speak. And a
      healthy military apparatus requires "exercise," by whatever
      rationale seems expedient, to prevent its atrophy.<br>
      <br>
      The nonmilitary functions of the war system are more basic. They
      exist not merely to justify themselves but to serve broader social
      purposes. If and when war is eliminated, the military functions it
      has served will end with it. But its nonmilitary functions will
      not. It is essential, therefore, that we understand their
      significance before we can reasonably expect to evaluate whatever
      institutions may be proposed to replace them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ECONOMIC</b><br>
      <br>
      The production of weapons of mass destruction has always been
      associated with economic "waste." The term is pejorative, since it
      implies a failure of function. But no human activity can properly
      be considered wasteful if it achieves its contextual objective.
      The phrase "wasteful but necessary," applied not only to war
      expenditures but to most of the "unproductive" commercial
      activities of our society, is a contradiction in terms. "...The
      attacks that have since the time of Samuel's criticism of King
      Saul been leveled against military expenditures as waste may well
      have concealed or misunderstood the point that some kinds of waste
      may have a larger social utility."<br>
      <br>
      In the case of military "waste," there is indeed a larger social
      utility. It derives from the fact that the "wastefulness" of war
      production is exercised entirely outside the framework of the
      economy of supply and demand. As such, it provides the only
      critically large segment of the total economy that is subject to
      complete and arbitrary central control. If modern industrial
      societies can be defined as those which have developed the
      capacity to produce more than is required for their economic
      survival (regardless of the equities of distribution of goods
      within them), military spending can be said to furnish the only
      balance wheel with sufficient inertia to stabilize the advance of
      their economies. The fact that war is "wasteful" is what enables
      it to serve this function. And the faster the economy advances,
      the heavier this balance wheel must be.<br>
      <br>
      This function is often viewed, over-simply, as a device for the
      control of surpluses. One writer on the subject puts it this way:
      "Why is war so wonderful? Because it creates artificial
      demand...the only kind of artificial demand, moreover, that does
      not raise any political issues: war, and only war, solves the
      problem of inventory." The reference here is to shooting war, but
      it applies equally to the general war economy as well. "It is
      generally agreed," concludes, more cautiously, the report of a
      panel set up by the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
      "that the greatly expanded public sector since World War II,
      resulting from heavy defense expenditures, has provided additional
      protection against depressions, since this sector is not
      responsive to con- traction in the private sector and has provided
      a sort of buffer or balance wheel in the economy."<br>
      <br>
      The principal economic function of war, in our view, is that it
      provides just such a flywheel. It is not to be confused in
      function with the various forms of fiscal control, none of which
      directly engages vast numbers of control, none of which directly
      engages vast numbers of men and units of production. It is not to
      be confused with massive government expenditures in social welfare
      programs; once initiated, such programs normally become integral
      parts of the general economy and are no longer subject to
      arbitrary control.<br>
      <br>
      But even in the context of the general civilian economy war cannot
      be considered wholly "wasteful." Without a long-established war
      economy, and without its frequent eruption into large-scale
      shooting war, most of the major industrial advances known to
      history, beginning with the development of iron, could never have
      taken place. Weapons technology structures the economy. According
      to the writer cited above, "Nothing is more ironic or revealing
      about our society than the fact that hugely destructive war is a
      very progressive force in it... War production is progressive
      because it is production that would not otherwise have taken
      place. (It is not so widely appreciated, for example, that the
      civilian standard of living rose during World War II.)" This is
      not "ironic or revealing," but essentially a simple statement of
      fact.<br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted that the war production has a dependably
      stimulating effect outside itself. Far from constituting a
      "wasteful" drain on the economy, war spending, considered
      pragmatically, has been a consistently positive factor in the rise
      of gross national product and of individual productivity. A former
      Secretary of the Army has carefully phrased it for public
      consumption thus: "If there is, as I suspect there is, a direct
      relation between the stimulus of large defense spending and a
      substantially increased rate of growth of gross national product,
      it quite simply follows that defense spending per se might be
      countenanced on economic grounds alone [emphasis added] as a
      stimulator of the national metabolism." Actually, the fundamental
      nonmilitary utility of war in the economy is far more widely
      acknowledged than the scarcity of such affirmations as that quoted
      above would suggest.<br>
      <br>
      But negatively phrased public recognitions of the importance of
      war to the general economy abound. The most familiar example is
      the effect of "peace threats" on the stock market, e.g., "Wall
      Street was shaken yesterday by news of an apparent peace feeler
      from North Vietnam, but swiftly recovered its composure after
      about an hour of sometimes indiscriminate selling." Savings banks
      solicit deposits with similar cautionary slogans, e.g., "If peace
      breaks out, will you be ready for it?" A more subtle case in point
      was the recent refusal of the Department of Defense to permit the
      West German government to substitute nonmilitary goods for
      unwanted armaments in its purchase commitments from the United
      States; the decisive consideration was that the German purchases
      should not affect the general (nonmilitary) economy. Other
      incidental examples are to be found in the pressures brought to
      bear on the Department when it announces plans to close down an
      obsolete facility (as a "wasteful" form of "waste"). and in the
      usual coordination of stepped-up military activities (as in
      Vietnam in 1965) with dangerously rising unemployment rates.<br>
      <br>
      Although we do not imply that a substitute for war in the economy
      cannot be devised, no combination of techniques for controlling
      employment, production, and consumption has yet been tested that
      can remotely compare to it in effectiveness. It is, and has been,
      the essential economic stabilizer of modern societies.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>POLITICAL</b><br>
      <br>
      The political functions of war have been up to now even more
      critical to social stability. It is not surprising, nevertheless,
      that discussions of economic conversion for peace tend to fall
      silent on the matter of political implementation, and that
      disarmament scenarios, often sophisticated in their weighing of
      international political factors, tend to disregard the political
      functions of the war system within individual societies.<br>
      <br>
      These functions are essentially organizational. First of all, the
      existence of a society as a political "nation" requires as part of
      its definition an attitude of relationship toward other "nations."
      This is what we usually call a foreign policy. But a nation's
      foreign policy can have no substance if it lacks the means of
      enforcing its attitude toward other nations. It can do this in a
      credible manner only if it implies the threat of maximum political
      organization for this purpose--which is to say that it is
      organized to some degree for war. War, then, as we have defined it
      to include all national activities that recognize the possibility
      of armed conflict, is itself the defining element of any nation's
      existence vis-a-vis any other nation. Since it is historically
      axiomatic that the existence of any form of weaponry insures its
      use, we have used the work "peace" as virtually synonymous with
      disarmament. By the same token, "war" is virtually synonymous with
      nationhood. The elimination of war implies the inevitable
      elimination of national sovereignty and the traditional
      nation-state.<br>
      <br>
      The war system not only has been essential to the existence of
      nations as independent political entities, but has been equally
      indispensable to their stable internal political structure.
      Without it, no government has ever been able to obtain
      acquiescence in its "legitimacy," or right to rule its society.
      The possibility of war provides the sense of external necessity
      without which nor government can long remain in power. The
      historical record reveals one instance after another where the
      failure of a regime to maintain the credibility of a war threat
      led to its dissolution, by the forces of private interest, or
      reactions to social injustice, or of other disintegrative
      elements. The organization of a society for the possibility of war
      is its principal political stabilizer. It is ironic that this
      primary function of war has been generally recognized by
      historians only where it has been expressly acknowledged--in the
      pirate societies of the great conquerors.<br>
      <br>
      The basic authority of a modern state over its people resides in
      its war powers. (There is, in fact, good reason to believe that
      codified law had its origins in the rules of conduct established
      by military victors for dealing with the defeated enemy, which
      were later adapted to apply to all subject populations.) On a
      day-to-day basis, it is represented by the institution of police,
      armed organizations charged expressly with dealing with "internal
      enemies" in a military manner. Like the conventional "external"
      military, the police are also substantially exempt from many
      civilian legal restraints on their social behavior. In some
      countries, the artificial distinction between police and other
      military forces does not exist. On the long-term basis, a
      government's emergency war powers -- inherent in the structure of
      even the most libertarian of nations -- define the most
      significant aspect of the relation between state and citizen.<br>
      <br>
      In advanced modern democratic societies, the war system has
      provided political leaders with another political-economic
      function of increasing importance: it has served as the last great
      safeguard against the elimination of necessary social classes. As
      economic productivity increases to a level further and further
      above that of minimum subsistence, it becomes more and more
      difficult for a society to maintain distribution patterns insuring
      the existence of "hewers of wood and drawers of water". The
      further progress of automation can be expected to differentiate
      still more sharply between "superior" workers and what Ricardo
      called "menials," while simultaneously aggravating the problem of
      maintaining an unskilled labor supply.<br>
      <br>
      The arbitrary nature of war expenditures and of other military
      activities make them ideally suited to control these essential
      class relationships. Obviously, if the war system were to be
      discarded, new political machinery would be needed at once to
      serve this vital sub-function. Until it is developed, the
      continuance of the war system must be assured, if for no other
      reason, among others, than to preserve whatever quality and degree
      of poverty a society requires as an incentive, as well as to
      maintain the stability of its internal organization of power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOCIOLOGICAL</b><br>
      <br>
      Under this heading, we will examine a nexus of functions served by
      the war system that affect human behavior in society. In general,
      they are broader in application and less susceptible to direct
      observation than the economic and political factors previously
      considered.<br>
      <br>
      The most obvious of these functions is the time-honored use of
      military institutions to provide antisocial elements with an
      acceptable role in the social structure. The disintegrative,
      unstable social movements loosely described as "fascist" have
      traditionally taken root in societies that have lacked adequate
      military or paramilitary outlets to meet the needs of these
      elements. This function has been critical in periods of rapid
      change. The danger signals are easy to recognize, even though the
      stigmata bear different names at different times. The current
      euphemistic clichés --"juvenile delinquency" and "alienation" --
      have had their counterparts in every age. In earlier days these
      conditions were dealt with directly by the military without the
      complications of due process, usually through press gangs or
      outright enslavement. But it is not hard to visualize, for
      example, the degree of social disruption that might have taken
      place in the United States during the last two decades if the
      problem of the socially disaffected of the post-World War II
      period had been foreseen and effectively met. The younger, and
      more dangerous, of these hostile social groupings have been kept
      under control by the Selective Service System.<br>
      <br>
      This system and its analogues elsewhere furnish remarkably clear
      examples of disguised military utility. Informed persons in this
      country have never accepted the official rationale for a peacetime
      draft -- military necessity, preparedness, etc. -- as worthy of
      serious consideration. But what has gained credence among
      thoughtful men is the rarely voiced, less easily refuted,
      proposition that the institution of military service has a
      "patriotic" priority in our society that must be maintained for
      its own sake. Ironically, the simplistic official justification
      for selective service comes closer to the mark, once the
      non-military functions of military institutions are understood. As
      a control device over the hostile, nihilistic, and potentially
      unsettling elements of a society in transition, the draft can
      again be defended, and quite convincingly, as a "military"
      necessity.<br>
      <br>
      Nor can it be considered a coincidence that overt military
      activity, and thus the level of draft calls, tend to follow the
      major fluctuations in the unemployment rate in the lower age
      groups. This rate, in turn, is a time-tested herald of social
      discontent. It must be noted also that the armed forces in every
      civilization have provided the principal state-supported haven for
      what we now call the "unemployable." The typical European standing
      army (of fifty years ago) consisted of "...troops unfit for
      employment in commerce, industry, or agriculture, led by officers
      unfit to practice any legitimate profession or to conduct a
      business enterprise." This is still largely true, if less
      apparent. In a sense, this function of the military as the
      custodian of the economically or culturally deprived was the
      forerunner of most contemporary civilian social-welfare programs,
      from the W.P.A. to various forms of "socialized" medicine and
      social security. It is interesting that liberal sociologists
      currently proposing to use the Selective Service System as a
      medium of cultural upgrading of the poor consider this a novel
      application of military practice.<br>
      <br>
      Although it cannot be said absolutely that such critical measures
      of social control as the draft require a military rationale, no
      modern society has yet been willing to risk experimentation with
      any other kind. Even during such periods of comparatively simple
      social crisis as the so-called Great Depression of the 1930s, it
      was deemed prudent by the government to invest minor make-work
      projects, like the "Civilian" Conservation Corps, with a military
      character, and to place the more ambitious National Recovery
      Administration under the direction of a professional army officer
      at its inception. Today, at least one small Northern European
      country, plagued with uncontrollable unrest among its "alienated
      youth," is considering the expansion of its armed forces, despite
      the problem of making credible the expansion of a non-existent
      external threat.<br>
      <br>
      Sporadic efforts have been made to promote general recognition of
      broad national values free of military connotation, but they have
      been ineffective. For example, to enlist public support of even
      such modest programs of social adjustment as "fighting inflation"
      or "maintaining physical fitness" it has been necessary for the
      government to utilize a patriotic (i.e. military) incentive. It
      sells "defense" bonds and it equates health with military
      preparedness. This is not surprising; since the concept of
      "nationhood" implies readiness for war, a "national" program must
      do likewise.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the war system provides the basic motivation for
      primary social organization. In so doing, it reflects on the
      societal level the incentives of individual human behavior. The
      most important of these, for social purposes, is the individual
      psychological rationale for allegiance to a society and its
      values. Allegiance requires a cause; a cause requires an enemy.
      This much is obvious; the critical point is that the enemy that
      defines the cause must seem genuinely formidable. Roughly
      speaking, the presumed power of the "enemy" sufficient to warrant
      an individual sense of allegiance to a society must be
      proportionate to the size and complexity of the society. Today, of
      course, that power must be one of unprecedented magnitude and
      frightfulness.<br>
      <br>
      It follows, from the patterns of human behavior, that the
      credibility of a social "enemy" demands similarly a readiness of
      response in proportion to its menace. In a broad social context,
      "an eye for an eye" still characterizes the only acceptable
      attitude toward a presumed threat of aggression, despite contrary
      religious and moral precepts governing personal conduct. The
      remoteness of personal decision from social consequence in a
      modern society makes it easy for its members to maintain this
      attitude without being aware of it. A recent example is the war in
      Vietnam; a less recent one was the bombing of Hiroshima and
      Nagasaki. In each case, the extent and gratuitousness of the
      slaughter were abstracted into political formulae by most
      Americans, once the proposition that the victims were "enemies"
      was established. The war system makes such an abstracted response
      possible in nonmilitary contexts as well. A conventional example
      of this mechanism is the inability of most people to connect, let
      us say, the starvation of millions in India with their own past
      conscious political decision-making. Yet the sequential logic
      linking a decision to restrict grain production in America with an
      eventual famine in Asia is obvious, unambiguous, and unconcealed.<br>
      <br>
      What gives the war system its preeminent role in social
      organization, as elsewhere, is its unmatched authority over life
      and death. It must be emphasized again that the war system is not
      a mere social extension of the presumed need for individual human
      violence, but itself in turn serves to rationalize most
      nonmilitary killing. It also provides the precedent for the
      collective willingness of members of a society to pay a blood
      price for institutions far less central to social organization
      that war. To take a handy example... "rather than accept speed
      limits of twenty miles an hour we prefer to let automobiles kill
      forty thousand people a year." A Rand analyst puts it in more
      general terms and less rhetorically: "I am sure that there is, in
      effect, a desirable level of automobile accidents---desirable,
      that is, from a broad point of view; in the sense that it is a
      necessary concomitant of things of greater value to society." The
      point may seem too obvious for iteration, but it is essential to
      an understanding of the important motivational function of war as
      a model for collective sacrifice.<br>
      <br>
      A brief look at some defunct pre=modern societies is instructive.
      One of the most noteworthy features common to the larger, more
      complex, and more successful of ancient civilizations was their
      widespread use of the blood sacrifice. If one were to limit
      consideration to those cultures whose regional hegemony was so
      complete that the prospect of "war" had become virtually
      inconceivable -- as was the case with several of the great
      pre-Columbian societies of the Western Hemisphere -- it would be
      found that some form of ritual killing occupied a position of
      paramount social importance in each. Invariably, the ritual was
      invested with mythic or religious significance; as will all
      religious and totemic practice, however, the ritual masked a
      broader and more important social function.<br>
      <br>
      In these societies, the blood sacrifice served the purpose of
      maintaining a vestigial "earnest" of the society's capability and
      willingness to make war -- i.e., kill and be killed -- in the
      event that some mystical -- i.e., unforeseen -- circumstance were
      to give rise to the possibility. That the "earnest" was not an
      adequate substitute for genuine military organization when the
      unthinkable enemy, such as the Spanish conquistadores, actually
      appeared on the scene in no way negates the function of the
      ritual. It was primarily, if not exclusively, a symbolic reminder
      that war had once been the central organizing force of the
      society, and that this condition might recur.<br>
      <br>
      It does not follow that a transition to total peace in modern
      societies would require the use of this model, even in less
      "barbaric" guise. But the historical analogy serves as a reminder
      that a viable substitute for war as a social system cannot be a
      mere symbolic charade. It must involve risk of real personal
      destruction, and on a scale consistent with the size and
      complexity of modern social systems. Credibility is the key.
      Whether the substitute is ritual in nature or functionally
      substantive, unless it provides a believable life- and-death
      threat it will not serve the socially organizing function of war.<br>
      <br>
      The existence of an accepted external menace, then, is essential
      to social cohesiveness as well as to the acceptance of political
      authority. The menace must be believable, it must be of a
      magnitude consistent with the complexity of the society
      threatened, and it must appear, at least, to affect the entire
      society.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>ECOLOGICAL</b><br>
      <br>
      Men, like all other animals, is subject to the continuing process
      of adapting to the limitations of his environment. But the
      principal mechanism he has utilized for this purpose is unique
      among living creatures. To forestall the inevitable historical
      cycles of inadequate food supply, post-Neolithic man destroys
      surplus members of his own species by organized warfare.<br>
      <br>
      Ethologists have often observed that the organized slaughter of
      members of their own species is virtually unknown among other
      animals. Man's special propensity to kill his own kind (shared to
      a limited degree with rats) may be attributed to his inability to
      adapt anachronistic patterns of survival (like primitive hunting)
      to his development of "civilizations" in which these patterns
      cannot be effectively sublimated. It may be attributed to other
      causes that have been suggested, such as a maladapted "territorial
      instinct," etc. Nevertheless, it exists and its social expression
      in war constitutes a bio- logical control of his relationship to
      his natural environment that is peculiar to man alone.<br>
      <br>
      War has served to help assure the survival of the human species.
      But as an evolutionary device to improve it, war is almost
      unbelievably inefficient. With few exceptions, the selective
      processes of other living creatures promote both specific survival
      and genetic improvement. When a conventionally adaptive animal
      faces one of its periodic crises of insufficiency, it is the
      "inferior" members of the species that normally disappear. An
      animal's social response to such a crisis may take the form of a
      mass migration, during which the weak fall by the wayside. Or it
      may follow the dramatic and more efficient pattern of lemming
      societies, in which the weaker members voluntarily disperse,
      leaving available food supplies for the stronger. In either case,
      the strong survive and the weak fall. In human societies, those
      who fight and die in wars for survival are in general its
      biologically stronger members. This is natural selection in
      reverse.<br>
      <br>
      The regressive genetic effort of war has been often noted and
      equally often deplored, even when it confuses biological and
      cultural factors. The disproportionate loss of the biologically
      stronger remains inherent in traditional warfare. It serves to
      underscore the fact that survival of the species, rather than its
      improvement, is the fundamental purpose of natural selection, if
      it can be said to have a purpose, just as it is the basic premise
      of this study.<br>
      <br>
      But as the polemologist Gaston Bouthoul has pointed out, other
      institutions that were developed to serve this ecological function
      have proved even less satisfactory. (They include such established
      forms as these: infanticide, practiced chiefly in ancient and
      primitive societies; sexual mutilation; monasticism; forced
      emigration; extensive capital punishment, as in old China and
      eighteenth-century England; and other similar, usually localized,
      practices.)<br>
      <br>
      Man's ability to increase his productivity of the essentials of
      physical life suggests that the need for protection against
      cyclical famine may be nearly obsolete. It has thus tended to
      reduce the apparent importance of the basic ecological function of
      war, which is generally disregarded by peace theorists. Two
      aspects of its remain especially relevant, however. The first is
      obvious: current rates of population growth, compounded by
      environmental threat to chemical and other contaminants, may well
      bring about a new crisis of insufficiency. If so, it is likely to
      be one of unprecedented global magnitude, not merely regional or
      temporary. Conventional methods of warfare would almost surely
      prove inadequate, in this event, to reduce the consuming
      population to a level consistent with survival of the species.<br>
      <br>
      The second relevant factor is the efficiency of modern methods of
      mass destruction. Even if their use is not required to meet a
      world population crisis, they offer, perhaps paradoxically, the
      first opportunity in the history of man to halt the regressive
      genetic effects of natural selection by war. Nuclear weapons are
      indiscriminate. Their application would bring to an end the dis-
      proportionate destruction of the physically stronger members of
      the species (the "warriors") in periods of war. Whether this
      prospect of genetic gain would offset the unfavorable mutations
      anticipated from post-nuclear radioactivity we have not yet
      determined. What gives the question a bearing on our study is the
      possibility that the determination may yet have to be made.<br>
      <br>
      Another secondary ecological trend bearing on projected population
      growth is the regressive effect of certain medical advances.
      Pestilence, for example, is no longer an important factor in
      population control. The problem of increased life expectancy has
      been aggravated. These advances also pose a potentially more
      sinister problem, in that undesirable genetic traits that were
      formerly self-liquidating are now medically maintained. Many
      diseases that were once fatal at pre-procreational ages are now
      cured; the effect of this development is to perpetuate undesirable
      susceptibilities and mutations. It seems clear that a new
      quasi-eugenic function of war is now in process of formation that
      will have to be taken into account in any transition plan. For the
      time being, the Department of Defense appears to have recognized
      such factors, as has been demonstrated by the planning under way
      by the Rand Corporation to cope with the breakdown in the
      ecological balance anticipated after a thermonuclear war. The
      Department has also begun to stockpile birds, for example, against
      the expected proliferation of radiation-resistant insects, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC</b><br>
      <br>
      The declared order of values in modern societies gives a high
      place to the so-called "creative" activities, and an even higher
      one to those associated with the advance of scientific knowledge.
      Widely held social values can be translated into political
      equivalents, which in turn may bear on the nature of a transition
      to peace. The attitudes of those who hold these values must be
      taken into account in the planning of the transition. The
      dependence, therefore, of cultural and scientific achievement on
      the war system would be an important consideration in a transition
      plan even is such achievement had no inherently necessary social
      function.<br>
      <br>
      Of all the countless dichotomies invented by scholars to account
      for the major differences in art styles and cycles, only one has
      been consistently unambiguous in its application to a variety of
      forms and cultures. However it may be verbalized, the basic
      distinction is this: Is the work war-oriented or is it not? Among
      primitive peoples, the war dance is the most important art form.
      Elsewhere, literature, music, painting, sculpture, and
      architecture that has won lasting acceptance has invariably dealt
      with a theme of war, expressly or implicitly, and has expressed
      the centricity of war to society. The war in question may be
      national conflict, as in Shakespeare plays, Beethoven's music, or
      Goya's paintings, or it may be reflected in the form of religious,
      social, or moral struggle, as in the work of Dante, Rembrandt, and
      Bach. Art that cannot be classified as war-oriented is usually
      described as "sterile," "decadent," and so on. Application of the
      "war standard" to works of art may often leave room for debate in
      individual cases, but there is no question of its role as the
      fundamental determinant of cultural values. Aesthetic and moral
      standards have a common anthropological origin, in the exaltation
      of bravery, the willingness to kill and risk death in tribal
      warfare.<br>
      <br>
      It is also instructive to note that the character of a society's
      culture has borne a close relationship to its war-making
      potential, in the context of its times. It is no accident that the
      current "cultural explosion" in the United States is taking place
      during an era marked by an unusually rapid advance in weaponry.
      This relationship is more generally recognized than the literature
      on the subject would suggest. For example, many artists and
      writers are now beginning to express concern over the limited
      creative options they envisage in the warless world they think, or
      hope, may be soon upon us. They are currently preparing for this
      possibility by unprecedented experimentation with meaningless
      forms; their interest in recent years has been increasingly
      engaged by the abstract pattern, the gratuitous emotion, the
      random happening, and the unrelated sequence.<br>
      <br>
      The relationship of war to scientific research and discovery is
      more explicit. War is the principal motivational force for the
      development of science at every level, from the abstractly
      conceptual to the narrowly technological. Modern society places a
      high value on "pure" science, but it is historically inescapable
      that all the significant discoveries that have been made about the
      natural world have been inspired by the real or imaginary military
      necessities of their epochs. The consequences of the discoveries
      have indeed gone far afield, but war has always provided the basic
      incentive.<br>
      <br>
      Beginning with the development of iron and steel, and proceeding
      through the discoveries of the laws of motion and thermodynamics
      to the age of the atomic particle, the synthetic polymer, and the
      space capsule, no important scientific advance has not been at
      least indirectly initiated by an implicit requirement of weaponry.
      More prosaic examples include the transistor radio (an outgrowth
      of military communications requirements), the assembly line (from
      Civil War firearms needs), the steel-frame building (from the
      steel battleship), the canal lock, and so on. A typical adaptation
      can be seen in a device as modest as the common lawnmower; it
      developed from the revolving scythe devised by Leonardo da Vinci
      to precede a horse-powered vehicle into enemy ranks.<br>
      <br>
      The most direct relationship can be found in medical technology.
      For example, a giant "walking machine," and amplifier of body
      motions invented for military use in difficult terrain, is now
      making it possible for many previously con- fined to wheelchairs
      to walk. The Vietnam war alone has led to spectacular improvements
      in amputation procedures, blood-handling techniques, and surgical
      logistics. It has stimulated new large-scale research on malaria
      and other typical parasite diseases; it is hard to estimate how
      long this could otherwise have been delayed, despite its enormous
      nonmilitary importance to nearly half the world's population.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>OTHER</b><br>
      <br>
      We have elected to omit from our discussion of the nonmilitary
      functions of war those we do not consider critical to a transition
      program. This is not to say they are unimportant, however, but
      only that they appear to present no special problems for the
      organization of a peace-oriented social system. They include the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      War as a general social release. This is a psychosocial function,
      serving the same purpose for a society as do the holiday, the
      celebration, and the orgy for the individual---the release and
      redistribution of undifferentiated tensions. War provides for the
      periodic necessary readjustment of standards of social behavior
      (the "moral climate") and for the dissipation of general boredom,
      one of the most consistently undervalued and unrecognized of
      social phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      War as a generational stabilizer. This psychological function,
      served by other behavior patterns in other animals, enables the
      physically deteriorating older generation to maintain its control
      of the younger, destroying it if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      War as an ideological clarifier. The dualism that characterized
      the traditional dialectic of all branches of philosophy and of
      stable political relationships stems from war as the prototype of
      conflict. Except for secondary considerations, there cannot be, to
      put it as simply as possible, more than two sides to a question
      because there cannot be more than two sides to a war.<br>
      <br>
      War as the basis for the inter-national understanding. Before the
      development of modern communications, the strategic requirements
      of war provided the only substantial incentive for the enrichment
      of one national culture with the achievements of another. Although
      this is still the case in many inter-national relationships, the
      function is obsolescent.<br>
      <br>
      We have also forgone extended characterization of those functions
      we assume to be widely and explicitly recognized. An obvious
      example is the role of war as controller of the quality and degree
      of unemployment. This is more than an economic and political
      sub-function; its sociological, cultural, and ecological aspects
      are also important, although often teleonomic. But none affect the
      general problem of substitution. The same is true of certain other
      functions; those we have included are sufficient to define the
      scope of the problem.<br>
      <br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
      <div align="center"><b>SECTION 6</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      By now it should be clear that the most detailed and comprehensive
      master plan for a transition to world peace will remain academic
      if it fails to deal forthrightly with the problem of the critical
      nonmilitary functions of war. The social needs they serve are
      essential; if the war system no longer exists to meet them,
      substitute institutions will have to be established for the
      purpose. These surrogates must be "realistic," which is to say of
      a scope and nature that can be conceived and implemented in the
      context of present-day social capabilities. This is not the truism
      it may appear to be; the requirements of radical social change
      often reveal the distinction between a most conservative
      projection and a wildly utopian scheme to be fine indeed.<br>
      <br>
      In this section we will consider some possible substitutes for
      these functions. Only in rare instances have they been put forth
      for the purposes which concern us here, but we see no reason to
      limit ourselves to proposals that address themselves explicitly to
      the problem as we have outlined it. We will disregard the
      ostensible, or military, functions of war; it is a premise of this
      study that the transition to peace implies absolutely that they
      will no longer exist in any relevant sense. We will also disregard
      the non-critical functions exemplified at the end of the preceding
      section.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ECONOMIC</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Economic surrogates for war must meet two principal criteria. They
      must be "wasteful," in the common sense of the word, and they must
      operate outside the normal supply-demand system. A corollary that
      should be obvious is that the magnitude of the waste must be
      sufficient to meet the needs of a particular society. An economy
      as advanced and complex as our own requires the planned average
      annual destruction of not less than 10 percent of gross national
      pro- duct if it is effectively to fulfill its stabilizing
      function. When the mass of a balance wheel is inadequate to the
      power it is intended to control, its effect can be self-defeating,
      as with a runaway locomotive. The analogy, though crude, is
      especially apt for the American economy, as our record of cyclical
      depressions shows. All have taken place during periods of grossly
      inadequate military spending.<br>
      <br>
      Those few economic conversion programs which by implication
      acknowledge the nonmilitary economic function of war (at least to
      some extent) tend to assume that so-called social-welfare
      expenditures will fill the vacuum created by the disappearance of
      military spending. When one considers the backlog of un- finished
      business---proposed but still unexecuted---in this field, the
      assump- tion seems plausible. Let us examine briefly the following
      list, which is more or less typical of general social welfare
      programs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HEALTH<br>
        <br>
      </b>Drastic expansion of medical research, education, and training
      facilities; hospital and clinic construction; the general
      objective of complete government-guaranteed health care for all,
      at a level consistent with current developments in medical
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EDUCATION</b><br>
      <br>
      The equivalent of the foregoing in teacher training; schools and
      libraries; the drastic upgrading of standards, with the general
      objective of making available for all an attainable educational
      goal equivalent to what is now considered a professional degree.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOUSING</b><br>
      <br>
      Clean, comfortable, safe, and spacious living space for all, at
      the level now enjoyed by about 15 percent of the population in
      this country (less in most others).<br>
      <br>
      <b>TRANSPORTATION</b><br>
      <br>
      The establishment of a system of mass public transportation making
      it possible for all to travel to and from areas of work and
      recreation quickly, comfortably, and conveniently, and to travel
      privately for pleasure rather than necessity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The development and protection of water supplies, forests, parks,
      and other natural resources; the elimination of chemical and
      bacterial contaminants from air, water, and soil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>POVERTY<br>
        <br>
      </b>The genuine elimination of poverty, defined by a standard
      consistent with current economic productivity, by means of a
      guaranteed annual income or whatever system of distribution will
      best assure its achievement.<br>
      <br>
      This is only a sampler of the more obvious domestic social welfare
      items, and we have listed it in a deliberately broad, perhaps
      extravagant, manner. In the past, such a vague and
      ambitious-sounding "program" would have been dismissed out of
      hand, without serious consideration; it would clearly have been,
      prima facie, far too costly, quite apart from its political
      implications. Our objective to it, on the other hand, could hardly
      be more contradictory. As an economic substitute for war, it is
      inadequate because it would be far too cheap.<br>
      <br>
      If this seems paradoxical, it must be remembered that up to now
      all proposed social-welfare expenditures have had to be measured
      within the war economy, not as a replacement for it. The old
      slogan about a battleship or an ICBM costing as much as x
      hospitals or y schools or z homes takes on a very different
      meaning if there are to be more battleships or ICBM's.<br>
      <br>
      Since the list is general, we have elected to forestall the
      tangential controversy that surrounds arbitrary cost projections
      by offering no individual cost estimates. But the maximum program
      that could be physically effected along the lines indicated could
      approach the established level of military spending only for a
      limited time - -in our opinion, subject to a detailed
      cost-and-feasibility analysis, less than ten years. In this short
      period, at this rate, the major goals of the program would have
      been achieved. Its capital-investment phase would have been
      completed, and it would have established a permanent comparatively
      modest level of annual operating cost -- within the framework of
      the general economy.<br>
      <br>
      Here is the basic weakness of the social-welfare surrogate. On the
      short-term basis, a maximum program of this sort could replace a
      normal military spending program, provided it was designed, like
      the military model, to be subject to arbitrary control. Public
      housing starts, for example, or the development of modern medical
      centers might be accelerated or halted from time to time, as the
      requirements of a stable economy might dictate. But on the
      long-term basis, social-welfare spending, no matter how often
      redefined, would necessarily become an integral, accepted part of
      the economy, of no more value as a stabilizer than the automobile
      industry or old age and survivors' insurance. Apart from whatever
      merit social-welfare programs are deemed to have for their own
      sake, their function as a substitute for war in the economy would
      thus be self-liquidating. They might serve, however, as expedients
      pending the development of more durable substitute measures.<br>
      <br>
      Another economic surrogate that has been proposed is a series of
      giant "space research" programs. These have already demonstrated
      their utility in more modest scale within the military economy.
      What has been implied, although not yet expressly put forth, is
      the development of a long-range sequence of space-research
      projects with largely unattainable goals. This kind of program
      offers several advantages lacking in the social welfare model.
      First, it is unlikely to phase itself out, regardless of the
      predictable "surprises" science has in store for us: the universe
      is too big. In the event some individual project unexpectedly
      succeeds there would be no dearth of substitute problems. For
      example, if colonization of the moon proceeds on schedule, it
      could then become "necessary" to establish a beachhead on Mars or
      Jupiter, and so on. Second, it need be no more dependent on the
      general supply-demand economy than its military prototype. Third,
      it lends itself extraordinarily well to arbitrary control.<br>
      <br>
      Space research can be viewed as the nearest modern equivalent yet
      devised to the pyramid-building, and similar ritualistic
      enterprises, of ancient societies. It is true that the scientific
      value of the space program, even of what has already been
      accomplished, is substantial on its own terms. But current
      programs are absurdly obviously disproportionate, in the
      relationship of the knowledge sought to the expenditures
      committed. All but a small fraction of the space budget, measured
      by the standards of comparable scientific objectives, must be
      charged de facto to the military economy. Future space research,
      projected as a war surrogate, would further research, projected as
      a war surrogate, would further reduce the "scientific" rationale
      of its budget to a minuscule percentage indeed. As a purely
      economic substitute for war, therefore, extension of the space
      program warrants serious consideration.<br>
      <br>
      In Section 3 we pointed out that certain disarmament models, which
      we called conservative, postulated extremely expensive and
      elaborate inspection systems. Would it be possible to extend and
      institutionalize such systems to the point where they might serve
      as economic surrogates for war spending? The organization of
      failsafe inspection machinery could well be ritualized in a manner
      similar to that of established military processes. "Inspection
      teams" might be very like weapons. Inflating the inspection budget
      to military scale presents no difficulty. The appeal of this kind
      of scheme lies in the comparative ease of transition between two
      parallel systems.<br>
      <br>
      The "elaborate inspection" surrogate is fundamentally fallacious,
      however. Although it might be economically useful, as well as
      politically necessary, during the disarmament transition, it would
      fail as a substitute for the economic function of war for one
      simple reason. Peace-keeping inspection is part of a war system,
      not of a peace system. It implies the possibility of weapons
      maintenance or manufacture, which could not exist in a world at
      peace as here defined. Massive inspection also implies sanctions,
      and thus war-readiness.<br>
      <br>
      The same fallacy is more obvious in plans to create a patently
      useless "defense conversion" apparatus. The long-discredited
      proposal to build "total" civil defense facilities is one example;
      another is the plan to establish a giant antimissile missile
      complex (Nike-X, et al.). These programs, of course, are economic
      rather than strategic. Nevertheless, they are not substitutes for
      military spending but merely different forms of it.<br>
      <br>
      A more sophisticated variant is the proposal to establish the
      "Unarmed Forces" of the United States. This would conveniently
      maintain the entire institutional military structure, redirecting
      it essentially toward social- welfare activities on a global
      scale. It would be, in effect, a giant military Peace Corps. There
      is nothing inherently unworkable about this plan, and using the
      existing military system to effectuate its own demise is both
      ingenious and convenient. But even on a greatly magnified world
      basis, social-welfare expenditures must sooner or later reenter
      the atmosphere of the normal economy. The practical transitional
      virtues of such a scheme would thus be eventually negated by its
      inadequacy as a permanent economic stabilizer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>POLITICAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The war system makes the stable government of societies possible.
      It does this essentially by providing an external necessity for a
      society to accept political rule. In so doing, it establishes the
      basis for nationhood and the authority of government to control
      its constituents. What other institution or combination of
      programs might serve these functions in its place?<br>
      <br>
      We have already pointed out that the end of the war means the end
      of national sovereignty, and thus the end of nationhood as we know
      it today. But this does not necessarily mean the end of nations in
      the administrative sense, and internal political power will remain
      essential to a stable society. The emerging "nations" of the peace
      epoch must continue to draw political authority from some source.<br>
      <br>
      A number of proposals have been made governing the relations
      between nations after total disarmament; all are basically
      juridical in nature. They contemplate institutions more or less
      like a World Court, or a United Nations, but vested with real
      authority. They may or may not serve their ostensible post-
      military purpose of settling international disputes, but we need
      not discuss that here. None would offer effective external
      pressure on a peace-world nation to organize itself politically.<br>
      <br>
      It might be argued that a well-armed international police force,
      operating under the authority of such a supranational "court,"
      could well serve the function of external enemy. This, however,
      would constitute a military operation, like the inspection schemes
      mentioned, and, like them, would be inconsistent with the premise
      of an end to the war system. It is possible that a variant of the
      "Unarmed Forces" idea might be developed in such a way that its
      "constructive" (i.e., social welfare) activities could be combined
      with an economic "threat" of sufficient size and credibility to
      warrant political organization. Would this kind of threat also be
      contradictory to our basic premise? -- that is, would it be
      inevitably military? Not necessarily, in our view, but we are
      skeptical of its capacity to evoke credibility. Also, the obvious
      destabilizing effect of any global social welfare surrogate on
      politically necessary class relationships would create an entirely
      new set of transition problems at least equal in magnitude.<br>
      <br>
      Credibility, in fact, lies at the heart of the problem of
      developing a political substitute for war. This is where the
      space-race proposals, in many ways so well suited as economic
      substitutes for war, fall short. The most ambitious and
      unrealistic space project cannot of itself generate a believable
      external menace. It has been hotly argued that such a menace would
      offer the "last, best hope of peace," etc., by uniting mankind
      against the danger of destruction by "creatures" from other
      planets or from outer space. Experiments have been proposed to
      test the credibility of an out-of-our-world invasion threat; it is
      possible that a few of the more difficult-to-explain "flying
      saucer" incidents of recent years were in fact early experiments
      of this kind. If so, they could hardly have been judged
      encouraging. We anticipate no difficulties in making a "need" for
      a giant super space program credible for economic purposes, even
      were there not ample precedent; extending it, for political
      purposes, to include features unfortunately associated with
      science fiction would obviously be a more dubious undertaking.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, an effective political substitute for war would
      require "alternate enemies," some of which might seem equally
      farfetched in the context of the current war system. It may be,
      for instance, that gross pollution of the environment can
      eventually replace the possibility of mass destruction by nuclear
      weapons as the principal apparent threat to the survival of the
      species. Poisoning of the air, and of the principal sources of
      food and water supply, is already well advanced, and at first
      glance would seem promising in this respect; it constitutes a
      threat that can be dealt with only through social organization and
      political power. But from present indications it will be a
      generation to a generation and a half before environmental
      pollution, however severe, will be sufficiently menacing, on a
      global scale, to offer a possible basis for a solution.<br>
      <br>
      It is true that the rate of pollution could be increased
      selectively for this purpose; in fact, the mere modifying of
      existing programs for the deterrence of pollution could speed up
      the process enough to make the threat credible much sooner. But
      the pollution problem has been so widely publicized in recent
      years that it seems highly improbably that a program of deliberate
      environ- mental poisoning could be implemented in a politically
      acceptable manner.<br>
      <br>
      However unlikely some of the possible alternate enemies we have
      mentioned may seem, we must emphasize that one must be found, of
      credible quality and magnitude, if a transition to peace is ever
      to come about without social disintegration. It is more probably,
      in our judgement, that such a threat will have to be invented,
      rather than developed from unknown conditions. For this reason, we
      believe further speculation about its putative nature ill- advised
      in this context. Since there is considerable doubt, in our minds,
      that any viable political surrogate can be devised, we are
      reluctant to compromise, by premature discussion, any possible
      option that may eventually lie open to our government.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOCIOLOGICAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Of the many functions of war we have found convenient to group
      together in this classification, two are critical. In a world of
      peace, the continuing stability of society will require: 1) an
      effective substitute for military institutions that can neutralize
      destabilizing social elements and 2) a credible motivational
      surrogate for war that can insure social cohesiveness. The first
      is an essential element of social control; the second is the basic
      mechanism for adapting individual human drives to the needs of
      society.<br>
      <br>
      Most proposals that address themselves, explicitly or otherwise,
      to the postwar problem of controlling the socially alienated turn
      to some variant of the Peace Corps or the so-called Job Corps for
      a solution. The socially disaffected, the economically unprepared,
      the psychologically unconformable, the hard-core "delinquents,"
      the incorrigible "subversives," and the rest of the unemployable
      are seen as somehow transformed by the disciplines of a service
      modeled on military precedent into more or less dedicated social
      service workers. This presumption also informs the otherwise
      hardheaded ratiocination of the "Unarmed Forces" plan.<br>
      <br>
      The problem has been addressed, in the language of popular
      sociology, by Secretary McNamara. "Even in our abundant societies,
      we have reason enough to worry over the tensions that coil and
      tighten among underprivileged young people, and finally flail out
      in delinquency and crime. What are we to expect.. where mounting
      frustrations are likely to fester into eruptions of violence and
      extremism?" In a seemingly unrelated passage, he continues: "It
      seems to me that we could move toward remedying that inequity [of
      the Selective Service System] by asking every young person in the
      United States to give two years of service to his country --
      whether in one of the military services, in the Peace Corps, or in
      some other volunteer developmental whether at home or abroad. We
      could encourage other countries to do the same." Here, as
      elsewhere through- out this significant speech, Mr.McNamara has
      focused, indirectly but unmistakably, on one of the key issues
      bearing on a possible transition to peace, and has later
      indicated, also indirectly, a rough approach to its resolution,
      again phrased in the language of the current war system.<br>
      <br>
      It seems clear that Mr.McNamara and other proponents of the
      peace-corps surrogate for this tar function lean heavily on the
      success of the paramilitary Depression programs mentioned in the
      last section. We find the precedent wholly inadequate in degree.
      Neither the lack of relevant precedent, however, nor the dubious
      social welfare sentimentality characterizing this approach warrant
      its rejection without careful study. It may be viable -- provided,
      first, that the military origin of the Corps format be effectively
      rendered out of its operational activity, and second, that the
      transition from para- military activities to "developmental w? A"
      can be effected without regard to the attitudes of the Corps
      personnel or to the "value" of the work it is expected to perform.<br>
      <br>
      Another possible surrogate for the control of potential enemies of
      society is the reintroduction, in some form consistent with modern
      technology and political processes, of slavery. Up to now, this
      has been suggested only in fiction, notably in the works of Wells,
      Huxley, Orwell, and others engaged in the imaginative anticipation
      of the sociology of the future. But the fantasies projected in
      Brave New World and 1984 have seemed less and less implausible
      over the years since their publication. The traditional
      association of slavery with ancient pre-industrial cultures should
      not blind us to its adaptability to advanced forms of social
      organization, nor should its equally traditional incompatibility
      with Western moral and economic values. It is entirely possible
      that the development of a sophisticated form of slavery may be an
      absolute prerequisite for social control in a world at peace. As a
      practical matter, conversion of the code of military discipline to
      a euphemized form of enslavement would entail surprisingly little
      revision; the logical first step would be the adoption of some
      form of "universal" military service.<br>
      <br>
      When it comes to postulating a credible substitute for war capable
      of directing human behavior patterns in behalf of social
      organization, few options suggest themselves. Like its political
      function, the motivational function of war requires the existence
      of a genuinely menacing social enemy. The principal difference is
      that for purposes of motivating basic allegiance, as distinct from
      accepting political authority, the "alternate enemy" must imply a
      more immediate, tangible, and directly felt threat of destruction.
      It must justify the need for taking and paying a "blood price" in
      wide areas of human concern.<br>
      <br>
      In this respect, the possible enemies noted earlier would be
      insufficient. One exception might be the environmental-pollution
      model, if the danger to society it posed was genuinely imminent.
      The fictive models would have to carry the weight of extraordinary
      conviction, underscored with a not inconsiderable actual sacrifice
      of life; the construction of an up-to-date mythological or
      religious structure for this purpose would present difficulties in
      our era, but must certainly be considered.<br>
      <br>
      Games theorists have suggested, in other contexts, the development
      of "blood games" for the effective control of individual
      aggressive impulses. It is an ironic commentary on the current
      state of war and peace studies that it was left not to scientists
      but to the makers of a commercial film to develop a model for this
      notion, on the implausible level of popular melodrama, as a
      ritualized manhunt. More realistically, such a ritual might be
      socialized, in the manner of the Spanish Inquisition and the less
      formal witch trials of other periods, for purposes of "social
      purification," "state security," or other rationale both
      acceptable and credible to postwar societies. The feasibility of
      such an updated version of still another ancient institution,
      though doubtful, is considerably less fanciful than the wishful
      notion of many peace planners that a lasting condition of peace
      can be brought about without the most painstaking examination of
      every possible surrogate for the essential functions of war. What
      is involved here, in a sense, is the quest for William Jame's
      "moral equivalent of war."<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible that the two functions considered under this
      heading may be jointly served, in the sense of establishing the
      antisocial, for whom a control institution is needed, as the
      "alternate enemy" needed to hold society together. The relentless
      and irreversible advance of unemployability at all levels of
      society, and the similar extension of generalized alienation from
      accepted values may make some such program necessary even as an
      adjunct to the war system. As before, we will not speculate on the
      specific forms this kind of program might take, except to note
      that there is again ample precedent, in the treatment meted out to
      disfavored, allegedly menacing, ethnic groups in certain societies
      during certain historical periods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ECOLOGICAL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Considering the shortcomings of war as a mechanism of selective
      population control, it might appear that devising substitutes for
      this function should be comparatively simple. Schematically this
      is so, but the problem of timing the transition to a new
      ecological balancing device makes the feasibility of substitution
      less certain.<br>
      <br>
      It must be remembered that the limitation of war in this function
      is entirely eugenic. War has not been genetically progressive. But
      as a system of gross population control to preserve the species it
      cannot fairly be faulted. And, as has been pointed out, the nature
      of war is itself in transition. Current trends in warfare -- the
      increased strategic bombing of civilians and the greater military
      importance now attached to the destruction of sources of supply
      (as opposed to purely "military" bases and personnel) -- strongly
      suggest that a truly qualitative improvement is in the making.
      Assuming the war system is to continue, it is more than probably
      that the regressively selective quality of war will have been
      reversed, as its victims become more genetically representative of
      their societies.<br>
      <br>
      There is no question but that a universal requirement that
      procreation be limited to the products of artificial insemination
      would provide a fully adequate substitute control for population
      levels. Such a reproductive system would, of course, have the
      added advantage of being susceptible of direct eugenic management.
      Its predictable further development -- conception and embryonic
      growth taking place wholly under laboratory conditions -- would
      extend these controls to their logical conclusion. The ecological
      function of war under these circumstances would not only be
      superseded but surpassed in effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      The indicated intermediate step -- total control of conception
      with a variant of the ubiquitous "pill," via water supplies or
      certain essential foodstuffs, offset by a controlled "antidote" --
      is already under development. There could appear to be no
      foreseeable need to revert to any of the outmoded practices
      referred to in the previous section (infanticide, etc.) as there
      might have been if the possibility of transition to peace had
      arisen two generations ago.<br>
      <br>
      The real question here, therefore, does not concern the viability
      of this war substitute, but the political problems involved in
      bringing it about. It cannot be established while the war system
      is still in effect. The reason for this is simple: excess
      population is tar material. As long as any society must
      contemplate even a remote possibility of war, it must maintain a
      maximum supportable population, even when so doing critically
      aggravates an economic liability. This is paradoxical, in view of
      war's role in reducing excess population, but it is readily
      understood. War controls the general population level, but the
      ecological interest of any single society lies in maintaining its
      hegemony vis-a-vis other societies. The obvious analogy can be
      seen in any free-enterprise economy. Practices damaging to the
      society as a whole -- both competitive and monopolistic--are
      abetted by the conflicting economic motives of individual capital
      interests. The obvious precedent can be found in the seemingly
      irrational political difficulties which have blacked universal
      adoption of simple birth-control methods. Nations desperately in
      need of increasing unfavorable production-consumption ratios are
      nevertheless unwilling to gamble their possible military
      requirements of twenty years hence for this purpose. Unilateral
      population control, as practiced in ancient Japan and in other
      isolated societies, is out of the question in today's world.<br>
      <br>
      Since the eugenic solution cannot be achieved until the transition
      to the peace system takes place, why not wait? One must qualify
      the inclination to agree. As we noted earlier, a real possibility
      of an unprecedented global crisis of insufficiency exists today,
      which the war system may not be able to forestall. If this should
      come to pass before an agreed-upon transition to peace were
      completed, the result might be irrevocably disastrous. There is
      clearly no solution to this dilemma; it is a risk which must be
      taken. But it tends to support the view that if a decision is made
      to eliminate the war system, it were better done sooner than
      later.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC</b><br>
      <br>
      Strictly speaking, the function of war as the determinant of
      cultural values and as the prime mover of scientific progress may
      not be critical in a world without war. Our criterion for the
      basic nonmilitary functions of war has been: Are they necessary to
      the survival and stability of society? The absolute need for
      substitute cultural value-determinants and for the continued
      advance of scientific knowledge is not established. We believe it
      important, however, in behalf of those for whom these functions
      hold subjective significance, that it be known what they can
      reasonably expect in culture and science after a transition to
      peace.<br>
      <br>
      So far as the creative arts are concerned, there is no reason to
      believe they would disappear, but only that they would change in
      character and relative social importance. The elimination of war
      would in due course deprive them of their principal conative
      force, but it would necessarily take some time for the transition,
      and perhaps for a generation thereafter, themes of socio-moral
      conflict inspired by the war system would be increasingly
      transferred to the idiom of purely personal sensibility. At the
      same time, a new aesthetic could have to develop. Whatever its
      name, form, or rationale, its function would be to express, in
      language appropriate to the new period, the once discredited
      philosophy that art exists for its own sake. This aesthetic would
      reject unequivocally the classic requirement of paramilitary
      conflict as the substantive content of great art. The eventual
      effect of the peace-world philosophy of art would be democratizing
      in the extreme, in the sense that a generally acknowledged
      subjectivity of artistic standards would equalize their new,
      content-free "values."<br>
      <br>
      What may be expected to happen is that art would be reassigned the
      role it once played in a few primitive peace-oriented social
      systems. This was the function of pure decoration, entertainment,
      or play, entirely free of the burden of expressing the socio-moral
      values and conflicts of a war-oriented society. It is interesting
      that the groundwork for such a value-free aesthetic is already
      being laid today, in growing experimentation in art without
      content, perhaps in anticipation of a world without conflict. A
      cult has developed around a new kind of cultural determinism,
      which proposes that the technological form of a cultural
      expression determines its values rather than does its ostensibly
      meaningful content. Its clear implication is that there is no
      "good" or "bad" art, only that which is appropriate to its
      (technological) times and that which is not. Its cultural effect
      has been to promote circumstantial constructions and unplanned
      expressions; it denies to art the relevance of sequential logic.
      Its significance in this context is that it provides a working
      model of one kind of value-free culture we might reasonably
      anticipate in a world at peace.<br>
      <br>
      So far as science is concerned, it might appear at first glance
      that a giant space-research program, the most promising among the
      proposed economic surrogates for war, might also serve as the
      basic stimulator of scientific research. The lack of fundamental
      organized social conflict inherent in space work, however, would
      rule it out as an adequate motivational substitute for war when
      applied to "pure" science. But it could no doubt sustain the broad
      range of technological activity that a space budget of military
      dimensions could require. A similarly scaled social-welfare
      program could provide a comparable impetus to low-keyed
      technological advances, especially in medicine, rationalized
      construction methods, educational psychology, etc. The eugenic
      substitute for the ecological function of war would also require
      continuing research in certain areas of the life sciences.<br>
      <br>
      Apart from these partial substitutes for war, it must be kept in
      mind that the momentum given to scientific progress by the great
      wars of the past century, and even more by the anticipation of
      World War III, is intellectually and materially enormous. It is
      our finding that if the war system were to end tomorrow this
      momentum is so great that the pursuit of scientific knowledge
      could reasonably be expected to go forward without noticeable
      diminution for perhaps two decades. It would then continue, at a
      progressively decreasing tempo, for at least another two decades
      before the "bank account" of today's unresolved problems would
      become exhausted. By the standards of the questions we have
      learned to ask today, there would no longer be anything worth
      knowing still unknown; we cannot conceive, by definition, of the
      scientific questions to ask once those we can now comprehend are
      answered.<br>
      <br>
      This leads unavoidably to another matter: the intrinsic value of
      the unlimited search for knowledge. We of course offer no
      independent value judgments here, but it is germane to point out
      that a substantial minority of scientific opinion feels that
      search to be circumscribed in any case. This opinion is itself a
      factor in considering the need for a substitute for the scientific
      function of war. For the record, we must also take note of the
      precedent that during long periods of human history, often
      covering thousands of years, in which no intrinsic social value
      was assigned to scientific progress, stable societies did survive
      and flourish. Although this could not have been possible in the
      modern industrial world, we cannot be certain it may not again be
      true in a future world at peace.<br>

        <b>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>THE NATURE OF WAR</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      War is not, as is widely assumed, primarily an instrument of
      policy utilized by nations to extend or defend their expressed
      political values or their economic interests. On the contrary, it
      is itself the principal basis of organization on which all modern
      societies are constructed. The common proximate cause of war is
      the apparent interference of one nation with the aspirations of
      another. But at the root of all ostensible differences of national
      interest lie the dynamic requirements of the war system itself for
      periodic armed conflict. Readiness for war characterizes
      contemporary social systems more broadly than their economic and
      political structures, which it subsumes.<br>
      <br>
      Economic analyses of the anticipated problems of transition to
      peace have not recognized the broad preeminence of war in the
      definition of social systems. The same is true, with rare and only
      partial exceptions, of model disarmament "scenarios." For this
      reason, the value of this previous work is limited to the
      mechanical aspects of transition. Certain features of these models
      may perhaps be applicable to a real situation of conversion to
      peace; this till depend on their compatibility with a substantive,
      rather than a procedural, peace plan. Such a plan can be developed
      only from the premise of full understanding of the nature of the
      war system it proposes to abolish, which in turn presupposes
      detailed comprehension of the functions the war system performs
      for society. It will require the construction of a detailed and
      feasible system of substitutes for those functions that are
      necessary to the stability and survival of human societies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The visible, military function of war requires no elucidation; it
      is not only obvious but also irrelevant to a transition to the
      condition of peace, in which it will by definition be superfluous.
      It is also subsidiary in social significance to the implied,
      nonmilitary functions of war; those critical to transition can be
      summarized in five principal groupings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. ECONOMIC:</b> War has provided both ancient and modern
      societies with a dependable system for stabilizing and controlling
      national economies. No alternate method of control has yet been
      tested in a complex modern economy that has shown itself remotely
      comparable in scope or effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. POLITICAL:</b> The permanent possibility of war is the
      foundation for stable government; it supplies the basis for
      general acceptance of political authority. It has enabled
      societies to maintain necessary class distinctions, and it has
      ensured the subordination of the citizen to the state, by virtue
      of the residual war powers inherent in the concept of nationhood.
      No modern political ruling group has successfully controlled its
      constituency after failing to sustain the continuing credibility
      of an external threat of war.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. SOCIOLOGICAL:</b> War, through the medium of military
      institutions, has uniquely served societies, through-out the
      course of known history, as an indispensable controller of
      dangerous social dissidence and destructive antisocial tendencies.
      As the most formidable of threats to life itself, and as the only
      one susceptible to mitigation by social organization alone, it has
      played another equally fundamental role: the war system has
      provided the machinery through which the motivational forces
      governing human behavior have been translated into binding social
      allegiance. It has thus ensured the degree of social cohesion
      necessary to the viability of nations. No other institution, or
      groups of institutions, in modern societies, has successfully
      served these functions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. ECOLOGICAL:</b> War has been the principal evolutionary
      device for maintaining a satisfactory ecological balance between
      gross human population and supplies available for its survival. It
      is unique to the human species.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC:</b> War-orientation has determined
      the basic standards of value in the creative arts, and has
      provided the fundamental motivational source of scientific and
      technological progress. The concepts that the arts express values
      independent of their own forms and that the successful pursuit of
      knowledge has intrinsic social value have long been accepted in
      modern societies; the development of the arts and sciences during
      this period has been corollary to the parallel development of
      weaponry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR : CRITERIA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The foregoing functions of war are essential to the survival of
      the social systems we know today. With two possible exceptions
      they are also essential to any kind of stable social organization
      that might survive in a warless world. Discussion of the ways and
      means of transition to such a world are meaningless unless a)
      substitute institutions can be devised to fill these functions, or
      b) it can reasonably be hypothecated that the loss or partial loss
      of any one function need not destroy the viability of future
      societies.<br>
      <br>
      Such substitute institutions and hypotheses must meet varying
      criteria. In general, they must be technically feasible,
      politically acceptable, and potentially credible to the members of
      the societies that adopt them. Specifically, they must be
      characterized as follows:<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. ECONOMIC:</b> An acceptable economic surrogate for the war
      system will require the expenditure of resources for completely
      nonproductive purposes at a level comparable to that of the
      military expenditures otherwise demanded by the size and
      complexity of each society. Such a substitute system of apparent
      "waste" must be of a nature that will permit it to remain
      independent of the normal supply-demand economy; it must be
      subject to arbitrary political control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. POLITICAL:</b> A viable political substitute fir war must
      posit a generalized external menace to each society of a nature
      and degree sufficient to require the organization and acceptance
      of political authority.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. SOCIOLOGICAL</b>: First, in the permanent absence of war,
      new institutions must be developed that will effectively control
      the socially destructive segments of societies. Second, for
      purposes of adapting the physical and psychological dynamics of
      human behavior to the needs of social organization, a credible
      substitute for war must generate an omnipresent and readily
      understood fear of personal destruction. This fear must be of a
      nature and degree sufficient ot ensure adherence to societal
      values to the full extent that they are acknowledged to transcend
      the value of individual human life.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. ECOLOGICAL:</b> A substitute for war in its function as the
      uniquely human system of population control must ensure the
      survival, if not necessarily the improvement, of the species, in
      terms of its relations to environmental supply.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC:</b> A surrogate for the function of
      war as the deter- minant of cultural values must establish a basis
      of socio-moral conflict of equally compelling force and scope. A
      substitute motivational basis for the quest for scientific
      knowledge must be similarly informed by a comparable sense of
      internal necessity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR : MODELS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following substitute institutions, among others, have been
      proposed for consideration as replacements for the nonmilitary
      functions of war. That they may not have been originally set forth
      for that purpose does not preclude or invalidate their possible
      application here.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. ECONOMIC</b>: a) A comprehensive social-welfare program,
      directed toward maximum improvement of general conditions of human
      life. b) A giant open-end space research program, aimed at
      unreachable targets. c) A permanent, ritua- lized, ultra-elaborate
      disarmament inspection system, and variants of such a system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. POLITICAL:</b> a) An omnipresent, virtually omnipotent
      international police force. b) An established and recognized
      extraterrestrial menace. c) Massive global environmental
      pollution. d) Fictitious alternate enemies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. SOCIOLOGICAL : CONTROL FUNCTION:</b> a) Programs generally
      derived from the Peace Corps model. b) A modern, sophisticated
      form of slavery. MOTIVATIONAL FUNCTION: a) Intensified
      environmental pollution. b) New religions or other mythologies. c)
      Socially oriented blood games. d) Combination forms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. ECOLOGICAL:</b> A comprehensive program of applied eugenics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. CULTURAL:</b> No replacement institution offered. <b><br>
        <br>
        6. SCIENTIFIC:</b> The secondary requirements of the space
      research, social welfare, and / or eugenics programs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBSTITUTES FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF WAR : EVALUATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The models listed above reflect only the beginning of the quest
      for substitute institutions for the functions of war, rather than
      a recapitulation of alternatives. It would be both premature and
      inappropriate, therefore, to offer final judgments on their
      applicability to a transition to peace and after. Furthermore,
      since the necessary but complex project of correlating the
      compatibility of proposed surrogates for different functions could
      be treated only in exemplary fashion at this time, we have elected
      to withhold such hypothetical correlations as were tested as
      statistically inadequate.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, some tentative and cursory comments on these
      proposed functional "solutions" will indicate the scope of the
      difficulties involved in this area of peace planning.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ECONOMIC:</b> The social-welfare model cannot be expected to
      remain outside the normal economy after the conclusion of its
      predominantly capital-investment phase; its value in this function
      can therefore be only temporary. The space-research substitute
      appears to meet both major criteria, and should be examined in
      greater detail, especially in respect to its probable effects on
      other war functions. "Elaborate inspection" schemes, although
      superficially attractive, are inconsistent with the basic premise
      of a transition to peace. The "unarmed forces" variant,
      logistically similar, is subject to the same functional criticism
      as the general social-welfare model.<br>
      <br>
      <b>POLITICAL:</b> Like the inspection-scheme surrogates, proposals
      for plenipotentiary international police are inherently
      incompatible with the ending of the war system. The "unarmed
      forces" variant, amended to include unlimited powers of economic
      sanction, might conceivably be expanded to constitute a credible
      external menace. Development of an acceptable threat from "outer
      space," presumably in conjunction with a space-research surrogate
      for economic control, appears unpromising in terms of credibility.
      The environmental-pollution model does not seem sufficiently
      responsive to immediate social control, except through arbitrary
      acceleration of current pollution trends; this in turn raises
      questions of political acceptability. New, less regressive,
      approaches to the creation of fictitious global "enemies" invite
      further investigation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOCIOLOGICAL: CONTROL FUNCTION:</b> Although the various
      substitutes proposed for this function that are modeled roughly on
      the Peace Corps appear grossly in- adequate in potential scope,
      they should not be ruled out without further study. Slavery, in a
      technologically modern and conceptually euphemized form, may prove
      a more efficient and flexible institution in this area. <br>
      <br>
      <b>MOTIVATIONAL FUNCTION:</b> Although none of the proposed
      substitutes for war as the guarantor of social allegiance can be
      dismissed out of hand, each presents serious and special
      difficulties. Intensified environmental threats may raise
      ecological dangers; myth-making dissociated from tar may no longer
      be politically feasible; purposeful blood games and rituals can
      far more readily be devised than implemented. An institution
      combining this function with the preceding one, based on, but not
      necessarily imitative of, the precedent of organized ethnic
      repression, warrants careful consideration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ECOLOGICAL</b>: The only apparent problem in the application of
      an adequate eugenic substitute for war is that of timing; it
      cannot be effectuated until the transition to peace has been
      completed, which involved a serious temporary risk of ecological
      failure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CULTURAL: </b>No plausible substitute for this function of war
      has yet been proposed. It may be, however, that a basic cultural
      value-determinant is not necessary to the survival of a stable
      society. <br>
      <br>
      <b>SCIENTIFIC</b>: The same might be said for the function of war
      as the prime mover of the search for knowledge. However, adoption
      of either a giant space-research program, a comprehensive
      social-welfare program, or a master program of eugenic control
      would provide motivation for limited technologies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GENERAL CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is apparent, from the foregoing, that no program or combination
      of programs yet proposed for a transition to peace has remotely
      approached meeting the comprehensive functional requirements of a
      world without war. Although one projected system for filling the
      economic function of war seems promising, similar optimism cannot
      be expressed in the equally essential political and sociological
      areas. The other major nonmilitary functions of war -- ecological,
      cultural, scientific -- raise very different problems, but it is
      least possible that detailed programming of substitutes in these
      areas is not prerequisite to transition. More important, it is not
      enough to develop adequate but separate surrogates for the major
      war functions; they must be fully compatible and in no degree
      self-canceling.<br>
      <br>
      Until such a unified program is developed, at least
      hypothetically, it is impossible for this or any other group to
      furnish meaningful answers to the questions originally presented
      to us. When asked how best to prepare for the advent of peace, we
      must first reply, as strongly as we can, that the war system
      cannot responsibly be allowed to disappear until 1) we know
      exactly what it is we plan to put in its place, and 2) we are
      certain, beyond reasonable doubt, that these substitute
      institutions will serve their purposes in terms of the survival
      and stability of society. It will then be time enough to develop
      methods for effectuating the transition; procedural programming
      must follow, not precede, substantive solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Such solutions, if indeed they exist, will not be arrived at
      without a revolutionary revision of the modes of thought
      heretofore considered appropriate to peace research. That we have
      examined the fundamental questions involved from a dispassionate,
      value-free point of view should not imply that we do not
      appreciate the intellectual and emotional difficulties that must
      be overcome on all decision-making levels before these questions
      are generally acknowledged by others for what they are. They
      reflect, on an intellectual level, tradition- al emotional
      resistance to new (more lethal and thus more "shocking") forms of
      weaponry. The understated comment of then-Senator Hubert Humphrey
      on the publication of ON THERMONUCLEAR WAR is still very much to
      the point: "New Thoughts, particularly those which appear to
      contradict current assumptions, are always painful for the mind to
      contemplate."<br>
      <br>
      Nor, simple because we have not discussed them, do we minimize the
      massive reconciliation of conflicting interests with domestic as
      well as international agreement on proceeding toward genuine peace
      presupposes. This factor was excluded from the purview of our
      assignment, but we would be remiss if we failed to take it into
      account. Although no insuperable obstacle lies in the path of
      reaching such general agreements, formidable short-term
      private-group and general-class interest in maintaining the war
      system is well established and widely recognized. The resistance
      to peace stemming from such interest is only tangential, in the
      long run, to the basic functions of war, but it will not be easily
      overcome, in this country or elsewhere. Some observers, in fact,
      believe that it cannot be overcome at all in our time, that the
      price of peace is, simply, too high. This bears on our overall
      conclusions to the extent that timing in the transference to
      substitute institutions may often be the critical factor in their
      political feasibility.<br>
      <br>
      It is uncertain, at this time, whether peace will ever be
      possible. It is far more questionable, by the objective standard
      of continued social survival rather than that of emotional
      pacifism, that it would be desirable even if it were demonstrably
      attainable. The war system, for all its subjective repugnance to
      important sections of "public opinion" has demonstrated its
      effectiveness since the beginning of recorded history; it has
      provided the basis for the development of many impressively
      durable civilizations, including that which is dominant today. It
      has consistently provided unambiguous social priorities. It is, on
      the whole, a known quantity. A viable system of peace, assuming
      that the great and complex questions of substitute institutions
      raised in this Report are both soluble and solved, would still
      constitute a venture into the unknown, with the inevitable risks
      attendant on the unforeseen, however small and however well
      hedged.<br>
      <br>
      Government decision-makers tend to choose peace over war whenever
      a real option exists, because it usually appears to be the "safer"
      choice. Under most immediate circumstances they are likely to be
      right. But in terms of long-range social stability, the opposite
      is true. At our present state of knowledge and reasonable
      inference, it is the war system that must be identified with
      stability, the peace system that must be identified with social
      speculation, however justifiable the speculation may appear, in
      terms of subjective moral or emotional values. A nuclear physicist
      once remarked, in respect to a possible disarmament agreement: "If
      we could change the world into a world in which no weapons could
      be made, that would be stabilizing. But agreements we can expect
      with the Soviets would be destabilizing." The qualification and
      the bias are equally irrelevant; any condition of genuine total
      peace, however achieved, would be destabilizing until proved
      otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      If it were necessary at this moment to opt irrevocably for the
      retention or for the dissolution of the war system, common
      prudence would dictate the former course. But it is not yet
      necessary, late as the hour appears. And more factors must
      eventually enter the war-peace equation than even the most
      determined search for alternative institutions for the functions
      of war can be expected to reveal. One group of such factors has
      been given only passing mention in this Report; it centers around
      the possible obsolescence of the war system itself. We have noted,
      for instance, the limitations of the war system in filling its
      ecological function and the declining importance of this aspect of
      war. It by no means stretches the imagination to visualize
      comparable developments which may compromise the efficacy of war
      as, for example, an economic controller or as an organizer of
      social allegiance. This kind of possibility, however remote,
      serves as a reminder that all calculations of contingency not only
      involve the weighing of one group of risks against another, but
      require a respectful allowance for error on both sides of the
      scale.<br>
      <br>
      More expedient reason for pursuing the investigation of alternate
      ways and means to serve the current functions of war is narrowly
      political. It is possible that one or more major sovereign nations
      may arrive, through ambiguous leadership, at a position in which a
      ruling administrative class may lose control of basic public
      opinion or of its ability to rationalize a desired war. It is not
      hard to imagine, in such circumstances, a situation in which such
      governments may feel forced to initiate serious full-scale
      disarmament proceedings (perhaps provoked by "accidental" nuclear
      explosions), and that such negotiations may lead to the actual
      disestablishment of military institutions. As our Report has made
      clear, this could be catastrophic. It seems evident that, in the
      event an important part of the world is suddenly plunged without
      sufficient warning into an inadvertent peace, even partial and
      inadequate preparation for the possibility may be better than
      none. The difference could even be critical. The models considered
      in the preceding chapter, both those that seem promising and those
      that do not, have one positive feature in common -- an inherent
      flexibility of phasing. And despite our strictures against
      knowingly proceeding into peace-transition procedures without
      thorough substantive preparation, our government must nevertheless
      be ready to move in this direction with whatever limited resources
      of planning are on hand at the time --- if circumstances so
      require. An arbitrary all-or-nothing approach is no more realistic
      in the development of contingency peace programming than it is
      anywhere else.<br>
      <br>
      But the principal cause for concern over the continuing
      effectiveness of the war system, and the more important reason for
      hedging with peace planning, lies in the backwardness of current
      war-system programming. Its controls have not kept pace with the
      technological advances it has made possible. Despite its
      unarguable success to date, even in this era of unprecedented
      potential in mass destruction, it continues to operate largely on
      a laissez-faire basis. To the best of our knowledge, no serious
      quantified studies have even been conducted to determine, for
      example:<br>
      <br>
      --- optimum levels of armament production, for purposes of
      economic control, at any given relationship between civilian
      production and consumption patterns:<br>
      <br>
      --- correlation factors between draft recruitment policies and
      mensurable social dissidence;<br>
      <br>
      --- minimum levels of population destruction necessary to maintain
      war-threat credibility under varying political conditions;<br>
      <br>
      --- optimum cyclical frequency of "shooting" wars under varying
      circumstances of historical relationship.<br>
      <br>
      These and other war-function factors are fully susceptible to
      analysis by today's computer-based systems, but they have not been
      so treated; modern analytical techniques have up to now been
      relegated to such aspects of the ostensible functions of war as
      procurement, personnel deployment, weapons analysis, and the like.
      We do not disparage these types of application, but only deplore
      their lack of utilization to greater capacity in attacking
      problems of broader scope. Our concern for efficiency in this
      context is not aesthetic, economic, or humanistic. It stems from
      the axiom that no system can long survive at either input or
      output levels that consistently or substantially deviate from an
      optimum range. As their data grow increasingly sophisticated, the
      war system and its functions are increasingly endangered by such
      deviations.<br>
      <br>
      Our final conclusion, therefore, is that it will be necessary for
      our government to plan in depth for two general contingencies. The
      first, and lesser, is the possibility of a viable general peace;
      the second is the successful continuation of the war system. In
      our view, careful preparation for the possibility of peace should
      be extended, not because we take the position that the end of war
      would necessarily be desirable, if it is in fact possible, but
      because it may be thrust upon us in some form whether we are ready
      for it or not. Planning for rationalizing and quantifying the war
      system, on the other hand, to ensure the effectiveness of its
      major stabilizing functions, is not only more promising in respect
      to anticipated results, but is essential; we can no longer take
      for granted that it will continue to serve our purposes well
      merely because it always has. The objective of government policy
      in regard to war and peace, in this period of uncertainty, must be
      to preserve maximum options. The recommendations which follow are
      directed to this end.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>SECTION 8</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      (1) We propose the establishment, under executive order of the
      President, of a permanent WAR/PEACE Research Agency, empowered and
      mandated to execute the programs described in (2) and (3) below.
      This agency (a) will be provided with non-accountable funds
      sufficient to implement its responsibilities and decisions at its
      own discretion, and (b) will have authority to preempt and
      utilize, without restriction, any and all facilities of the
      executive branch of the government in pursuit of its objectives.
      It will be organized along the lines of the National Security
      Council, except that none of its governing, executive, or
      operating personnel will hold other public office or governmental
      responsibility. Its directorate will be drawn from the broadest
      practicable spectrum of scientific disciplines, humanistic
      studies, applied creative arts, operating technologies, and
      otherwise unclassified professional occupations. It will be
      responsible solely to the President, or to other officers of
      government temporarily deputized by him. Its operations will be
      governed entirely by its own rules of procedure. Its authority
      will expressly include the unlimited right to withhold information
      on its activities and its decisions, from anyone ex- cept the
      President, whenever it deems such secrecy to be in the public
      inter- est.<br>
      <br>
      (2) The first of the War/Peace Research Agency's two principal
      responsibilities will be to determine all that can be known,
      including what can reasonably be inferred in terms of relevant
      statistical probabilities, that may bear on an eventual transition
      to a general condition of peace. The findings in this Report may
      be considered to constitute the beginning of this study and to
      indicate its orientation; detailed records of the investigations
      and findings of the Special Study Group on which this Report is
      based, will be furnished the agency, along with whatever
      clarifying data the agency deems necessary. This aspect of the
      agency's work will hereinafter be referred to as "Peace Research."<br>
      <br>
      The Agency's Peace Research activities will necessarily include,
      but not be limited to, the following:<br>
      <br>
      (a) The creative development of possible substitute institutions
      for the principal nonmilitary functions of war.<br>
      <br>
      (b) The careful matching of such institutions against the criteria
      summarized in this Report, as refined, revised, and extended by
      the agency.<br>
      <br>
      © The testing and evaluation of substitute institutions, for
      acceptability, feasibility, and credibility, against hypothecated
      transitional and postwar conditions; the testing and evaluation of
      the effects of the anticipated atrophy of certain unsubstantiated
      functions.<br>
      <br>
      (d) The development and testing of the correlativity of multiple
      substitute institutions, with the eventual objective of
      establishing a comprehensive pro- gram of compatible war
      substitutes suitable for a planned transition to peace, if and
      when this is found to be possible and subsequently judged
      desirable by appropriate political authorities.<br>
      <br>
      (e) The preparation of a wide-ranging schedule of partial,
      uncorrelated, crash programs of adjustment suitable for reducing
      the dangers of unplanned transition to peace effected by force
      majeure.<br>
      <br>
      Peace Research methods will include but not be limited to, the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      (a) The comprehensive interdisciplinary application of historical,
      scientific, technological, and cultural data.<br>
      <br>
      (b) The full utilization of modern methods of mathematical
      modeling, analogical analysis, and other, more sophisticated,
      quantitative techniques in process of development that are
      compatible with computer programming.<br>
      <br>
      © The heuristic "peace games" procedures developed during the
      course of its assignment by the Special Study Group, and further
      extensions of this basic approach to the testing of institutional
      functions.<br>
      <br>
      (3) The WAR/PEACE Research Agency's other principal responsibility
      will be "War Research." Its fundamental objective will be to
      ensure the continuing viability of the war system to fulfill its
      essential nonmilitary functions for as long as the war system is
      judged necessary to or desirable for the survival of society. To
      achieve this end, the War Research groups within the agency will
      engage in the following activities:<br>
      <br>
      (a) Quantification of existing application of the non-military
      functions of war. Specific determinations will include, but not be
      limited to: 1) the gross amount and the net proportion of
      nonproductive military expenditures since World War II assignable
      to the need for war as an economic stabilizer; 2) the amount and
      proportion of military expenditures and destruction of life,
      property, and natural resources during this period assignable to
      the need for war as an instrument for political control; 3)
      similar figures, to the extent that they can be separately arrived
      at, assignable to the need for war to maintain social
      cohesiveness; 4) levels of recruitment and expenditures on the
      draft and other forms of personnel deployment attributable to the
      need for military institutions to control social disaffection; 5)
      the statistical relationship of war casualties to world food
      supplies; 6) the correlation of military actions and expenditures
      with cultural activities and scientific advances (including
      necessarily the development of measurable standards in these
      areas).<br>
      <br>
      (b) Establishment of a priori modern criteria for the execution of
      the non- military functions of war. These will include, but not be
      limited to: 1) calculation of minimum and optimum ranges of
      military expenditure required, under varying hypothetical
      conditions, to fulfill these several functions, separately and
      collectively; 2) determination of minimum and optimum levels of
      destruction of LIFE, PROPERTY, and NATURAL RESOURCES prerequisite
      to the credibility of external threat essential to the political
      and motivational functions; 3) deve- lopment of a negotiable
      formula governing the relationship between military recruitment
      and training policies and the exigencies of social control.<br>
      <br>
      (c) Reconciliation of these criteria with prevailing economic,
      political, sociological, and ecological limitations. The ultimate
      object of this phase of War Research is to rationalize the
      heretofore informal operations of the war system. It should
      provide practical working procedures through which responsible
      governmental authority may resolve the following war-function
      problems, among others, under any given circumstances: 1) how to
      determine the optimum quantity, nature, and timing of military
      expenditures to ensure a desired degree of economic control; 2)
      how to organize the recruitment, deployment, and ostensible use of
      military personnel to ensure a desired degree of acceptance of
      authorized social values; 3) how to compute on a short-term basis,
      the nature and extent of the LOSS OF LIFE and other resources
      which SHOULD BE SUFFERED and/or INFLICTED DURING any single
      outbreako of hostilities to achieve a des- ired degree of internal
      political authority and social allegiance; 4) how to project, over
      extended periods, the nature and quality of overt warfare which
      must be planned and budgeted to achieve a desired degree of
      contextual stability for the same purpose; factors to be
      determined must include frequency of occurrence, length of phase,
      INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION, extensiveness of geographical
      involvement, and OPTIMUM MEAN LOSS OF LIFE; 5) how to extrapolate
      accurately from the foregoing, for ecological purposes, the
      continuing effect of the war system, over such extended cycles, on
      population pressures, and to adjust the planning of casualty rates
      accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      War Research procedures will necessarily include, but not be
      limited to, the following:<br>
      <br>
      (a) The collation of economic, military, and other relevant date
      into uniform terms, permitting the reversible translation of
      heretofore discrete categories of information.<br>
      <br>
      (b) The development and application of appropriate forms of
      cost-effectiveness analysis suitable for adapting such new
      constructs to computer terminology, programming, and projection.<br>
      <br>
      (c) Extension of the "war games" methods of systems testing to
      apply, as a quasi-adversary proceeding, to the nonmilitary
      functions of war.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Since Both Programs of the WAR/PEACE RESEARCH Agency will
      share the same purpose---to maintain governmental freedom of
      choice in respect to war and peace until the direction of social
      survival is no longer in doubt -- it is of the essence of this
      proposal that the agency be constituted without limitation of
      time. Its examination of existing and proposed institutions will
      be self- liquidating when its own function shall have been
      superseded by the historical developments it will have, at least
      in part, initiated.<br>

      <br>
      14. As in recent draft-law controversy, in which the issue of
      selective deferment of the culturally privileged is often
      carelessly equated with the preservation of the biologically
      "fittest."<br>
      <br>
      15. G.Bouthol, in La Guerre (Paris: Presses universitairies de
      France, 1953) and many other more detailed studies. The useful
      concept of "polemology," for the study of war as an independent
      discipline, is his, as is the notion of "demographic relaxation,"
      the sudden temporary decline in the rate of population increase
      after major wars.<br>
      <br>
      16. This seemingly premature statement is supported by one of our
      own test studies. But it hypothecates both the stabilizing of
      world population growth and the institution of fully adequate
      environmental controls. Under these two conditions, the
      probability of the permanent elimination of involuntary global
      famine is 68 percent by 1976 and 95 percent by 1981.<br>

      1. This round figure is the median taken from our comuptations,
      which cover varying contingencies, but it is sufficient for the
      purpose of general discussion.<br>
      <br>
      2. But less misleading than the more elegant traditional metaphor,
      in which war expenditures are referred to as the "ballast" of the
      economy but which suggests incorrect quantitative relationships.<br>
      <br>
      3. Typical in generality, scope, and rhetoric. We have not used
      any published program as a model; similarities are unavoidably
      coincidental rather than tendentious.<br>

      10. As in Nazi Germany; this type of "ideological" ethnic
      repression, directed to specific sociological ends, should not be
      confused with traditional economic exploitation, as of Negroes in
      the U.S., South Africe, etc.<br>

      Michigan, and California, as well as in Mexico and the U.S.S.R.
      Preliminary test applications are scheduled in Southeast Asia, in
      countries not yet announced.<br>
      <br>
      12. Expressed in the writings of H. Marshall McLuban, in
      Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (New York: McGraw-Hill,
      1964) and elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      13. This rather optimistic estimate was derived by plotting a
      three-dimensional distribution of three arbitratily defined
      variables; the macro-structural, relating to the extension of
      knowledge beyond the capacity of conscious experience; the
      organic, dealing with the manifestations of terrestrial life as
      inherently comprehensible; and the infra-particular, covering the
      subconcep- tual requirements of natural phenomena. Values were
      assigned to the known and unknown in each parameter, tested
      against data from earlier chronologies, and modified heuristically
      until predictable correlations reached a useful level of accuracy.
      "Two decades" means, in this case, 20.6 years, with a standard
      deviation of only 1.8 years. (An incidental finding, not pursued
      to the same degree of accuracy, suggests a greatly accelerated
      resolution of issues in the biological sciences after 1972.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>SECTION 7</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. Since they represent an examination of too small a percentage
      of the eventual options, in terms of "multiple mating," the
      subsystem we developed for this application. But an example will
      indicate how one of the most frequently recurring correlation
      problems--chronological phasing--was brought to light in this way.
      One of the first combinations tested showed remarkably high
      coefficients of compatibility, on a post hoc static basis, but no
      variations of timing, using a thirty-year transition module,
      permitted even marginal synchronization. The combination was thus
      disqualified. This would not rule out the possible adequacy of
      combinations using modifications of the same factors, however,
      since minor variations in a proposed final condition may have
      disproportionate effects on phasing.<br>
      <br>
      2. Edward Teller, quoted in War/Peace Report (December 1964).<br>
      <br>
      3. E.g., the highly publicized "Delphi Technique" and other, more
      sophisticated procedures. A new system, especially suitable for
      institutional analysis, was developed during the course of this
      study in order to hypothecate mensurable "peace games"; a manual
      of this system is being prepared and will be submitted for general
      distribution among appropriate agencies. For older, but still
      useful, techniques, see Norman C. Dalkey's Games and Simulations
      (Santa Monica, Calif.:Rand, 1964).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SECTION 8</b><br>
      <br>
      1. A primer-level example of the obvious and long overdue need for
      such translation is furnished by Kahn (in Thinking About the
      Unthinkable,p.102). Under the heading "Some Awkward Choices" he
      compares four hypothetical policies: a certain loss of $3,000; a
      .1 chance of loss of $300,000; a.01 chance of loss of $30,000,000;
      and a .001 chance of loss of $3,000,000,000. A government
      decision-maker would "very likely" choose in that order. But what
      if "lives are at stake rather than dollars?" Kahn suggests that
      the order of choice would be reversed, although current experience
      does not support this opinion. Rational war research can and must
      make it possible to express, without ambiguity, lives in terms of
      dollars and vice versa; the choices need not be, and cannot be,
      "awkward."<br>
      <br>
      2. Again, an overdue extension of an obvious application of
      techniques up to now limited such circumscribed purposes as
      improving kill-ammunition ratios determining local choice between
      precision and saturation bombing, and other minor tactical, and
      occasionally strategic, ends. The slowness of Rand, I.D.A., and
      other responsible analytic organizations to extend
      cost-effectiveness and related concepts beyond early-phase
      applications has already been widely re- marked on and criticized
      elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      3. The inclusion of institutional factors in war-game techniques
      has been given some rudimentary consideration in the Hudson
      Institute's Study for Hypothetical Narratives for Use in Command
      and Control Systems Planning (by William Pfaff and Edmund
      Stillman; Final report published in 1963). But here, as with other
      war and peace studies to date, what has blocked the logical
      extension of new analytic techniques has been a general failure to
      understand and properly evaluate the non-military functions of
      war. <br>
