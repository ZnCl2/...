      <p><b>Summary:<br>
          <br>
        </b>A strong electric field applied to a section of the Keystone
        pipeline can smooth oil flow and yield significant pump energy
        savings. Once aligned with an electric field, oil retained its
        low viscosity and turbulence for more than 11 hours before
        returning to its original viscosity. The process is repeatable
        and the researchers envision placing aligning stations spaced
        along a pipeline, significantly reducing the energy necessary to
        transport oil. <br>
        <br>
        Researchers have shown that a strong electric field applied to a
        section of the Keystone pipeline can smooth oil flow and yield
        significant pump energy savings. <br>
        <br>
        Traditionally, pipeline oil is heated over several miles in
        order to reduce the oil's thickness (which is also known as
        viscosity), but this requires a large amount of energy and
        counter-productively increases turbulence within the flow. In
        2006 Rongjia Tao of Temple University in Pennsylvania proposed a
        more efficient way of improving flow rates by applying an
        electric field to the oil. The idea is to electrically align
        particles within the crude oil, which reduces viscosity and
        turbulence.<br>
        <br>
        To test this, Tao collaborated with energy company Save The
        World Air, Inc. to develop an Applied Oil Technology (AOT)
        device that links to oil pipelines and produces an electric
        field along the direction of the oil flow. Recent trials on oil
        pipelines in Wyoming and China verified that crude oil particles
        form short chains in an electric field. These chains reduce
        viscosity in the direction of flow to a minimum. At the same
        time the viscosity perpendicular to the flow increases, which
        helps suppress turbulence in the overall flow.<br>
        <br>
        This past summer Tao and his colleagues also successfully tested
        the AOT device on a section of the Keystone pipeline near
        Wichita, Kansas.<br>
        <br>
        "People were amazed at the energy savings when we first tested
        this device. They didn't initially understand the physics," said
        Tao. "A second test with an independent company was arranged and
        found the same thing." Tests on a section of the Keystone
        pipeline found that the same flow rate could be achieved with a
        75 percent reduction of pump power from 2.8 megawatts to 0.7
        megawatts, thanks to the AOT device. The device itself uses 720
        watts.<br>
        <br>
        Once aligned, the oil retained its low viscosity and turbulence
        for more than 11 hours before returning to its original
        viscosity. But the process is repeatable and Tao and his
        colleagues envision AOT stations spaced along a pipeline,
        significantly reducing the energy necessary to transport oil.
        This work was published in January 2015 in Physical Review E and
        Tao will present the additional Keystone pipeline test results
        at the American Physical Society March Meeting 2015 in San
        Antonio (March 2-6).<br>
        <br>
        Previously Tao has also shown that the same technique applied
        with a magnetic field can reduce blood viscosity by 20 to 30
        percent, published in 2011 in Physical Review E. With clinical
        trials, Tao says this could represent a future treatment for
        heart disease.<br>

      <p><b> Abstract<br>
          <br>
        </b>Flows through pipes, such as crude oil through pipelines,
        are the most common and important method of transportation of
        fluids. To enhance the flow output along the pipeline requires
        reducing viscosity and suppressing turbulence simultaneously and
        effectively. Unfortunately, no method is currently available to
        accomplish both goals simultaneously. Here we show that
        electrorheology provides an efficient solution. When a strong
        electric field is applied along the flow direction in a small
        section of pipeline, the field polarizes and aggregates the
        particles suspended inside the base liquid into short chains
        along the flow direction. Such aggregation breaks the rotational
        symmetry and makes the fluid viscosity anisotropic. In the
        directions perpendicular to the flow, the viscosity is
        substantially increased, effectively suppressing the turbulence.
        Along the flow direction, the viscosity is significantly
        reduced; thus the flow along the pipeline is enhanced. Recent
        field tests with a crude oil pipeline fully confirm the
        theoretical results.<br>
        <b><br>
          Figure 1<br>
          As the liquid suspension flow passes a strong local electric
          field, the suspended particles are aggregated into short
          chains along the field direction.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2<br>
          Small-angle neutron scattering has confirmed the aggregation.
          With no electric field, the scattering is isotropic and
          sparse, indicating the particles are randomly distributed in
          the oil (left). Under an electric field of 250V/mm (middle),
          the scattering reveals short chains of particles aggregated
          along the field direction. When E=400V/mm, the short chain has
          a prolate spheroid shape (right).<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3<br>
          The electric field makes the viscosity along the flow
          direction much lower than the original viscosity, while it
          raises the viscosity perpendicular to the flow much higher
          than the original viscosity.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 4<br>
          The AOT device is placed downstream next to the pump.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 5<br>
          After the AOT device was turned on, there was less pressure
          loss. When the loop was filled with all treated crude oil, the
          pressure loss was down 40%. After the device was turned off,
          the pressure loss returned to the original value as the
          untreated crude oil pushed the treated crude oil away.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 6<br>
          The electric-field-treated oil flow has pump pressure linearly
          proportional to the flow rate, indicating the flow remains
          laminar as the Reynolds number reaches 6348. The untreated oil
          has pump pressure increasing much faster than the linear
          relation with the flow rate, indicting the flow becomes
          turbulent when the Reynolds number &gt;2300.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 7<br>
          Outside the electric field, the viscosity of treated crude oil
          goes up slowly after the treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 8<br>
          During the test, the treated crude oil kept its reduced
          viscosity for 11 h after the AOT device was shut off.<br>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Want Better Mileage? Simple Device Which
              Uses Electrical Field Could Boost Gas Efficiency Up To 20%</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b><i>ScienceDaily (Sep. 26, 2008)</i></b> — With the high cost
        of gasoline and diesel fuel impacting costs for automobiles,
        trucks, buses and the overall economy, a Temple University
        physics professor has developed a simple device which could
        dramatically improve fuel efficiency as much as 20 percent. </p>
      <p>According to <b>Rongjia Tao</b>, Chair of Temple's Physics
        Department, the small device consists of an electrically charged
        tube that can be attached to the fuel line of a car's engine
        near the fuel injector. With the use of a power supply from the
        vehicle's battery, the device creates an electric field that
        thins fuel, or reduces its viscosity, so that smaller droplets
        are injected into the engine. That leads to more efficient and
        cleaner combustion than a standard fuel injector, he says. </p>
      <p>Six months of road testing in a diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz
        automobile showed that the device increased highway fuel from 32
        miles per gallon to 38 mpg, a <b>20 percent boost</b>, and a
        12-15 percent gain in city driving. </p>
      <p>The results of the laboratory and road tests verifying that
        this simple device can boost gas mileage. </p>
      <p>"We expect the device will have wide applications on all types
        of internal combustion engines, present ones and future ones,"
        Tao wrote in the study published in Energy &amp; Fuels. </p>
      <p>Further improvements in the device could lead to even better
        mileage, he suggests, and cited engines powered by gasoline,
        biodiesel, and kerosene as having potential use of the device. </p>
      <p>Temple has applied for a patent on this technology, which has
        been licensed to California-based Save The World Air, Inc., an
        environmentally conscientious enterprise focused on the design,
        development, and commercialization of revolutionary technologies
        targeted at reducing emissions from internal combustion engines.
      </p>
      <p>According to Joe Dell, Vice President of Marketing for STWA,
        the company is currently working with a trucking company near
        Reading, Pa., to test the device on diesel-powered trucks, where
        he estimates it could increase fuel efficiency as much as 6-12
        percent. </p>
      <p>Dell predicts this type of increased fuel efficiency could save
        tens of billions of dollars in the trucking industry and have a
        major impact on the economy through the lowering of costs to
        deliver goods and services. </p>
      <p>"Temple University is very excited about the translation of
        this new important technology from the research laboratory to
        the marketplace," said Larry F. Lemanski, Senior Vice President
        for Research and Strategic Initiatives at Temple. "This
        discovery promises to significantly improve fuel efficiency in
        all types of internal combustion engine powered vehicles and at
        the same time will have far-reaching effects in reducing
        pollution of our environment." </p>

      <p>Researchers say they’ve produced an electric device that can
        boost fuel efficiency in cars and trucks and by as much as 20
        percent </p>
      <p>Researchers at Temple University today said today they had
        developed a simple electrically charged tube, which when
        attached to a car’s fuel line can boost energy efficiency by as
        much as 20 percent. </p>
      <p>Temple University physics professor Rongjia Tao said the
        charged tube is powered by the vehicle’s battery. In essence,
        the electrical field powered by the battery thins the fuel and
        reduces its viscosity (see Nano-ceramic boosts fuel efficiency).
      </p>
      <p>That means smaller droplets can be injected into the engine.
        This process of generating small droplets leads to more
        efficient and cleaner combustion than a standard fuel injector,
        according to the researcher. </p>
      <p>Temple University said the device has undergone six months of
        road testing in a diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz automobile.
        Results from the testing revealed the device boosted highway
        fuel mileage by 20 percent, from 32 miles-per-gallon to 38 mpg.
        On city streets, the device only provided a 12 to 15 percent
        gain. </p>
      <p>Further improvements in the device could lead to even better
        mileage (see Driving team takes on Guinness efficiency record).
        What's more, the device can work in other types of internal
        combustion engines powered by gasoline, biodiesel and kerosene.
      </p>
      <p>Researchers said there is more work to be done on the prototype
        device to further improve mileage yields. Temple University said
        it has applied for a patent on the technology. The university
        said Calif.-based Save The World Air has licensed the
        technology. </p>
      <p>The research results were published in <i>Energy &amp; Fuels</i>,
        a bi-monthly journal published by the American Chemical Society.

              Pipes</font></b> </p>

      <p>Zapping thick crude oil with a magnetic or electric field could
        make it flow more smoothly through pipes. The technique, which
        reduces the viscosity of the liquid, could make transporting
        crude through cold underwater pipes easier and cheaper,
        researchers claim. </p>
      <p>The cost of transporting oil is a major factor in the energy
        economy, although the type of oil being moved is changing. "More
        heavy oil is being pumped. Lighter crude is being found less and
        less," says Rongjia Tao, a physicist at Temple University in
        Philadelphia, US. </p>
      <p>Since heavy crude is more viscous, it flows more slowly through
        the pipes, reducing the volume of oil that can be pumped. If it
        flows too slowly, oil companies try diluting it with gasoline or
        other solvents, or sometimes heating the oil. But those
        techniques can be expensive and hard to implement on ocean-based
        oil rigs. </p>
      <p>Tao says the viscosity of a suspension is partly the result of
        the size of the suspended particles. Smaller particles create a
        fluid that is more viscous than large particles. </p>
      <p>The two researchers reasoned that if they could get the small
        particles to clump together, or aggregate, viscosity would go
        down. First they tested the theory with a suspension of iron
        nanoparticles in silicon oil. They applied a magnetic field to
        the suspension, and did indeed observe a reduction in viscosity.
      </p>
      <p><b>Ongoing effect</b> </p>
      <p>Tao says that the magnetic field apparently caused the iron
        particles to stick together into larger clumps. Once the field
        was turned off they continued to stick together for several
        hours, only gradually breaking apart. </p>
      <p>Tao and his colleague Xiaojun Xu then decided to see what
        affect magnetic and electric fields would have on the viscosity
        of crude oil. </p>
      <p>Crude oil can contain either paraffin, asphalt, or both. The
        researchers found that a magnetic field reduced the viscosity of
        paraffin-based crude oil by about 15% when applied at 1.33 Tesla
        for 50 seconds. The reduction in viscosity lasted for several
        hours, gradually returning to normal. Tao says the magnetic
        field seems to have polarised the paraffin particles, causing
        them to clump together in the same way as the iron particles. </p>
      <p>The magnetic field did not work on asphalt-based crude oil,
        however. So Tao and Xu decided to try applying an electric field
        to this mixture. They applied a powerful electric field to the
        oil and again saw a reduction in viscosity. Tao believes the
        particles were similarly polarised. Whatever the process, the
        particles clumped together before gradually breaking apart over
        several hours. <br>
        Cost sensitive </p>
      <p>Tao says that the technique could eventually be useful in oil
        pipelines. Powerful magnets could be positioned at regular
        intervals along the pipeline, or electrified grids could run on
        the inside. </p>
      <p>But Ross Chow of the Alberta Research Council in Edmonton,
        Canada, says that the researchers had to apply large amounts of
        electrical energy for fairly small decreases in viscosity. He
        also says it is not clear whether Tao and Xu's theoretical
        explanation of what is happening is correct. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, Chow says the effect seems to be real, and
        agrees that further research might lead to an economic way of
        using magnetic and electric fields in pipelines. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;Researchers have figured out a new way to make crude oil
        flow faster using electric and magnetic pulses. They hope such
        technologies will help harvest crude oil buried in fields deep
        below the seafloor. </p>
      <p>Cold temperatures can make it nearly impossible for thick
        asphalt-based crude oil to flow through a pipeline, such as the
        TransCanada Mainline in western Canada. New research suggests
        electric pulses could ease the oil flow. Photograph is copyright
        TransCanada Pipelines Limited. </p>
      <p>Low temperatures in offshore pipelines decrease oil’s ability
        to flow, so that it is much more difficult to move through the
        pipelines. But the seemingly simplest solution — heating those
        pipelines — has proven difficult and expensive, says Rongjia
        Tao, a physicist at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pa. </p>
      <p>While some companies still use heat, perhaps the most common
        way energy companies currently reduce oil viscosity is through
        the use of chemical additives, which modify the internal
        structure of the oil and allow it to flow more easily, says Ken
        Barker, a chemist with Baker Petrolite in St. Louis. Companies,
        however, are always trying new options to improve the efficiency
        of the process. </p>
      <p>In China and Russia, for example, companies frequently dilute
        the crude oil with gasoline, Tao says. And the Department of
        Energy has looked at adding bacteria or other biological agents
        to improve flow rates. People also have tried using magnets
        since at least the 1970s, Barker says, but until now, such
        experiments have lacked a solid foundation. </p>
      <p>The new method, described by Tao and colleague Xiaojun Xu in
        the Sept. 20 Energy &amp; Fuels is based on a simple concept,
        Tao says: Send a magnetic or electric pulse through the pipeline
        and into the oil. That pulse causes the wax-like molecules in
        the crude oil to cluster together into a smaller number of large
        particles, which makes it flow more easily. The trick, he says,
        is not to overdo it or you can have the opposite effect; too
        much clumping will increase the viscosity of the oil. </p>
      <p>So Tao and Xu ran a series of experiments to see exactly what
        level of pulses was needed to maximize the flow rate of both
        paraffin-based oil and asphalt-based oil. Paraffin-based crude
        is common in Asia and the Middle East, and asphalt-based oil is
        most common in North America. </p>
      <p>They found that 1- to 3-second-long magnetic pulses were best
        for increasing the flow rate of paraffin oil, while seconds-long
        electric pulses worked best on asphalt-based oil. The pulses
        could keep the oil flowing easily for up to 12 hours. Once the
        oil started to thicken again, the pulses could be reapplied to
        thin the oil for another few hours, Tao says. In a pipeline, the
        magnetic or electric pulse machines could be separated several
        kilometers apart to apply the pulses as soon as the oil
        viscosity starts to increase, he says. </p>
      <p>Barker says that it is probably accurate that applying a pulse
        will affect the oil’s viscosity, but to what degree, he does not
        know. “This research is good and offers an explanation for why
        these [electric and magnetic] fields will work, but how
        significant it will be remains to be seen,” he says. Every crude
        oil has slightly different properties, he says, and Tao and Xu
        only looked at several samples, so more research is necessary. </p>
      <p>Tao agrees that they need to further experiment with flow rates
        in the field and with different types of oil, including heavy
        oil and oil sands. But meanwhile, he and Xu have sought a patent
        on their technology, and a California company is planning to
        develop it. </p>

      <p>The thin glass tube was held upright with a clamp, but the
        thick, dark oil inside didn't budge - much like ketchup stuck in
        an overturned bottle. No problem. Rongjia Tao brushed the
        outside of the tube a few times with a small magnet, and the oil
        began to flow slowly downward. Tao, a physics professor at
        Temple University, wants to take his technique from glass tubes
        to pipelines, improving the flow of tarlike crude oil in oil
        fields worldwide - especially in cold, deepwater environments
        where it takes more energy to pump the thick stuff. In today's

        <p><b><font size="+1">Simple Device which uses Electrical Field
              could Boost Gas Efficiency</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>With the high cost of gasoline and diesel fuel impacting costs
        for automobiles, trucks, buses and the overall economy, a Temple
        University physics professor has developed a simple device which
        could dramatically improve fuel efficiency as much as 20
        percent. According to Rongjia Tao, Chair of Temple's Physics
        Department, the small device consists of an electrically charged
        tube that can be attached to the fuel line of a car's engine
        near the fuel injector. With the use of a power supply from the
        vehicle's battery, the device creates an electric field that
        thins fuel, or reduces its viscosity, so that smaller droplets
        are injected into the engine. That leads to more efficient and
        cleaner combustion than a standard fuel injector, he says. </p>
      <p>Six months of road testing in a diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz
        automobile showed that the device increased highway fuel from 32
        miles per gallon to 38 mpg, a 20 percent boost, and a 12-15
        percent gain in city driving. </p>
      <p>The results of the laboratory and road tests verifying that
        this simple device can boost gas mileage was published in Energy
        &amp; Fuels, a bi-monthly journal published by the American
        Chemical Society. </p>
      <p>"We expect the device will have wide applications on all types
        of internal combustion engines, present ones and future ones,"
        Tao wrote in the published study, "Electrorheology Leads to
        Efficient Combustion." </p>
      <p>Further improvements in the device could lead to even better
        mileage, he suggests, and cited engines powered by gasoline,
        biodiesel, and kerosene as having potential use of the device. </p>
      <p>Temple has applied for a patent on this technology, which has
        been licensed to California-based Save The World Air, Inc., an
        environmentally conscientious enterprise focused on the design,
        development, and commercialization of revolutionary technologies
        targeted at reducing emissions from internal combustion engines.
      </p>
      <p>According to Joe Dell, Vice President of Marketing for STWA,
        the company is currently working with a trucking company near
        Reading, Pa., to test the device on diesel-powered trucks, where
        he estimates it could increase fuel efficiency as much as 6-12
        percent. </p>
      <p>Dell predicts this type of increased fuel efficiency could save
        tens of billions of dollars in the trucking industry and have a
        major impact on the economy through the lowering of costs to
        deliver goods and services. </p>
      <p>"Temple University is very excited about the translation of
        this new important technology from the research laboratory to
        the marketplace," said Larry F. Lemanski, Senior Vice President
        for Research and Strategic Initiatives at Temple. "This
        discovery promises to significantly improve fuel efficiency in
        all types of internal combustion engine powered vehicles and at
        the same time will have far-reaching effects in reducing
        pollution of our environment." </p>

      <p>Presidential candidates have suggested inflating your tires,
        mechanics instruct motorists to keep their cars in shape and
        everyday drivers are cutting their travels when possible. But
        the physics department at Temple has developed a part for
        vehicles that may impact drivers’ wallets. </p>
      <p>Rongjia Tao, chair of the physics department, has developed a
        small device that when connected to the fuel line in diesel
        engines can improve gas efficiency by 20 percent. </p>
      <p>The small device Rongjia Tao invented can increase gas
        efficiency by up to 20 percent. It was tested on a Mercedes-Benz
        300D (Ana Zhilkova/TTN). </p>
      <p>The device receives power from a vehicle’s battery to create an
        electric field that thins fuel, resulting in smaller amounts of
        fuel being injected into the engine. </p>
      <p>Development of the device began in 2006 with Tao and five other
        researchers, two of whom were Temple students. </p>
      <p>“The major difficulty was that there was a shortage of good
        technicians in our machine shop to manufacture the device,” Tao
        said. </p>
      <p>After testing the device on a Mercedes-Benz 300D, there was an
        increase in highway miles per gallon from 32 to 38. City driving
        tests resulted in a 15 percent gain. </p>
      <p>The group intended to improve fuel efficiency and decrease
        pollutant emissions according to the study published in Energy
        &amp; Fuels. </p>
      <p>Diesel-powered vehicles gain more mpg, along with less black
        plumes of exhaust. The use of biodiesel, an alternative diesel
        fuel made from renewable resources, has lower emissions compared
        to petroleum diesel. </p>
      <p>The device was selected by Save The World Air, Inc. According
        to its Web site, STWA seeks “to provide a comprehensive range of
        cost-effective and value-added products to the worldwide
        combustion engine market” that are deemed clean technology
        resources. </p>
      <p>STWA became aware of Tao’s product through a client who
        provided research grants. The corporation purchased licenses to
        Tao’s patents. STWA has a contract with AWI Truck Company of
        Reading, Pa., to install the device on its trucks. </p>
      <p>Eddie Casanova, an employee of Temple’s grounds department,
        drives a diesel truck for the university. Temple pays for the
        fuel in the truck Casanova drives. </p>
      <p>“We should have gotten the first choice,” Casanova said about
        the device being used in Reading rather than being implemented
        on campus first. </p>
      <p>Expanding the research to gasoline engines is under way, as
        testing is scheduled to be performed soon, Tao said. </p>
      <p>“I feel that basic science research can be very useful in
        solving some big technology issues.” </p>

          petroleum-based fluids. The method includes the step of
          applying an electric field of sufficient strength and for a

          reduction in viscosity of the fluid. </p>
        <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0002]The present invention relates to petroleum-based
          fluids. More specifically, it relates to a method for reducing
          the viscosity and facilitating the flow of petroleum-based
          fluids. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0003]It is well known in the art that petroleum-based
          fluids, such as crude oil, have viscosity characteristics of
          liquid suspensions or emulsions. As a result, the three basic
          types of crude oil--paraffin-based, asphalt-based, and
          mixed-base (paraffin-based and asphalt-based mixed)--all
          exhibit the characteristic of increased viscosity
          corresponding to decreased fluid temperatures. In
          paraffin-based crude oil, as the temperature of the fluid
          decreases, especially when the temperature falls just below
          the temperature at which wax begins to precipitate (called the
          wax-appearance temperature), paraffin in the fluid
          crystallizes into many nanometer-sized particles which suspend
          in the solvent and increase the apparent viscosity of the
          fluid. In asphalt-based crude oil, asphalt in the fluid
          solidifies into an increasing number of asphaltene particles
          as the temperature decreases, resulting in a continuous
          increase in apparent viscosity. Mixed-based crude oil likewise
          demonstrates an inverse viscosity/temperature relationship
          similar to characteristics of both paraffin-based and
          asphalt-based crude oils. This inverse viscosity/temperature
          relationship is particularly problematic when the increase in
          viscosity fouls pipelines in which crude oil is transported. </p>
        <p>[0004]In addition to the viscosity increase at lower
          temperatures, crude oil precipitates wax or asphaltene
          particles at lower temperatures, which is particularly
          problematic because of its detrimental effect on the
          transportation of crude oil via pipeline. As a result of crude
          oil wax or asphaltene precipitation, pipelines must be
          frequently shut down and cleaned to scrape out wax or
          asphaltene buildup in the piping to prevent obstruction of
          crude oil flow. </p>
        <p>[0005]With increasing demands on world oil supplies and the
          low temperature climates, for example offshore oil wells and
          the Artic and sub-Arctic environs, in which oil is extracted
          or through which it is transported, it is increasingly
          important to develop methods for improving the flow of crude
          oil in pipelines at lower temperatures. </p>
        <p>[0006]For the reasons described above, a method for
          decreasing viscosity and facilitating fluid flow of
          petroleum-based fluids, such as crude oil, is desirable. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0007]According to the method of the present invention, there
          is provided a method for reducing the viscosity of petroleum
          based fluids. The method comprises applying to the fluid an
          electric field of sufficient strength and of a sufficient
          period of time to reduce viscosity of the fluid and applying
          that field for a time sufficient to facilitate improved flow
          of the fluid. The selection of an appropriate strength
          electric field and an appropriate time period for application
          of the field is necessary to produce a desired reduction in
          viscosity of the petroleum-based fluid and improvement in the
          flow thereof. The present invention is particularly useful in
          the transportation of crude oil through pipelines where
          improved fluid flow is desirable, and more specifically where
          cooler fluid temperatures cause increased fluid viscosity, and
          raising the fluid's temperature in order to reduce the
          viscosity is difficult to achieve. </p>

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0016]The present invention provides a method for reducing
          viscosity and improving the flow of petroleum-based fluids, by
          applying to the fluid an electric field of sufficient strength
          and for a period of time sufficient to reduce viscosity of the
          fluid. </p>
        <p>[0017]The method is directed to petroleum-based fluids, such
          as crude oil, but is not limited to this particular
          petroleum-based fluid. Thus the method is applicable, for
          example, to crude oil, including but not limited to paraffin
          based crude oil, asphalt based crude oil, mixed based crude
          oil (a combination of both paraffin-based and asphalt-based),
          and mixtures thereof. More particularly the present invention
          is directed to fluids which are too viscous, due at least in
          part to temperature considerations, to be easily transported
          or piped from one location to another. </p>
        <p>[0018]It has been discovered that by applying an electric
          field to the fluid, viscosity of the fluid can be reduced to
          facilitate flow of the fluid and/or prevent precipitation of
          solids which might cause blockage or reduced flow through
          pipes or vessels through which the fluid must pass. In order
          to obtain a desired reduction in viscosity, the applied
          electric field must be of a strength of at least about 10 V/mm
          in order to produce a reduction in viscosity of the fluid. For
          example, the field strength may suitably be in the range of
          about 10 V/mm up to about 2000 V/mm, for example in the range
          of about 400 V/mm to about 1500 V/mm. The selection of a
          particular value within this range is expected to depend on
          the composition of the fluid, the desired degree of reduction
          in viscosity, the temperature of the fluid, and the period
          during which the field is to be applied. It will be
          appreciated that if the field strength is too low or the
          application period too short no significant change in
          viscosity will result. Conversely if the strength of the
          electric field is too high or the period of application too
          long, the viscosity of the fluid may actually increase. </p>
        <p>[0019]As indicated above, the duration of exposure of the
          fluid to the electric field is also important in order to
          reduce the viscosity. The exposure period is suitably in the
          range of about 1 second to about 300 seconds, for example,
          about 1 second to about 100 seconds. </p>
        <p>[0020]As the fluid continues its flow over extended periods
          of time, the viscosity following application of the field as
          described above will tend to increase slowly back toward its
          original value. It may therefore be necessary, in order to
          maintain a desired viscosity range, to reapply the electric
          field periodically at a point or multiple points downstream
          from the point at which the initial electric field was
          applied. For example, it may be desirable to reapply the
          electric field at intervals ranging, for example, from about
          15 minutes to about 60 minutes as the fluid progresses along
          its path of travel to ensure that viscosity is always below a
          predetermined level. In crude oil applications, it may thus be
          desirable to locate electric fields at a series of points
          downstream from the initial point to the destination point.
          Since crude oil in a pipeline flows several miles per hour,
          applying an electric field at intervals every couple of miles
          would allow viscosity to be maintained below the predetermined
          value. The viscosity would continually be driven to the lower
          values by counteracting the rebounding that occurs as the
          crude oil flows through areas of the pipe not exposed to the
          electric fields. </p>
        <p>[0021]By applying the electric field within these ranges of
          strength and period, nearby paraffin particles or asphaltene
          particles are forced to aggregate into larger particles that
          are limited to micrometer size, while not permitting enough
          time or strength to let these particles form macroscopic
          clusters. As the average particle size increases, the
          viscosity is reduced. Once the electric field is removed, the
          rate that the viscosity returns to its original value
          decreases over time as the aggregated particles gradually
          disassemble. It may take as long as about 8-10 hours for the
          viscosity to return to its initial value. </p>
        <p>[0022]The electric field used may be a direct current (DC) or
          an alternating current (AC) electric field. When applying an
          AC electric field, the frequency of the applied field is in
          the range of about 1 to about 3000 Hz, for example from about
          25 Hz to about 1500 Hz. This field can be applied in a
          direction parallel to the direction of the flow of the fluid
          or it can be applied in a direction other than the direction
          of the flow of the fluid. </p>
        <p>[0023]The strength of the field and duration of the period of
          time the fluid is exposed to the field varies depending on the
          type of crude oil involved, such as paraffin-based crude oil,
          asphalt-based crude oil, mixed-based crude oil, or a mixture
          thereof. It has been determined that the higher the initial
          viscosity of the fluid before being subjected to the electric
          field, the greater the reduction in viscosity after being
          subjected to the electric field. </p>
        <p>[0024]In one embodiment, the electric field is applied using
          a capacitor 10 wherein the crude oil flows through the
          capacitor 10, experiencing a short pulse electric field as a
          constant voltage is applied to the capacitor. The capacitor
          may be of the type which includes at least two metallic meshes
          20 connected to a large tube 30, as illustrated in FIG. 1,
          wherein the crude oil passes through the mesh. </p>
        <p>[0025]It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
          other types of capacitors may also be used. In this
          embodiment, the electric field is applied in a direction
          parallel to the direction of fluid flow. These types of
          capacitors can be used to generate pulse electric fields that
          can be applied to crude oil in pipelines. </p>
        <p>[0026]In another embodiment, the electric field is generated
          by a capacitor across which the electric field is applied in a
          direction other than the direction of the flow of the fluid.
          It is contemplated that the electric field can be applied in
          almost any feasible direction across the fluid and still
          achieve a reduction in viscosity. </p>
        <p>[0027]The following are examples that are illustrative of the
          invention: </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
        <p>[0028]A DC electric field of 600 V/mm was applied to a
          paraffin-based crude oil sample for 60 seconds, which had an
          initial viscosity of 44.02 cp at 10.degree. C. After exposure
          to the electric field, the viscosity dropped to 35.21 cp, or
          about 20% of its initial value. After the electric field was
          removed, the viscosity, as shown in FIG. 2, gradually
          increased. After about 30 minutes, the viscosity had climbed
          to 41 cp, still 7% below the original viscosity. The rate of
          viscosity increase after the first 30-minute period dropped
          considerably. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
        <p>[0029]A paraffin-based crude oil sample with an initial
          viscosity of 33.05 cp at 10.degree. C., was exposed to a 50-Hz
          AC electric field of 600V/mm for 30 seconds. The viscosity of
          the fluid dropped to about 26.81 cp, or 19% of the initial
          value. After 30 minutes, the viscosity climbed to only about
          30 cp, still about 10% below the original value, as shown in
          FIG. 3. </p>
        <p>[0030]The results as shown in Examples 1 and 2 indicate that
          both DC electric fields and low-frequency AC fields are
          effective in reducing the apparent viscosity of the crude oil
          samples tested. Experiments also revealed that it takes
          approximately 10 hours for the viscosity which has been
          reduced by the applied electric field to return to its
          original value. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
        <p>[0031]The duration of the applied electric field to the
          sample was determined for the optimal duration of the electric
          field. For the paraffin-based crude oil sample tested, the
          optimal duration was determined to be 15 seconds for an
          applied DC electric field strength of 600 V/mm. The lowest
          viscosity immediately after the electric field was applied was
          19.44 cp, 17.1% down from the original viscosity value of
          23.45 cp, before the electric field was applied, as shown in
          FIG. 4. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
        <p>[0032]For a crude oil sample having a viscosity of about
          44.02 cp at 10.degree. C. before the electric field was
          applied, the optimal duration was found to be about 60 seconds
          using an electric field of 600 V/mm. The sample's viscosity
          dropped to about 35.21 cp, or 20%, for this time period, as is
          illustrated in FIG. 5. This result shows that the effect of
          the electric field gets stronger as the viscosity of crude oil
          gets higher. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 5</b> </p>
        <p>[0033]The graph shown in FIG. 6 is a plot of the results for
          the sample in Example 2 at its optimal duration. The crude oil
          originally had viscosity 23.45 cp. After application of a DC
          field of 600V/mm for 15 seconds, the viscosity dropped to
          19.44 cp, down 4.01 cp, a 17.10% reduction. On the other hand,
          as shown in Example 1, the viscosity was down 8.81 cp, a 20%
          reduction. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 6</b> </p>
        <p>[0034]Further experimentation in which samples of crude oil
          were tested at 10.degree. and 20.degree. revealed that the
          electric field's effect is stronger when the temperature of
          the fluid is lower. As the temperature is decreased, the
          volume fraction of paraffin particles gets higher; therefore,
          the apparent viscosity gets higher and the effect of the
          electric field on the fluid viscosity also becomes more
          pronounced. In Example 6, the paraffin-based crude oil was
          tested at both 20.degree. C. and 10.degree. C. and the results
          indicated that the electric field effect at 10.degree. C. is
          stronger than that at 20.degree. C. For example, at 20.degree.
          C. the largest viscosity drop was less than 10%, while at
          10.degree. C. it was significantly higher than 10%. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 7</b> </p>
        <p>[0035]An asphalt-based crude oil sample at 23.5.degree. C.,
          having a kinetic viscosity 773.8 cSt, required about 8 seconds
          of exposure to an applied electric field of 1000 V/mm for
          viscosity reduction. In the sample, the kinetic viscosity
          immediately dropped to 669.5 cSt, down 104.3 cSt or
          approximately 13.5% After about 90 minutes, the kinetic
          viscosity was at 706.8 cSt, still 67 cSt below the original
          value. During the experiment, the temperature was maintained
          at 23.5.degree. C. The results are shown in FIG. 7. </p>
        <p>[0036]In comparing the effects of applying a magnetic field
          with the effects of applying an electric field to the
          asphalt-based crude oil, it was determined that the magnetic
          field had only a minimal effect on the viscosity of the
          sample, however, application of the electric field to the same
          sample reduced the viscosity of the asphalt-based crude oil
          significantly. </p>
        <p>[0037]Another feature of the present invention is that it
          also slows the precipitation of wax from crude oil. As the
          nanoscale paraffin particles aggregate to micrometer-sized
          particles, the available surface area for crystallization is
          dramatically reduced. Thus, the precipitation of wax from
          crude oil is significantly decreased. </p>
        <p>[0038]Although the invention is illustrated and described
          herein with reference to specific embodiments, the invention
          is not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather,
          various modifications may be made in the details within the
          scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without
          departing from the invention. It is contemplated that the
          invention, while described with respect to crude oil, may be
          useful in other applications where increased petroleum-based
          fluid viscosity is problematic and inhibits flow of the fluid.

          particular to methods and devices for affecting the physical
          properties of the hydrocarbons using a magnetic field. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND ART</b> </p>
        <p>[0002]The use of magnetic devices and methods for the
          treatment of hydrocarbons is known in the prior art. However,
          the mechanisms and effects of such treatment are not well
          known and difficult to predict. </p>
        <p>[0003]A sample of prior art in the general field of magnetic
          treatment of fuels is as follows: [0004]U.S. Pat. No.

        <p>[0013]The prior art documents, of which the above represent
          only a small proportion, are specifically directed towards the

          fuel when burnt in an engine. </p>
        <p>[0014]However, there are also a number of documents which
          propose devices for the "conditioning of a fluid or fuel" with
          the application of the device being left vague. An outline of

          fluids </p>
        <p>[0018]This document discloses a device for the magnetic
          treatment of fluids such as gases or liquids. The device
          includes a plurality of sets of magnets (permanent or
          electromagnets) for imparting a magnetic field to a fluid. The
          magnets are arranged peripherally about a pipe or other fluid
          conduit within which is a flowing fluid, and the device
          utilises magnets having different magnetic field strengths for
          varying the field flux along the length of the pipe or fluid
          conduit. It is to be noted that in the background of the
          invention portion of the specification, the problems discussed
          relate to the prevention of scaling, corrosion or algae growth
          in pipes. Magnetic devices are also discussed in the context
          of improving the fuel consumption of, and reducing the
          undesirable omissions of engines. </p>
        <p>[0019]Paraffins are a major problem in the production of some
          crude oils. Although paraffins usually remain in solution in
          the formation, as the oil is produced some of the light ends
          are lost which can alter the crystalline pattern of the
          paraffin allowing it to precipitate and/or create a paraffin
          wax due to temperature changes. Approximately 40% of the cost
          to bring useable petroleum to the market is in the control of
          paraffin. </p>
        <p>[0020]It is known to use chemicals, usually acids and
          expensive biocides, to prevent, dissolve or remove these
          materials from the pipes. However, these are not always
          effective. The chemicals may be toxic or expensive and
          frequently these chemicals provide a long term operating
          expense as they must be continuously added to the fluid. </p>

        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0022]The present invention is directed to an apparatus for
          the magnetic treatment of fluids which may at least partially
          overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages or
          provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice. </p>
        <p>[0023]In one form, the invention resides in an apparatus for
          the magnetic treatment of fluids which produces a change in at
          least one physical or rheological characteristic of the fluid
          treated, the apparatus including at least one magnetic means
          for applying a magnetic field to a fluid. </p>
        <p>[0024]In a more particular form, the invention resides in an
          apparatus for the magnetic treatment of fluids which produces
          at least one magnetic field for a period of time, T.sub.c at
          or above a critical magnetic field strength, H.sub.c, the
          period T.sub.c and the field strength H.sub.c determined
          relative to one another and dependant upon the properties of
          the fluid. </p>
        <p>[0025]In another form, the invention may reside in a method
          for the magnetic treatment of fluids, the method including the
          step of applying at least one magnetic field to a fluid to be
          treated. </p>
        <p>[0026]In a more particular form, the invention resides in a
          method for the magnetic treatment of fluids the method
          including the step of applying at least one magnetic field for
          a period of time, T.sub.c at or above a critical magnetic
          field strength, H.sub.c, the period T.sub.c and the field
          strength H.sub.c determined relative to one another and
          dependant upon the properties of the fluid. </p>
        <p>[0027]The method and apparatus according to the present
          invention find particular application when applied to fluids
          with hydrocarbons whether they be liquids or gaseous. It is to
          be appreciated that while particularly applicable to
          hydrocarbon fluids or those containing hydrocarbons (whether a
          mixture or not), the apparatus and method of the present
          invention may be used with other fluids. Generally, a simple
          way of applying the magnetic field to the fluid may be as the
          fluid is flowing and as such, the field may be applied to a
          fluid flowing through a pipe or conduit. </p>
        <p>[0028]While not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears a
          hydrocarbon fluid may be notionally divided into "particles",
          which can be defined as large molecules, suspended in a base
          fluid made up of smaller molecules which are usually in the
          majority and thus form the base liquid. The viscosity of the
          hydrocarbon fluid may therefore be approximated as the
          viscosity of a liquid suspension, which is very different to
          single-molecule liquid, such as water and liquid nitrogen. For
          the same volume fraction, .PHI., the apparent viscosity
          depends on the particle size. As the particles get smaller,
          the apparent viscosity gets higher. This can be seen from the
          Mooney equation [4), </p>
        <p>/.eta..sub.0=exp [2.5.PHI./(1-k .PHI.)], (1) </p>
        <p>where the crowding factor k increases as the particle size
          decreases. Some prior art experiments estimated
          k=1.079+exp(0.01008/D)+exp(0.00290/D.sup.2) for
          micrometer-size particles, where D is the particle diameter in
          unit of micrometers. </p>
        <p>[0029]Each of the large molecules or "particles" has a
          magnetic susceptibility .mu..sub.p which is different from the
          magnetic susceptibility of the base fluid .mu..sub.f. In a
          magnetic field, the particles are thus polarised along the
          field direction. If the particles are uniform spheres of
          radius a, in a magnetic field the dipole moment may be
          estimated by the formula: </p>
        <p>m=H a.sup.3(.mu..sub.p-.mu..sub.f)/(.mu..sub.p-2 .mu..sub.f)
          (2) </p>
        <p>where H is the local magnetic field, which should be close to
          the external field in dilute cases. The dipolar interaction
          between these to dipoles induces magnetic dipoles, the
          strength of which is given by: </p>
        <p>U=.mu..sub.fm.sup.2(1-3 cos.sup.2.theta.)/r.sup.3 (3) </p>
        <p>where r is the distance between these two dipoles and .theta.
          is the angle between the straight line between the dipoles and
          the magnetic field. If this interaction is stronger than the
          normal Brownian motion, these two dipoles will aggregate
          together to align in the field direction. If the dipole
          interaction is very strong and the duration of magnetic field
          is long enough, the particles will aggregate into macroscopic
          chains or columns, which will jam the liquid flow and increase
          the apparent viscosity, a well known phenomenon in
          magnetorheological (MR) fluids. </p>
        <p>[0030]It has been surprisingly found that if the applied
          magnetic field is a short pulse, the induced dipolar
          interaction does not have enough time to affect particles at
          macroscopic distances apart, but forces nearby ones into small
          clusters. The assembled clusters are thus of limited size, for
          example of micrometer size. While the particle volume fraction
          remains the same, the average size of the "new particles" is
          increased. This may lead to the reduction in apparent
          viscosity because the value of the crowding factor k, is
          reduced. </p>
        <p>[0031]Preferably, the correlation between the strength of the
          magnetic field H.sub.c and the period of application of the
          field, T.sub.c may be calculated according to the following </p>
        <p>[0032]Once the magnetic field applied to the fluid for
          T.sub.c ceases, the induced dipolar interaction will generally
          disappear. However, typically, the aggregated clusters of
          particles could sustain for a period of time due to
          hysteresis. After a time, the Brownian motion and other
          variable disturbances will typically act to break the assemble
          particles down. After the assembled particles are completely
          broken down (which could take approximately 8 to 10 hours,
          breakdown time T.sub.b), the rheological properties of the
          liquid suspension generally return to the state of prior to
          the magnetic treatment. Therefore, it would be preferable for
          applications in long distance or extended transport time fluid
          transport, for example fuel oil pipelines, that the magnetic
          field be applied to the fluid at periods determined according
          to the breakdown time, T.sub.b. </p>
        <p>[0033]Suitably, there may be a plurality of apparatus
          applying the magnetic field spaced along a conduit or pipe
          transporting the fluid. The separation distance of the
          apparatus may be determined according to the velocity of the
          fluid flow through the conduit and the breakdown time,
          T.sub.b. The application of the field and the spacing of the
          magnetic assemblies on a pipe with respect to the flow rate
          through the pipe may be adjusted or adjustable in order to
          maintain a lowered viscosity in the fluid. </p>
        <p>[0034]If the particle number density is n, two neighbouring
          particles are typically separated about n.sup.-1/3. Using
          Equation (2), the dipolar interaction between two neighbouring
          particles is about m.sup.2n.mu..sub.f. In order for particles
          to cluster together, this interaction will preferably be
          stronger than the thermal Brownian motion which acts to pull
          neighbouring particles together. Suitably, the following
          parameter, .alpha. which may specify the competition between
          the dipolar interaction and the thermal motion may then be
          arrived at </p>
        <p>=.mu..sub.fm.sup.2n/(k.sub.BT).gtoreq.1 (4) </p>
        <p>where k.sub.B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute
          temperature. </p>
        <p>[0035]With Equation (2), the critical field to be applied in
          order to realise the invention may then be calculated as </p>
        <p>H.sub.c=[k.sub.BT/(n.mu..sub.f)].sup.1/2(.mu..sub.p+2.mu..sub.f)/[.alpha..-
sup.3(.mu..sub.p-.mu..sub.f)]








          (5) </p>
        <p>[0036]If the applied magnetic field is weaker than H.sub.c,
          the thermal Brownian motion may prevent particles from
          aggregating together. In order to change the apparent
          viscosity of the liquid suspension, the applied magnetic field
          applied according to the invention, is suitably not lower than
          H.sub.c </p>
        <p>[0037]From the dipolar interaction, the force between two
          neighbouring particles is generally about
          6.mu..sub.fm.sup.2n.sup.4/3. Using the relation for Stoke's
          drag force on a particle 6.alpha..pi..eta..sub.a.nu., the
          particle's average velocity is suitably about
          v=.mu..sub.fm.sup.2n.sup.4/3/(.pi..eta..sub.aa). </p>
        <p>[0038]The time required for two neighbouring particles to get
          together may then be approximately about </p>
        <p>=n.sup.-1/3/v=.pi..eta..sub.0(.mu..sub.p+2.mu..sub.f).sup.2/[.mu..sub.fn.s-
up.5/3a.sup.5(.mu..sub.p+.mu..sub.f).sup.2H.sup.2]=.pi..eta..sub.0a/(n.sup-
.2/3k.sub.BT.alpha.).








          (6) </p>
        <p>[0039]If the duration of magnetic field is too much shorter
          than .tau., the particles may not have enough time to
          aggregate together. On the other hand, if the duration of
          magnetic field is much longer than .tau., macroscopic chains
          may be formed and the apparent viscosity of the fluid could be
          increased instead of reduced. </p>
        <p>[0040]Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment of the
          invention, a suitable duration of the magnetic field should be
          in the order of .tau.. From Equation (6), it is clear that if
          the applied magnetic field is getting stronger, the pulse
          duration should get shorter. Therefore, the strength of the
          applied magnetic field, H.sub.c may be determined relative to
          the period of application of the field, T.sub.c. </p>
        <p>[0041]In MR fluids (.alpha..gtoreq.100), the dipolar
          interaction may be too strong and force the particles into
          chains along the field direction in milliseconds. In petroleum
          oils, the induced magnetic dipolar interaction may suitably be
          much weaker than that in MR fluids. Therefore, according to a
          particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, in
          which the fluid treated has an .alpha.-value between 1 and 10,
          the apparent viscosity of a liquid suspension may be
          effectively reduced by selecting a suitable duration of
          application of a magnetic field. </p>
        <p>[0042]The aggregated particles by the magnetic field which
          generally result from use of the invention, may not be
          spherical. They may be elongated along the field direction and
          may rotate under the influence of magnetic field, which may
          further help the reduction of the apparent viscosity, </p>
        <p>[0043]An apparatus may be provided embodying the invention.
          Generally, the apparatus for applying the magnetic field will
          be magnets. The magnets may be constructed of any appropriate
          material and may, for example, be permanent magnets or
          electromagnets as known to the art or which may hereinafter be
          developed. When the magnets are permanent magnets, especially
          suitable magnetic materials include ceramics, and rare earth
          materials, which particularly include neodymium-iron-boron
          magnets as well as samarium-cobalt type magnets. </p>
        <p>[0044]With the case of electromagnets, it will be apparent
          that these should be attached to an appropriate electrical
          source so that their electromagnetic properties are
          maintained. The physical form of the magnets may be of any
          appropriate form and it is only preferred in the arrangements
          of the apparatus described herein. </p>
        <p>[0045]The magnets should have a Curie temperature
          sufficiently high that they retain their magnetic
          characteristics at the operating temperatures to which they
          are exposed. For example, in an automobile engine, the fuel
          line magnets will lie above the engine block where relative
          heating will greatly increase their temperature. Some magnets
          lose much of their magnetic field strength as their
          temperature rise. The Curie temperature of Alnico magnets are
          760.degree. C. to 890.degree. C., of Ceramic magnets (ferrite
          magnets) 450.degree. C., of Neodymium 310.degree. C. to
          360.degree. C. and of Samarium 720.degree. C. to 825.degree.
          C. </p>
        <p>[0046]It is also to be understood that magnets which have
          been described above with reference to the invention may be
          magnets, as well as any combination of a magnet and one or
          more elements which may act to improve the penetration of the
          magnetic field into the conduit, or which condenses the field
          strength of the magnet. These include the use of one or more
          pole pieces formed of iron or steel, especially low carbon
          content cold rolled steel. Such a pole piece is preferably
          positioned intermediate one face or one pole of a magnet, and
          the exterior wall of a conduit. Desirably, the portion of the
          pole piece in contact with the exterior wall of the conduit
          has a profile which approximates the profile of the exterior
          wall of the conduit so that the pole piece may be mounted onto
          the conduit. Typically, the portion of the pole piece in
          contact with the exterior wall has an arcuate profile which
          corresponds to the exterior radius of a conduit, especially a
          pipe. Where the conduit has a flat surface (such as for
          conduit having a square, triangular or rectangular shaped
          cross section) the portion of the pole piece in contact with
          the exterior wall may be a flat profile. The pieces may be
          arranged on any side of any of the magnets, such as
          intermediate the magnet and the outer wall of the conduit, in
          contact with at least a part of a magnet and at the same time
          perpendicular to exterior wall of the conduit. The pole piece
          may also be tapered such that the face of the pole piece which
          is in contact with the magnet is equal to or greater than the
          surface area of the side of the magnet which it contacts, but
          on its opposite face, the pole piece has a lesser surface
          area. In such an arrangement the pole piece is provided with a
          tapered configuration which acts to concentrate the magnetic
          field at the interface of the magnet with pole piece, to the
          smaller area at the opposite face of the pole piece which is
          at or near the exterior wall of the pipe. </p>
        <p>[0047]With regard to the construction of the apparatus
          according to the present invention, any means which are suited
          for peripherally arranging each of the sets of magnets with
          respect to a conduit as described above may be used. The
          magnets need not physically contact the conduit, but this may
          be desirable with a ferromagnetic conduit such as an iron or
          steel pipe. These means may include appropriate mechanical
          means such as clamps, brackets, bands, straps, housing devices
          having spaces for retaining the magnets therein, as well as
          chemical means such as adhering the magnets to the exterior
          wall of the conduit. </p>
        <p>[0048]Any suitable means including any of the means or
          devices which may have been described in any of the patents
          mentioned above, may be used. In further embodiments, it is
          also contemplated that the sets of magnets could be an
          integral part of the conduit such as being included in the
          construction of the wall of the conduit as well. The sets of
          magnets may also be placed on the interior wall of the
          conduit. It is also contemplated that the sets of magnets used
          to practise the invention may form an integral part of the
          wall of a conduit. In such an arrangement, there may be
          provided a conduit section with flanges, threads or other
          means of attachment which may be used to insert said conduit
          section in-line with the conduit within which flows a fluid.
          Such a conduit section would include magnets in an arrangement
          in accordance with the present inventive concepts taught
          herein, included in or as part of the wall of the conduit
          section. </p>
        <p>[0049]The method and apparatus of the present invention may
          also be applied to atomisation of hydrocarbon fluids.
          Atomisation generally occurs as a result of interaction
          between a liquid and the surrounding air, and the overall
          atomisation process involves several interacting mechanisms,
          among which is the splitting up of the larger drops during the
          final stages of disintegration. In equilibrium, a droplet's
          radius is determined by the liquid's surface tension and the
          pressure difference, </p>
        <p>r=2.gamma./.DELTA.p (7) </p>
        <p>where .gamma. is the surface tension and
          .DELTA.p=p.sub.i-p.sub.a is the pressure difference between
          pressure inside the droplet, p.sub.i, and the air pressure
          near the droplet surface, p.sub.a. The size r in Equation (7)
          is usually noted as the critical size. In the spray process,
          drops may be initially much larger than r. They then may break
          again and again into small droplets. The influence of liquid's
          viscosity, by opposing deformation of the drop, may increase
          the break-up time. Therefore, low liquid viscosity favours
          quick breaking of drops and leads to smaller size of droplets.
        </p>
        <p>[0050]In addition, in many complex fluids, if a fluid's
          viscosity is reduced, its surface tension also goes down. It
          is anticipated that a pulsed magnetic field applied according
          to the method of the invention may also reduce the surface
          tension of these petroleum fuels as well as their apparent
          viscosity. </p>

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0056]According to an aspect of the invention, a method for
          treating hydrocarbons and particularly fuels, fuel oils and
          crude oils is provided. </p>
        <p>[0057]A number of examples applications were undertaken
          wherein a magnetic field was applied to a hydrocarbon fluid
          for a period of time, T.sub.c at or above a critical magnetic
          field strength, H.sub.c. The period T.sub.c and the field
          strength H.sub.c were determined relative to one another and
          were dependant upon the properties of the fluid. The
          imposition of the magnetic field in this manner was found to
          reduce the apparent viscosity of the fluid. </p>
        <p>[0058]In the examples, the method and apparatus were used to
          treat pure gasoline, pure diesel and pure kerosene without any
          additives. However, since the bulk of the hydrocarbon fluids
          produced contains additives of some kind, the examples
          described herein were conducted on hydrocarbon fluids having
          composition which approximate the major types of fuels used
          for automobiles and trucks and also on crude oil. </p>
        <p>[0059]The examples were conducted using a Brookfield.RTM.
          digital viscometer LVDV-II+ equipped with a UL adapter. The
          Brookfield LVDV-II+ viscometer measures fluid viscosity at a
          given shear rate. The principal of operation is to drive a
          spindle immersed in the test fluid through a calibrated
          spring. The viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle is
          measured by the spring deflection and measured with a rotary
          transducer. The LVDV-II+ has a measurement range of
          15-2,000,000 cP. </p>
        <p>[0060]The UL adaptor consists of a precision cylindrical
          spindle rotating inside an accurately machined tube to measure
          the viscosity of low viscosity fluids with a high accuracy.
          With the UL adaptor and spindle, viscosities in the range of
          1-2,000 cP are measurable. </p>
        <p>[0061]In the following description and the accompanying
          figures, the magnetic field was imposed at time zero (T=0). </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
        <p><b>Gasoline with 20% Ethanol</b> </p>
        <p>[0062]Ethanol is an important additive in gasoline sold in
          some markets. This example was conducted on gasoline with 20%
          ethanol. It is interesting to note that pure gasoline has very
          low viscosity, about 0.8 cP at 10.degree. C. However, ethanol
          has quite high viscosity, about 1.7 cP at 10.degree. C.
          Therefore, a mixture of gasoline with 20% ethanol has
          viscosity of about 0.95 cP. </p>
        <p>[0063]A strong magnetic field of 1.3 T was applied to the
          sample for 5 seconds. The apparent viscosity dropped to 0.81
          cP, but soon climbed to about 0.865 cP, fluctuating there and
          gradually increasing, as seen in FIG. 1. However, after 3
          hours, the apparent viscosity remained at 0.88 cp, 8% below
          the original value. The apparent viscosity remained
          substantially below the original value 200 minutes after the
          application of magnetic field. We expect that the viscosity
          would return to 0.95 cp in about 10 hours. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
        <p><b>Gasoline with 10% MTBE</b> </p>
        <p>[0064]MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) is still widely used
          as gasoline additive. This example was conducted on gasoline
          with 10% MTBE. Different from ethanol, MTBE has quite low
          viscosity. Therefore, a mixture of gasoline with 10% MTBE at
          10.degree. C. has a viscosity of 0.84 cP, slightly higher than
          that of pure gasoline. </p>
        <p>[0065]A magnetic field of 1.3 T was applied to the sample for
          about 1 second. The apparent viscosity immediately dropped to
          0.77 cP. Then it was fluctuating around 0.78 cP for several
          hours and gradually increasing, as can be seen from FIG. 2. </p>
        <p>[0066]However, as shown in FIG. 2, after more than 2 hours,
          the viscosity remained about 7% below 0.84 cP, the previous
          value. The apparent viscosity remained substantially below the
          original value 150 minutes after the application of magnetic
          field. This behaviour is quite similar to that of gasoline
          with ethanol in a pulse magnetic field, but we also noted that
          for gasoline with 10% MTBE the magnetic pulse duration should
          be shorter than that for gasoline with 10% ethanol. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
        <p><b>Diesel Fuel</b> </p>
        <p>[0067]Diesel has much higher viscosity than that of gasoline.
          Example 3 was conducted on pure diesel and diesel with 0.5% of
          ethylhexyl nitrate (EHN) as additive. The behaviour for both
          samples is quite similar because the volume fraction of the
          additive is very small. </p>
        <p>[0068]As shown in FIG. 3, diesel has a viscosity of 5.80 cP
          at 10.degree. C. which is considerably higher than that of
          gasoline. After application of a magnetic field of 1.1 T for 8
          seconds, the apparent viscosity dropped to 5.64 cP, then
          remained at 5.70 cP for several hours. The apparent viscosity
          remained below the original value 160 minutes after the
          application of magnetic field. </p>
        <p>[0069]Further testing may be required to determine the
          optimal duration of magnetic pulse. On one hand, since diesel
          is more close to crude oil, it is expected that the magnetic
          field induced dipolar interaction should be stronger than that
          in gasoline. On the other hand, since the diesel's original
          viscosity is higher than that of gasoline, it is expected the
          magnetic pulse should have a slightly long duration. The
          results in FIG. 3 indicate that a pulse magnetic field can
          reduce the apparent viscosity of diesel. </p>
        <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
        <p><b>Crude Oil</b> </p>
        <p>[0070]Example 4 was conducted with Sunoco crude oil. Since
          Sunoco crude oil is light crude oil and has low wax-appearance
          temperature, the example was performed at 10.degree. C. As
          shown in FIG. 4, at that temperature Sunoco crude oil has a
          viscosity about 26.2 cp. After application of a magnetic field
          of 1.3 T for 4 seconds, the apparent viscosity dropped to 22.2
          cp, which was 16% lower than the original value. After the
          magnetic field was turned off, the viscosity remained low, but
          was gradually increasing. </p>
        <p>[0071]After 200 minutes, it reached 25.0 cp, but still 5%
          below the original value. From extrapolation of this curve, it
          is expected that the viscosity will return to the original
          value after about 10 hours. </p>
        <p>[0072]In the present specification and claims (if any), the
          word "comprising" and its derivatives including "comprises"
          and "comprise" include each of the stated integers but does
          not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers. </p>
        <p>[0073]Reference throughout this specification to "one
          embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular
          feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection
          with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of

        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention relates to electrorheological fluids.
          More specifically, it relates to a method for increasing
          and/or modulating the yield shear stress of electrorheological
          fluids and to an apparatus employing such method. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>Electrorheological (ER) fluids and ER effects are well known
          in the art. Since the discovery of ER fluids around 1947, many
          efforts have been made to increase the yield shear stress of
          ER fluids to a level at which they can advantageously be used
          for various industrial applications, such as actuators for
          torque transmission (such as clutch, brake, and power
          transmission), vibration absorption (such as shock absorber,
          engine mount, and damper), fluid control (such as servo valve
          and pressure valve) and many other industrial applications. ER
          fluids are generally more energy efficient than hydraulic,
          mechanical or electromechanical devices which serve the same
          function. However, the strength of ER fluids has not been
          generally high enough in the past. The search for strong ER
          fluids has produced limited results. ER fluids currently have
          yield shear stress up to about 5 kPa in the presence of an
          applied electric field, not generally sufficient for major
          industrial applications, most of which therefore do not
          utilize ER fluids. The present invention achieves increased
          yield shear stress through a novel use of the microstructure
          properties of ER fluids. </p>
        <p>The flow characteristics of an ER fluid change when an
          electric field is applied through it. The ER fluid responds to
          the applied electric field by what can be described as
          progressively gelling. More specifically, the ER fluid is
          generally comprised of a carrier fluid, such as pump oil,
          silicone oil, mineral oil, or chlorinated paraffin. Fine
          particles, such as polymers, minerals, or ceramics, are
          suspended in the carrier fluid. When an electric field is
          applied through the ER fluid, positive and negative charges on
          the particles separate, thus giving each particle a positive
          end and a negative end. The suspended particles are then
          attracted to each other and form chains leading from one
          electrode to the other. These chains of particles cause the ER
          fluid to "gel" in the electric field between the electrodes in
          proportion to the magnitude of the applied electric field.
          Thus, the prior art provides a means to increase the yield
          shear stress ("effective viscosity") of an ER fluid by
          application of an electrical field, but the maximum yield
          shear stress thus attained (up to about 5 kPa) is still not
          sufficient for use in most industrial applications. </p>
        <p>For the reasons described above, a method for increasing
          and/or modulating the yield shear stress of ER fluids by a
          simple process would be desirable. In addition an apparatus
          employing such method of increasing and/or modulating the
          yield shear stress of ER fluids would further be desirable. </p>
        <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention is directed to a method for increasing
          and/or modulating the yield shear stress of ER fluids and to
          an apparatus employing such method. </p>
        <p>According to the method of the present invention, a
          sufficient electric field is first applied to the ER fluid to
          cause particles within the ER fluid to form into chains of
          particles and to cause the ER fluid to "gel" in the electric
          field applied between the electrodes. Then, a sufficient
          pressure is applied to the ER fluid between the electrodes,
          while the electric field applied in the previous step is
          substantially maintained. This causes the chains of particles
          to thicken and thus increases the yield shear stress. The
          pressure and the shear stress may be applied in any direction,
          relative to that of the applied electric field, which causes
          the chains of particles to thicken. When the increased shear
          stress is no longer needed or needs to be modulated upwardly
          or downwardly, the pressure and, optionally, the electric
          field are adjusted upwardly or downwardly as required. </p>
        <p>In a first embodiment of the method of the invention, the
          pressure is applied in a direction substantially perpendicular
          to that of the electric field, in which case the chains
          aggregate and thus become thicker. In a second embodiment, the
          pressure is applied in a direction substantially parallel to
          that of the electric field, in which case the chains become
          shorter and thus become thicker. However, as contemplated in
          the present invention, the pressure may be applied in any
          direction with respect to that of the applied electric field
          which results in thickening of the chains through a
          combination of shortening and aggregation of the chains. </p>
        <p>According to the apparatus of the present invention, the ER
          fluid is placed between and in communication with two working
          structures, between which a force or a torque is to be
          transmitted (through the ER fluid). The ER fluid is also in
          communication with at least two electrodes having different
          electric potentials, which serve to apply an electric field
          through the ER fluid when an increase in the yield shear
          stress is desired. The electrodes may be on the same or
          different working structures, or be separate from them. A
          sufficient electric potential is first applied to the
          electrodes to cause particles within the ER fluid between the
          electrodes to form into chains of particles and to cause the
          ER fluid to gel. Then, a sufficient pressure is applied to the
          ER fluid, suitably by bringing the two working structures
          closer together, while the electric potential applied in the
          previous step is substantially maintained, to cause the chains
          of particles to become thicker and thus to increase the yield
          shear stress. The increase in the yield shear stress resulting
          from the applied pressure causes any force or torque which is
          provided by one working structure to be transmitted more
          efficiently to the other working structure. When the more
          effective force or torque transmission is no longer needed,
          the pressure and, optionally, the electric field may be
          removed. If an intermediately effective force or torque
          transmission is needed, the applied pressure may be decreased
          while the applied electric field remains applied at the same,
          a higher, or a lower level. Thus, once a higher yield shear
          stress has been established, it may be modulated upwardly or
          downwardly as required by increasing or decreasing the
          strength of the electric field, the applied pressure, or both.
        </p>
        <p>In a first embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, the
          first working structure is preferably electrically insulating,
          but may also be grounded electrically, and the electrodes are
          all on the second working structure, the working surface of
          which is parallel to the working surface of the first working
          structure. In this embodiment, the chains of particles form in
          the vicinity of the second working structure, between
          electrodes through the ER fluid. Pressure is applied in a
          direction perpendicular to that of the electric field by
          bringing the two working surfaces closer together, which
          causes aggregation of the chains into thicker chains,
          providing an increase in the yield shear stress. In one
          variation of this embodiment, the electrodes have an
          alternating arrangement on the second working structure,
          separated by insulating zones, so that neighboring (adjacent)
          electrodes have different electric potentials. However, other
          electrode arrangements are possible with similar results. In
          addition, other variations of this embodiment are possible in
          which the two working structures are not parallel and/or not
          planar. </p>
        <p>In a second embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, the
          two working structures are parallel and each one serves as an
          electrode. In this embodiment, the chains of particles form
          between the two working structures, through the ER fluid.
          Pressure is applied in a direction parallel to that of the
          electric field by bringing the two working surfaces closer
          together, which causes the chains to become shorter and thus
          thicker, again providing an increase in the yield shear
          stress. Variations of this embodiment are also possible in
          which the two working structures are not parallel and/or not
          planar. </p>
        <p>It is to be understood that both the foregoing general
          description and the following detailed description are
          exemplary, but not restrictive, of the invention. </p>

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>The present invention increases the yield shear stress of
          electrorheological (ER) fluids, by producing a change in their
          microstructure through the application of pressure. Referring
          to FIGS. 1-10, the present invention is directed to a method
          for increasing and/or modulating the yield shear stress of ER
          fluids and to an apparatus employing such method. </p>
        <p>The method for increasing the yield shear stress of an ER
          fluid 10 according to the present invention comprises the
          steps of: </p>
        <p>a) applying a sufficient electric field to the ER fluid 10 to
          cause particles within the ER fluid 10 to form into chains of
          particles within the electric field; and </p>
        <p>b) applying a sufficient pressure to the ER fluid 10, after
          step a) and while substantially maintaining the electric field
          applied in step a), to cause the chains of particles to
          thicken or aggregate and thus impart to the ER fluid 10 an
          increase in the yield shear stress. </p>
        <p>Further, following increasing the yield shear stress of the
          ER fluid 10 according to steps a) and b) above, the yield
          shear stress can be modulated by one of the following
          additional steps: </p>
        <p>c) decreasing or increasing the applied pressure, after step
          b), to modulate the yield shear stress downwardly or upwardly
          as required to adjust the force or torque being transmitted
          from one working structure to another working structure; </p>
        <p>d) decreasing or increasing the applied electric field, after
          step b) to modulate the yield shear stress downwardly or
          upwardly as required to adjust the force or torque being
          transmitted from one working structure to another working
          structure; or </p>
        <p>e) combining steps c) and d) to modulate the yield shear
          stress downwardly or upwardly as required. </p>
        <p>An example of the method above described for increasing
          and/or modulating the yield shear stress of an ER fluid 10
          according to the present invention comprises the steps of: </p>
        <p>a) applying a sufficient electric field to the ER fluid 10 to
          cause particles within the ER fluid 10 to form into chains of
          particles within the electric field; </p>
        <p>b) applying a sufficient pressure to the ER fluid 10, after
          step a) and while substantially maintaining the electric field
          applied in step a), to cause the chains of particles to
          thicken or aggregate and thus impart to the ER fluid 10 an
          increase in the yield shear stress; </p>
        <p>c) decreasing or removing the applied pressure, after step b)
          and while substantially maintaining the electric field applied
          in step a), to cause the thickness of the chains of particles
          to decrease and thus impart to the ER fluid 10 a decrease in
          the yield shear stress; and </p>
        <p>d) repeating steps b) and c) as needed. </p>
        <p>In this example of the method of the invention, because the
          electric field remains, the yield shear stress that remains
          after step c) is not zero, as it would be if the electric
          field were also removed. It may be noted that the maximum
          yield shear stress which can be obtained with most ER fluids
          in the absence of applied pressure is so low (typically 5 kPa
          or less) that removal of the electric field will not be
          necessary in some applications, for which this example of the
          method of the invention will thus be adequate. </p>
        <p>In each of the embodiments and examples described herein, it
          is preferred that the ER fluid 10 has a volume fraction not
          too low or too high and comprises dielectric particles in a
          non-conducting liquid, such as oil, like (but not limited to)
          pump oil, transformer oil, silicon oil, etc. The term "volume
          fraction", as used in the present application, refers to the
          volume of net dielectric particles relative to the volume of
          the ER fluid, and its useful range of values is well known in
          the prior art pertaining to ER fluids. The tests of the
          present invention with a volume fraction of 35% give an
          excellent result, but tests with other volume fractions work
          well too, for example, a volume fraction of about 10% to about
          60%, more specifically about 20% to about 50%. </p>
        <p>For the methods of the present invention being described,
          each of the steps may be carried out at varying parameters and
          conditions. The parameters and conditions which are disclosed
          allow one of skill in the art to carry out the particular
          described method(s), but are not intended to imply that the
          particular described method(s) cannot be effectively or
          efficiently carried out at other parameters and/or conditions.
          The specific parameters and conditions chosen may vary due to
          many factors, such as the particular ER fluid being used, the
          desired increase in or level of yield shear stress of the ER
          fluid, the specific apparatus or device required to carry out
          these methods, etc. </p>
        <p>The step of applying an electric field, or step a), of the
          embodiments described in the present application causes the
          particles within the ER fluid 10 to form into chains of
          particles when a sufficient electric field is applied to the
          ER fluid 10, via electrodes, by direct application to the ER
          fluid 10, or by any other known suitable method. For example,
          the electrodes may be separated from the ER fluid 10 by an
          electrically insulating layer and still apply a sufficient
          electric field (albeit more or less attenuated) to the ER
          fluid 10. There is no hard limit as to the strength of the
          electric field being applied in this step, but the useful
          range of values is well known in the prior art pertaining to
          ER fluids. The electric field should be sufficiently high such
          that an adequate number of chains of particles are formed in
          the ER fluid 10. The electric field applied may, for example,
          be in the range of about 500 V/mm to about 3000 V/mm, more
          specifically about 1000 V/mm to about 2000 V/mm. The electric
          field may be DC or AC. </p>
        <p>The step of applying pressure, or step b), of the embodiments
          described in the present application causes the chains of
          particles that are formed in step a) to thicken when a
          sufficient pressure is applied to the ER fluid 10 while the
          electric field is being maintained. The thickening of the
          chains provides the ER fluid 10 with an increase in yield
          shear stress. The step of applying pressure is required to
          occur after step a) and while the electric field applied in
          step a) is substantially maintained. The pressure applied may
          be in the range about 50 kPa to about 850 kPa, but can be
          lower or higher, depending on the magnitude of the increase in
          yield shear stress which is required. The pressure may be
          applied in any direction relative to that of the applied
          electric field, including in particular, in a parallel
          direction (in which case the chains shorten and thus become
          thicker) or in a perpendicular direction (in which case chains
          aggregate and thus become thicker). </p>
        <p>An apparatus employing the method for increasing and/or
          modulating the yield shear stress of an ER fluid 10 according
          to the present invention comprises two working structures,
          between which a force or a torque needs to be transmitted and
          an ER fluid 10 between them and in communication with them.
          The ER fluid 10 between the two working structures is also in
          communication with at least two electrodes having different
          electric potentials, which serve to apply an electric field
          through the ER fluid 10 when an increase in the yield shear
          stress is desired for the purpose of better transferring a
          force or torque between the two working structures. The
          electrodes may be part of one or both working structures, or
          may be separate from both of them, provided that they are
          within, or near the boundary of, the region between the two
          working structures. According to the method of the present
          invention, a sufficient electric field is first applied to the
          ER fluid 10, between the working structures, to form chains of
          particles and to cause the ER fluid 10 to "gel". The electric
          field is generated by applying an electric potential
          difference between the electrodes. Then, a sufficient pressure
          is applied to the ER fluid 10, suitably by bringing the two
          working structures closer together, while the electric
          potential difference applied in the previous step is
          substantially maintained, to cause the chains of particles to
          become thicker and thus to increase the yield shear stress.
          The increase in the yield shear stress resulting from the
          applied pressure improves the transmission of any force or
          torque between the working structures. When the improved force
          or torque transmission is no longer needed, the pressure and,
          optionally, the electric field are removed or modulated
          upwardly or downwardly as required for a particular
          application. </p>
        <p>In a first embodiment of the apparatus of the invention, the
          first working structure is preferably electrically insulating,
          but may also be grounded electrically, and all electrodes are
          on the second working structure as shown in greater detail in
          FIGS. 1-3. In this embodiment, the chains of particles form in
          the vicinity of the second working structure, going between
          electrodes through the ER fluid 10. Application of pressure is
          made by bringing the working structures closer together, and
          causes aggregation of the chains into thicker chains, thus
          leading to a higher yield shear stress and improved force or
          torque transmission. In this embodiment, the applied pressure
          and the electric field are perpendicular. In one variation of
          this embodiment, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, linear parallel
          electrodes 25, 27 have an alternating arrangement on the
          second working structure 22, separated by insulating zones, so
          that neighboring electrodes 25, 27 have different electric
          potentials. In a variation of this embodiment, shown in FIG.
          3, the apparatus 12 have electrodes 15, 17 that are circular
          and concentric. Many other variations are possible which
          maintain the essential features required to apply the method
          of the invention including, for example: (1) working surfaces
          that are not parallel to each other or are not planar (for
          example, concentric spherical sections), (2) electrodes which
          are part of a grid (open or not) which is not attached to
          either of the working structures but is between them, or (3)
          electrodes which are separated from the ER fluid 10 by an
          electrically insulating layer or membrane. </p>
        <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, apparatus 20 according to the
          first embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention
          comprises a first working structure 18, a second working
          structure 22, metallic strips which serve as electrodes 25,
          27, insulating barriers 24, 26, and an ER fluid 10. The first
          working structure 18 has an inner (bottom, in the figures)
          insulating surface 28 (which is in contact with the ER fluid
          10), an outer surface 30, and a plurality of sides 32. The
          electrodes 25, 27 of this embodiment are embedded in the inner
          (top, in the figures) surface 29 (which is in contact with the
          ER fluid 10) of the second working structure 22 and are
          separated by insulating barriers 24, 26. The electrodes 25, 27
          are positioned in an alternating arrangement such that each
          positive electrode 25 is positioned next to at least one
          negative electrode 27. The terms "positive" and "negative" in
          respect to the electrodes are not meant to convey any
          relationship to electric ground but, rather, to indicate that
          one electrode (positive) is at higher electric potential than
          the other (negative). Furthermore, the polarities (positive
          and negative) of the electrodes may be reversed without
          affecting the operation of the apparatus. This arrangement
          generates a sufficient electric field to align the particles
          of the ER fluid 10 into chains of particles which align in the
          ER fluid in the direction of the applied electric field. As
          illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the top surface of the
          electrodes 25, 27 and the top surface of the barriers 24, 26,
          defining a working surface, are leveled, flat, smooth, and
          parallel to the inner surface 28 of the first working
          structure 18. This minimizes the viscous friction between this
          working surface and the ER fluid 10 when the electric field is
          not applied. The ER fluid 10 is positioned between the working
          structures 18, 22. When the apparatus 20 is in use, the
          working structures 18, 22 can be moved toward and away from
          each other. The first apparatus 20 and its variations, such as
          that illustrated in FIG. 3, are believed suitable for many
          industrial applications such as automobile clutch, torque
          transmission, etc. FIGS. 1-3 assign to the first working
          structure 18 all movement producing the applied pressure. In
          practice, movement of either or both working structures 18, 22
          may contribute to the applied pressure. </p>
        <p>In a variation (not illustrated) of the embodiments shown in
          FIGS. 1 and 2, all the electrode strips 25, 27 at the same
          electric potential may be combined into a single comb-shaped
          electrode having teeth so that the teeth of the positive
          comb-shaped electrode are intercalated between the teeth of
          the negative comb-shaped electrode. Each one of these two
          comb-shaped electrodes may be constructed by tying together
          all of the individual electrode strips 25, 27, shown in FIGS.
          1 and 2, at the same electric potential through an
          electrically conducting cross-bar (either under the plane of
          the individual electrode strips or in the same plane as the
          individual electrode strips), or it may be manufactured as a
          single piece of the same comb-shaped electrode. A similar
          variation may be applied to the embodiment shown in FIG. 3. </p>
        <p>In a further variation (not illustrated) of the first
          embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, the
          electrodes are arranged in a two-dimensional array of
          alternating electrodes at different electric potentials, i.e.,
          the two-dimensional equivalent of the one-dimensional arrays
          shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. Alternatively, the entire working
          surface, may serve as the single electrode at one electric
          potential, incorporating a two-dimensional array of holes
          permitting insertion of the electrodes at the other electric
          potential (and any insulating spacers). In either case,
          individual electrodes may be tied together, under the plane of
          the individual electrodes, into the two-dimensional
          equivalents of the comb-shaped electrodes described in the
          preceeding paragraph. </p>
        <p>In a second embodiment of the apparatus of the invention,
          each working structure serves as an electrode to which a
          different electric potential is applied. In this embodiment,
          the chains of particles form between the two working
          structures, through the ER fluid. Application of pressure
          causes shortening of the chains, which become thicker, leading
          to a higher yield shear stress. In this embodiment, the
          applied pressure and the electric field are parallel. This
          embodiment has two principal disadvantages over the first
          embodiment, which may or may not be important in particular
          applications: (1) both working structures (which are rotating
          or moving in some other way relative to each other), rather
          than only one, require electrical connections; and (2) the
          distance between the electrodes changes when the working
          structures are brought closer together to apply the pressure,
          making control of the electric field (which, at constant
          applied electric potential, is inversely proportional to the
          distance between the electrodes) more difficult and
          introducing the possibility of electrical breakdown between
          the working structures. Variations of this embodiment are
          possible which maintain the essential features required to
          apply the method of the invention including, for example: (1)
          working surfaces that are not parallel to each other or are
          not planar (for example, concentric spherical sections), (2)
          multiple electrodes at the same electric potential on each
          working structure, (3) one or more electrodes which are not
          attached to either of the working structures but are between
          them, or (4) electrodes which are separated from the ER fluid
          10 by an electrically insulating layer or membrane. </p>
        <p>Referring to FIG. 4, the apparatus 40 according to the second
          embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention comprises
          two working structures 42, 43, two electrodes 44, 46, and an
          ER fluid 10 positioned between the working structures 42, 43.
          The first working structure 42 has an inner surface 48 (which
          is in contact with the ER fluid 10), an outer surface 50, and
          a plurality of sides 52. The second working structure 43 has
          an inner surface 54 (which is in contact with the ER fluid
          10), an outer surface 56, and a plurality of sides 58. The
          negative electrode 46 is positioned on the inner surface 54 of
          the second working structure 43. The positive electrode 44 is
          positioned on the inner surface 48 of the first working
          structure 42, and can be moved toward and away from the
          negative electrode 46 when apparatus 40 is in use. Again, the
          terms "positive" and "negative" in respect to the electrodes
          are not meant to convey any relationship to electric ground
          but, rather, to indicate that one electrode (positive) is at
          higher electric potential than the other (negative).
          Furthermore, the polarities (positive and negative) of the
          electrodes may be reversed without affecting the operation of
          the apparatus. FIG. 4 assigns to the first working structure
          42 all movement producing the applied pressure. In practice,
          movement of either or both working structures 42, 43 may
          contribute to the applied pressure. </p>
        <p>A third embodiment (not illustrated) of the apparatus of the
          invention combines the first and second embodiments. In this
          embodiment, both working structures incorporate multiple
          electrodes at different electric potentials, as described in
          the first embodiment for only one working structure, so that
          the applied electric field has components which are parallel
          and components which are perpendicular to the direction of the
          applied pressure. Application of the electric field leads to
          the formation, within the ER fluid 10, of chains of particles
          which go from electrode to electrode on the same working
          structure, as well as chains of particles which go from
          electrodes on one working structure to electrodes on the other
          working structure. In one variation of this embodiment, the
          electrode arrangement is the same on both working structures,
          except that their polarities are reversed, so that each
          positive electrode on one working structure is closest to: (1)
          at least one negative electrode on the same working structure
          and (2) at least one negative electrode on the other working
          structure. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the apparatus 40 is
          connected to the system 60 used in measuring the yield shear
          stress of the ER fluid 10. The system 60 used in measuring the
          yield shear stress includes a linear table 62, a first force
          sensor 64, a second force sensor 66, and a lead screw 68. The
          second force sensor 66 measures the normal pressure. Then,
          shear force is applied to the first force sensor 64 to
          determine the yield shear stress. A system similar to system
          60 is used in measuring the yield shear stress of the ER fluid
          10 in apparatus 20. Also, it is obvious to one of skill in the
          art that other systems can be used to measure the yield shear
          stress of the ER fluid 10. </p>
        <p>In reference to the first apparatus 20, FIGS. 5-8 are graphs
          showing the results of a yield shear stress measurement in
          which electric fields, under different pressures and constant
          pressure, respectively, having different values and having
          been applied to the ER fluid 10, according to the present
          invention. In FIG. 5, when the shear force SF.sub.1 that is
          applied is parallel to the electric field, as in the apparatus
          of FIG. 1, the yield shear stress of the ER fluid 10 increases
          almost linearly with the different pressures applied at
          electric fields of 500 V/mm, 1000 V/mm, and 2000 V/mm. In FIG.
          6, when the shear force SF.sub.2 that is applied is
          perpendicular to the electric field, as in the apparatus of
          FIG. 2, the yield shear stress of the ER fluid 10 increases
          almost linearly with the different pressures applied at
          electric fields of 500 V/mm and 1000 V/mm. As the applied
          electric field increases, the slope k increases slightly but
          measurably. In FIG. 7, when the shear force SF.sub.1 that is
          applied is parallel to the electric field, the yield shear
          stress of the ER fluid 10 increases with the applied electric
          field at constant pressures of 50 kPa, 100 kPa, 200 kPa, and
          400 kPa. In FIG. 8, when the shear force SF.sub.2 that is
          applied is perpendicular to the electric field, the yield
          shear stress of the ER fluid 10 increases with the applied
          electric field at constant pressures of 100 kPa, 200 kPa, and
          400 kPa. As the pressure increases, the yield shear stress
          also increases more dramatically with the applied electric
          field. With the technology of the present invention, the ER
          fluid 10 has a yield shear stress value of about 110 kPa at
          2000 V/mm and 400 kPa pressure (FIG. 5), about 95 kPa at 1000
          V/mm and 400 kPa pressure (FIG. 6), more than sufficient for
          many major industrial applications. If the shear force is in
          an arbitrary direction in the plane perpendicular to the
          direction of the applied force, it can be decomposed into two
          components, one parallel to the electric field and the other
          perpendicular to the electric field. FIGS. 5-8 can then be
          used to find the yield shear stress in any arbitrary direction
          perpendicular to the applied pressure. FIGS. 5-8 show that, in
          both cases, the yield shear stress is greatly raised, and that
          apparatus 20 and its variations work for a shear force in any
          arbitrary direction perpendicular to the applied force. </p>
        <p>In reference to the second apparatus 40, FIGS. 9 and 10 are
          graphs, similar to the graphs for the first apparatus 20,
          showing the results of a yield shear stress measurement in
          which electric fields, under different pressures and constant
          pressure, respectively, having different values and having
          been applied to the ER fluid 10, according to the present
          invention. FIG. 9 shows the yield shear stress of the ER fluid
          10 increasing almost linearly with the different pressures
          applied at electric fields of 1000 V/mm, 2000 V/mm, and 3000
          V/mm. As the applied electric field increases, the slope k
          increases. FIG. 10 shows the yield shear stress of the ER
          fluid 10 increasing with the applied electric field at
          constant pressures of 50 kPa, 210 kPa, and 500 kPa. As the
          pressure increases, the yield shear stress also increases more
          dramatically with the electric field. With the technology of
          the present invention, the ER fluid 10 has a yield shear
          stress value of about 200 kPa at 3000 V/mm and 800 kPa
          pressure, roughly a 40-fold improvement due to the application
          of pressure, and more than sufficient for most major
          industrial applications. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 9 and 10, when combined with FIGS. 5-8, can be used to
          find the increase in yield shear stress with the applied
          pressure in any arbitrary direction with respect to the
          applied electric field. This shows that the yield shear stress
          is greatly raised in all cases and that a combination of
          apparatus 20 and of apparatus 40 (the third embodiment of the
          apparatus of the invention) works for a shear force in any
          arbitrary direction with respect to the applied force and to
          the applied electric field. </p>
        <p>The present invention increases the strength, or yield shear
          stress, of ER fluids 10 by a factor that, depending on the
          applied pressure, can be as high as 40 or more. With this new
          technology, ER fluids will have many major industrial
          applications. For example, ER fluids can be used for an
          automobile clutch made of two discs and filled with ER fluid
          between them (FIG. 3). One disc is connected to the engine and
          the other is connected to the driving wheels. If there is no
          electric potential difference or pressure applied between the
          two discs, the ER fluid has practically zero yield shear
          stress and the clutch is unengaged. When an electric field is
          applied, followed by an increase in pressure in accordance
          with the present invention, the ER fluid may reach a yield
          shear stress of about 200 kPa in milliseconds. Thus, the
          clutch is engaged. It is clear that such a new automobile
          clutch will be much more efficient and agile than existing
          ones and, since it has no wearing parts, it will be more
          reliable and have a much longer working life. </p>
        <p>There is no prior art technology that can produce a yield
          shear much above 5 kPa. The method of the present invention
          provides a means for increasing the yield shear stress of ER
          fluids to over 100 kPa and up to as much as 200 kPa or more,
          which exceeds the requirement of most major industrial
          applications. In addition, the methods of the present
          invention can be applied to many, or all, of the existing ER
          fluids since they are general and effective. </p>
        <p>It is to be understood that the present invention is not
          limited to the preferred or other embodiments described
          herein, but encompasses all embodiments within the scope of
          the following claims. </p>

          Abstract --&nbsp; An apparatus (100) for reducing the size of
          fuel particles injected into a combustion chamber is
          disclosed. The apparatus includes fuel line (110), a first
          metallic mesh (114) disposed within the fuel line (110), and a
          second metallic mesh(112) disposed within the fuel line (110),
          upstream of the first metallic mesh (114). An electrical
          supply (130) is electrically coupled to the first metallic
          mesh (114) and the second metallic mesh (112). Operation of
          the electrical supply (130) generates an electrical field
          between the first metallic mesh (114) and the second metallic
          mesh (112). A fuel injector (120) is disposed at an end of the
          fuel line (110), downstream from the first metallic mesh
          (114). Methods of reducing the size of fuel particles,
          improving gas mileage in a vehicle, increasing power output
          from a combustion engine, and improving emissions for a
          combustion engine are also provided. </p>
