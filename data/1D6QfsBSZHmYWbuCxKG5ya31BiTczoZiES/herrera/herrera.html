      <br>
      A life-changing discovery from a Mexican scientist. Imagine not
      having to buy batteries ever again... Just think about the amount
      of battery-powered gadgets we use daily in our lives, and the
      problem it is when we have to throw them away. Simply take a
      moment to think how much our planet is damaged with this process,
      and the number of people who use and dispose batteries every day.<br>
      <br>
      Under such premise, and to address this problematic, Mexican
      scientist Arturo Solis Herrera was motivated to start an important
      research regarding this small and little lasting-power sources,
      which pollute the planet in large amounts.<br>
      <br>
      Bat gen is the name of this ever-lasting battery. It consists of a
      biochemical process triggered by mixing water and melanin, which
      results in a substance capable of separating oxygen from hydrogen
      (the components of a water molecule), therefore liberating energy.
      The process continues as the same molecule brings together both
      elements turning them into water again; as a result one more
      energy load is triggered.<br>
      <br>
      According to Solis’ research, once this process is reached, it can
      continue for 100 years! Moreover, there are several ways of
      artificially producing the melanin found in human nails, hair and
      retina; two of them, which he already patented, are based on
      vegetables and oil.<br>
      <br>
      Arturo Solis is head of Investigation and Development of the Human
      Photosynthesis Research Center, which was founded by himself in
      the state of Aguascalientes, in the center region of Mexico. For
      twenty years, the Mexican scientist dedicated his own resources to
      this study, and fortunately on April 2010 the Russian government
      granted him the patent number 6017379. Currently he is very close
      to obtaining it in the United States and Europe.<br>
      <br>
      For now, Bat gen can only be used to power up household
      appliances, but this is just the beginning, as it is planned that
      it can boost the engine of an electric car very soon.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>PHOTOELECTROCHEMICAL METHOD OF SEPARATING
          WATER INTO HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN, <br>
          USING MELANINS AS THE CENTRAL ELECTROLYSING ELEMENT</b><br>
        <b>US8920990</b><br>

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to the processes or methods for obtaining
      alternative energy, particularly the ones known as
      photoelectrochemical processes, through which hydrogen and oxygen
      atoms are obtained by means of the separation or partition of
      water molecule with which we generate hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
      Moreover, high energy electrons are generated, and very possibly
      this method can be applied to the reduction of carbon dioxide,
      nitrate and sulphate molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Because the reactions occur in both ways, our invention can also
      be applied to electricity generation, for our method permits to
      bind hydrogen and oxygen atoms forming water molecules, and
      collaterally generating electrical current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      About the related art, nowadays, the known processes used up to
      now to separate the water molecule in hydrogen and oxygen atoms
      are, among others:<br>
      <br>
      a).—The application of intense electrical currents.<br>
      <br>
      b).—The heating of water until two thousand degrees centigrade.<br>
      <br>
      c).—The separation of water molecule by solar electrochemical
      method: (photoelectrochemical), which integrates a semi-conductor
      material and a water electrolyzer in a monolithic design to
      produce hydrogen directly from water using light as the unique
      energy source. Simple in concept, the challenge was to find a
      material or base that could support the whole process, and up to
      now, the ideal or the most adequate material had not found because
      some materials are very expensive, some are polluting, others are
      inefficient; most of them decompose fast, others are damaged with
      water and some others require exceedingly strict work conditions;
      that is why cost-effectiveness has not been feasible up to now
      from an economical, environmental and political point of view, and
      others are not appropriate for large scale application, their
      usefulness being thus reduced to some specific and small processes<br>
      <br>
      d).—Another method to separate water is by solar energy
      concentration (with mirrors for example), with the object to
      elevate water temperature until two thousand ° C. This is the
      required temperature used in laboratory to divide the water
      molecule.<br>
      <br>
      e).—One further method is by using photosynthetic microbes as
      green algas and cianobacterium, those produce hydrogen from water
      as part of metabolic activities using light energy as main source.
      This photobiological technology is promising, but as oxygen is
      produced as well as hydrogen, the technology must solve the
      limitation that is the sensibility to oxygen in the enzymatic
      systems. Besides, hydrogen production from photosynthetic
      organisms is currently too low to be economically viable.<br>
      <br>
      f).—Another method is water electrolysis, using electricity to
      separate the water molecule in its compounds (hydrogen and oxygen
      atoms). At present time, two kinds of electrolyzers are used for
      commercial production of hydrogen: the alkaline, and the membrane
      of protons interchange, but these approaches cannot compete now
      from an economic point of view with the hydrogen produced from
      natural gas. (Source: U.S. Department of Energy, Efficiency and
      Renewable Hydrogen fuel cells and Infrastructure Technology
      Program Hydrogen Production &amp; Delivery).<br>
      <br>
      A natural material that can also divide or separate the water
      molecule and that has been studied is chlorophyll but because its
      affinity with light is between 400 nm and about 700 nm the rest of
      the light energy is lost. That is why it is estimated that 80
      percent of used energy is wasted. Moreover, its production is
      complex and expensive, requiring for example temperatures of -8°
      C. These are the reasons by which we decided to use the melanins
      as electrolyzing water element, because its affinity in the
      spectrum goes from 200 to 900 nm or more, and because of the
      physiological characteristics of the tissues in which melanin
      generally occurs. Parameters such as the oxygen concentration call
      the attention and that is why we decided to contrast the
      hypothesis that when melanin is illuminated, we would get the
      photolysis of the water molecules, generating thus oxygen and
      hydrogen atoms, besides other products such as OH, hydrogen
      peroxide, anion superoxide and high energy electrons, as well as
      support and catalyze the reverse reaction.<br>
      <br>
      Before our work, the photohydrolitic and hydrosynthetic properties
      of melanin, the so called melanin response to electro-retinogram
      only had historical interest. In the early sixties, it was
      discovered that intense non physiological luminous stimulus
      applied to the pigmented ephythelium of the retina, generated
      potential changes throughout it. This response to melanin reflects
      a physicochemical response to light absorption by melanin, similar
      in some way to the early potential of electro-retinogram receptors
      generated by opsin molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The literature points out that researchers have not found the
      clinical application to the melanin response yet. And we add that
      this is due to the fact that the process of said event had not
      been understood. Now we know that portions surrounding the
      molecule collect photon energy and through it the water molecule
      is divided, that is, they oxide it, separating hydrogen from
      oxygen, then the hydrogen, the carrier of energy by excellence is
      caught possibly by FAD and NAD for its further processing by
      eukaryote cell to energize one or other reaction among the many
      that occur every second and lead to life. But the wonder of the
      event is that also the structure of (primary, secondary, third,
      fourth) melanin permits the occurrence of the opposite reaction,
      i.e. the union of hydrogen and oxygen, or in other words, the
      reduction of oxygen, that produces water and electricity. The
      absorption of light by the melanin starts an ionic event that
      finally gives us electricity, because the sole division of water
      molecule is not enough; the reversibility of the reaction has to
      happen, i.e. the reunion of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Any range or ranges disclosed in this description are deemed to
      include and provide support for any sub-range within those range
      or ranges. Any range or ranges disclosed in this description are
      deemed to include and provide support for any point or points
      within those range or ranges.<br>
      <br>
      This invention consists essentially in obtaining under normal
      temperature, and using natural or artificial light, as the only
      source of energy, the division of water molecule to obtain
      hydrogen and oxygen atoms as well as electrons of high energy or
      join hydrogen or oxygen atoms to obtain water and electric
      current; using as main or central electrolyzing melanin, melanin
      precursors, melanin derivatives and melanin analogues:
      polihydroxyindole, eumelanin, feomelanin, alomelanin,
      neuromelanin, humic acid, fulerens, graphite, polyindolequinones,
      acetylene black, pyrrole black, indole black, benzene black,
      thiophene black, aniline black, poliquinones in hydrated form
      sepiomelanins, dopa black, dopamine black, adrenalin black,
      catechol black, 4-amine catechol black, in simple linear chain,
      aliphatics or aromatics; or their precursors as phenoles,
      aminophenols, or diphenols, indole poliphenols, ciclodopa DHI Y
      DHICA1, quinones, semiquinones or hydroquinones. L-tyrosine,
      L-dopamine, morpholin, ortho benzoquinone, dimorpholin, porphirin
      black, pterin black, ommochrome black, free nitrogen precursors,
      any of the above listed with any size or particles. (from 1
      angstrom to 3 or 4 cms.). All afore mentioned the compounds,
      electroactive, in suspension, solution, in gel, that absorb the
      ultrasound in the interval of one MHz, natural or synthetic, with
      vegetal, animal or mineral origin; pure or mixed with organic or
      inorganic compounds, ions, metals, (gadolinium, iron, nickel,
      copper, erbium, europium, praseodymium, dysprosium, holmium,
      chromium or magnesium, lead selenure, and so on). Gadolinium is a
      very effective metal. The metal is incorporated into the melanin
      in ionic form or as a particle, as well as drugs or medication
      energizing the photo electrochemical design with light (natural or
      synthetic, coherent or not, monochromatic or polychromatic) with
      wavelength mainly between 200 and 900 nanometers, though other
      wavelengths and other energy types, for example, the kinetic, also
      are efficient in various grades, according to the rest of the
      conditions (pH, temperature, pressure, and so on). To this kind of
      designs magnetic fields from soft to significant intensity can be
      applied.<br>
      <br>
      The events in this design may occur to a greater o lesser extent
      under internal or external physical or chemical stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      We propound the use of melanin (as mentioned before) as the
      electrolyzer material of the water molecule, using light as main
      or sole energy source, particularly at wavelength between 200 and
      900 nm for the hydrogen production systems known as
      photoelectrochemical methods. As aforementioned, these systems
      integrate a semiconducting material and a water electrolyzer
      inside a monolithic design to produce hydrogen atoms directly from
      water, using light as the main or sole source of energy, though
      sound, ultrasound, in an interval of one MHz, mechanical stir,
      magnetic fields, etc. can also be used.<br>
      <br>
      Although, it is a simple concept, the challenge was to find a
      material that could withstand the whole process. At least two
      basic criteria had to be met: one was the light absorbing system
      or compound had to generate enough energy to start, lead and
      support completely the electrolysis reaction, and it had to be low
      cost, stable and long lasting in a water environment.<br>
      <br>
      Melanin, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives, melanin variants
      and analogues can meet reasonably and efficiently the above
      mentioned requirements and this represents a progress to solve the
      central problem of photoelectrochemical designs.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of the container holding it in the appropriate equipment
      can be very varied: cubic, cylinder, spherical, polyhedral,
      rectangular, etc. Being one of the main requirements, to be
      transparent, in order to permit the light to pass through and
      depending on the wavelength of the illumination that is going to
      be used, the walls could be made of quartz, for example, so that
      the walls of the container do not absorb the ultraviolet
      radiations, or if a specific wavelength is determined, the
      material of which the container is made could be of a color that
      allow maximum transparency or absorption of the wavelength from
      the electromechanical spectrum which we are interested in. The
      walls can be made of glass or of any other polymer whose
      transmission characteristics of the electromagnetic radiations fit
      to the final needs of the photoelectrochemical design. The
      wavelengths that can be used to energize the design comprise from
      200 nanometers to 900 nanometers.<br>
      <br>
      Inside the cell, the main material, the essential solute, melanin
      precursors, melanin derivatives, melanin variants and analogues,
      mainly dissolved in water, because the basis of the design is the
      notable capacity of melanin to capture photons of wavelengths
      comprised between 200 and 900 nm, probably by the surrounding
      portions of the molecule, followed by the generation of high
      energy electrons from low energy electrons. These high energy
      electrons go to the centers of free radicals of the compound where
      they are probably captured by an element for example: a metal such
      as iron, copper, gadolinium, europium, etc. from where they are
      transferred to a primary electron acceptor from a nature that is
      uncertain up to now because the union is complex and comprises
      ionic interactions depending on the pH. This electron transfer
      liberates energy which is used to establish the protons gradient.<br>
      <br>
      The combination of the melanin molecule with water forms what can
      be called a photosystem, which captures luminous energy using at
      least two interrelated activities: removal of electrons from water
      and generation of a protons gradient.<br>
      <br>
      The melanin components are in very close contact among them which
      makes a fast transfer of energy easy. At three picoseconds of
      illumination, the melanin reaction centers respond transferring a
      photo-excited electron to the primary electron receptor. This
      transference of electrons generates a donator, positively charged
      and a receiver negatively charged. The importance of the formation
      of two species with opposite charges is seen when we consider the
      reduction capacities of these two species, because one of them is
      deficient in electrons and can accept electrons which makes it an
      oxidizing agent. By contrast, the other compound has an extra
      electron that can be lost easily, making it a reducing agent. This
      event—the formation of an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent
      from the light&lt;-&gt; takes less than billionesimal of second
      and is the first essential step in the photolysis.<br>
      <br>
      Because they are charged in an opposite way, these compounds show
      an obvious mutual attraction. The separation of charges is
      (probably) stabilized by their movement to opposite sides of the
      molecule; being the negative compound the one that first gives its
      electron toward a quinone (Q1) and possibly then the electron is
      transferred to a second type of quinone (Q2), this producing a
      semi reduced form of the quinone molecule which can be strongly
      linked to the reaction center of the melanin molecule. With each
      transfer, the electron gets closer to the reaction center of the
      melanin molecule. The portion of melanin positively charged is
      reduced, thus preparing the reaction center for the absorption of
      another photon. The absorption of a second photon sends a second
      electron along the way. (melanin negatively charged towards the
      first and second quinone molecule — Q1 and Q2 -). This second
      molecule absorbs two electrons, and thus combines with two
      protons. The protons used in this reaction could derive from the
      same melanin molecule or from the surrounding water, causing a
      decrease in the concentration of hydrogen ions of the photosystem,
      what contributes to the formation of a protons gradient. In theory
      the reduced quinone molecule is dissociated from the reaction
      center of melanin, been replaced reaction by a new quinone
      molecule. These reactions occur at normal temperature but when you
      modify for example the temperature you can favor the reaction in
      one or other way, depending on the control of the other variables:
      (pH, magnetic fields, concentrations, gases, partial pressures,
      shape of cells, etc.) and the main objective of the process.<br>
      <br>
      The separation of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms
      is a highly endergonic reaction due to the very stable association
      of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The separation of the water
      molecules (in hydrogen and oxygen atoms) in the laboratory
      requires the use of a strong electric current or high temperature
      of almost 2,000° C. the above (water electrolyzing) is obtain by
      melanin at room temperature, using only the energy obtained from
      light, wavelength mainly comprised between 200 and 900 nanometers,
      either from natural or artificial source, coherent or not,
      concentrated or disperse, mono or polychromatic. It is estimated
      that the redox potential of oxidized form of quinone is
      approximately +1.1 V, what is strong enough to attract the firmly
      united low energy electrons from the water molecule (redox
      potential of +0.82), separating the molecules in hydrogen and
      oxygen atoms. The separation of the water molecule by
      photopigments is named photolysis. It is believed that the
      formation of the oxygen molecule during the photolysis requires
      the simultaneous loss of four electrons from two water molecules
      according to the reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2H2O<br>
      <br>
      &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="241089761-CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00002" /&gt;<br>
      4H&lt;+&gt;+O2+4e&lt;-&gt;<br>
      <br>
      A reaction center can only generate a positive charge or its
      oxidizing equivalent at the same time. This problem is solved
      hypothetically by the presence of four nitrogen atoms in the
      reaction center of the melanin molecule, each one of them
      transferring only one electron. This nitrogen concentration, adds
      may be four positive charges upon transferring four electrons (one
      each time) to the closest quinone&lt;+&gt; molecule.<br>
      <br>
      The transfer of electrons from the nitrogens of the reaction
      centers to the quinine&lt;30 &gt;is obtained by means of the
      passage through a positively charged tyrosine moiety. After each
      electron is transferred to quinone&lt;+&gt;, regenerating quinone,
      the pigment is reoxidized (again a quinone&lt;+&gt;) after the
      absorption of another photon to the photosystem. So the
      accumulation of four positive charges (oxidizing equivalents) by
      the nitrogen atoms of the reaction center is modified by the
      successive absorption of four photons by the melanin photosystem.
      Once the four charges have been accumulated the oxygen releasing
      quinone complex can catalyze the 4e&lt;-&gt; removal from 2H2O
      forming an O2 molecule, and regenerating the totally reduced
      quantity of nitrogens in the reaction center.<br>
      <br>
      The protons produced in the photolysis are released in the medium
      where they contribute to the protons gradient. The photosystem
      must be illuminated several times before the occurrence of O2
      release and thus hydrogen can be measured; this indicates that the
      effects of the individual photo reactions must accumulate before
      O2 and hydrogen are released.<br>
      <br>
      The quinones are considered carriers of mobile electrons. It is to
      be kept in mind that all electron transfers are exergonics and
      occur as the electrons are successively taken to carriers with an
      increasing affinity for the electrons (more positive redox
      potentials). The need of having electron moving carriers is
      obvious. The electrons generated by the photolysis can pass to
      several inorganic receivers, which are thus reduced. These ways
      for electrons can lead (depending on the composition of the used
      mix) to the eventual reduction of nitrate molecule (NO3) into
      ammoniac molecule (NH3) or the sulphates in sulphydrides
      (SH&lt;-&gt;) reductions that change the inorganic wastes into
      compounds necessary for life. So the sunlight energy can be used
      not only to reduce the most oxidized form of a carbon atom (CO2)
      but also to reduce the most oxidized forms or nitrogen and
      sulphur.<br>
      <br>
      The production of one O2 molecule requires the removal of four
      electrons from two molecules of water, the removal of four
      electrons from water requires the absorption of four photons, one
      for each electron.<br>
      <br>
      The design of the cell is an important parameter for the
      optimization in obtaining the product of the reaction in which we
      have a particular interest, because the addition of electrons, the
      nature of them, the use of magnetic fields, the addition of
      several compounds (organic or inorganic, ions, metals, drugs or
      medications) to the photosystem that at the beginning was only
      melanin and water, plus the addition of electrolytes, plus the
      addition of medicines, and temperature management, the control of
      partial pressures of gases, the management of the electrical
      current generated, the application of magnetic fields, the level
      of pH, the material used in making the cells and the shape and
      disposition of its internal divisions, etc. Apart from other
      variables, which are able to be controlled in such a way that the
      final design can recover electrons, or protons, or oxygen, and the
      resulting compounds according to the formulation of the medium in
      the melanin is dissolved. Thus, the melanins, melanin precursors,
      melanin derivatives, melanin variants and analogues (its
      analogues, its synthetic or natural precursors, pure or combined
      with organic compounds and inorganic compounds, metals) allow a
      notable flexibility of the design according to the goals to reach.<br>
      <br>
      The optimization of photoelectrochemical design relates to the
      objectives, for example: for a higher generation of protons and
      oxygen or generation of electricity; the largest possible area of
      exposition of the liquid compound to the light in an extended
      container, apart from other procedures such as the addition of
      electrons carrier compounds, melanin doping, or positive microlens
      to concentrate the light, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The design of the container is not limited and can have a
      spherical, cubic, rhomboidal, polyhedric, plain concave, plain
      convex, biconvex, biconcave shape with microlens in a side (the
      side exposed to light to concentrate it) and flat on the other
      side cylindrical, circular cylindrical, hollow cylindrical,
      circular cone (straight) truncated cone, rectangular prism,
      oblique prism, rectangular pyramid, straight truncated pyramid,
      truncated spherical segment, spherical segmented, spherical
      sector, spherical with cylindrical perforation, sphere with conic
      perforations, torus (circular section ring), cylinder with slanted
      cut, cylindrical wedge, semi prism barrel, and combinations of
      them, etc, because the liquid assumes any shape, only requiring to
      be transparent to allow the passage of the maximum possible light,
      and depending of the kind of melanin used (doped or not, for
      example), it will be convenient to select a specific wavelength to
      illuminate the soluble melanin, but until this moment one of the
      big virtues of soluble synthetic melanin is that it absorbs the
      majority of the wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. But
      it appears to show its major absorption between 200 and 900
      nanometers wavelengths. The control of the partial pressures of
      the gases in the interior of the cell is an important variable,
      and depending on the cell shape and the use given to it, these
      pressures can go from 0.1 mm Hg until 3 or 4 atmospheres; another
      variable that must be taken into account is the concentration of
      different substances dissolved in the liquid, where the critical
      concentration is mainly of melanin and can go from 0.1% to 100%,
      the increase could be in steps of 0.1%; other variable that can be
      modified is the ratio among the different components of the
      formula (depending on the use), because potassium can be added in
      a concentration from 0.1 to 10%; sodium in a concentration from
      0.1 to 10%; chlorine in a concentration from 0.1 to 10%; calcium
      in a concentration from 0.1 to 10%; iron in a concentration from
      0.1 to 8%, copper in a concentration from 0.1 to 5%, arsenic in a
      concentration from 0.1 to 8 or 9%, gold in a concentration 0.1 to
      8 or 9%, silver in a concentration similar to gold, nickel in a
      concentration from 0.1 to 8%, gadolinium, europium, erbium, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The final volume can range from 1 microliter to 10 or 20 liters
      depending on the size of the container and the available space;
      the temperature can fluctuate from 2 to 45° C., the frequency of
      change of solution can be from every 15 minutes to several months
      or 2 or 3 years; the formation of compartments inside the little
      cell, in the interior of the cell shapes ranging from small
      spheres (microspheres, there can be several dozens of them) to
      spheres the size of which could be included 3 or 4 times inside
      the whole design, and in the shape of the interior of the little
      cell cubic rhombic, polyhedral, concave plane, convex plane,
      biconvex, biconcave with microcells, biconvex on one side (the
      side exposed to light to concentrate it) and flat on the other
      side, cylindrical, circular cylindrical, hollow cylindrical,
      circular cone (straight), truncated cone, rectangular prism
      (straight), oblique prism, rectangular pyramid (straight),
      truncated pyramid, truncated spherical segment, spherical segment,
      spherical sector, spherical with cylindrical perforation, sphere
      with conic perforations, toro (circular section ring), cylinder
      with slanted cut, cylindrical wedge, barrel, semiprism, can be
      used including combinations of these, the power of the microlens
      can range from 0.1 to 100 diopters, the redox properties of the
      materials used in the formation of the compartments (iron, silver,
      copper, nickel, gold, platinum, gallium arsenide, silicon,
      gadolinium, europium, erbium, praseodymium, dysprosium, holmium,
      chromium, magnesium, lead selenide and alloys of them, etc).<br>
      <br>
      The use or not of cathodes y anodes, their material (for example
      platinum, iron, silver, gold, steel, aluminum, nickel, arsenium,
      gadolinium, europium, erbium, praseodymium, dysprosium, holmium,
      chromo, magnesium; gallium), depending on the optimal
      characteristics to recover electrons or hydrogen, but it has to be
      kept in mind that in presence of metal or borium, the hydrogen
      works with -1; another variable is initial pH of the solution that
      can range from 2 or 3 to 8 or 9 units of pH, being the most used
      about 7, the above mentioned variables that can be handled in
      order to control the photoelectrolysis process depending on the
      needs of the project in question.<br>
      <br>
      The core of any efficient photoelectrochemical designs are the
      melanins, i.e. melanin, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives,
      melanin variants and analogues, water soluble, where they catalyze
      the photolysis process, without undergoing significant changes
      except the presence of elements such as magnesium, iron, copper,
      lead, and others, the resulting products of which together with
      the resulting products of the partial reduction of the oxygen atom
      (superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, quinones
      and orthoquinones), can fast or slowly damage the effectiveness of
      melanin, but in the case of pure melanin, at a 10% concentration,
      for example, the duration of the compound is long enough to be
      economically convenient (years), and the synthesis of melanin is a
      very efficient process. Thus, from an economic and ecological
      point of view it is very viable, because pure melanin is fully
      biodegradable. Thus, the little cell only requires a periodic
      supply of distillated water, as well as a periodic replacement of
      soluble melanin, or eventually, the renewal of substances added to
      the design to optimize or potentiate some of the processes
      occurring as a result of exposing the photo-electrochemical design
      to the light. The ecological advantage of the final products of
      the reaction being water molecules, oxygen molecules or atoms,
      hydrogen, high energy electrons, and electrical current can be
      easily realized. There is little generation of greenhouse effect
      CO2 molecules. The transfer of electrons releases energy, which is
      used to establish a proton gradient.<br>
      <br>
      The proton movement during the electrons transportation can be
      compensated by the movement of other ions, so using membrane and a
      solvent with adequate solutes, membrane potential can be formed
      from photons capture by mean of melanin.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolyzing properties of melanin (among many others) can
      explain the light generated peak observable in the
      electroretinogram, because if melanin is illuminated,
      intracellular pH gets down, that activates the chlorine channels
      sensitive to pH in the basolateral cellular membrane. (The light
      peak is an increase of the potential that follows the FOT phase
      (fast oscillation trough) and forms the slowest and longest
      lasting component of the electroretinogram from direct current.
      (Kris 1958, Kolder 1959, Kikadawa 1968, Steinberg 1982).<br>
      <br>
      Melanins, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives, variants and
      analogues, oxidize the water molecule to O, O2, and H2, absorbing
      energy obtained by the light (photons), and reduce oxygen atom
      with hydrogen atoms to H2O, liberating energy (electricity,
      although it can “keep” the electricity, i.e. it can function as a
      battery or accumulator, i.e. not only generating energy but also
      keeping it for a while and within some limits). That is why the
      cell design can be adapted to the requirements.<br>
      <br>
      H2 and O2 atoms are produced with light, but the generation of
      these elements can be increased by melanin doping (melanin, its
      precursors, variants, derivatives, or synthetic or natural
      analogues) with metals or adding organic and inorganic molecules,
      also modifying the electrolyte concentrations, adding drugs or
      controlling the characteristics of light, over the liquid
      containing water and melanins (melanin, its precursors, variants,
      derivatives, or synthetic or natural analogues), for example with
      a design based on microlens to condensate or selecting determinate
      wavelength, using coherent or disperse, monochromatic,
      polychromatic, continuous, discontinuous, natural, artificial,
      light; etc. The photoelectrochemical reactions happen in two ways,
      i.e. the water molecule is separated but also formed, so it can
      recover electric current of the design and it can also be
      optimized through melanin doping with different substances (drugs,
      metals, electrolytes, organic and inorganic molecules, and others)
      or by light concentration by mean of lens, among others.<br>
      <br>
      The box containing the liquid can have different shapes that adapt
      to different needs, in the house roofs, car roofs, plants
      buildings, industrial processes, etc. cells connected among them,
      but the central component of the design is melanin (melanins, its
      precursors, its derivatives, its variants, its analogues, water
      soluble), that induces and carries out the photolysis of the water
      molecule, in presence of light.<br>
      <br>
      The melanins, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives, melanin
      variants and analogues remove electrons from water and generate a
      gradient of protons.<br>
      <br>
      The light depending reactions can also generate energy to reduce
      CO2 to CH2O, nitrates to ammonia and sulphates to sulphydriles.<br>
      <br>
      A compound that has been reported in the literature and that has
      shown to induce and carry out these processes is the chlorophyll
      but because it absorbs light mainly in the extreme regions of the
      visible spectrum, it is estimated that 80% of the irradiated
      energy is wasted, in contrast, with our offer to use melanin,
      because it practically absorbs soft and hard ultraviolet
      electromagnetic radiations, all the visible spectrum and the far
      and near infrared lengths (Spicer &amp; Goldberg 1996). It would
      not be surprising that it could absorb other types of energy such
      as kinetic energy or other wavelengths of the electromagnetic
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We conducted small scale experiments. Once we inferred these
      interesting properties of melanins according the structure
      activity relation, we placed soluble synthetic melanin in water,
      forming a 1% solution in five 20 mL transparent, high density
      polythene flasks, at room temperature. We measured the pH before
      and after lighting them during 30 minutes with visible light of
      natural source (sun) not concentrated; measuring the pH, we
      obtained in average a decrease of two decimals of unit of pH (from
      7.3 to 7.1), we consider it significant because melanins have
      buffering property per se, so the change must be larger, but is
      hidden by melanin intrinsic buffering property, and thus we only
      detected part of this pH modification, a change of pH the
      magnitude of which is related to the biological system, because if
      it were greater, it would probably severely destroy or damage the
      cell, but a change of this size is enough to induce biological
      changes that involves said extraordinary compound. To determine
      the biological magnitude of a decrease of 0.2 units of pH, we will
      mention that, in the case of blood, this reduction increases more
      than 10% the calcium concentration.<br>
      <br>
      Besides, the total blood pH ranges from 7.38 to 7.44, the arterial
      blood pH ranges from 7.36 to 7.41, and the vein blood pH ranges
      from 7.37 to 7.45, i.e., the variations are within a very narrow
      margin, and thus a difference of 2 decimals of unit of pH is
      really significant in a biological system.<br>
      <br>
      In an initial close design we estimated the liberation of hydrogen
      in function of electric current generation, and obtained 50 mV on
      average and 110 mV between each peak, corresponding to about one
      to two units of pH, what is equivalent to the production of
      1×10&lt;-7 &gt;mol/liter of hydrogen per each pH unit, because the
      molecular weight of hydrogen indicates that a mol of it is equal
      to a gram of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the melanocyte, is the cell showing most
      affinity for calcium in the organism, showing an affinity one
      thousand times higher than the bone, because although the latter
      has a larger quantity, it is only deposited in mineral form.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that this change from 0.2 to 1.0 units of pH, as
      well as its reversion when they were placed in flasks in a dark
      place, was foreseen by our theoretical system, i.e. when we made
      the experiment we knew the result we were going to obtain, in
      other words, we did not make many experiments, we only made it
      twice or three times, resulting as we expected. The solutions of
      melanin used in the experiments had been prepared for at least 3
      years, were not doped; and as pointed out by the theoretical
      system, it is a very long lasting compound, very stable in water,
      that does not require preservatives, or refrigeration, is not
      contaminated with microorganisms despite the age of the
      preparation, and these solutions only need to be kept in a fresh
      and dry place; that is why we were relatively sure that the
      reaction was going to happened, though we could not foresee its
      magnitude because the buffering capacity of melanin is not known
      or it is not possible to assess it exactly because the melanin
      formula is not fully known.<br>
      <br>
      This experiment also demonstrated that melanin does not require
      preservatives and its electrolyzing properties are maintained
      despite the time (3 years after being synthesized). We are now
      working on improving the protocols to answer to some of the many
      questions that are generated through these experiments, but
      because of the extraordinary possibilities of industrial, medical,
      energetic, and laboratory applications of the electrolyzing
      characteristics of melanin, we decided to protect immediately its
      use in the photoelectrochemical processes of energy generation.<br>
      <br>
      A photoelectrochemical system was built that works with natural
      light, the reactive cell of which contains up to 1.3% of melanin,
      i.e. more than 98% is water. Optionally metals or drugs can be
      used to increase its efficiency. The little cell has been
      hermetically sealed to avoid that gases generated escape. Another
      variable refers to the electrodes, their geometry and nature that
      can be conductors, semiconductors or semimetals. Each millimeter
      of electrolyzing material has produced 10 millivolts and
      microampers day and night, during years, recharges of
      electrolyzing material or water have not been required; it has
      been conducted at room temperature showing that it is an
      efficient, economical and versatile photolectrochemical system.<br>
      <br>
      In this example, we managed to light the first light emitting
      diode (LED), which remains lit six months later. The cells do
      produce electricity and we are working on making them more
      efficient and scaling them up to competitive costs. Initially, we
      used a concentration of 1.3% melanin and 98.7% water. Later, when
      we increased the concentration of melanin to 4%, the generation of
      electricity increased exponentially. In terms of technological
      development, we have achieved progress I consider to be
      significant and which can reflect the potential of such cells.<br>
      <br>
      Besides, we were able to connect up a small music player, since
      each cell now produces 600 mV and 200 mA, that is, a thousand
      times more than the 200 µA we used to achieve.<br>
      <br>
      We have produced a liter and a half of melanin every three months
      and our cells were of 30 mL and produced 400 mV and 10 µA.
      However, currently, in our small laboratory, we produce about 200
      liters of melanin daily. <br>

      An electrochemical process and system for producing glucose and
      glucose precursors are described. The process and system allow for
      the production of glucose from carbon dioxide and water, requiring
      only melanin, or a precursor, derivative, analog, or variant of
      melanin, and electromagnetic energy, such as visible or invisible
      light energy.<br>
      <b><br>
        FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates to processes and systems for
      producing glucose. In particular, the invention relates to the
      production of glucose from water, carbon dioxide, electromagnetic
      energy, and melanin, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives,
      melanin analogs, or melanin variants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Glucose is a simple sugar having the general chemical
      formula C6H1206. Glucose is a basic molecule of the food chain and
      is consumed by many organisms as a primary source of energy. One
      well studied process that results in the production of glucose is
      plant photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In general, photosynthesis is the process of converting
      light energy into chemical energy. More specifically, through the
      process of photosynthesis, plants use light energy to convert
      carbon dioxide (C02) and water (H20) into oxygen (02) and glucose.
      Another critical component to this process is the pigment known as
      chlorophyll. Chlorophyll initiates photosynthesis by absorbing
      light energy or photons. For every photon absorbed, chlorophyll
      loses one electron, creating a flow of electrons which
      subsequently generates the energy necessary to catalyze the
      splitting of water into hydrogen ions or protons (H&lt;+&gt;) and
      02. The resulting proton gradient is used to generate chemical
      energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This chemical
      energy is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into
      glucose.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Similar to chlorophyll, melanin is also classified as a
      pigment. Melanin is composed of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and
      carbon, although the exact structure has not been fully
      elucidated. Melanin is ubiquitous in nature and methods are also
      known in the literature for synthesis of melanin. For many years,
      melanin had no biological or physiological function attributed to
      it, other than it being considered a simple sunscreen with a low
      protection factor equivalent to that of a 2% copper sulfate
      solution. Melanin has also been considered the darkest molecule
      because it is able to absorb energy of almost any wavelength, yet
      it did not seem to emit any energy. This was unique to melanin,
      and it contradicted thermodynamic laws because other compounds
      capable of absorbing energy, particularly pigments, emit a portion
      of the energy absorbed. The electronic properties of melanin have
      thus been the focus of attention for quite some time. However,
      melanin is one of the most stable compounds known to man and, for
      a long time, it seemed that melanin was unable to catalyze any
      chemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Recently, the intrinsic property of melanin to absorb
      energy and utilize the absorbed energy to split and subsequently
      reform the water molecule was discovered. Thus, melanin absorbs
      all wavelengths of electromagnetic energy, including visible and
      invisible light energy, and dissipates this absorbed energy by
      means of water dissociation and its consequent reformation. A
      photoelectrochemical process for separating water into hydrogen
      and oxygen, using melanin, and analogs, precursors, derivatives,
      or variants of melanin is described in U.S. Patent Application
      Publication No. US 2011/0244345.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Without wishing to be bound by any theories, it is believed
      that the reaction inside melanin occurs according to the following
      Scheme I:<br>
      <br>
      2H20 ^?2H2+ 02+ 4e (I)<br>
      <br>
      Upon the absorption of electromagnetic energy such as light energy
      (visible or invisible), melanin catalyzes the dissociation of
      water into diatomic hydrogen (H2), diatomic oxygen (02), and
      electrons (e&lt;"&gt;). Although the splitting of water into
      hydrogen and oxygen consumes energy, the reaction is reversible,
      and in the reverse process the reduction of oxygen atoms with
      diatomic hydrogen to reform the water molecules liberates energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Thus, melanin is able to transform light energy into
      chemical energy, analogous to the process by which plants use
      chlorophyll to transform light energy into chemical energy during
      photosynthesis. Therefore, by analogy, we have designated this
      process "human photosynthesis." However, there are at least two
      important distinctions between the water splitting reaction
      carried out by melanin and that carried out by chlorophyll. The
      first is that chlorophyll cannot catalyze the reverse process of
      reforming the water molecule. The second is that the water
      splitting reaction by chlorophyll can only occur in a living cell
      and with visible light having a wavelength in the range of 400 nm
      to 700 nm. Thus, the subsequent production of glucose can also
      only occur inside the living cell. In contrast, melanin can split
      and reform the water molecule outside of a living cell using any
      form of electromagnetic energy, particularly with light energy
      (visible or invisible) having a wavelength in the range of 200 nm
      to 900 nm. <br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] It is now discovered that upon the absorption of
      electromagnetic energy, such as invisible or visible light energy,
      melanin can split and reform the water molecule, and subsequently
      catalyze a reaction that transforms carbon dioxide (C02) and water
      into glucose.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The invention relates to electrochemical processes and
      systems for utilizing melanin, melanin precursors, melanin
      derivatives, melanin analogs, and melanin variants to produce
      glucose from carbon dioxide and water. According to embodiments of
      the invention, melanin can be used to produce glucose from carbon
      dioxide and water, additionally requiring only a source of<br>
      <br>
      electromagnetic energy, such as invisible or visible light energy,
      gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation,
      microwaves, and radiowaves. Unlike the ability of chlorophyll to
      convert light energy into chemical energy, which is subsequently
      used to produce glucose in living cells by the process of
      photosynthesis, melanin can be used to produce glucose via an<br>
      <br>
      electrochemical process that can be performed outside a living
      cell. Thus, until now, such a process for producing glucose has
      not been replicated in the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In one general aspect, the invention relates to an
      electrochemical process for producing glucose (C6H1206). According
      to embodiments of the invention, the electrochemical process
      comprises reacting water and carbon dioxide gas dissolved therein,
      in the presence of at least one melanin material and a source of
      electromagnetic energy. The at least one melanin material is
      selected from melanin, melanin precursors, melanin derivatives,
      melanin analogs, and melanin variants. Because melanin is able to
      absorb electromagnetic energy and transform this<br>
      <br>
      electromagnetic energy into usable chemical energy, an external
      electric current is not required for the production of glucose
      according to an electrochemical process of the invention.
      According to a preferred embodiment, an electrochemical process of
      the invention is a photoelectrochemical process, and the source of
      electromagnetic energy is photoelectric energy selected from
      visible and invisible light having a wavelength in the range of
      200 run to 900 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another general aspect, the invention relates to an
      electrochemical process for producing CnH2nOnspecies, wherein n
      represents an integer. In a preferred embodiment, n represents 1,
      2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, such that a CnH2nOnspecies produced by a process
      of the invention is a glucose precursor, or glucose itself.
      According to embodiments of the invention, the<br>
      <br>
      electrochemical process comprises reacting water and carbon
      dioxide gas dissolved therein, in the presence of at least one
      melanin material and a source of electromagnetic energy,
      preferably photoelectric energy selected from visible and
      invisible light energy having a wavelength in the range of 200 nm
      to 900 nm. [0013] In yet another general aspect, the invention
      relates to systems for producing glucose and CnH2nOn species from
      water, carbon dioxide, melanin and a source of electromagnetic
      energy. According to embodiments of the invention, a system for
      producing glucose via an electrochemical process comprises:<br>
      <br>
      (i) a reaction cell for receiving water and C02gas dissolved
      therein, and at least one melanin material, wherein the at least
      one melanin material is selected from melanin, melanin precursors,
      melanin derivatives, melanin analogs, and melanin variants; and<br>
      <br>
      (ii) a source of electromagnetic energy, such that the
      electromagnetic energy is transmitted into the reaction cell and
      is absorbed by the melanin material.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The system for producing glucose according to embodiments
      of the invention does not require any complicated operation or
      set-up, and thus only requires a container for receiving water and
      C02gas dissolved therein, and at least one melanin material, as
      well as a source of<br>
      <br>
      electromagnetic energy to provide the at least one melanin
      material with sufficient amounts of energy to catalyze the
      splitting and reformation of the water molecule and the subsequent
      formation of glucose. According to a preferred embodiment, the
      source of electromagnetic energy transmits visible or invisible
      light energy having a wavelength between 200 nm and 900 nm into
      the reaction cell.<br>

      will be apparent from the following detailed description and the
      appended claims.<br>

      <br>
      [0020] According to embodiments of the invention, an
      electrochemical process for producing glucose comprises reacting
      water and C02gas dissolved therein, in the presence of at least
      one melanin material and a source of electromagnetic energy. Forms
      of electromagnetic energy suitable for use in an electrochemical
      process of the invention include visible and invisible light,
      gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation,
      microwaves, and radiowaves. According to a preferred embodiment,
      an electrochemical process according to the invention is a<br>
      <br>
      photoelectrochemical process, wherein the source of
      electromagnetic energy is photoelectric energy selected from
      visible light and invisible (ultraviolet and infrared radiation)
      light.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] According to embodiments of the invention, the at least one
      melanin material is selected from melanin, melanin precursors,
      melanin derivatives, melanin analogs, and melanin variants. In a
      preferred embodiment, the at least one melanin material is
      selected from natural melanin and synthetic melanin.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] According to embodiments of the invention, melanin can by
      synthesized from amino acid precursors of melanin, such as
      L-tyrosine. However, melanin materials can be obtained by any
      method known in the art in view of the present disclosure,
      including chemically synthesizing melanin materials and isolating
      melanin materials from natural sources, such as plants and
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] According to another embodiment of the invention, an
      electrochemical process can be carried out in the presence of at
      least one melanin device. The melanin device is comprised of a
      substrate and at least one melanin material, such that the melanin
      material is held on or within the substrate. The melanin material
      can be dispersed throughout the substrate or adsorbed onto the
      substrate. Preferably, the substrate is transparent to allow for
      increased transmission of electromagnetic energy in the form of
      light energy, and therefore increased glucose production. A
      melanin device can comprise one type of melanin material, or more
      than one type of melanin material. For example, a melanin device
      for use in the invention can comprise melanin and eumelanin.
      According to another embodiment of the invention, more than one
      melanin device, with each device comprising a different type of
      melanin material can be used. For example, a first melanin device
      comprising melanin and a second melanin device comprising
      eumelanin can both be used in a process of producing glucose
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] A purpose of using a melanin device in an electrochemical
      process of the invention is to prevent the melanin material from
      dissolving in the water, diffusing through the water, or floating
      freely throughout the water. The melanin device ensures that the
      water retains its transparency and melanin is not lost during
      replenishment of water or C02or removal of glucose. Thus, the
      melanin device allows for the melanin material to remain in
      contact with the water without being dissolved in the water. The
      substrate of the melanin device can be any inert material,
      including, but not limited to, silica, plastic, and glass. The
      melanin device can be, for example, a melanin/silica plate, which
      can be made by combining a cementing mixture of silica with an
      aqueous melanin solution. Preferably, a melanin device for use in
      the invention is melanin mixed with silica.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to embodiments of the invention, the melanin
      device can take on any size or shape, including but not limited to
      a rod (cylindrical), plate, sphere, or cube-shape. At least one
      melanin device can be used, but the number of melanin devices, or
      the size or shape of the melanin devices, is not limited in any
      way. The rate of the reaction will be controlled by the size,
      shape, surface area, amount of melanin material and number of
      melanin devices used in the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      According to a preferred embodiment, the size, shape and number of
      melanin devices are selected based on the desired reaction rate of
      the electrochemical process. For example, using a larger number of
      melanin devices will result in a faster rate of glucose
      production. As another illustrative example, a larger amount of
      melanin material in the melanin device will result in a faster
      rate of glucose production.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] An electrochemical process according to embodiments of the
      invention will be initiated when the melanin material absorbs
      electromagnetic energy and catalyzes the electrolysis of water
      into H2and 02. According to one embodiment of the invention (batch
      process), carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in the water only once,
      prior to the initiation of the photoelectrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment (continuous process), the
      photoelectrochemical process further comprises continuously
      dissolving C02gas in the water to continuously replenish the C0
      gas as it is consumed and converted to glucose. Any suitable
      method for continuously dissolving C02gas in the water can be
      used. For example, the C02gas can be continuously injected into
      the water by pipes or tubes connected to a gas pump. The pipes or
      tubes can be made of any material that is inert and substantially
      impermeable to C02gas, including but not limited to polyethylene.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to a particular embodiment of the invention, a
      process for producing glucose is a photoelectrochemical process
      requiring a source of photoelectric energy. Preferably, the source
      of photoelectric energy is either visible or invisible light
      having a wavelength ranging from 200 nm to 900 nm. In a more
      preferred embodiment, the source of photoelectric energy is
      natural light.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] According to another embodiment of the invention, the
      electrochemical process can be performed at room temperature
      (approximately 25°C), preferably at a temperature below room
      temperature in the range of 0°C to 25 °C, and more preferably at a
      temperature ranging from 2°C to 8°C. Although lower temperatures
      can decrease the turnover rate of splitting and reforming the
      water molecules, a lower temperature incubation preserves the
      C02gas bubbles introduced at the start of the process and
      eliminates the need to continuously inject C02gas into the water.
      Thus, using lower temperatures has the main advantage of rendering
      the electrochemical process technically simpler to execute.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] An electrochemical process according to the invention can
      further comprise a step of isolating the glucose obtained from the
      reaction of carbon dioxide, water, and the at least one melanin
      material. As an illustrative example, glucose can be isolated by
      evaporating the aqueous reaction solution. However, glucose can be
      identified and measured without being isolated by, for example,
      spectrophotometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The invention also relates to an electrochemical process
      for producing CnH2nOnspecies, wherein n represents an integer.
      Preferably n is 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, such that the CnH2nOnspecies
      is a glucose precursor, or glucose itself. According to
      embodiments of the invention, an electrochemical process for
      producing CnH2nOnspecies can be the same as that used to produce
      glucose, and comprises reacting water and C02gas dissolved
      therein, in the presence of at least one melanin material and a
      source of electromagnetic energy. Preferably, the source of
      electromagnetic energy is photoelectric energy selected from
      visible light and invisible (ultraviolet and infrared radiation)
      light. Other embodiments of a process for producing CnH2nOnspecies
      according to the invention can be the same as those described for
      an electrochemical process for producing glucose according to the
      invention. Preferably, an electrochemical process for producing
      CnH2nOnspecies is a photoelectrochemical process.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The precise mechanism by which melanin is able use
      electromagnetic energy to produce glucose, glucose precursors, and
      other CnH2nOnspecies from C02and water in an electrochemical
      process according to embodiments of the invention is not yet fully
      understood. Without wishing to be bound by any theories, it is
      believed that melanin absorbs the electromagnetic energy,
      promoting conversion of low energy electrons to high energy
      electrons. The high energy electrons are transferred by mobile
      electron carriers within the melanin material. This electron
      transfer releases energy and establishes a proton gradient
      sufficient to initiate the splitting of water into diatomic
      hydrogen (H2) and diatomic oxygen (02) along with the release of
      four high energy electrons. Thus, melanin releases molecules of
      H2and 02, as well as a flow of high energy electrons in all
      directions, controlled by diffusion. The released hydrogen and
      high energy electrons have different types of energy, and it is
      thought that both types of energy play a role in the conversion of
      C02and water into glucose and other CnH2nOnspecies. Although the
      splitting of water into H2and 02consumes energy, the reaction is
      reversible and the reduction of 02with H2to reform the water
      molecules liberates energy. Thus, after the water molecule is
      split, the water molecule must be reformed in order to supply
      energy to the glucose production reaction that occurs from the
      fusion of C02and water.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Many factors will affect the rate and efficiency of an
      electrochemical process for producing glucose according to
      embodiments of the invention. These factors include, but are not
      limited to, the amount of energy released by splitting and
      reforming the water molecules, the entropy of the dissolved
      C02gas, the amount of dissolved C02gas, temperature, pressure, the
      wavelength of electromagnetic energy supplied to the reaction, and
      the amount of electromagnetic energy absorbed by the melanin
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, an
      electrochemical process for producing glucose is performed under
      sterile conditions, meaning that there is substantially no
      bacteria present in the reaction. Because bacteria can consume
      glucose, the presence of bacteria can decrease the amount of
      glucose produced by an electrochemical process according to the
      invention. Reactions can be sterilized by any method known in the
      art in view of the present disclosure, including but not limited
      to filter sterilization and heat sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The dissociation and reformation of the water molecule to
      produce energy that is subsequently used to produce glucose from
      carbon dioxide and water can by catalyzed by at least one melanin
      material, wherein the at least one melanin material is the only
      water-electrolyzing material present in the reaction. Thus, in
      particular embodiments of the invention, the at least one melanin
      material is the only water-electrolyzing material used in an
      electrochemical process for producing glucose. According to a
      preferred embodiment, melanin (synthetic or natural) is the only
      water electrolyzing material used in a process for producing
      glucose. [0035] Another aspect of the invention provides a system
      for producing glucose via an electrochemical process. According to
      embodiments of the invention, the system is comprised of a
      reaction cell and a source of electromagnetic energy. As used
      herein, the term "reaction cell" refers to any container that can
      receive and hold water and carbon dioxide gas dissolved therein.
      The reaction cell can take on any shape, and can be made of any
      suitable material including, but not limited to, plastics, glass,
      and any other materials that allow for the transmission of the
      desired wavelengths of electromagnetic energy into the reaction
      cell, such that the electrochemical process can occur. The
      material of the reaction cell is preferably transparent to allow
      for the transmission of visible light. The material of the
      reaction cell is also preferably substantially impermeable to
      carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] According to another embodiment, the reaction cell is a
      closed reaction cell. A closed reaction cell is sealed to prevent
      carbon dioxide gas from escaping the reaction cell, and can be
      made of any suitable material as discussed above. Preferably, the
      reaction cell is closed. The reaction cell receives water and
      C02gas dissolved therein, and at least one melanin material. The
      at least one melanin material is selected from melanin, melanin
      precursors, melanin derivatives, melanin analogs, and melanin
      variants, and is preferably melanin (synthetic or natural). In
      another embodiment of the invention, a system comprises the at
      least one melanin material as part of at least one melanin device,
      the device comprised of a substrate and a melanin material as
      discussed above. Preferably, the melanin device comprises melanin
      (natural or synthetic) and silica.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] A system according to the invention is preferably sterile,
      and lacks the presence of any bacteria. The system, including one
      or more of its component parts (reaction cell, tubing, etc.) can
      be sterilized according to any method known in the art that
      eliminates or kills bacteria, such as by applying heat, chemicals,
      irradiation, pressure, or filtration.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] According to embodiments of the invention, the energy
      provided by the source of electromagnetic energy to the reaction
      cell is transmitted through the reaction cell, such that it is
      absorbed by the melanin material. In a preferred embodiment, the
      source of electromagnetic energy provides invisible or visible
      light energy having a wavelength between 200 nm and 900 nm to the
      reaction cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to another embodiment of the invention, the
      system can further comprise a device for continuously injecting
      C02gas into the reaction cell. The device can be, for example, a
      gas pump. The device can be connected to the reaction cell by
      pipes or tubes. If the reaction cell is closed, the device is
      preferably connected in such a way that allows for the closed
      reaction cell to remain sealed to prevent C02gas from escaping.
      Thus, using a closed reaction cell has the advantage of
      eliminating the need to continuously inject carbon dioxide into
      the reaction cell, provided that the container is sufficiently
      sealed to prevent the carbon dioxide gas from escaping.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to embodiments of the invention, a system for
      producing glucose via an electrochemical process can also be used
      to produce CnH2nOnspecies. Preferably the CnH2nOnspecies is a
      glucose precursor, wherein n represents 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The electrochemical process and system for producing
      glucose according to embodiments of the invention, in addition to
      C02gas dissolved in water, requires only the presence of a melanin
      material and electromagnetic energy, preferably photoelectric
      energy, and more preferably light energy, and thus is
      environmentally friendly because no source of external energy,
      other than that present in the natural surroundings is required.
      Furthermore, no complex setup or maintenance is required. The only
      maintenance required is the replacement of the water and dissolved
      C02gas once C02has been consumed and transformed into glucose.
      Because melanin is one of the most stable molecules known to man,
      having a half-life estimated to be on the order of millions of
      years, the melanin material or melanin device can be used for
      decades before it needs to be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In a preferred embodiment, the at least one melanin
      material in the system is melanin (natural or synthetic). In
      another preferred embodiment, melanin is the only
      water-electrolyzing material present in the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The electrochemical process and system for producing
      glucose according to embodiments of the invention have at least
      two important applications. The first application is the
      production of glucose, as described above, which is a basic
      molecule of the food chain. The second application is related to
      the control of atmospheric C02. According to embodiments of the
      invention, the production of glucose requires the consumption of
      C02. Thus, the invention further provides a method for reducing
      atmospheric C02levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Carbon dioxide (C02) is the principal greenhouse gas that
      results from human activities, and the concentration of
      atmospheric C02is increasing at an accelerating rate, contributing
      to global warming and climate change. Although the upper safety
      limit for atmospheric C02has been set at 350 parts per million
      (ppm), atmospheric C02levels have remained above this limit since
      early 1988. In addition, paleo-climate evidence and ongoing
      climate change suggest that C02levels will need to be reduced in
      order to preserve the planet in a state in which life on Earth has
      adapted to.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Furthermore, calculations by NASA researchers indicate
      that, despite unusually low solar activity between 2005 and 2010,
      Earth continued to absorb more energy than it returned to space.
      Thus, climate stabilization will also require a restoration of the
      Earth's energy balance as well as a reduction of C02levels. In
      other words, Earth will need to radiate as much energy to space as
      it absorbs from the sun in order to slow down global warming.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Therefore, new methods for controlling the level of
      atmospheric C02and for consuming absorbed solar energy are greatly
      needed. In a photoelectrochemical process according to embodiments
      of the invention, only light energy and at least one melanin
      material such as melanin (synthetic or natural), a melanin analog,
      or melanin precursor are required to convert C02and water into
      glucose. Thus, both C02and solar energy are consumed in the
      production of glucose by a photoelectrochemical process of the
      invention, which will contribute to a reduction of C02levels while
      simultaneously using absorbed solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1 : Dissociation and reformation of the water
        molecule catalyzed by melanin.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] Two 1 liter closed containers (closed reaction cells) made
      of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), were formed under sterile
      conditions each containing 1 liter of purified water. C02gas was
      dissolved in the water in each container at an initial pressure of
      5 atm, and melanin mixed with silica was placed in one of the two
      containers. The containers were exposed to visible light for six
      weeks and incubated at a temperature of about 2°C to 8°C (35.6°F
      to 46.4°F).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] After 5 days, deformation of the plastic packaging of the
      container containing melanin mixed with silica was observed. In
      contrast, after 6 weeks of exposure to visible light, the plastic
      packaging of the container that did not have any melanin mixed
      with silica showed no visible deformation.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The results of the experiment support the claim that
      melanin has the intrinsic ability to dissociate and reform the
      water molecule in the presence of light energy. This dissociation
      and reformation of the water molecule produced a vacuum, as
      indicated by the deformation of the plastic packaging of only the
      closed container that contained melanin. The energy that is
      produced from splitting and reforming the water molecule catalyzed
      by melanin can subsequently be used to convert carbon dioxide and
      water into glucose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Production of glucose from CO2 dissolved in water,
        melanin and light energy.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0050] Ten sealed, 3 liter closed containers (closed reaction
      cells) made of polyethylene, were formed under sterile conditions
      each containing 1800 mL of purified water. C02was dissolved in the
      water in each container under a pressure of approximately 2.20
      PSI, in sufficient amounts such that numerous bubbles of C02gas
      were easily observed. Five of the containers served as the control
      group and contained no melanin device, and the other five
      containers served as the experimental group. For the experimental
      group, plates of melanin mixed with silica were placed at the
      bottom of each container. The melanin/silica plates were made by
      combining a cementing mixture of silica with an aqueous solution
      of melanin. The melanin used was chemically synthesized in the
      laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The containers of both the control and experimental groups
      were placed in a refrigerator and incubated at a temperature
      ranging between 2°C to 8°C (35.6°F to 46.4°F) for four weeks. The
      purpose of refrigerating the containers was to preserve the C02gas
      initially dissolved in the water. This eliminated the need for
      continuous manipulation of the containers by having to dissolve
      C02in the water either continuously or several times over the
      course of the experiment. Because the refrigerator was composed of
      metal walls, the source of energy supplied to the containers was
      mostly invisible light present within the refrigerator. The
      containers were kept sealed throughout the course of the
      experiment and the visual observance of C02gas bubbles in the
      control group containers throughout the four week incubation
      confirmed that the containers were adequately sealed.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The dissolved C02gas bubbles were observed daily. At the
      end of the first week, the C02bubbles in all of the control group
      containers were still present and showed no change from the start
      of the experiment. On the other hand, in all of the experimental
      group containers, the dissolved C02bubbles disappeared completely
      within a few hours. This indicated that carbon dioxide was being
      consumed, but only in the presence of melanin. The experiment was
      continued for four weeks, even though the carbon dioxide bubbles
      in the experimental containers had disappeared within a few hours,
      to determine if any other product or sediment was formed. At the
      end of the fourth week, the seals of each container in both the
      experimental and control groups were broken under sterile
      conditions and a 10 mL sample of water was removed from each
      container. It should also be noted that at the end of the fourth
      week, the carbon dioxide in the containers of the control group
      showed no change from the start of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The 10 mL samples of water removed from each of the control
      group and experimental group containers were noted to be both
      transparent and odorless. For the experimental group, there was no
      sediment observed in the samples of either group, indicating that
      the melanin had not dispersed from the melanin/silica plates.
      Additional parameters, including the density, pH, and glucose
      concentration were measured in each sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The glucose concentration in each sample was determined by
      spectrophotometry using a standardized glucose oxidase (GOD)
      assay. Briefly, each sample was treated with glucose oxidase to
      oxidize glucose, producing gluconate and hydrogen peroxide. The
      hydrogen peroxide was then oxidatively coupled with
      4-amino-antipyrene (4-AAP) and phenol in the presence of
      peroxidase, producing a red dye quinoeimine. The absorbance of
      quinoeimine at 505 nm, which is directly proportional to the
      concentration of glucose, was then measured and used to determine
      the concentration of glucose in the sample. The results are listed
      below in Table 1.<br>

      glucose can be produced from carbon dioxide and water, requiring
      only melanin and electromagnetic energy, such as invisible light.<br>

      essentially characterised by the use of melanins and the

      radiation which is emitted from heat or any other source and which
      can be absorbed by said compounds, such that the process in
      question, regardless of type, is cooled and can be surrounded or
      have sufficient and suitable contact with the closed-geometry

      into electrical energy, water, oxygen, hydrogen and high-energy
      electrons, depending on the design geometry used. The by-products
      obtained can be varied depending on the geometry of the

      stations since apart from reducing the temperature, providing
      isolation and absorbing dangerous electromagnetic radiation,

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Heat generation mainly (but also of other wavelengths) is a common
      event in most industrial processes, refining, generation, nuclear
      power plants, home and automotive. Air, water is usually used, and
      in the case of car engines propylene glycol derivatives are used
      to cool and lower the temperature, so as not to get out of
      control, but this heat energy is used to generate electricity in
      any case only moves from one body to another. In the case of water
      cooling nuclear reactors, cooled in water, and the resulting steam
      is used to move a coil that generates electricity. In the case of
      the melanins, its precursors, analogs and derivatives thereof,
      directly energize electromagnetic radiation intra- and
      intermolecular processes that result in the generation of
      electricity and water, depending on the design or containing the
      substrate can promote the generation opt hydrogen, oxygen, and
      high energy electrons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our invention operates on the property of melanins, their
      precursors, analogs or derivatives thereof, discovered by us and
      described in detail in PCT / MX2005 / 000092 patent. to absorb
      electromagnetic radiation in a very efficient, possibly the entire
      electromagnetic spectrum, using this energy to break and join the
      water molecule, one of the end products of this cycle power
      generation .. The heat is transmitted primarily in the region
      Infrared electromagnetic spectrum. Melanins efficiently absorb
      such radiations (among many others), and according to the law of
      Lavoisier, will be transformed into another type of energy, which
      fortunately, in the case of melanins ultimately result in the
      generation of electricity. It has already been described in other
      patents of us (PCT / MX2005 / 000092) as detailed in that case the
      event, summarizing have to melanin, its precursors, analogs and
      derivatives thereof, in the presence of light (electromagnetic
      radiation - all electromagnético-) spectrum and water, some water
      molecule in 3 picoseconds, giving hydrogen and oxygen as well as
      high-energy electrons, but as the reverse reaction supports the
      same substrate (melanin) then we have to re-form water and
      electricity, both reactions occur in the same medium, a stable
      state, that is, if the variables are right is conditional; in the
      continuous generation of electricity, which is very useful
      product. The novelty of our invention is that then, heat and / or
      radiation of any wavelength within the electromagnetic spectrum;
      generated under different industrial processes, both at home or in
      the case of combustion engines by gasoline, diesel or the like,
      including nuclear, can be exploited to generate electricity.
      Currently, none of the methods of cooling and / or insulating
      these processes produces a product as useful as electricity, or at
      least without requiring greater combustion. Our invention is based
      on the colossal property of melanins, its precursors, analogs and
      derivatives thereof to convert electromagnetic radiation into
      electricity and water or, depending on the reaction equilibrium
      obtain hydrogen, oxygen and high energy electrons. This discovered
      by us, as described in PCT / MX2005 / 000092 patent.<br>
      <br>
      Our invention begins with "wrap" virtually Photoelectrochemical
      cells based melanins, its precursors, analogs and derivatives
      thereof; "hot spots" or heat emitting and / or radiation of any
      kind capable of being absorbed by melanin; industrial plants,
      nuclear power plants; the roofs of the houses; and in the case of
      cars, engines, ie any process of natural and / or artificial; so
      that this wonderful substrate to absorb the heat or other energy,
      we will generate photolysis of water and / or photo hydro
      synthesis, giving oxygen, hydrogen and high-energy electrons in
      the first case and water and electricity the second case. It is
      obvious that by absorbing heat or radiant some energy, a decrease
      in temperature of the "hot" areas either industrial structures,
      nuclear reactors, houses and / or engines, either automotive or
      other (nuclear occurs inclusive). In the case of engines to
      generate electricity from the heat generated by combustion, allow
      us called hybrid designs that currently rely on batteries or
      accumulators that feed an electric motor that provides a small
      part of horsepower needed to move the vehicle, and the batteries
      or accumulators are recharged in part, by devices that generate
      electricity by rotation or movement and which are placed on the
      moving parts of the vehicle, for example on the axes; but also
      need to be recharged by connecting to the power of the house. The
      internal combustion engine moves based on burning gasoline, but
      under imminent oil shortage is frantically looking for ways to
      decrease significantly the consumption of fossil fuels; so the
      application of melanins for cooling internal combustion engines,
      with a consequent generation of hydrogen and / or electricity,
      depending on the design of photoelectrochemical cell used, engines
      allow vehicles to be smaller, much smaller than today, since
      melanin efficiently absorb the heat radiation (among many others),
      and then the electricity produced by them will recharge in varying
      degrees or feed entirely on batteries and accumulators for
      electric motors that count the vehicle, possibly with the
      efficiency needed to avoid recharging is necessary (batteries or
      accumulators) using household current. This will surely result in
      a significant increase in the autonomy of the vehicle and lower
      fuel consumption, since the engines would be smaller.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of industrial plants, high consumption of electricity,
      common in most industrial processes could be reduced to a greater
      or lesser extent, thanks to optimal utilization of the detached
      along supply chains radiant energy (heat or some other
      wavelength), because in addition to cooling and hence cooling or
      insulating areas that emit heat or radiation of some sort, which
      is something very useful, we would have a product (electricity) to
      energize us another link in the chain, allowing us greater or
      lesser extent, optimize consumption electric current with the
      consequent reduction of costs, a lower generation of greenhouse
      gases, and perhaps even amazing optimizing the processes used in
      the manufacture of countless articles that forms the current
      economic activity. In the case of nuclear and / or nuclear sources
      (reactors) this invention represents an additional advantage,
      since the melanin has ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation
      of high speed, so apart from insulation shield radioactive coolant
      and also generate electricity. Needless to detail here, the many
      economic policies advantages, ecological, environmental, legal;
      etc; resulting from a lower power consumption and better use of
      industrial processes, and already installed and widely used
      engines. Furthermore, depending on the characteristics of the
      photoelectrochemical cell based melanin, or their precursors,
      analogs and derivatives thereof; We can obtain hydrogen, oxygen,
      high-energy electrons or water and electricity. All depending on
      the geometry of the designs of the "envelope" shaped base
      fotoelectroquírnicas melanin cells. This application for cooling
      and / or absorb heat radiation or some other form within the
      electro-magnetic, capable of being absorbed by melanin, its
      precursors, analogs and derivatives thereof, spectrum can be
      applied to any process of natural origin and / or artificial. Any
      type of radiant energy can promote biochemical reactions in
      melanin involving photolysis and / or fotohidrosíntesis. So our
      patent application processes has natural and / or artificial.<br>

      active and free from undesirable pollutants or toxic materials.
      The purity obtained makes it possible for the melanin to be used
      immediately in compounds designed for human use, for cosmetic use,
      for industrial use and for electronic designs. It requires no
      preservatives, it is highly stable and it is highly uniform.<br>

      The structure/activity relationship of the melanins makes it

      <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We began a study about the three main causes of blindness in 1990,
      because their incidence and prevalence have not changed in the
      last forty years. Twelve years later we concluded that the main
      source of energy for the human retina is water, not ATP. And this
      is also true for the entire human body. Water is the main source
      of energy. The amazing capability of eukaryotic cells to break or
      dissociate the water molecule was unsuspected to us because it
      takes 2000°C degrees to dissociate water in a laboratory
      environment, and until today, it was believed that only plants
      were capable of accomplishing this. Photosynthesis occurs in
      humans as it does in plants. The water that we drink every day is
      not just to wash away detritus and toxins; it is not just a
      cleaner, nor a simple solvent. When our body dissociates the water
      molecule, cells are able to get their energy from Hydrogen
      (Hydrogen is the energy carrier that Nature uses the most). Water
      is our main source of energy. If our body couldn’t acquire energy
      from water, we would need to eat between 50 - 170 kg (110 - 374
      lbs) daily. In any system, when a generalized failure occurs, we
      must suspect energy first. Parkinson and Alzheimer’s Disease are
      examples of a generalized failure. That explains why it is not
      uncommon that patients improve dramatically with pharmacological
      stimulation of the human photosynthesis process. Recall that the
      brain needs energy not only to grow or to perform its functions,
      but also to preserve its form and shape. The best energy for human
      cells is Hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many molecular changes have been detected in Alzheimer’s disease,
      but the overarching theme that emerges from the data is that an
      accumulation of misfolded proteins in the aging brain results in
      oxidative and inflammatory impairment, like the damage that occurs
      in other tissues, such as the eye, skin, liver, etc., which in
      turn leads to energy failure and synaptic dysfunction1. However,
      in light of our new knowledge and discoveries, we can say that
      glucose is not a source of energy, rather, it is just a source of
      biomass, therefore, the energy failure happens first, and
      alterations to the biomass, happen secondly.<br>
      <br>
      Cerebral plaques laden with ß-amyloid peptide (Aß) and dystrophic
      neurites in neocortical terminal fields, as well as prominent
      neurofibrillary tangles in medial tem poral-lobe structures, are
      important pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease, however,
      they are not specific. Loss of neurons and white matter,
      congophilic (amyloid) angiopathy, inflammation, and oxidative
      damage are also present, but are not pathognomonic of AD. Aß
      peptides are natural products of metabolism consisting of 36 to 43
      amino acids. Therefore it seems that the sequence of normal
      metabolism does occur but with alterations difficult to assign to
      the relationship activity-structure of the molecules themselves,
      because their presence is normal at certain levels.<br>
      <br>
      An imbalance between production and clearance, and aggregation of
      peptides, causes Aß to accumulate, and this imbalance more than
      the final excess of byproducts, may be the initiating factor in
      Alzheimer’s disease. From our point of view, the imbalance is a
      result of the low levels of energy available. On the other hand,
      Aß spontaneously self-aggregates into multiple coexisting physical
      forms, a common behavior in many molecules in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Amyloid ß</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      2.1. Alzheimer’s Disease Is an Energy, and Not a Biomass Troble In
      brain-slice preparations, dimers and trimers of Aß are toxic to
      synapses [1]. The severity of the cognitive defect in Alzheimer’s
      disease correlates with levels of oligomers in the brain, not the
      total Aß burden [2]. Neuronal activation rapidly increases Aß
      secretion at the synapse, a process tied to the normal release of
      vesicles containing neurotransmitters. Physiologic levels of
      synaptic Aß may dampen excitatory transmission and prevent
      neuronal hyperactivity [3]. Therefore, molecular changes described
      in the literature concerning AD are based in compounds that are
      not strange to the tissue, the main difference between normal and
      ill tissue is the amount present, we could say; in general terms,
      the changes in biomass composition observed in the brain of
      patients with AD are not really significant, therefore Alzheimer’s
      Disease is not a biomass problem, it is an energy problem.<br>
      <br>
      Increased oxidative stress, the impaired protein-folding function
      of the endoplasmic reticulum, and deficient proteasome-mediated
      and autophagic-mediated clearance of damaged proteins—all of which
      are also associated with aging—accelerate the accumulation of
      amyloid and tau proteins in Alzheimer’s disease [4]. Therefore, a
      generalized failure of the cell is evident, and in any system,
      with a similar behavior, we must think of energy first.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2. Energy and Eukaryotic Cell</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main source of energy of the eukaryotic cell is water, not
      ATP. The profound misconception that food, glucose or ATP are the
      main source of energy has its basis in the lack of knowledge of
      the hitherto unknown capacity of melanin to split the water
      molecule [5]. Until today, the fact that human tissues have the
      capability to take hydrogen from water—the energy carrier by
      excellence in the whole Universe—arising from the splitting of
      water, as plants do, was totally unknown before our work.<br>
      <br>
      It was unthinkable that an expensive chemical reaction, from the
      energetic point of view, such as water dissociation, that requires
      2000°C in the laboratory to take place, might occur at room
      temperature in our body. The sole possibility seemed berserk.
      However, our studies researching the three main causes of
      blindness allowed us to detect the hitherto unknown fact that
      melanin is the “human chlorophyll”. This amazing compound absorbs
      photonic energy and transforms it into chemical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. The Cycle of Solís-Herrer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An exhaustively review of melanin is out of the scope of this
      work, therefore we will write only about the main characteristics
      of the process. We refer the interested reader to the works of Dr.
      Paul Meredith and Dr. Dadachova [6].<br>
      <br>
      The reaction in chlorophyll is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      2H2O 2H2 + O2<br>
      <br>
      where as in melanin, the reaction is:<br>
      <br>
      2H2O 2H2 + O2<br>
      <br>
      Notice that the reaction in melanin occurs in both directions.<br>
      <br>
      This apparently slight difference between the two is the hallmark
      of mammal and human life. It is not about dissociating ad
      infinitum, because hydrogen and the energy that it carries are the
      basic fuel of the cell. Eukaryotic cells use hydrogen in many
      ways, starting with the fact that hydrogen is without a doubt the
      best-known antioxidant. Hydrogen could even reduce oxygen itself
      and form that strange substance that we call water. Therefore, the
      main product of the chemical reaction is hydrogen, the energy
      carrier by excellence in Nature; oxygen is toxic at any level.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, melanin could increase oxygen concentration in some
      tissues, by means of water dissociation, up to 97% but not more,
      because at that point the reaction changes direction and begins to
      reform water, and produces simultaneously with the liquid an
      orderly flux of electrons that could be registered with
      appropriate instruments as an undulant direct current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.1. Mitochondria, the Power House of the Eukaryotic Cell</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In many diseases without a defined or specific anatomic or
      histological substrate, such as Alzheimer’s and other
      neurodegenerative processes of unknown etiology, it’s very likely
      that the ground alteration is a chronic shortage more than an
      acute shortage of the supply and thereafter availability of
      hydrogen from the water dissociation process. The main and
      consistent findings should be mitochondrial alterations, because
      hydrogen is the precise compound that drives ATP synthase, and
      when hydrogen supply is not adequate, then the main function of
      ATP synthase (synthesis of ATP) is impaired. Pioneering
      biochemical studies have long forged the concept that the
      mitochondria are the energy powerhouse of the cell. These studies,
      combined with the unique evolutionary origin of the mitochondria,
      led the way to decades of research focusing on the organelle as an
      essential, yet independent, functional component of the cell [7].
      However, mitochondria are organelles that function within an
      integrated reticulum that is continually remodeled by both fusion
      and fission events; therefore like any other cell component they
      require energy. So, where is this energy for the mitochondria
      coming from?<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.2. The Answer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water dissociation is the answer. We could infer that the way the
      human photosystem releases energy is completely adequate with many
      diverse goals. The energy spreads out continuously and
      symmetrically in all directions through the cytoplasm, night and
      day. Furthermore, water splitting is not the source of energy for
      the mitochondria alone, rather every organelle inside any
      eukaryotic cell needs energy to stay in good function, shape and
      therefore performance (Figure 1).<br>
      <br>
      In regards to the relationship between water dissociation and ATP
      formation we have that the hydrogen released by the Human
      Photosynthesis process it is not solely or exclusively used by the
      Mitochondria in the Oxidative Phosphorilation process, a set of
      biochemical reactions not yet well understood. In fact, one of
      these main reactions, known as Mitchell’s Chemo-osmotic Theory,
      remains a theory decades away from being postulated. Rather, the
      cell uses hydrogen in many metabolic pathways. To cite an example,
      hydrogen is, without doubt, the best antioxidant.<br>
      <br>
      The heterogeneity of pathways that could initiate and drive
      Alzheimer’s disease has shown that there is no single linear chain
      of events, therefore it is a generalized failure, so we must think
      of a failure in energy first, an impaired water splitting process,
      and not suspect ATP, blood or glucose metabolic pathway. To
      complicate matters, some changes are not pathologic but
      reactionary or protective.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.3. The Brain</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Anatomically, the brain is a good example to sustain our finding
      that the main source of energy is water, not ATP, blood or
      glucose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.4. Aging-Related Process and Human Photosynthesis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It remains possible that many of these mechanisms, including the
      amyloid hypothesis, are minor or wrong, and that some critical
      aging-related process is the disease trigger (Ref. [1]). Human
      Photosynthesis could explain this aging-related process, because
      the capability of the human body begins to decline in the
      mid-twenties. We lose our capacity to perform the photosynthesis
      function at its peak during adulthood (which is less than that of
      embryonic period) at an approximate rate of 10% with each decade
      of life after the mid-twenties, and when we reach our fifties it
      goes into free fall.<br>
      <br>
      The potential risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease,
      general anesthesia, promotes tau insolubility and Aß
      oligomerization [9,10], and that is congruent with our findings
      because the water dissociation capacity in the human body is very
      sensitive to agents with an elevated<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1. Convolutions of the cerebral cortex have been
      traditionally explained as a solution to adapt the greatest amount
      of neuronal tissue in a limited bone-confined intracranial-space.
      However, from the point of view of our new knowledge, the real
      goal is to keep every inch, every corner of neuronal tissue in
      contact with the water of the ventricles and subarachnoid space.
      The main source of energy is the water of the CSF in the
      ventricles and subarachnoid space, not the blood vessels [8].<br>
      <br>
      apparent distribution volume, such as anesthesia agents and
      antidepressants.<br>
      <br>
      The axonal-transport deficits are an internal derangement that is
      probably an effect rather than a cause of Alzheimer’s Disease;
      therefore it is not hard to believe that it could be normalized
      with an adequate level of human photosynthesis, or water splitting
      process, because the first requirement of any process in our body
      is energy, undoubtedly.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that Glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes are
      considered to be risk factors for dementia [11] is consistent with
      our new knowledge that glucose is only the main source of biomass,
      but the usual order of events are alterations in energy first, and
      then biomass disorders in second place.<br>
      <br>
      Iron poisons melanin itself, so elevated levels of this divalent
      transition metal are linked with neuro-degeneration in several
      ways [12].<br>
      <br>
      The higher serum glucose levels that are common in normal aging
      directly damage hippocampal structures [13], probably because
      greater amount of water than normal is required by the eukaryotic
      cell to move the glucose molecule, lessening the availability of
      water to produce energy by means of dissociation of the water
      molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Something similar happens in the imbalanced expression of
      low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins and receptors
      for advanced glycation end products, proposed by the neurovascular
      uncoupling hypothesis [14].<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Oxidative Stress</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dysfunctional mitochondria release oxidizing free radicals, and in
      the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients and in the normal aging
      brain, they cause considerable oxidative stress [15]. However,
      mitochondria cannot be dysfunctional if energy levels are
      adequate, because after billions of years of evolution these
      organelles know very well what they have to do. Experimental
      models show that markers of oxidative damage precede pathological
      changes [16]. Aß, a potent generator of reactive oxygen species
      [17] and reactive nitrogen species [18], is a prime initiator of
      this damage, but the best antioxidant, without question, is the
      diatomic hydrogen, the main product of the water dissociation
      process performed by the Human Photosystem, composed by
      Light/Melanin/Water, arranged in order of abundance in Nature.<br>
      <br>
      We can demonstrate that energy from water is a very important
      source of hydrogen. The amount of food that we ingest every day
      (about 700 g) cannot satisfy our daily requirements of ATP (11000
      calories a minute). And devices such as this photo-electrochemical
      self-renewable cell, which can light up LEDs during years, day and
      night, have demonstrated the flux of electrons. (Figure 2)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapeutic Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In our clinic we have treated with extraordinary results several
      patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (Figure 3 and 4), as well as
      patients with many other diseases by enhancing the Human
      Photosynthesis process. Because Human Photosynthesis is the
      chemical reaction that fully explains the origin of life, all
      biochemical processes, tissues, organs and systems that comprise
      the human body have been created after it and are owing to the
      energy transduced by the Human Photosystem. The basis of the
      treatment is the enhancement of the water splitting process with
      pharmacological agents developed by our team. As we increase the
      available energy in the cells, and because it is released
      symmetrically in all directions, all intracellular organelles,
      even the nucleus, as well as biochemical compounds present in the
      cytoplasm and nucleosol, that require energy to be transformed,
      activated, or modified benefit in many ways in order to perform
      their function adequately.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The discovery that glucose is a source of biomass, and not a
      source of energy, is groundbreaking knowledge. Therefore
      Alzheimer’s Disease is an energy problem, not a biomass problem.
      Any biochemical reaction requires energy as a first step.
      Thereafter all changes in atoms, molecules, cells or tissues also
      need energy to continue with all the different subset of
      reactions, therefore, en<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2. The image shows an LED arrangement energized with a
      device that we have developed to demonstrate the biological event
      in the test tube [19].<br>
      <br>

      examination, notice the aggressive look on her face.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4. Same patient five weeks after starting treatment using
      Human Photosynthesis enhancer.<br>
      <br>
      Energy is constantly needed. In other words, energy is required at
      the begining, during and after the reaction, i.e. at all times.<br>
      <br>
      In AD the chronic low levels of water dissociation mean a chronic
      shortage of energy that will be manifested several ways along the
      path of evolution of the disease. Histological findings are in
      accordance with a generalized more than a punctual failure, and in
      any system with this type of alteration we must think of energy
      first.<br>
