      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>Rodent repellent liquids are disclosed
        which are comprised of thujone oil in pure form or in the form
        of cedar leaf oil in a suitable low odor liquid carrier such as
        mineral oil. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a liquid having rodent
        repellent characteristics. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b> </p>
      <p>For many years numerous attempts have been made to keep rats
        and mice away from homes, storage bins and other areas. Most
        commonly, traps or poisons are used to kill the vermin. In
        addition to creating dead animal disposal problems, traps and
        poisons also pose dangers to children, pets and animals.
        Furthermore, traps and poisons must be monitored. Sprung traps
        must be reset and consumed poison must be replaced. Also, many
        people have found that for each rat they kill with traps or
        poison there are others in the area who survive. </p>
      <p>Rather than try to kill the rodents which are present, a better
        approach is to deter them from entering the area. Certain plant
        extracts have been found to have repellent properties Bottrell
        in U.S. Pat. No. 1,871,949 uses oil of peppermint to repell
        rodents. Cross in U.S. Pat. No. 2,159,550 teaches that extracts
        from the wood and fruit of the Areca catechu plant have
        repellent properties. Yet, neither of these materials have had
        any commercial success. </p>
      <p>The art has also recognized that certain plants repel rodents.
        For example, pieces of the wormwood plant (Artemsia Absinthium)
        have been used as moth and rodent repellents. But, these pieces
        are only effective for a relatively short period of time,
        typically a few days. </p>
      <p>The art has generally attributed the repellent characteristics
        of the wormwood and other plants to the presence of alkyloids in
        the plant. Apparently, these alkyloids are poisonous. However, I
        have discovered that thujone oil, a natural oil of the wormwood
        plant and a component of cedar leaf oil from the cedar tree, not
        alkyloids, will repel rodents when used in the manner here
        described. </p>
      <p>In my U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,668,294 and 4,654,080 I disclose liquid
        rodent repellents in which thujone oil is combined with sodium
        silicate, lacquer or kerosene. Although these products work well
        they are not suitable for warm environments. The flash points of
        lacquer and kerosene are so low that there is a risk of
        ignition. Thus, there is a need for a liquid rodent repellent
        which is non-flammable. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>I provide a rodent repellent in liquid form by combining pure
        thujone oil or cedar leaf oil which contains thujone oil with a
        low odor liquid carrier. Several liquids such as mineral oil,
        alcohol, kerosene or lacquer are suitable. </p>
      <p>I prefer to use a liquid comprised of thujone oil in the form
        of cedar leaf oil and a low odor liquid carrier, such as mineral
        oil, in a mixture having from 0.5 to 10 ounces carrier per 1
        ounce cedar leaf oil. If pure thujone oil is used the mixture
        should contain a higher percentage of carrier. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>I have found that certain compositions of thujone oil or cedar
        leaf oil and a low odor liquid carrier will repel rodents for a
        significant period of time. A combination of thujone oil or
        cedar leaf oil and liquid when used like a paint will keep
        rodents away from the painted area for between three and five
        years. </p>
      <p>To make these products, I first extract the oil from the plant
        source. Thujone oil is extracted from the wormwood plant and
        cedar leaf oil is obtained from the cedar tree. Thujone oil is
        also commercially available as it is used in perfume. Both oils
        have a similar aroma and can be used interchangeably. Then the
        oil is combined with a suitable, low odor carrier such as
        mineral oil, alcohol, white kerosene or any of the low odor
        solvents sold by Exxon under the trade name ISOPAR. </p>
      <p>I have found that mineral oil is a suitable carrier for thujone
        oil and cedar leaf oil. Cedar leaf oil and mineral oil are
        combined to provide from 0.5 to 10 ounces mineral oil per ounce
        of cedar leaf oil. Then, the combination is applied to a surface
        like any standard paint. </p>
      <p>Other low odor carriers in addition to mineral oil could also
        be used as a carrier. These solvents must be non-reactive with
        thujone oil and evaporate at room temperature or lower. They
        also must not leave an odorous residue which would overpower the
        odor of thujone oil. </p>
      <p>I have conducted several experiments to show the effectiveness
        of my rat and mice repellents. The first experiment consisted of
        three boxes with the entrances to each blocked with sheets of
        screen. The rats were placed in the middle box. The box on the
        left contained food and the walls of the box were stained with
        the rat and mice repellent. This repellent was a mixture of 12%
        thujone oil and 88% lacquer. The box on the right contained only
        food and the walls were not stained. At the end of five days,
        the metal screens were lifted. The rats would not enter the box
        with the rat and mice repellent, but ate from the box that
        contained no repellent. </p>
      <p>I have also applied my liquid repellent to underfloor areas of
        homes that I identified as rodent nests or pathways. A few days
        later I returned and saw no signs of rats or mice. The owners of
        the homes I treated also reported no signs of rodents after
        treatment. </p>
      <p>In a second experiment, I used two boxes separated by a metal
        screen. A neutral box without repellent on the walls housed the
        rats. The remaining box contained the rat and mice repellent and
        contained the food. After five days the metal screen which
        separated the boxes was lifted. The rats would not enter the box
        stained with the rat and mice repellent to get the food. The
        repellent used in this experiment was a mixture of 12% thujone
        oil and 88% lacquer. </p>
      <p>While I have described certain present preferred embodiments of
        my invention, it should be distinctly understood that the
        invention is not limited thereto but may be variously embodied
        within the scope of the following claims. </p>
