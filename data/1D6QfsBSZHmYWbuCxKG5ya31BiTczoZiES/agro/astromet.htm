      <p>"All things have their season, and a time to every purpose
        under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to
        plant, and a time to reap". (Ecclesiastes 3:1-2) </p>
      <p>Many biodynamic cultivators plant and harvest with respect to
        lunar phases and planetary aspects, and they swear by the
        results. Almanacs and calendars offer traditional lore for the
        consideration of farmers. Some of these practices are ancient
        and universal, occurring with variations in many cultures around
        the world. </p>
      <p>Many of these beliefs are grounded in fact. The sun, moon, and
        planets are surrounded by magnetospheres which trail behind them
        for millions of miles like wakes behind ships. These fields
        affect life on earth by modifying atmospheric electrical field
        conditions and the geomagnetic field. </p>
      <p>In 1938, Dr Harry Marvis announced the discovery that stars
        exercise a daily influence on terrestrial weather. Sidereal air
        pressure, or barometric variations in relation to the positions
        of stars, is sometimes as high as 3% of that occurring in common
        storms. </p>
      <p>The zodiacal signs exert a fruitful or barren influence upon
        Earth through the channel of Luna, according to the nature of
        the sign through which the moon is passing. The time to plant is
        when the Sun and Earth’s horizon (the Ascendant or Rising Sign)
        are in favorable signs (Figure 1). The optimal day for planting
        is when the Moon also enters that sign. </p>
      <p>Leafy vegetable crops that grow above ground should be planted
        during a new or waxing moon in Pisces, Taurus, Cancer or
        Scorpio. Trees and crops requiring longer than one year to
        produce should be planted during a full or waning moon in
        Taurus. Subsoil crops (potatoes, peanuts, carrots, etc.) should
        be planted under a waning moon. </p>

        <p><img src="lunphas.gif" width="445" height="351"></p>
      </center>
      <p>As indicated in Figure 2, seeds that have a short (up to 7
        days) or extra-long (one month) germination period should be
        sown two days before the new moon, up to 7 days later. </p>
      <p>During the first week of its cycle, the moon’s light increases,
        and its gravitational pull decreases. The relative influence of
        terrestrial gravity increases at that time, stimulating balanced
        growth of leaves and roots. In the second week, lunar gravity
        increases, and its light increases to a maximum. Leaf growth
        increases during that period. During the third week, both
        moonlight and lunar gravity decrease, and root growth is
        enhanced accordingly. Transplant at that time. In the fourth
        week, lunar gravity increases, and moonlight decreases. Both
        leaf and root growth decrease during this rest phase. </p>
      <p>Traditional sources suggest that flower seeds should be plants
        during the crescent moon unless seeds are desired; in that case,
        sow just before the Full Moon. Seeds planted when Luna is in
        Capricorn produce rapid growth, but poor yields. Seeds planted
        under an Aquarian moon will rot or produce watery fruit. </p>
      <p>Cancer and Scorpio are fruitful signs which prompt germination
        and assure abundant yields. Leaf growth is greater when water
        signs are effective. Root growth is best in Earth signs. The
        Fire signs stimulate the rapid growth of seeds and fruit. Air
        signs promote the growth of lowers. </p>
      <p>Prepare the soil, pull weeds, and fight pests during the new
        moon phase in a barren sign (Aries, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius,
        or Aquarius). Lay mulch under the Full Moon, and turn manure and
        compost piles during the waning moon. Apply it at the new or
        half moon. Irrigate and feed plants when the moon is in a Water
        sign. </p>
      <p>Harvest under a full or waning moon in a barren sign. If timber
        is cut under the full moon in Leo, it will last longer than wood
        cut at any other time, and it will not become worm-eaten. Trees
        planted under a waxing moon will produce more fruit, while trees
        planted during the dark phase of the moon will produce better
        quality fruit. </p>
      <p><b>Astro-Meteorology ~</b> </p>
      <p>Weather prediction by astro-meteorology is a highly refined
        area of sidereal science which has claimed an amazing 90%-plus
        record of accuracy for both short- and long-term forecasts of
        weather patterns. This system is an accumulation of
        tried-and-true observational data going back several millennia.
      </p>
      <p>The subject was widely popularized by Joseph Goodavage in his
        book, Our Threatened Planet (1978, Simon &amp; Schuster), in
        which he represented the work of pioneers such as Dr Irving
        Krick, Dr Andrew Douglass, George McCormack and others.
        According to Goodavage, the sun has entered a period of
        prolonged and violent instability with which we must cope.
        Modern astronomy has confirmed Goodavage’s prediction. </p>
      <p>Classical horoscopic weather prediction is based on forecasts
        of the influences of the planets in solstice or equinox
        horoscopes. Each zodiacal sign colors the characteristics of the
        planets occupying that region. For instance, a "wet" planet such
        as Luna indicates extra-wet weather when it is located in a
        water sign; much drier conditions are indicated when Luna is in
        a fire sign. </p>
      <p>Half of the total influence of a weather horoscope should be
        judged from the 4th house cusp and planets therein, and their
        aspects. The 4th house governs the locale. </p>
      <p>One quarter of the total influence of ingress weather charts
        should be judged from the first house, from its occupying
        planets and their aspects, from the sign on its cusp, and from
        the planet ruling the cusp sign, the sign it is in, and its
        aspects. </p>
      <p>One-eighth of the influence of a weather chart is judged from
        the planet for which the chart is erected. Sol = temperature,
        Luna = moisture, Mercury = air. For example, if Sol is in Aries,
        then Mars, the ruling planet of Aries, and its aspects also must
        be considered. </p>
      <p>One-eighth of the influence on weather is to be judged by the
        planets in angular houses, their aspects, and the signs they
        occupy. </p>
      <p>The temperature chart gives an average indication of the
        weather, but indications of storms should be compared with both
        air and moisture charts for that time. </p>
      <p>The primary mutual aspects are the conjunction, opposition,
        square and trine, but even the minor aspects are effective.
        Trines and sextiles are not necessarily beneficial, but they
        tend to exert a more gentle influence than the inharmonious
        aspects (square and opposition). Interpretation depends on the
        planetary positions in the signs and houses, and the aspects and
        parallels of declination to other planets, and the ascendant of
        the chart and the aspects to it by transiting planets. Table 1
        lists indicators of weather attributes of the planets and signs.
      </p>
      <p>Table 2 is Dr Adam Clark’s system for predicting the weather
        throughout the lunations forever. It foretells the weather that
        is most likely to occur during each phase of the moon. </p>
      <p>The nearer to midnight that the moon changes its phase in the
        full and last quarter, the better the weather will be for the
        seven days following. The time span for this calculation of from
        10 pm to 2 am. </p>
      <p>The nearer to noon (from 10 am to 2 pm) that the moon changes
        phase, the more wet weather may be expected for the next week.
        These observations are for the summer season, though they also
        are adaptable to spring and fall observations. Changing phases
        of the moon occurring from 4 pm to 10 pm may be followed by fair
        weather, depending on the wind, as indicated in Table 2. </p>
