      <p>Besides the <b><a href="biodynam.htm">Biodynamic Formulas</a></b>,
        there exist several other methods of stimulating seed
        germination and plant growth with non-toxic substances. Several
        other methods are in general use by farmers: </p>
      <p><b>(1) Nutrient Presoaking ~</b> Presoak seeds in a solution of
        nutrients that will add to the vigor of the seeds. Pure water
        tends to dissolve out substances contained in the seeds’ shells
        that are needed for the germination and growth. One easy method
        of stimulating the germination of seeds is to soak them in an
        aqueous extract of the full-grown plant from the preceding crop.
        Low-voltage direct electrical current can facilitate the
        electrophoresis of nutrients into the seeds, as described in the
        review of <a href="../articles/elcultur.htm">ElectroCulture</a>.
      </p>
      <p><b>(2) Acid Scarification ~</b> This technique is recommended
        for thick-shell seeds. Place dry seeds in a glass container and
        cover them with concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr 1.84) for 5
        minutes. Pour off the acid and wash the seeds very thoroughly
        with fresh water to remove any residual acid. Never add water to
        the acid; it will spatter violently. Always add acid to the
        water. The seeds should be planted immediately while wet. </p>
      <p><b>(3) Moist-Chilling ~</b> Also known as Vermiculization or
        Stratification, this technique of preconditioning seeds
        accelerates the after-ripening of seeds by exposing them to low
        temperature (0-10 degrees), moisture, and air for a period of
        time. Moist chilling is most effective when applied after hot
        water presoaking. Seeds are mixed with two volumes of sand and
        are kept in plastic bags in a refrigerator or outdoors. At the
        end of the after-ripening period some of the seeds may begin to
        germinate while in storage. The seeds can be separated from
        their medium by shaking the mixture on a screen. The seeds
        should be planted immediately before they dry out. </p>
      <p><b>(4) Thiourea ~</b> Aqueous solutions (0.5-3%) stimulate
        germination, but inhibit later growth. Therefore seeds should be
        soaked no longer than 12 hours, and must be thoroughly rinsed
        with fresh water. </p>
      <p><b>(5) Potassium Nitrate ~</b> Seeds will germinate faster when
        placed in sand moistened with 0.2% aqueous potassium nitrate.
        Rewater with pure water rather than additional nitrate solution.
      </p>
      <p><b>(6) Hydrogen Peroxide ~</b> 30% hydrogen peroxide also is
        effective as a stimulant of germination. Very dilute hydrogen
        peroxide also accelerates later growth if used only
        occasionally. </p>
      <p><b>(7) Gibberillin ~</b> When seeds absorb water, the hormone
        gibberillin appears in the embryo and is translocated to the
        aleurone layer, where it activates the metabolism to initiate
        sprouting. Gibberillin causes the rapid growth of beans and
        bamboo, which contain large amounts of the hormone. </p>
      <p>Gibberillin is not, however, appropriate for application to all
        plants. In most cases, gibberillin increases the thickness and
        internodal length of the stalk. Sometimes the terminal nodes are
        weak branching is suppressed, and the roots develop poorly. The
        number of flowers increase, and they are larger. Germination and
        flowering are stimulated, but leaf growth and chlorophyll
        production are reduced proportionately. </p>
      <p>Gibberillin is extracted from cucumber seeds, fresh cantelope
        seeds, dried corn kernels, and from pencil rod, lupine, and
        pinto beans. Soak 200 gr of powdered seeds for one week in 110
        ml of a mixture of acetone (10 parts), isopropyl alcohol (5
        parts) ethanol (2 parts) and water (5 parts). Filter the mush
        and rinse it with 20 ml acetone and 20 ml isopropyl alcohol.
        Combine the rinse and mother liquor, evaporate the solvent, and
        dissolve the residual gum in alkaline water for experimental
        use. </p>
      <p><b>(8) Auxin ~</b> Auxin is the general name of a group of
        plant hormones that includes indole-acetic-, -propionic-, and
        -butyric-acids. Auxins are active in many platn functions, such
        as stem growth, root development, and flowering. </p>
      <p>The sexual expression of plants is strongly influenced by the
        amount of auxin present during the flowering phase. Other
        factors being equal, females develop with higher levels of
        auxin. </p>
      <p>Combine auxin (1:5000 water) with vitamin B-1 (1 ppm) to
        increase the effect of both nutrients, which are available in
        commercial preparations. </p>
      <p><b>(9) Triacontanol ~</b> This fatty acid is found in many
        plants. It increases growth rates and yields up to 25%, and
        increases the protein content, even in darkness, when most
        plants are dormant. It seems to enhance the growth of plants
        without increasing their consumption of nitrogen. </p>
      <p>Triacontanol is non-toxic, and incredibly potent. The applied
        dosage is one part in 10 million of water, applied as a foliar
        spray. The simplest way to use triacontanol is to plow under a
        crop of alfalfa, which contains relatively large amounts of the
        substance. Other common sources include cotton, apples, and
        sunflower seeds (which contain up to 8% in the fatty acid
        fraction). </p>
      <p>Triacontanol is extracted from dried plants by chloroform,
        which is then filtered and evaporated. Extract the residue with
        acetone, filter and evaporate the acetone, and extract the
        residue with petroleum ether to yield crude triacontanol. It can
        be purified by reverse chromatography. </p>
      <p>Other stimulants of plant growth include: ascorbic acid
        (vitamin C); use one to five parts in 10,000 of water. Dilute
        camphor also stimulates plant growth.</p>
