      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Biodynamic</b> cultivators
        stimulate plant growth and enlive compost and manure heaps with
        "activated ferments" of select plants: Oak bark, Dandelion,
        Yarrow, Stinging Nettle, and Valerian.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The preparation of these
          activated ferments may seem bizarre, yet they are very potent
          and virtually magical in effect when concocted correctly and
          applied in homeopathic dilution as described elsewhere in this
          article.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activated Oak Bark ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obtain the skull of any
          domestic animal. The skull must be new and undamaged. Remove
          the brain through the occipital foramen of the cranium with a
          small stick, then immediately fill the skull with pulverized
          oak bark. Close the opening with a piece of bone, and bury the
          skull in a wet place during winter. The skull can be buried in
          a leaky barrel filled with compost. The activated oak bark
          will be ready by spring. It is to be diluted by homeopathic
          potentization and applied as a spray to the soil, copost pile
          or manure heap. The activated oak bark influences the calcium
          process in plants.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activated Dandelion ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dandelion ferment affects
          the relationships of silicic acid and potassium in the plant
          organism. Collect young dandelion flowers, dry them, and fill
          the mesentery of an ox with them. Keep this in a cool, dry
          place covered with peat moss until October, then bury it in
          the soil during winter. By Easter it will be ready for use in
          the compost heap. The dandelion ferment is applied at a rate
          of one or two grams in 10-20- ml water per 2 cubic meters of
          compost.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chamomile Preparation ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Collect the flowers in May
          or June, dry them carefully, and store them in glass jars
          until autumn. Then obtain a large, fresh piece of cow
          intestine, cut it into 12-inch sections, and stuff them with
          the flowers to form sausages. Bury them in good soil during
          the winter, and dig them up in the spring. Use one or two
          grams of ferment per three cubic meters of compost.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activated Yarrow ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obtain the fresh bladder
          from a stag and fill it with yarrow, then dew the hole. Hand
          the bladder in the sunlight during the summer. It must be
          protected from birds by a cloth-covered wooden frame. During
          the autumn and winter it must be buried in the earth until
          spring. Keep the finished preparation in the bladder, and use
          one or two grams to enliven manure or compost heaps by sulfur
          processes.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stinging Nettle Preparation ~</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Collect as many young
          nettles as you can, let them fade a little, then bury them in
          the ground. Isolate the plants from the soil with a layer of
          peat moss above and below. They must remain buried for one
          winter and summer. They are to be added in small amounts to
          the compost pile, Activated nettles affect silica processes in
          their sphere of influence.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activate Valerian ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This plant is prepared in a
          simple manner: collect its flowers, moisten them with lukewarm
          rain water, and keep them in a loosely stoppered jar for
          several days. Then squeeze the juice from the flowers, and
          preserve this tincture. Prepare a 7x or 8x potency solution of
          this tincture and apply it as a spray.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Silica Preparation ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fill a cow’s horn with a
          paste of fine mesh silica gel. Bury the horn about 3 feet deep
          in good soil, leave it for the summer, and dig it up in the
          autumn. Keep it intact until it is needed. Use one gram of
          this silica preparation dissolved in one liter of lukewarm
          rain water. The silica must be very well stirred for at least
          two hours. Then dilute the solution with an additional 9
          liters of rainwater. Spray the plants at the rate of 10 liters
          per acre. Silica applied in this manner protects plants from
          insects, and gives seeds greater resistance to harsh weather.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Homeopathic Potentization
            ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Biodynamic farmers apply the
          activated ferments in extremely dilute solutions, called
          "homeopathic potencies", to stimulate plant growth and the
          fermentation of compost.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Homeopathic preparations
          work by virtue of the specific "vital essence" of a substance,
          liberated from the material form by the process of
          "potentization" (dilution and vibration). The quintessence
          permeates the compost, soil and plants like astral perfume,
          and affects plant growth with subtle yet powerful forces of
          the cosmos.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Homeopathic formulas are
          prepared by grinding the substance into fine powder; one part
          of this powder is mixed by grinding with nine parts of lactose
          (milk sugar), thus forming a "1x potency". The grinding
          process is called "trituration". By another method of
          preparation, the substance is diluted with nine parts of water
          or alcohol. The solution must be stirred vigorously, and/or
          stimulated with select frequencies by a signal generator. This
          treatment with vibrations is called "succussion".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Homeopathic remedies are
          prepared in successive dilutions on a decimal scale. A 1:9
          dilution is a 1x potency; 1:100 is 2x; 1:1000 is 3x, and so
          on. Each time the next higher potency is prepared, one part of
          the preceding potency is diluted with 9 parts of water or
          lactose. Some triturated powders can be prepared in a lapidary
          tumbler, using steel balls to do the grinding. A blender also
          can be used to prepare both triturations and successions.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From a chemical standpoint,
          the quantity of the triturated substance in a homeopathic dose
          of 6x or higher is negligible, being scarcely a trace, yet the
          effects are clearly pronounced. Homeopathic theory posits that
          the mechanical energy applied by trituration and succussion
          distends the molecules of the original substance, thus
          altering the fundamental nature and releasing its essential
          energy.<br>
