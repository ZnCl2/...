      <h1><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">"French
            Physicist Creates New Melodies - Plant Songs"</font></font></h1>
    </center>
    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Remember those song birds we
        used to hear in the fields? The sounds of animals in nature
        singing a symphony of soft and subtle sounds as all things flow
        together to create a living and vibrant concerto? Science is now
        showing that these sounds actually do influence the growth of
        plants. Researchers have demonstrated that plants respond to
        sounds in pro-found ways which not only influence their overall
        health but also increase the speed of growth and the size of the
        plant.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many people remember hearing
          in the late 1960's and 1970's about the idea that plants
          respond to music. There were lots of projects in high schools
          and colleges which successfully tested the effects of sound on
          plant growth. It was determined through repetitive testing
          that plants did respond to music and sound. The first book
          which brought this idea to most of us was: The Secret Life of
          Plants, by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird (Harper &amp;
          Row 1973). In this best selling book a number of astounding
          revelations about plant growth were revealed. The idea that
          plants were influenced by sound in both positive and negative
          ways was demonstrated by several world class scientists at
          that time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we think of plants
          being affected by sunlight we are really looking at the effect
          of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum on plants ­ that
          portion which includes visible light. It should not surprise
          us that sound also impacts plant growth because it is, in
          essence, an extension to other parts of the electromagnetic
          spectrum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The science was first
          disclosed in an article by Andy Coghlan which appeared in <b>New




            Scientist (May 28, 1994, p.10)</b>. The article confirmed
          old ideas by placing them in a scientific context. It tells an
          excellent story about the impact of sound on plant growth,
          bringing to light what was before considered esoteric or
          mysterious science. After reading this short article and those
          which follow in this issue of the Flashpoints a good deal more
          will be thought of "singing gardeners" and "plant
          communicators."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many people remember reading
          accounts of plant growth being stimulated by sound waves. At
          that time, "talking" to plants and playing plants different
          types of music was used to influence growth. A number of
          people were using these techniques without being able to
          completely explain the phenomena. This article is part of that
          story ­ a story which could have a profound impact on the way
          we grow and produce our food.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eccentrics who sing to their
          plants? People playing melodies to organic matter with the
          expectation that it will help stimulate growth? These ideas
          were the thoughts of some "non-scientists" until French
          physicist and musician, Joel Sternheimer, discovered the
          mechanism for how plants respond to the stimulation of sound
          waves. Sternheimer composes musical note sequences which help
          plants grow and has applied for an international patent1
          covering the concept.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sound sequences are not
          random but are carefully constructed melodies. Each note is
          chosen to correspond to an amino acid in a protein with the
          full tune corresponding to the entire protein. What this means
          is that the sounds sequenced in just the right order results
          in a tune which is unique and harmonizes with the internal
          structure of a specific plant type. Each plant type has a
          different sequence of notes to stimulate its growth. According
          to New Scientist, "Sternheimer claims that when plants "hear"
          the appropriate tune, they produce more of that protein. He
          also writes tunes that inhibit the synthesis of proteins." In
          other words, desirable plants could be stimulated to grow
          while undesirable plants (weeds for instance) could be
          inhibited. This is done with electromagnetic energy, in this
          case sound waves, pulsed to the right set of frequencies thus
          effecting the plant at an energetic and submolecular level.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sternheimer translates into
          audible vibrations of music the quantum vibrations that occur
          at the molecular level as a protein is being assembled from
          its constituent amino acids. By using simple physics he is
          able to compose music which achieves this correlation.
          Sternheimer indicated to New Scientist that each musical note
          which he composes for the plant is a multiple of original
          frequencies that occur when amino acids join the protein
          chain. He says that playing the right notes stimulates the
          plant and increases growth. This idea is particularly
          interesting because it may lead to the eventual obsolescence
          of fertilizers used to stimulate plant growth. This new method
          would be cheap and relatively easily provided throughout the
          world, thereby avoiding many of the problems associated with
          the extraction, shipping, environmental and economic costs of
          chemical fertilizers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Playing the right tune
          stimulates the formation of a plant's protein. "The length of
          a note corresponds to the real time it takes for each amino
          acid to come after the next," according to Sternheimer, who
          studied quantum physics and mathematics at Princeton
          University in New Jersey.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In experiments by
          Sternheimer, he claims that tomatoes exposed to his melodies
          grew two-and-a-half times as large as those which were
          untreated. Some of the treated plants were sweeter in addition
          to being significantly larger. The musical sequences
          stimulated three tomato growth promoters, cytochrome C, and
          thaumatin (a flavoring compound). According to Sternheimer in
          the New Scientist, "Six molecules were being played to the
          tomatoes for a total of three minutes a day."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sternheimer also claims to
          have stopped the mosaic virus by playing note sequences that
          inhibited enzymes required by the virus. This virus would have
          harmed the tomato plants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The note sequences used by
          the inventor are very short and need only be played one time.
          For example, the sequence for for cytochrome C lasts just 29
          seconds. According to Sternheimer, "on average, you get four
          amino acids played per second" in this series.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventor also issued a
          warning for those repeating his experiments. He warns to be
          careful with the sound sequences because they can affect
          people. "Don't ask a musician to play them," he says.
          Sternheimer indicated that one of his musicians had difficulty
          breathing after playing the tune for cytochrome C.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Plant stimulation by sound
          may have profound implications. The idea that a cheap source
          of "electromagnetic fertilizer" has been developed should be
          exciting for many third world countries. At a time when human
          progress can be made through simple solutions in agriculture,
          resources are being wasted in the extraction of mineral and
          oil compounds for fertilizers. If this method of fertilization
          were followed the human intellect would prove superior to
          physical capital in terms of distribution and production of
          this new technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The idea that sound can have
          a healing effect on humans is being explored by a number of
          independent scientists around the world. The know-ledge of the
          "sound effect on proteins" offers insights to health
          practitioners of the benefits to humans. In addition to the
          favorable economic factors, the increased vitality of the
          plant substances can positively impact the health of all
          humans that consume them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The patent includes melodies
          for cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome C which are two proteins
          involved in respiration. It also includes sound sequences for
          troponin C which regulates calcium uptake in muscles. Further,
          a tune was developed for inhibiting chalcone synthase which is
          an enzyme involved in making plant pigments.</font> </p>
