        <p style="text-align: left;">To prevent influx of pests that
          could create agricultural problems, produce-importing nations
          enforce strict rules --depending on the commodity and the
          infesting insect. The rules often require vulnerable produce
          to be treated in some way that ensures destruction of pests. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For several decades, methyl bromide
          has been a mainstay treatment to kill a wide array of
          quarantined pests as well as those encountered in orchards,
          packinghouses, and food plants. But this potent chemical
          fumigant is being phased out because of evidence linking it to
          damage to Earth's ozone layer. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although the effectiveness of using
          radio waves to kill destructive insects in agricultural
          products has been known for 70 years, the technique has never
          been applied on a commercial scale. A recent cooperative
          effort by four ARS research laboratories and two universities
          aims to overcome the technical barriers for the use of radio
          wave heating to control pests on a commercial scale. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Electromagnetic waves of radio
          frequency can make molecules vibrate and heat up --like
          microwaves heat food. The trick is to kill pest insects
          without killing the taste or texture of the food they infest.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Since 2000, a team led by Juming
          "Jimmy" Tang of Washington State University (WSU) in Pullman,
          involving four ARS laboratories and the University of
          California-Davis (UC-Davis), has been working on a 4-year
          study to see whether radio waves would be an economical,
          environmentally friendly alternative to methyl bromide and
          other chemicals to effectively rid fruits and nuts of live,
          quarantined insects. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>In Texas -- It's Chiefly Citrus</b>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Weslaco, Texas, ARS entomologist
          Guy J. Hallman is checking out use of radio frequency
          treatment of citrus against the Mexican fruit fly. He's in the
          Crop Quality and Fruit Insect Research Unit at the Kika de la
          Garza Subtropical Agricultural Research Center. Hallman is
          developing a device to simulate what's needed to heat-treat
          citrus fruit with radio waves commercially. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"We're trying to bridge the gap
          between the laboratory and real world," says Hallman. "Once we
          know how to treat fruit in a commercial situation and how much
          it will cost, any producer, shipper, or packinghouse operator
          can use the information to decide whether radio wave pest
          control is a viable option." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In Hallman's system, citrus fruit
          would pass through a conveyor between a series of radio
          frequency heaters. To simulate a commercial system in the
          laboratory, the fruit are conveyed in a circulating water bath
          to keep them moving during heating. This would prevent the
          fruit's overheating from extended contact with any one area of
          the bath. And to ensure continuous heating from the peel in to
          the fruit's center --essential to killing all fruit flies that
          might be present-- a bumper would dunk any fruit that bobbed
          above the water surface. This prevents dark-black rings from
          forming around the fruit at the water's surface because of an
          energy concentration where the water meets the air. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A method using just hot air to
          treat fruit in boxes or bins has been tried commercially in
          Mexico with mixed results. It takes hours to complete and puts
          a strain on the fruit's skin, sometimes causing heat damage.
          Radio frequency heating can be done in less than half an hour
          and is less damaging, since the fruit is heated uniformly
          throughout. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Hallman has focused on grapefruits
          but is also working with other citrus, including oranges and
          tangerines. The larger the fruit, he notes, the harder it is
          to heat uniformly and the more likely to form hot and cold
          spots. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"This multi-lab project is making a
          serious effort to take a look at things that haven't been
          looked at with radio frequency heating," says Hallman. "I
          think we stand a good chance of finding out how radio
          frequency disinfestation can be done to a large volume of
          fruits or nuts -- and if it can be done on a commercial
          scale." He predicts that by this summer he'll have a good idea
          of what the treatment will cost. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>In Washington -- Apples and
            Cherries</b> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">If you're in Wapato, Washington,
          don't be enticed by the apples floating in the tub in James
          Hansen's laboratory. You don't want to go bobbing for them. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">There are several reasons, says
          Hansen, an entomologist with ARS' Yakima Agricultural Research
          Laboratory. The first is that this particular tub is filled
          with salt water. Second, if you were to latch onto one of the
          apples with your teeth, you might bite the proverbial worm-- a
          larva hatched from a codling moth egg. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">And Hansen wants these apples
          intact -- no tooth marks, please. Such a mark might skew the
          results of tests he is conducting on use of radio waves to rid
          the fruit of live, pesky insects like the codling moth before
          market -- or shipment to trading partners like South Korea and
          Japan, where such pests might not already occur. Japan is
          particularly stringent about what phytosanitary methods it
          will accept for disinfesting fresh produce. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This rule also applies to sweet
          cherries, a tree fruit commodity that generates over $145
          million in yearly national export sales, notes Hansen. In
          cooperation with the team led by Tang, a professor in
          biological systems engineering at WSU, Hansen plans to "bathe"
          tubs full of apples and cherries with radio waves to determine
          exposure times that will kill codling moth larvae without
          affecting fruit quality. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">From two lines of research, one
          focusing on the insects, the other on fruit quality, and three
          major disciplines -- engineering, entomology, and plant
          physiology -- the collaborators hope to position radio wave
          treatment as a technology that can be readily adopted by
          commercial packinghouses or quarantine operations in lieu of
          methyl bromide. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Without suitable alternatives to
          methyl bromide, we're going to be up a creek," ARS
          horticulturist Stephen R. Drake says of the U.S. fruit
          industry's fight against quarantined pests. He is with ARS'
          Tree Fruit Research Laboratory in Wenatchee, Washington. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"Ideally, you want to treat the
          fruit with radio frequency while it's being packed and
          designated for a particular market," Hansen explains.
          "Commercial packers can't afford to have produce sitting
          there, so we want this treatment to kill the insects as soon
          as it can." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Tang, Hansen, Drake, and Lisa
          Nevens, an ARS entomologist at Yakima, first began working on
          the radio frequency project in 1996. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>In California -- Tree Nuts and
            Dried Fruits</b> </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, in California,
          entomologist Judy A. Johnson is also keenly attuned to the
          potential of radio frequency energy to zap destructive
          insects. Her primary targets? The wiggly larvae of the navel
          orangeworm, Indianmeal moth, and codling moth. These insects
          are among the worst enemies of walnuts, almonds, and
          pistachios and of dried fruits such as figs and raisins.
          Johnson has newly added red flour beetle to her list of
          culprits-- a lesser pest of the nut and fruit crops but a
          major problem in flour mills and food-processing plants. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Johnson is doing the radio
          frequency work at the ARS San Joaquin Valley Agricultural
          Sciences Center at Parlier, near Fresno, in close association
          with cooperators at WSU and UC-Davis. They have already
          developed a preliminary picture of the target insects' ability
          to endure heat-- their "thermal tolerance." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The laboratory experiments that
          Johnson and her ARS and university colleagues conducted are
          the first to extensively detail the thermal tolerance of the
          navel orangeworm, Indianmeal moth, and codling moth. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For one test, Johnson and
          co-investigators drilled tiny holes in over 500 in-the-shell
          walnuts; enticed the slender, whitish navel orangeworms to
          enter the shells; then plugged the holes to block the insects'
          escape. The scientists then tried some novel combinations of
          radio waves and hot forced air, that is, air that's heated and
          blown into the test chamber holding the nuts. Radio waves,
          alone or combined with hot forced air, were used to heat the
          nuts to 55° C (131° F) in about 5 minutes. Hot forced air was
          then used to keep the nuts at 55° C for 5 or 10 minutes. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"All the treatments killed 100
          percent of the navel orangeworms," reports Johnson. What's
          more, tests led by co-researchers Tang at Pullman and
          Elizabeth J. Mitcham at UC-Davis, showed that the treatments
          didn't harm the quality of the nuts -- even in long-term
          storage. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">"That's critical," Johnson points
          out, "because walnuts are often stored for a year or more
          before they show up at your supermarket." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, walnuts are rich in
          oil, so they're more vulnerable to heat damage than some other
          kinds of nuts, such as almonds. "That's why we think that if a
          treatment is okay for walnuts," Johnson continues, "it will
          likely be okay for almonds." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Indianmeal moths proved to be more
          susceptible to heat than navel orangeworms are. "Indianmeal
          moths are silvery, and wedge-shaped. If you open a kitchen
          cupboard where you keep raisins or breakfast cereals and a
          little moth flies out at you," Johnson explains, "chances are
          it's an Indianmeal moth." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">For this experiment, Johnson and
          her colleagues used metal heating blocks, or plates, specially
          designed by Tang for the radio frequency research. They placed
          target insects in the small gap between the plates, which were
          then heated to specific temperatures and held at those
          temperatures for precise periods. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">She and her associates assembled
          some 15,000 Indianmeal moth larvae for the study, exposing
          them to temperatures ranging from 44° C to 52° C (about 111° F
          to 126° F) for 2 to 100 minutes. "In general," Johnson
          comments, "the lower the temperature, the longer it took to
          kill the larvae. These readings are the basis for a new,
          math-based model for projecting the rate of kill at other
          time-and-temperature regimens. Because of the large number of
          larvae tested and the range of temperatures that we
          investigated, we're very confident of the accuracy of the
          model's projections." </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Johnson and her cooperators also
          used the special heat plates to discover more about the amount
          of time and heat that it takes to kill navel orangeworms. They
          exposed 15,000 navel orangeworms to temperatures ranging from
          46° C to 54° C (about 115° F to 129° F) for 1 to 120 minutes.
          Using the new data, they created a mathematical model of the
          navel orangeworm's thermal tolerances. </p>
        <div style="text-align: left;"> </div>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The findings from the Texas,
          Washington, and California experiments are an essential
          starting point for making the radio frequency energy approach
          a success, Johnson says. The scientists have published their
          findings in the Journal of Economic Entomology, Journal of
          Stored Products Research, and Postharvest Biology and
