      <p align="left">Not only is the fridge solar powered, it can also
        be built from household materials&nbsp; -&nbsp; making it ideal
        for the Third World. </p>
      <p align="left">Emily Cummins, 21, came up with the idea while
        working on a school project in her grandfather's potting shed.
        The fridge is now improving the lives of thousands of

      </div>
      <p align="left">And Miss Cummins hopes to patent a more
        sophisticated portable model for use in transporting medical
        supplies around hot countries. </p>
      <p align="left">From the age of four, when she was given a hammer
        as a gift, Miss Cummins has spent much of her spare time making
        things out of ordinary materials. </p>

      <p align="left">Without using any power, temperatures stay at
        around 6c. </p>
      <p align="left">The fridge comprises two cylinders&nbsp; -&nbsp;
        one inside the other. The inner cylinder is made from metal but
        the outer cylinder can be made from anything to hand, including
        wood and plastic. </p>
      <p align="left">Miss Cummins, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, said:
        'A fridge is something that people can't seem to live without. </p>
      <p align="left">'I wanted to keep it really simple and so I set
        about researching how we cooled things years ago. The simplest
        method of cooling something could be seen when you look at how
        we cool biologically&nbsp; -&nbsp; through sweating or

        <p><i>Emily Cummins, inventor of the solar powered refrigerator</i></p>
      </center>
      <p align="left">Twenty-year old Emily Cummins has been called a
        sustainable designer, a serial ethical inventor, and a
        â€œteenprenuer.â€? Whatever her label, one thing about Emily is
        indisputable: she is already a woman on top. After graduating
        high school, she spent a year in Africa developing a solar
        powered refrigerator for use in third world countries where
        electricity is in short supply. Her invention earned her
        numerous accolades from the engineering community and media
        alike. A true innovator, though, Emily has no intention of
        stopping there. She continues to adopt an inventive approach to
        problem-solving and encourages other young people to think and
        create. </p>
      <p align="left">When Emily was four years old, she received a
        hammer so she could work side-by-side with her grandfather in
        his work shed. She enjoyed observing her grandfather as he
        crafted toys and jewelry boxes out of simple materials. As she
        got older, though, Emily became captivated by the notion that
        she too could create objects using just scrap materials and her
        grandfatherâ€™s tools. This early interest in design translated
        into a serious drive to solve problems through innovation. </p>
      <p align="left">She created her first noteworthy design at age
        fifteen for a major school project. After noticing that her
        arthritic grandfather had difficulty squeezing a tube of
        toothpaste, Emily created a toothpaste dispenser that allows the
        user to push on a lever rather than squeeze a small tube. </p>
      <p align="left">By the time she graduated from secondary school,
        Emily had become interested in inventing products for developing
        countries. She planned to enter a university immediately after
        graduation but decided instead to conduct her research in a real
        world scenario. She ventured to Africa to volunteer at a
        Namibian school and develop her design for a solar powered
        refrigerator. Emily wanted to take refrigerator technology
        â€œback to the basicsâ€? so it could be used in the third world
        where electricity is scarce. Using an aluminum cylindrical
        container and sheep wool to hold water, she created a
        refrigerator that would cool its contents through an evaporation
        process. The refrigerator needs no electricity, relying instead
        on solar energy. Emilyâ€™s refrigerator is ideal for
        transporting medicines and even storing food and water. </p>
      <p align="left">Upon returning to the UK after her year in Africa,
        Emily secured funding so that her product could be refined and
        even manufactured on a large scale. In addition to gaining
        material support, she earned a string of engineering and
        technology awards for her solar powered refrigerator. She was
        named the Technology Woman of the Future at the Women of the
        Future Awards in 2006. The Young Engineers for Britain called
        Emilyâ€™s refrigerator â€œThe Project with the Most Benefit to
        the Community.â€? She also won the British Female Innovator of
        the Year Award in 2007. </p>
      <p align="left">Emily enrolled at the University of Leeds to
        pursue a degree in management, but she contends that
        engineering, technology, and sustainability projects still
        factor into her academic and extracurricular work. Additionally,
        she is designing a second generation solar powered refrigerator.
        Although her initial design operated well, Emily hopes to design
        a model which can cool to lower temperatures. She also visits
        Africa to teach people there how to produce her first model. </p>
      <p align="left">Finally, she serves as an ambassador for the Make
        Your Mark campaign to help young people make their ideas happen.
        The campaign offers a range of resources for fostering
        creativity in teenagers and young adults. As an ambassador,
        Emily delivers lectures to schools and community groups about
        sustainability and the environment. By identifying the problems,
        she believes she can encourage young people to discover
        imaginative solutions. </p>
      <p align="left">In 2007, The Independent named Emily one of "the
        next big things"? Of course, the young inventor has already
        established herself as "something big"? Her solar powered
        refrigerator serves a useful and necessary purpose in the third
        world. Furthermore, her own efforts motivate young people to
        exercise their creativity. Through her work as a Meet Your Mark
        ambassador and an innovator, Emily may be inspiring "women on
        top" for the future </p>

      <p align="left">At the age of four my grandad gave me a hammer. </p>
      <p align="left">From then on, whenever I used to visit I’d spend
        hours with him in his hut at the bottom of the garden. </p>
      <p align="left">I’d watch as he’d take scraps of materials and
        turn them in to toys for me and my cousins. </p>
      <p align="left">As I got older I'd get involved, learning how to
        use tools and learning about the different properties of
        materials. </p>
      <p align="left">I loved the fact that we could make something out
        of seemingly random bits. </p>
      <p align="left">I used to make trucks, jewellery boxes and
        rounders sets which kept us busy for ages. I loved the freedom.
      </p>
      <p align="left">At such a young age I was able to be creative
        which is something I will never lose... </p>
      <p align="left"><b>http://www.emilycummins.co.uk/#/fridgeproblem/4521158226</b>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Whilst attending the National Design
        Sustainability Award’s, Ed Gillespie (Creative Director of
        Futerra) was one of the guest speakers, he spoke about
        Sustainable Development and I was inspired. </p>
      <p align="left">I was shocked at how big a problem global warming
        has become, partially due to the rate at which fossil fuels are
        being burnt. It was clear to me that everyday appliances cannot
        be used ‘everyday’ for much longer. </p>
      <p align="left">After extensive research I found that the
        refrigerator was the main appliance that people could not or did
        not want to live without, therefore I decided to design and make
        a prototype of a sustainable refrigerator. </p>
      <p align="left">I performed various scientific tests to find the
        most suitable sustainable materials to use, taking into account;
        efficient function, the amount of energy used to produce the
        materials, availability and cost. </p>
      <p align="left">The fridge I produced at school is a full working
        model; its size would be perfect for transporting medicines but
        my design could also be manufactured on a larger scale, as the
        theory would still work. </p>
      <p align="left">I manufactured the fridge in a cylindrical shape
        as there are fewer areas where bacteria can build up. The
        storage area is lifted from an inner cylinder meaning less cold
        air is lost as cold air sinks. </p>
      <p align="left">After completing my design and discovering how
        simple it was to cool, I thought about other uses for it, such
        as for use in Africa. I used contacts from my previous water
        carrier project to research further and research further,
        considering ease of manufacturing and material choices. </p>
      <p align="left">After my A levels I took my fridge to Africa where
        I spent nearly 5 months. During this time I tested my
        refrigerator. I am now in the process of creating a second
        generation refrigerator; meaning that it will be even more
        energy efficient and cool to constant temperatures lower than
        6ºc! </p>
      <p align="left">Between the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder
        is an open compartment where any medium capable of holding water
        can be placed.&nbsp; The medium would usually be sand, wool or
        soil and is packed into the gap and then water is added. </p>
      <p align="left">When the fridge is placed in a warm environment,
        the sun’s energy causes the water to evaporate from the medium.
        As the water/medium mix is held against the inner cylinder, heat
        is removed in the form of energy. Due to heat transfer the inner
        cylinder becomes cooler. The reduced temperature and completely
        dry environment of the inner chamber makes it perfect for the
        storage of perishables as it will allow items to be kept fresh
        for longer.<br>

        grandpa's potting shed. The Daily Mail claims that she has

      <p align="left">The Daily Mail's illustration describes it as
        having a "gap between the inner and outer layer that is filled
        with sand, wool or soil, that can be soaked with water." they
        continue and say that "the sun's rays heat this wet material and
        the water evaporates off." </p>
      <p align="left">Right. Putting it in the sun increases
        evaporation, cooling the interior? I suspect not, but
        evaporative cooling can be used to make an effective and cheap
        cooling system for Africa, like Mohammed Bah Abba did ten years
        ago. </p>
      <p align="left">(<a

      <p align="left">Warren described it earlier: </p>
      <p align="left">"[Take] two pots, one inside another. Fill the
        space between the two with moist sand, and you have a most
        ingenious fridge. (That’s very modern if you live in one of the
        90% of villages that don’t have electricity.) The water in the
        sand naturally migrates towards the outer pot, where it
        evaporates causing a temperature drop around the inner pot." </p>
      <p align="left">It was one of Time Magazine's inventions of the
        year in 2001 and won a Rolex award. It is made locally and sells
        for forty cents. </p>
      <p align="left">Warren also points us to the Darfur’s Women’s
        Association for Earthenware Manufacturing&nbsp; (
        http://www.itdg.org/?id=annual_review_2003 ), where: </p>
      <p align="left">"In Al Fashir, the capital of North Darfur,
        ITDGPractical Action and the Women’s Association for Earthenware
        Manufacturing have been experimenting with a traditional storage
        container called a zeer, invented by a teacher called Mohammed
        Bah Abba. </p>
      <p align="left">"A lidded earthenware pot is fitted inside a
        larger pot with an insulating layer of sand in between. This
        sand layer can be kept cool by adding water regularly, thus
        providing a refrigerated storage space at minimal cost. </p>
      <p align="left">"The results of these trials were amazing.
        Carrots, tomatoes and okra could now be kept in good condition
        for nearly twenty days, whereas previously they would have been
        unsaleable after two or three." </p>
      <p align="left">While evaporative cooling has been around for
        millenia, according to Rolex: </p>
      <p align="left">"The city of Qena in Upper Egypt is renowned for
        its porous-clay cooling vessels – a tradition spanning more than
        three millennia. In Burkina Faso, the Jula people’s traditional
        jars are sometimes soaked in water before goods are stored in
        them, so that they stay cool by evaporation. This single-pot
        design is similar to the pot-in-pot, but less efficient." </p>
      <p align="left">The double wall system is a dramatic improvement.
        In most of the versions we have seen, the porosity of the clay
        is an important component; Emily has made her version of a
        non-porous metal. Perhaps there is something about it that I am
        missing, that lets it work better in the sun than in the shade.
      </p>
      <p align="left">But every swamp cooler and fridge I ever heard of
        right back to the Australian Coolgardie Safe worked better in
        the shade and relied on moving air to increase evaporation
        rather than sitting in the sun. </p>

      <p align="left">In rural northern Nigeria, there are no
        refrigerators. Most people don't even have electricity. So
        perishable food must be eaten immediately, or it will go to
        waste. Mohammed Bah Abba, a local teacher, has developed an
        ingenious solution: the Pot-in-Pot Preservation Cooling System.
        A small earthenware pot is placed inside a larger one, and the
        space between the two is filled with moist sand. The inner pot
        is filled with fruit, vegetables or soft drinks; a wet cloth
        covers the whole thing. As water in the sand evaporates through
        the surface of the outer pot, it carries heat, drawing it away
        from the inner core. Eggplants stay fresh for 27 days, instead
        of the usual three. Tomatoes and peppers last for up to three
        weeks. A recipient of the Rolex Award for Enterprise, Abba, 37,
        who hails from a family of potmakers, is using his $75,000 award
        to make the invention available throughout Nigeria. He has
        already sold 12,000. </p>
