      <p><i>Two decades ago amateur scientist Maurice Ward invented a
          material that could resist the force of 75 Hiroshimas. So why
          haven't we all heard about it?</i> </p>

      <p>The gentleman feels for something in his jacket pocket. It's a
        nice suit, and it is accompanied by a suitably gentlemanly
        bow-tie. The effect is sartorially unusual but not too much.
        What will come out of the pocket, though, is more than unusual.
        It is unparalleled and almost unbelievable. 'Here,' says Maurice
        Ward, handing over a creamy small square. 'That's Starlite.'
        It's a piece of plastic that bends in all directions, with a
        charred mark the size of a coin on one side. 'That's from the
        nuclear blast,' says Ward. 'Don't worry, there's no nuclear
        stuff on it. I wouldn't have given it to you otherwise.' </p>
      <p>It feels and looks like nothing much, but holding this
        nondescript piece of plastic would be, to the world's defence
        and scientific community, somewhat of a privilege. Starlite,
        invented by the white-bearded, suited Ward, has been described
        as astonishing; impossible; miraculous. It has changed
        assumptions about thermodynamics and physics. It can resist
        temperatures that would melt diamonds, threefold. 'If it is what
        it seems,' says Toby Greenbury, a partner at law firm Mischon de
        Reya and Ward's lawyer for 20 years, 'it will be of enormous
        benefit to mankind. It's very difficult to think of another
        invention that is bigger in its implications.' As a
        fire-retardant, thermal barrier or heat-resistant coating,
        Starlite could change the world. Except that it hasn't, and
        that's as much of a mystery as the secret, unheard of properties
        of the material Ward invented 23 years ago. </p>
      <p>At the time, Ward and his family – his wife Eileen and four
        daughters – ran a small plastics business. It was a departure
        from the family trade, which was ladies' hairdressing – with
        Ward mixing hair products and dyes himself. They'd come from all
        over the north for his colouring skills, he says. 'My heads
        couldn't be copied. What L'Oreal and Garnier are doing today, I
        was doing 50 years ago. And they still haven't got it right.' </p>
      <p>His happy tinkering would stand him in good stead when
        hairdressing lost its appeal. In the early Eighties, Ward, with
        his canny eye for a good business deal, bought an extruder – a
        system for manufacturing plastic cross-sections – from ICI. It
        was a huge thing and took up too much space to be attractive to
        most buyers, but Ward thought it a bargain, installed it in his
        factory, and got tinkering. At this point the tale gets a bit
        confused. Ward is 76, after all, and his chronology isn't always
        chronological. But after something to do with ICI wanting a
        plastic for Citroën bonnets, Ward ended up with a failed
        extruded material that 'came out as scraps. We granulated it,
        stuck it in a bin and left it there.' That was that, until
        August 22 1985, when a British Airtours plane on the way to
        Corfu failed to take off at Manchester Airport and caught fire.
        For Ward, it was life-changing. 'It interested me because it was
        an air disaster on the ground, and because it was the smoke and
        toxicity that killed people, not the fire. Fifty-five people
        died in 40 seconds. We thought we'd like to find something that
        doesn't burn very much, that would be useful.' </p>
      <p>Ward began making up teaspoonfuls of 'stuff' in a food mixer.
        He christened the material 'gubbins,' and mixed and blended and
        mixed and blended some more: 'I was making up to 20 formulations
        a day.' Eventually, he got a few he liked, extruded them into
        sheet form and tested them with a blowtorch. 'I just thought,
        "well it's better than we ever expected. It's better than it
        needs to be."' </p>
      <p>It was better than better. The piece of gubbins had resisted
        2,500 C of heat aimed at it by the torch, and stayed cool enough
        to touch. Other experiments – holding a torched piece of gubbins
        up to the face; holding up a sheet with a hand behind it –
        produced similar results. Ward, a completely untrained amateur
        inventor, seemed to have invented a material that resisted heat
        and also cooled it. If it was for real, it was the best thermal
        barrier the world had yet seen, and its possibilities were
        limitless. Fire-resistant uniforms; better fire doors; safer
        furniture. Laser-resistant tanks and weaponry; more efficient
        missile nose cones. It could coat launch sites for vertical
        take-off aircraft and spacecraft. </p>
      <p>So this, thought the Wards, was it. Chemical companies would
        batter down their doors in desperation to license the invention,
        they would be wildly wealthy, and more importantly, the world,
        with this new, stunningly efficient fire retardant, would be a
        safer place for everyone. And nothing happened. There were tests
        carried out at ICI by a contact in one of the labs, in which the
        still unnamed material passed the UL94 (VO) test – involving a
        calibrated Bunsen burner flame – with ease. Ward thought then
        that 'if it were in ICI labs right now it'd be worth 10 million
        quid.' But talks fell through. 'I know now it's because they
        were working on Victrex,' says Ward, inviting me to look it up.
        (It's a 'high-performance thermoplastic', but not
        revolutionary.) Derision was also a factor. Ward has often been
        compared to the northern factory worker played by Alec Guinness
        in the 1951 film The Man in the White Suit. Guinness invents a
        material which repels dirt, and no one takes him seriously. Ward
        could sympathise. 'They laughed at me at first. But they take me
        seriously now.' </p>
      <p>At this point the chronology falters again. There were talks
        with British Aerospace, set up by 'a guy called Fred'. There
        were other talks with 'guys from a big international company'. I
        want more details, but there are none: Ward is expansive and
        unfailingly courtly, but can be elusive. He's 'a true English
        eccentric', the defence journalist Pamela Pohling-Brown wrote of
        him recently. Perhaps that's why our meeting takes place in the
        slightly odd surroundings of a meeting room in a Hartlepool
        primary school, along with the soundtrack of children playing
        and a fire alarm to add excitement. Perhaps that's also why he
        decided to call his product Starlite, because his eight-year-old
        granddaughter thought it was a good name. </p>
      <p>The talks collapsed, but other talk continued to circulate,
        reaching the studios of Tomorrow's World. In early 1990,
        presenter Peter McCann introduced viewers to Starlite by means
        of an egg. Ward shows me the first videoed test of the
        oxyacetylene torch meeting a Starlite-coated hen's egg. Not only
        did a Starlite coating prevent the egg from combusting, it was
        also an astonishingly efficient insulator, as McCann
        demonstrated by cracking the egg, after five minutes of it being
        torched, to reveal a completely raw yolk. There are other
        thermal barriers, the presenter said, but none that resist heat
        and yet give off no toxic fumes, and can be easily moulded. </p>
      <p>The defence establishment was watching. In July that year, Ward
        was invited to the British Atomic Weapons Establishment at
        Foulness, and the egg went nuclear. 'They'd been trying to get
        something to withstand a nuclear flash for 45 years, and we did
        it in five minutes.' Ward was reluctant to take part at first.
        'I was happy with my egg. It was just a challenge and I didn't
        want to lose.' This was a different league. Starlite-coated eggs
        were subjected to light-energy sources that simulated a nuclear
        flash, equivalent to a temperature of 10,000 C. 'They did it
        twice and it was still there. Charred, but intact.' The Foulness
        equipment couldn't keep up. 'I said to one scientist, "Are we
        doing all right?", and he burst out laughing. He said,
        "Normally, we do a test every couple of hours because we have to
        wait for it to cool down. We're doing it every 10 minutes, and
        it's sat there laughing at us."' Most materials vaporise beyond
        2,000 C. Pure carbon, which has the highest melting point of all
        elements, melts at 3,500 C. Starlite was withstanding
        temperatures and forces that physics and thermodynamics dictated
        it shouldn't. Even with tests from unquestionable authorities
        like AWE, people were sceptical. 'Some people called me a
        shyster. But they are blinkered. We've got video: We can show
        you.' </p>
      <p>In tests at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment in
        Malvern, Starlite was pulsed with lasers that would normally
        have burned through polymer. Instead, as Pohling-Brown reported
        in a widely-read article in International Defence Review in
        1993, 'Starlite showed little damage to the surface, merely
        small pits with the approximate diameter of the beam and with
        little evidence of melting.' Professor Keith Lewis, who led the
        RSRE tests, confirms that Starlite 'had unique properties which
        appeared to be very different to other forms of thermal barrier
        material available at the time.' It wasn't clear how Starlite
        worked: was it diffusing the heat? Absorbing it? Repelling it?
        'Keith Lewis told me that it does all sorts of things,' says
        Ward. 'It's very complex. Millions of things are happening all
        at once.' </p>
      <p>After that, the phones never stopped ringing. Ward may have
        been a canny businessman, but the thousands of aspiring
        investors were overwhelming. Greenbury came on board, and Ward
        'separated the men from the boys' by insisting on a
        confidentiality agreement and £8,000 paid upfront. Keeping the
        formula secret was paramount, to the point of refusing to patent
        it. 'Everyone said they would invest and could they have a
        sample. No, they couldn't.' Visitors to the factory were
        deliberately diverted from Starlite by loads of other material
        left lying around. The formula was known only by Ward and his
        immediate family, though Pohling-Brown reported that it included
        'up to 21 organic polymers and copolymers, and small quantities
        of ceramics'. 'It was put about that we never wrote it down but
        that's not true. I just didn't tell anybody.' </p>
      <p>In fact, Ward let a sample out of his sight only once. In June
        1991, a sample was sent to White Sands atomic weapons testing
        site in New Mexico, in the care of the SAS, and subjected to a
        simulated nuclear onslaught. 'It was classed as the biggest bang
        in town. I've seen a video [on which] it shredded forest to
        sawdust, rolled some tanks around, stripped an aircraft into
        pieces.' But Starlite survived. Further tests at Foulness had
        subjected it to the force of 75 Hiroshimas, and it survived
        that, too. NASA publicly raved about its potential, with
        spokesman Rudi Narangor revealing that 'We have done a lot of
        evaluation and … we know all the tremendous possibilities that
        this material has.' And yet still no agreement was signed.
        'Maurice,' says Greenbury, 'is a one-man band. He's an inventor,
        and he has an unusual way of looking at things. It has proved to
        be very difficult to deal with large companies. There hasn't
        been a meeting of minds.' </p>
      <p>Ward's conditions were unusual. He wouldn't sign
        confidentiality agreements, which made government and defence
        companies uncooperative. In joint ventures, he insisted on
        keeping 51 per cent. 'If they'd wanted to buy it outright, they
        could have had it. But they always wanted a licence, and if they
        wanted that they had to sign an agreement that says they won't
        plagiarise or reverse engineer. If they don't sign that, they
        get a sample and then they reverse engineer and why would they
        bother to get a licence?' This was why NASA never signed up.
        It's why BAE didn't, or Boeing, or the dozens of other
        corporations and military establishments who got somewhere in
        negotiations but never to the end. </p>
      <p>'Maurice's concern about confidentiality is a legitimate
        concern,' says Greenbury. Ward claims that two samples have been
        stolen, and countless attempts made. His talk might sound
        paranoid – a newspaper article that was 'squashed by the
        government'; a computer hack that removed documents from his
        computer; break-ins at his office – but the stakes were high
        enough for such claims to be believable. Greenbury, the sober
        lawyer, thinks 'some people might have been enormously tempted
        to find out the secret.' </p>
      <p>But Greenbury also thinks that Starlite's potential has been,
        so far, its biggest handicap. 'It's difficult to think of
        another invention that is bigger in its implications. If it had
        been less important, I think it would have been much easier.'
        Ward certainly believes in his product, claiming publicly that
        it could have prevented the space shuttle disasters. 'Starlite
        has a Q-value [an energy absorption rating] of 2,470. The space
        shuttle tiles have a Q-value of 1.' Not only that, but because
        Starlite is so lightweight – 1mm thick, compared to 75mm for the
        space tiles – it's actually '2,470 x 75 times better'. </p>
      <p>For Greenbury, the past few years have been Ward's wilderness
        ones. Publicity stopped when Ward entered into talks with Boeing
        in the late Nineties (and, according to Ward, involved
        researching using Starlite to protect Air Force One from a
        nuclear flash). They were almost successful. Contracts were
        drawn up, though no figures were written down. 'They used x and
        y on the documents, but figures were being bandied about of
        between a hundred million and half a billion.' (Greenbury, when
        asked to put a price on Starlite, thinks it 'incalculable'.)
        Negotiations collapsed, says Ward, because Boeing got into
        trouble (there were accusations of industrial espionage and the
        CEO was forced to resign). He surfaced from Boeing to find that
        no one was knocking on his door any more. 'Boeing asked us not
        to talk to anybody else. It was a huge mistake, because it
        stopped all the opposition coming to us, too.' He sounds
        resigned – 'It's quite a tale of woe, isn't it?' – but also
        somewhat a changed man. </p>
      <p>The secrecy will ease, up to a point. He will apply for
        patents, for a start. His rigid business practices have also
        softened, he says. Now he just wants to market it. 'We were used
        to selling a ton of this here and there. But this got too big
        for us.' Now, he's keeping things simple. There is still
        secrecy, in the form of ongoing negotiations with an Indian
        company to make an unnamed product (according to Greenbury) and
        with an airline manufacturer (according to Ward). There is still
        invention, in the form of a hollow-core Starlite-coated
        fire-door which weighs 25kg, compared to the usual 70-80kg: 'And
        it doesn't leak halogens all the time, like most doors.' His
        concrete plans aren't grand – he wants to get a local
        manufacturer to make the doors – but the door might be grander,
        being a response to criticism that his invention is so
        profoundly important, he should have given it to the world long
        ago. 'A lot of people have been saying that I'm a rotten prat
        and that I'm greedy and I should give it to the world.' Other
        critics have objected to his talks with defence companies.
        'That's one of the reasons I've tried to stay keeping hold of
        things. I've said it often enough that we'd like to give
        protection but not to cause devastation.' </p>
      <p>Ward promises great things are imminent. His website is still a
        one-page affair bearing a picture of his granddaughter
        harness-racing 'because I liked the picture'. But he's now
        posting test results and videos on a new blog. There are talks
        under way with an unnamed major aircraft manufacturer, and
        Greenbury is hopeful that the Indian negotiations will actually
        succeed. 'After 20 years, perhaps I'm being too optimistic, but
        I would really like to see this commercialised in Maurice's
        lifetime.' </p>
      <p>In the small meeting room in that Hartlepool primary school,
        Ward asks if he's told me enough. He phones later, asking if I
        have more questions (and worries that President Obama is at risk
        because he doesn't have Starlite on Air Force One). He wants to
        get his story across, again, despite the wilderness years. He's
        not bitter. 'We just followed a route. It was all going to
        happen.' He's back to working on new Starlite formulations.
        There will be more tests, more news, more publicity, he says.
        'The interest is there,' he says, 'and growing.' And with that,
        he drives me to the station in a modest car, a man in a blue
        suit who could still change the world, one Starlite-coated egg
        at a time. </p>

      <p>Ward and his 'starlite' were on 20/20 here in the states.&nbsp;
        After that appearance, a rep from DuPont came out to meet him
        across the pond.&nbsp; He caught the guy trying to get away with
        a sample by stuffing it down his pants. (big surprise)...
        Obviously some back room deal was struck long ago....because
        he's still alive, I believe, and the stuff's nowhere to be found
        in the public domain.<br>

        Maybe not too weird. Remember that guy from (maybe) Britain that
        said on TV that he had made this special thermal insulation that
        was cheap, anomolously high-temp resistant, and made with
        "things found in a grocery store" (he said with a twinkle in his
        eye)? He would take his white goo from a mayo jar and paste it
        to an egg, wet. Then torch the hell out of it and the egg was
        fine. He said that military were looking at it, and they said
        they couldn't crack what it was made of even with spectroscopy
        of whatever kind. Never heard anything more about it. Well, I
        may, or may not, have made some on my porch in college. </b>
      <p><b> OK, so here's what I was mucking with that evening on the
          porch: A propane torch (cheap and cheesey Bernz-O-matic like),
          a [probably alumina, white as snow] refractory brick tray used
          for electronic parts manufacture like ferrites and ceramic
          resistors or some like stuffs, "20 Mule Team" Borax [Hydrated
          sodium borate], Table Salt [sodium chloride], Sodium Hydroxide
          [aka: lye, caustic soda, sodium hydrate], Flint Glass Rod
          (and/or) Soda Glass Rod (and/or) Borosilicate Glass Rod. </b></p>
      <p><b> I was just making molten balls of stuff and one of the
          balls of stuff crystalized before my eyes and would not melt.
          This would be no biggy, but for the fact that when I took it
          to my metal sculpture class and torched it with the
          oxygen/acetylene torch and the little ball of stuff would not
          melt even after I had a pool of this [probably alumina]
          firebrick under the flame. Never have I seen anything hold up
          to a flame like that before or since. I feel like an idiot,
          but I don't know which items from the above list I had mixed
          together and I just blew it off for the longest time. </b></p>
      <p><b> If it really is similar to what the ol' Brit was making I
          see why he had the twinkle in his eye... everything I used can
          be found in some form within a grocery store. Be it the Borax
          from the launrdy section, the "Red Devil" Lye, the various
          glass types from everything from light bulbs to pickle jars,
          Table Salt, or even if the alumina brick got in on the
          reaction, it can be found floating around in one or a hundred
          fixtures of machines and lights. </b></p>
      <p><b> Being that I have almost everything for this test and
          absolutely no content on my website, I hope someone beats me
          to it and finds that it is a useful substance. Poke me in the
          forehead if you think I should do it and post my results on my
          site. </b></p>
      <p><b> Thanks fer listening, RR</b><br>
