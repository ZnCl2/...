      Phenomena connected with life and vitality seem to owe their
      nature to three types of radiation, according to the observations
      of the Chinese over a millenium or more and to the conclusions of
      contemporary biologists. These radiations are: the cosmic
      radiations (Chinese "Yang"), telluric or earth radiations ("Yin"),
      and thirdly, radiations specific to the chemical components of the
      earth.<br>
      <br>
      As a part of biology the existence of "harmful" rays -- affecting
      the health of organic cells -- can be shown by locally weaker
      plant growth. Among plants which can be used for the purpose
      because they are particularly sensitive to those radiations are
      lilac, currant bushes, apple trees, pines, leaf-artichike plants,
      celery, begonias, hydrangeas, dahlias, nasturniums, rose-bushes,
      box hedges, oaks, and hawthornes. These Harmful Radiations affect
      large animals no less than insects: cats are attracted, birds
      avoid them, ants make nests where the radiations pass. In other
      countries than France and in numerous experiments rabbits and mice
      have been made, for observation, to live in places where there are
      these radiations to affect them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Many Origins of "Harmful Rays"</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A number of observers have written upon this subject. The origin
      of "harmful rays" may be any of the following: dry or damp
      geological faults, underground streams producing above them a
      force possessing a dominant polarity, drains, cemeteries, all
      subterranean cavities, electric wires, electric motors' fields,
      petrol motors, special geological strata like felspath, also clay
      or deposits of dead organic matter; the fact of two Earth Rays
      crossing at a point ( the Partition Rays of Dr Peyre of Paris),
      the effect of inductive coiled wires (solenoids); even the
      "magnetic" properties (fluid) of certain people -- particularly of
      those who are disease "carriers" or else produce alpha radiations
      in excess; certain geometrical figures, as drawings or actual
      objects. The length of this list of causes shows that the subject
      is a vast one awaiting fuller research by biologists and
      radiesthetists.<br>
      <br>
      A certain German physicist is of the opinion that these radiations
      lie between the hertzian band and the infrared band of
      frequencies, with wavelengths between 0.345 cm and 10 cm. The
      Radio-Campometre (our own radiesthetic appliance) reveals these
      radiations with a length of between 8 mm and 4.5 cm (which may be
      the recordings of harmonics).<br>
      <br>
      The harmful nature of such radiations appears to be due to two
      causes:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Maximum ionization of the soil where irradiation is directed.<br>
      (2) The predominating polarity given to any living organism in the
      field of influences derived from the radiation.<br>
      <br>
      The intensity increases after dark, and is greatest on the day of
      the full moon, on the day preceding it, and on the day which
      follows. The intensity is also increased during magnetic storms
      and seismic disturbances.<br>
      <br>
      Our personal hypothesis is that cosmic and telluric radiations, as
      the two main sources of General Energy, produce and maintain the
      phenomenon of life in all living organisms, whether of the animal
      or the plant kingdoms.<br>
      <br>
      A simple experiment can illustrate the outstanding importance of
      these two sources of energy: Take three equal-sized begonias in
      their pots, numbered 1 to 3. No.1 will be protected from Telluric
      Rays by an insulator -- (A perfect insulator cannot be found, as
      oscillograph recordings show). No. 2 will be protected from Cosmic
      Rays by means of a Faraday cage. No. 3 will remain untreated, as
      the control plant. <br>
      <br>
      It will be observed that Nos. 1 and 2 will wither or die, while
      No. 3 continues to live normally. In other words, a combined
      stimulation from cosmic and telluric radiations is essential for
      life to be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      To the above concept of the complementary action of these two
      sources of energy, we add another hypothesis: "Every living
      organism of its own accord absorbs a definite quantity of one or
      other of these two sources of energy, as required, in order to
      insure the vital function."<br>
      <br>
      Let it not be forgotten that the living organism receives and also
      itself emits radiation. As Dr Jules Regnault, now of Granville,
      has written, "The living organism must be considered as an actual
      oscillator and resonator."<br>
      <br>
      The most disturbing fact which our own observations have shown in
      the course of investigations is the following: in the case of
      healthy living organism (plants or animals), the proportion of the
      two sources of energy seems to be fixed, namely, cosmic radiation
      100 units to telluric radiation 50 units; and whenever this
      proportion is not maintained in an organism, one always finds it
      ill or revealing some kind of deficiency. The constancy of these
      proportions is a proof of Dame Nature's constancy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Causes of Imbalance in Cellular Oscillation</b><br>
      <br>
      We can quote from our observations the following causes of
      imbalance:<br>
      <br>
      (a) Excess "polar" radiation emitted by subterranean streams,
      which have a predominating polarity;<br>
      <br>
      (b) Radioactive emanations of certain soils which exhibit an
      excess of alpha particles and gamma radiation, but a deficiency of
      beta particles (an exception is to be made with regard to the
      "rare earths", which emit a form of radioactive energy favorable
      to plant life).<br>
      <br>
      (c) Cosmic radiations in excess when they reach a soil deficient
      in lime.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the numerous forms of radiation present in nature it
      can easily be accepted that many of these radiations can bring
      about a wave interference producing imbalance in many of the vital
      radiations absorbed by living organisms. The latter are affected
      when they are reached by the passing of these radiations; after a
      certain length of time the ionic equilibrium of the living
      organisms is thereby destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      These observations, derived from numerous experiments, have led us
      to evolve three solutions:<br>
      1. Neutralization.<br>
      2. The broadcasting of selected vital forces for restoring
      balance.<br>
      3. A combined arrangement with neutralization and a simultaneous
      broadcasting of vital forces.<br>
      <br>
      Before giving any description of the methods employed for solving
      problem in each of the three ways, a few words may be said about
      the phenomenon of radiations connected with the vital force. Let
      these be called the "Vital Radiation", and let us see what is
      meant by this. Earlier in this paper they were described as
      apparently dependent upon the action of two forces, cosmic
      radiation and telluric radiation. (For the time being influences
      due to a specific soil's radiations will not be discussed, this
      being reserved for a separate discussion).<br>
      <br>
      The kind of experiment which can be repeated by anybody to prove
      the action of these two types of energy has already been
      described. In order to obtain a standard reaction or recording for
      all radiesthetists we have constructed a pendulum specifically for
      the assessment of this vital radiation. Both with the
      "Radio-Capteur" constructed by Dr Regnault, and with our
      "Radio-Campometre" we have been able to observe that corresponding
      fields of influence are constant for the two following: cosmic
      radiation received when the sky is blue and free from clouds;
      telluric radiation, i.e., standard influences emanating from the
      Earth.<br>
      <br>
      Constant recordings have been obtained for these, we have invented
      three specific pendulums, namely the R.C. (Rayon Cosmique); the
      R.T. (Rayon Tellurique); the R.V. (Rayon Vital), suitable for
      standardizing radiesthetists' records.<br>
      <br>
      As experiment will show, the pendulum R.V. provides gyrations only
      over living organisms, and the gyration is in reverse rotation
      whenever a field detected is due to any radiation unfavorable to
      phenomena of vitality. This pendulum can thus indicate the degree
      of the vital field's value. A study of this vital field,
      supplemented by examination of the fields of cosmic and telluric
      radiations, then shows the cause of any cell deficiency when there
      is imbalance and there is no longer the normal standard proportion
      between cosmic radiation and telluric radiation.<br>
      <br>
      With these pendulums we can conduct biological examinations
      according to what is required, the task being to determine one of
      the three "causes of cellular oscillation imbalance". It is now
      the moment for reporting on --<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Three Solutions :</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>No. 1 : Solutions</b> -- It should be said that our
      investigations stated in 1929. At this time a little neutralizer
      had been invented for controlling the position of the vertical
      over underground mines or sources of water. Dr Joly, of Paris,
      happened to ask Dr Jules Regnault whether this appliance could be
      effective for neutralizing areas above any soil emitting radiation
      found harmful to health. During the six months of experimental to
      observe the protective effects. (There can be no auto-suggestion
      responsible for results obtained on plants). In view of what was
      learned by this means an appliance was installed in the house of
      Dr Joly's patient. At the end of several months the patient
      congratulated us on its efficacy as shown by his restored health.<br>
      <br>
      Since then this appliance has had improvements made to it, and
      these can be outlined as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. -- Ability to collect the harmful radiation from the area where
      it was detected;<br>
      <br>
      2. -- Conveyance of this radiation to a neutralizing appliance, by
      means of the radiation-conducting qualities of an insulated
      electric wire;<br>
      <br>
      3. -- Filtration of such harmful rays and conversion of their
      wave-form to make the radiation favorable to living organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Harmful radiation of this kind has been identified in human
      habitations and in buildings used by horses, cows and pigs. At the
      request of the owners our system of neutralization has been
      installed. The following are two of the many letters of
      appreciation received from farmers of the region (here translated
      into English):<br>
      <br>
      St. Neen, 22.9.47<br>
      Following your installation in my cow-sheds and my sties I have
      observed that there have no longer been deaths as there were
      before. The neutralization has been successful for about a year.
      The stock great energy. <br>
      <br>
      Poce, 20.9.48<br>
      I am writing to tell you the result of installing neutralizers at
      the beginning of June 1947. We now have 15 young pigs from two
      sows, a thing which we never obtained before.<br>
      <br>
      A sheaf of testimonials is available. Their reproduction in this
      short paper would not be suitable.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that this neutralizer involves no expenditure on
      upkeep. The energy it provides is derived from earth radiation
      throgh being connected to the earth where the harmful earth rays
      have been radiesthetically detected. The appliance does not have
      any healing power in itself, but it brings about good health by
      insuring that the living organisms are in a place favorable to the
      development of the phenomena responsible for life, as research
      undertaken since 1930 has proved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solution No. 2 : Emission of Vitalizing Radiations</b> -- The
      work on the frequencies of cells by Prof. Ch. Henry, of the
      Sorbonne, need not be described again: nor need details be given
      of Lakhovsky's view on the effect of oscillators on plants, of
      similar work by the American, Dr McManus, and of work by the
      Russian, Prof. Chiyevski. All these have closely examined the
      biological question, the effect of radiations upon living
      organisms, and, in in particular, upon plants.<br>
      <br>
      On the same lines we have in turn studied the effects of
      oscillators and the irradiation of different wavelengths. Without
      entering into the details we can declare: "According to the extent
      and to the intensity of the electromagnetic wavefield produced by
      an oscillator and according to the degree of resonance of the
      radiations upon living an oscillator and according to the degree
      of resonance of the radiations to the living organisms, the effect
      is either favorable or unfavorable to the phenomena of life."<br>
      <br>
      After numerous tests we have for the same purpose succeeded in
      inventing two methods:<br>
      <br>
      <b>The First Method Irradiation</b>, based on use of a
      hertzian-wave transmitter capable of providing the two types of
      vital radiations. With this appliance we have irradiated seeds
      used in horticulture and in farming, and had clearly defined
      effects. Experiment has shown that compared with control seed the
      seed treated gives plants with a better general growth and more
      strength; these plants mature earlier, providing a better crop.
      (In the case of beet, this latter can be as much as 20%, better,
      and in the case of potatoes 10% better).<br>
      <br>
      For the melons shown in the photographs sent to the Congress the
      growth is clearly greater for the seed which has been irradiated*.
      [* Two photographs exhibited showed the difference between melon
      plants grown from activated and non-activated seed about 16 weeks
      after planting ]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Second Method of Irradiation</b> ( which has been patented
      ) is based on an electromagnetic device combined with an
      oscillatoe of these vital radiations.<br>
      <br>
      According to the controls made by others who know how to make use
      of radiesthesia, the result of this device's irradiation is an
      increase of the field of the tested specimen; an increased "vital
      potential" is recorded by the radiesthetist. An interesting
      observation of one of these people was the fact that carrying the
      appliance in one's pocket seems to increase one's powers of
      resistance and to reduce general fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of irradiated plants we have observed increased growth
      and earlier bloom by comparison with the control plants. Trees in
      poor condition have gained strength through treatment lasting say,
      a year. Water when treated by the device the device acquires new
      qualities due to an absorption of this vital radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solution No. 3</b> : Neutralization and Simultaneous
      Broadcasting of the Vitalizing Radiaition -- Two methods are to be
      considered according to what is precisely required.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 1</b> -- To transform the radiations in only a small
      area to make this more favorable to life. For this, a small
      portable Neutralizer* [ *The Neutralizer and the Vitalizer
      exhibited consisted of small flat brass cylinders or capsules
      about 43 mm in diameter and 15 mm high. They were hermetically
      sealed. ] Model 168-2, which exerts its influence over a radius of
      1 m. 30 cm ( 50 inches ); also a Vitalizer, Model 168-3. The
      combination of these two can be useful; for instance, to a person
      who must remain in a zone of harmful radiations, say during
      working hours; or for cattle occupying&nbsp; a small shed which is
      in a harmful zone; or again for a tree which fails to thrive
      because by mischance it has been planted in a zone of harmful
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 2</b> -- To modify the conditions of a whole house or of
      a cowshed or similar building situated in a large area influenced
      by harmful telluric radiations. Firstly, neutralize completely the
      whole area where the building is, by means of an appliance which
      emits healthy vitality radiations over a radius of at least 20
      meters ( 65 feet ). This appliance must be connected to earth. The
      broadcasting derived from this appliance increases the vitality
      potential in the area, and for all living organisms increases
      their powers of resistance to the various causes of any
      disturbance to the vitality factor. Many tests along these lines
      are still required from biologists who are skilled in radiesthetic
      assessment. It is hoped that these tests will be made in the near
      future since the matter is in our opinion of capital importance,
      for it concerns our Life. The investigations of British biologists
      will be welcomed.<br>

            Apparatus for Capture of Hertzian Waves<br>
          </b></font></div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): LARVARON MAURICE-FRANCOIS +<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Apparatus for detecting radio waves. The purpose of the apparatus
      is to capture the waves of all kinds emitted by all the bodies of
      the animal, vegetable and mineral reigns and those emitted by the
      radiotelegraph and xadiotelephone stations. It can replace the
      current devices used to pick up hertzian waves: antenna or frame.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Its principle is based on the following observation: a metallic
      wire, in the form of a solenoid, enters into vibration under the
      influence of the terrestrial waves. It thus acquires the property
      of capturing said waves. On the other hand, the shape of this
      electromagnetic apparatus enables it to reinforce the sensed
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description and construction. </b><br>
      <br>
      The apparatus consists of a wire wound in a solenoid: A. The turns
      may be wound directly or indirectly. The wire forming the turns is
      a few tenths of a millimeter in diameter. The diameter of the
      turns varies with the intensity intensity needed.<br>
      <br>
      The starting point of the wire forms a closed loop B. At the C end
      of the solenoid the wire communicates with a terminal D of the
      same metal as itself. In the center is a bundle of soft E. wire.
      The whole is in a wooden boot F.<br>

      </b>Sourcier: the question of clay<br>
      December 13, 2015<br>
      <br>
      After having read an old Maurice LARVARON, "Radiobiology,
      application to the art of the dowsers" I learned that: Water and
      clay can be confused because their alpha and beta radiation,

      <br>
      Dr. Larvaron, son of our scholar colleague, agricultural engineer
      Larvaron, a professor at the Agricultural School of Rennes and
      author of the interesting work Radiobiology has had the merit of
      bringing before the Faculty of Medicine of Paris the formidable
      question of "harmful waves." His inaugural thesis on "pathogenic
      telluric influences" was supported by him in June 1943 , Under the
      chairmanship of Professor Abrami.<br>
      <br>
      The contacts of the radiesthesic or rather radiobiological science
      with the official world have so far been so rare that they deserve
      to be reported. First, doctor-veterinarian Abel Martin had already
      supported his thesis on the "Radiesthetic Diagnosis in Veterinary
      Medicine" at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris in 1932. Then, on 24
      April 1930, the Association of Radiesthetists of Paris, in the
      Great Hall of the Museum, under the auspices of the Société
      Française d'Acclimatation and under the effective presidency of
      Professor Bresson, Director of the École Vétérinaire d'Alfort ,
      Gave a lecture entitled "The harmful waves in relation to the
      health of man, animals and plants".<br>
      <br>
      We hope that these various contacts with official scientists will
      multiply and that our colleagues radiobiologists will find an
      encouragement to multiply the experiments and to perfect their
      methods.<br>
      <br>
      In his remarkable work, Dr. Larvaron brings some new light to the
      question of "harmful waves" which still contains so many obscure
      points. He has dealt with the issue on a somewhat broad scale,
      guided by prominent radiobiologists, such as his father, who was
      previously mentioned, the author of Radiobiology, then Dr.
      Régnault de Toulon, author of Biodynamics and Radiations, and
      finally Dr Creuzé, former head of the laboratory at the Faculty of
      Medicine in Paris, former editor-in-chief of the journal Bio
      dynamisme and author of numerous books and articles on
      "Biodynamics and Radiation".<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Larvaron, in his thesis, taking into account the novelty and
      interest of our radiation, devoted several pages to them: "In
      1937, Dr. Peyré established the existence of rectilinear
      radiations, Parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic meridian
      which may have an adverse effect on certain persons under
      specified conditions ".<br>
      <br>
      In a chapter entitled "rayons de Peyre", he also expresses the
      idea that the cosmic origin would be the main force causing the
      initial departure of this radiation. However, he also cites the
      different hypothesis of our friend, the engineer Besnard.
      "According to the latter, the earth would behave like a generator
      of electric currents, which would go in the east-west direction,
      since the earth turns on its axis in 24 hours in the East-West
      direction, The Law of Lenz ".<br>
      <br>
      In this hypothesis, the formation of radiations with a magnetic
      pace would be determined by electric radiation. These two kinds of
      radiation would be crossed by virtue of the law of Ersted,
      according to which every rectilinear electric current determines
      the formation of a corresponding magnetic field around it,
      intersecting with the initial electric current. Under these
      conditions, the name of cosmo telluric would not suit our
      radiation very well.<br>
      <br>
      Be that as it may, Dr. Larvaron adopting our conclusions, adds:
      "From all the above," he says, "we may conclude with Dr. Peyre, as
      to the nature of these radiations, lines, or fields of force And
      their possible harmfulness, it is electromagnetism and in
      particular the electronization of air (above the lines and
      interlacing) which give the simplest and most often accepted
      explanation. Also see an effect of the general radiation of matter
      or of the general radioactivity of the soil, since all bodies can
      be regarded as more or less radioactive and possessing some sort
      of atomic energy. "<br>
      <br>
      Finally, Dr. Larvaron ends by quoting what we wrote in 1938 in the
      Medical Courier: "Of this hypothesis, electromagnetism and
      radioactivity which are far from excluding, or even if it was only
      a reflection Of cosmic waves, we would nonetheless be in the
      presence of a general manifestation of universal energy. "<br>
      <br>
      Such is, inspired by our earlier writings, the general opinion of
      Dr. Larvaron on our radiations. As can be seen, he reserved for
      them in his inaugural thesis a place in relation to their
      importance and novelty, and then approached the classification of
      "harmful waves": "We will adopt, he says, with some modifications
      The classification established by Mr. H. Mellin ". According to
      this author and the work of MM. Mager and Dr. Peyré, harmful
      influences can be classified as:<br>
      <br>
      The surface influences, which would be due to three causes:<br>
      <br>
      Geological formations of different nature (magnesia, kaolin, green
      clay, ...).<br>
      <br>
      Unhealthy (polluted, worn or dead water, sumps, sewers, cesspools,
      etc.).<br>
      <br>
      So-called cosmo influences of Peyré and the influences of depth.<br>
      <br>
      On sea as on land ...<br>
      <br>
      Finally, Dr. Larvaron, after having indicated how to find these
      radiations and quotes several of our observations, adds
      immediately: "Intrigued, Dr. Peyré, in the spring of 1939,
      embarked on a cruise to ascertain if he would find The same
      radiation on the sea as on land ".<br>
      <br>
      1. On the steamer Champlain, which led him to Dakar, he found the
      same bundles in his cabin and on all the decks of the ship. The
      intersections of the spokes remained fixed in their direction with
      respect to the magnetic meridian, in spite of the changes in the
      course of the ship. We were thus everywhere, on sea as on land, in
      the presence of a North-South radiation of magnetic appearance,
      attributable to terrestrial magnetism, and of an East-West
      radiation perpendicular to the first and of electric appearance.<br>
      <br>
      2. Thus, everywhere, on land as on land, these radiations are
      rectilinear; Consequently, it can not be radiation due to other
      solely telluric influences, such as those resulting from the
      composition of the soil or from the presence in the subsoil of
      underground faults or watercourses. Indeed, the latter are always
      sinuous, crisscrossing the earth's crust following the chance of
      fractures of the ground.<br>
      <br>
      3. Cosmo-telluric rays, so-called Peyre's rays, would therefore
      cover our sphere with a network limiting virtually neutral grid
      zones, all giving the appearance of an immense checkerboard or an
      enormous net enveloping our entire globe. These radiations would
      partition the atmosphere and the soil.<br>
      <br>
      4. In the atmosphere, they would rise from the North-South and
      East-West divisions encountered on the ground.<br>
      <br>
      The various explanations undertaken, relating to their nature,
      conclude that they are of an electromagnetic nature.<br>
      <br>
      1. Experimentally, it can be seen that they determine, above all
      in their interlacing, an ionisation of the air which is superior
      to that found at other points. Messrs. Besnard and Lambert have
      observed this on several occasions and on different occasions,
      using a highly sensitive electrometer with gold leaf. "It is to
      this degree of maximum ionization that would be the greatest
      harm".<br>
      <br>
      2. We can not praise Dr. Larvaron for his dual merit, first of
      all, in bringing the question of harmful waves before the Faculty
      of Medicine in Paris, and then of having shown, "Peyré rays" of
      such a broad understanding. <br>
