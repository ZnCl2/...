      <br>
      Of all the plants men have ever grown, none has been praised and
      denounced as often as marijuana (Cannabis sativa). Throughout the
      ages, marijuana has been extolled as one of man's greatest
      benefactors - and cursed as one of his greatest scourges.
      Marijuana is undoubtedly a herb that has been many things to many
      people. Armies and navies have used it to make war, men and women
      to make love. Hunters and fishermen have snared the most ferocious
      creatures, from the tiger to the shark, in its herculean weave.
      Fashion designers have dresses the most elegant women in its
      supple knit. Hangmen have snapped the necks of thieves and
      murderers with its fiber. Obstetricians have eases the pain of
      childbirth with its leaves. Farmers have crushed its seeds and
      used the oil within to light their lamps. Mourners have thrown its
      seeds into blazing fires and have had their sorrow transformed
      into blissful ecstasy by the fumes that filled the air.<br>
      <br>
      Marijuana has been known by many names: hemp, hashish, dagga,
      bhang, loco weed, grass - the list is endless. Formally christened
      Cannabis sativa in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, marijuana is one of
      nature's hardiest specimens. It needs little care to thrive. One
      need not talk to it, sing to it, or play tranquil Brahms lullabies
      to coax it to grow. It is as vigorous as a weed. It is ubiquitous.
      It flourishes under nearly every possible climatic condition.<br>
      <br>
      It sprouts from the earth not meekly, not cautiously in suspense
      of where it is and what it may find, but defiantly, arrogantly,
      confident that whatever the conditions it has the stamina to
      survive.<br>
      <br>
      It is not a magnanimous herb. Plants unfortunate enough to fall in
      the shade of its serrated leaflets will find that marijuana does
      not share its sunlight. It wants it all. Marijuana also does not
      like to share its territory. It encroaches on its neighbors. Its
      roots gobble up all the nutrients in the soil, and like a vampire
      it sucks the life blood from the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Marijuana is a very rapidly growing plant, attaining a usual
      height of three to twenty feet at maturity. Five hundred years
      ago, the French author Rabelius wrote that it was "sown at the
      first coming of the swallows and pulled out of the ground when the
      cicadies began to get hoarse."<br>
      <br>
      Marijuana is dioecious, which means that there are sexually
      distinct male and female plants. At one time, farmers believed
      that only the females produced the intoxicating hashish resin. Now
      it is known that both sexes produce this gummy secretion. The
      male, however, manufactures less resin and produces flowers
      earlier than the female. To prevent a pollinating marriage,
      cannabis growers destroy these males as soon as they are detected.
      Had he known of this age-old custom, Freud might have written an
      insightful treatise on the symbolism of this bit of agricultural
      castration.<br>
      <br>
      The intoxicating resin is secreted by glandular hairs located
      around the flowers and to a certain extent in the lower portions
      of the plant. The actual substance in the resin responsible for
      the plant's inebriating effects is a chemical called
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In very hot climates, as in
      India and North Africa, so much resin is produced that the plant
      appears to be covered with a sticky dew even as it bakes under the
      parching rays of the hot sun. This resin serves as a protective
      shield preventing loss of water from the plant to the dry air. And
      of course, the more resin, the more THC likely to be present.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis seeds are brownish and rather hard. When pressed, they
      yield a yellowish-green oil once used to make soap, lamp oil,
      paint and varnish. Bird fanciers claim that hemp seed stimulates
      birds to develop superior plumage. While the seeds contain far
      less THC than the leaves or flowers, the chemical is still
      present. Although there are no reports of any birds flying into
      trees or houses after feasting on a meal of cannabis seeds, it was
      by burning these seeds and inhaling the fumes given off that some
      ancient societies first experienced cannabis's intoxicating
      powers.<br>
      <br>
      The stem of the plant is square and hollow and covered with strong
      fibers. The first step in removing these fibers is called retting
      and involves soaking the stems so that partial decomposition
      occurs. This disengages the nonfibrous tissue. The stem is then
      bent so that the fibers can separate. Once separated, they can be
      stripped away and spun into thread or twisted into cordage and
      rope.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis will grow under most conditions that will support life.
      It is inherently indestructible. Long after other species of
      plants have disappeared because of drought, infestation, or
      climatic changes, cannabis will still exist. Cannabis is one of
      nature's best examples of survival of the fittest.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the conditions under which it grows, cannabis will
      either produce more resin or more fiber. When raised in hot, dry
      climates, resin is produced in great quantities and fiber quality
      is poor. In countries with mild, humid weather, less resin is
      produced and the fiber is stronger and more durable.<br>
      <br>
      It is because of these climate-related characteristics that most
      Europeans knew very little of the intoxicating properties of the
      cannabis plant until the nineteenth century when hashish was
      imported from India and the Arab countries. Prior to this time,
      cannabis was merely a valuable source of fiber and seed oil to
      most Europeans, nothing more.<br>
      <br>
      In India, Persia, and the Arab countries, the main value of the
      plant resided in its inebriating resin. People in these countries
      were also among the first to use cannabis fiber to make nets and
      ropes. But the sticky covering on the plant was what they valued
      most, especially where alcohol was proscribed by religious
      doctrine.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on his personal interests, the cannabis farmer could
      increase his yield of fiber or resin by various measures. To
      produce a plant with a better fiber, he grew his plants very close
      to one another. This reduced the amount of sunlight falling on
      individual plants and promoted the growth of long stems and
      fibers. To obtain more resin, he sowed his seeds further apart.
      This gave each plant more sunlight and forced the plant to secrete
      more resin in order to keep itself from drying out. But regardless
      of whether he was after the fiber or the resin, male plants were
      always destroyed before they could court the females, since the
      production of seeds by the female invariably reduced the quality
      of fiber and resin.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis was harvested by various methods. If the fiber were
      primarily of interest, the stems would be cut fairly close to the
      ground with a specially designed sickle with the blade set at
      right angles to the handle.<br>
      <br>
      Harvesting the resin was a different matter. People who grew
      cannabis for personal pleasure simply snipped some leaves whenever
      the desire moved them. In countries such as Nepal where cannabis
      became part of the agricultural economy, the resin was gathered
      more systematically but in a less sanitary fashion: after the
      female plants were ripe with their sticky coverings, worke<br>
      <br>
      rs were hired to run naked through the cannabis fields. As they
      brushed against the plants, a certain amount of resin would adhere
      to their bodies. At the end of each run they would scrape the
      sticky resin from their bodies and start again. Since cannabis
      resin and water do not mix very well, the perspiration from their
      sweating bodies were shaped into bricks and readied for market.
      Buyers were rarely finicky about anything other than how
      pleasurable was the intoxication they felt when they consumed
      their purchase.<br>

          <b>I. The Early Years</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <b><br>
        1. Cannabis in the Ancient World</b><br>
      <br>
      Millions of years ago, humanoid creatures descended from the trees
      in Africa. These first men stood erect, their eyes peering into
      the beyond, their hands grasping rudimentary weapons and tools,
      ready to bend nature to their will.<br>
      <br>
      The descendants of these first men wandered into almost every
      corner of the earth and evolved into four main racial groups: the
      Negroids, Australoids, Mongoloids, and Caucasoids. Each race,
      living under different climatic conditions and in virtual
      isolation from one another, developed special physical
      characteristics to enable them to survive in their particular part
      of the world. Along with these physical traits there emerged
      rudimentary cultures as distinct as the colors of their skins.
      Some communities relied primarily on hunting for survival,
      refining their skills and weapons through the ages to capture prey
      and eventually to conquer and enslave rival communities. Others
      subsequently discovered that the seeds and leaves of certain
      plants would appease hunger and sustain life. Once they became
      farmers, men gave up their spears and knives for plowshares and
      permanent settlements came into being.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest civilizations sprouted along the banks of great
      rivers - the Hwang-Ho in China, the Indus in India, the Tigris and
      Euphrates in Mesopotamia (where biblical scholars have sought in
      vain for traces of the Garden of Eden), and the Nile in Egypt. The
      soil along these riverbanks was particularly suited for
      agriculture, being rich and deep and invigorated annually by new
      deposits of silt.<br>
      <br>
      Whether they remained hunters or became farmers, the people who
      lived long before the written word was invented, discovered
      through trial and error the best materials for shaping, molding,
      bending, twisting, and sharpening objects into tools. In each
      civilization these discoveries were much the same; the only
      differences were the materials at hand.<br>
      <br>
      On the basis of artefacts and the history of China in its later
      years, archaeologists now assure us that hemp has been a familiar
      agricultural crop in China from the remote beginnings of
      settlement in that part of the world down to our own time. When
      the Chinese went about testing materials in their environment for
      suitability as tools, they most certainly would have looked into
      the possibility of using hemp whenever they required some kind of
      fiber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cannabis in China</b><br>
      <br>
      The earliest record of man's use of cannabis comes from the island
      of Taiwan located off the coast of mainland China. In this densely
      populated part of the world, archaeologists have unearthed an
      ancient village site dating back over 10,000 years to the Stone
      Age.<br>
      <br>
      Scattered among the trash and debris from this prehistoric
      community were some broken pieces of pottery the sides of which
      had been decorated by pressing strips of cord into the wet clay
      before it hardened. Also dispersed among the pottery fragments
      were some elongated rod-shaped tools, very similar in appearance
      to those later used to loosen cannabis fibers from their stems.[1]
      These simple pots, with their patterns of twisted fiber embedded
      in their sides, suggest that men have been using the marijuana
      plant in some manner since the dawn of history.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery that twisted strands of fiber were much stronger
      than individual strands was followed by developments in the arts
      of spinning and weaving fibers into fabric - innovations that
      ended man's reliance on animal skins for clothing. Here, too, it
      was hemp fiber that the Chinese chose for their first homespun
      garments. So important a place did hemp fiber occupy in ancient
      Chinese culture that the Book of Rites (second century B.C.)
      ordained that out of respect for the dead, mourners should wear
      clothes made from hemp fabric, a custom followed down to modern
      times.[2]<br>
      <br>
      While traces of early Chinese fabrics have all but disappeared, in
      1972 an ancient burial site dating back to the Chou dynasty
      (1122-249 B.C.) was discovered. In it were fragments of cloth,
      some bronze containers, weapons, and pieces of jade. Inspection of
      the cloth showed it to be made of hemp, making this the oldest
      preserved specimen of hemp in existence.[3]<br>
      <br>
      The ancient Chinese not only wove their clothes from hemp, they
      also used the sturdy fiber to manufacture shoes. In fact, hemp was
      so highly regarded by the Chinese that they called their country
      the "land of mulberry and hemp".<br>
      <br>
      The mulberry plant was venerated because it was the food upon
      which silkworms fed, and silk was one of China's most important
      products. But silk was very expensive and only the very wealthy
      could afford silken fabric. For the vast millions of less
      fortunate, cheaper material had to be found. Such material was
      typically hemp.<br>
      <br>
      Ancient Chinese manuscripts are filled with passages urging the
      people to plant hemp so that they will have clothes.[4] A book of
      ancient poetry mentions the spinning of hempen threads by a young
      girl.[5] The Shu King, a book which dates back to about 2350 B.C.,
      says that in the province of Shantung the soil was "whitish and
      rich...with silk, hemp, lead, pine trees and strange stones..."
      and that hemp was among the articles of tribute extorted from
      inhabitants of the valley of the Honan.[6]<br>
      <br>
      During the ninth century B.C., "female man-barbarians," an
      Amazon-like dynasty of female warriors from Indochina, offered the
      Chinese emperor a "luminous sunset-clouds brocade" fashioned from
      hemp, as tribute. According to the court transcriber, it was
      "shining and radiant, infecting men with its sweet smelling aroma.
      With this, and the intermingling of the five colors in it, it was
      more ravishingly beautiful than the brocades of our central
      states."[7]<br>
      <br>
      Ma, the Chinese word for hemp, is composed of two symbols which
      are meant to depict hemp. The part beneath and to the right of the
      straight lines represent hemp fibers dangling from a rack. The
      horizontal and vertical lines represent the home in which they
      were drying.<br>
      <br>
      As they became more familiar with the plant, the Chinese
      discovered it was dioecious. Male plants were then clearly
      distinguished from females by name (hsi for the male, chu for the
      female). The Chinese also recognised that the male plants produced
      a better fiber than the female, whereas the female produced the
      better seeds.[8] (Although hemp seed was a major grain crop in
      ancient China until the sixth century A.D.,[9] it was not as
      important a food grain as rice or mullet.[10])<br>
      <br>
      Hemp fiber was also once a factor in the wars waged by Chinese
      land barons. Initially, Chinese archers fashioned their bowstrings
      from bamboo fibers. When hemp's greater strength and durability
      were discovered, bamboo strings were replaced with those made from
      hemp. Equipped with these superior bowstrings, archers could send
      their arrows further and with greater force. Enemy archers, whose
      weapons were made from inferior bamboo, were at a considerable
      disadvantage. With ineffectual archers, armies were vulnerable to
      attack at distances from which they could not effectively return
      the hail of deadly missiles that rained upon them. So important
      was the hemp bowstring that Chinese monarchs of old set aside
      large portions of land exclusively for hemp, the first
      agricultural war crop.[11]<br>
      <br>
      In fact, every canton in ancient China grew hemp. Typically, each
      canton tried to be self-sufficient and grow everything it needed
      to support its own needs. When it couldn't raise something itself,
      it grew crops or manufactured materials that it could trade for
      essential goods. Accordingly, crops were planted around homes not
      only because of the suitability of the land, but also because of
      their commercial value. The closer to the home, the greater a
      crop's value.<br>
      <br>
      Because food was essential, millet and rice were grown wherever
      land and water were available. Next came vegetable gardens and
      orchards, and beyond them the textile plants, chiefly hemp.[12]
      Next came the cereals and vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      After the hemp was harvested by the men, the women, who were the
      weavers, manufactured clothes from the fibers for the family.
      After the family's needs were satisfied, other garments were
      produced for sale. To support their families, weaving began in
      autumn and lasted all winter.[13]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Invention of Paper</b><br>
      <br>
      Among the many important inventions credited to the Chinese, paper
      must surely rank at the very top. Without paper, the progress of
      civilization would have advanced at a snail's pace. Mass
      production of newspapers, magazines, books, notepaper, etc, would
      all be impossible. Business and industry would come to a
      standstill without paper to record transactions, keep track of
      inventories, and make payments of large sums of money. Nearly
      every activity we now take for granted would be a monumental
      undertaking were it not for paper.<br>
      <br>
      According to Chinese legend, the paper-making process was invented
      by a minor court official, Ts'ai Lun, in A.D. 105. Prior to that
      time, the Chinese carved their writings onto bamboo slips and
      wooden tablets. Before the invention of paper, Chinese scholars
      had to be physically fit if they wished to devote their lives to
      learning. When philosopher Me Ti moved around the country, for
      example, he took a minimum of three cartloads of books with him.
      Emperor Ts'in Shih Huagn, a particularly conscientious ruler,
      waded through 120 pounds of state documents a day in looking after
      his administrative duties![14] Without some less weighty writing
      medium, Chinese scholars and statesmen could look forward to at
      least one hernia if they were any good at their jobs.<br>
      <br>
      As a first alternative to these cumbersome tablets, the Chinese
      painted their words on silk fabric with brushes. But silk was very
      expensive. A thousand silkworms working day in and day out were
      needed to produce the silk for a simple "thank you" note.<br>
      <br>
      Ts'ai Lun had a better idea. Why not make a table out of fiber?
      But how? Producing writing tablets the way clothes were
      manufactured, by patiently intermingling individual fibers was not
      practical. There had to be some other way to get the fibers to mix
      with one another in a lattice structure that would be sturdy
      enough not to fall apart.<br>
      <br>
      No one knows how Ts'ai Lun finally discovered the secret of
      manufacturing paper from fiber. Perhaps it was a case of trial and
      error. However, the method he finally devised involved crushing
      hemp fibers and mulberry tree bark into a pulp and placing the
      mixture in a tank of water. Eventually, the fibers rose to the top
      all tangled together. Portions of this flotsam were then removed
      and placed in a mold. When dried in such molds, the fibers formed
      into sheets which could then be written on.<br>
      <br>
      When Ts'ai Lun first presented his invention to China's arm-weary
      bureaucrats, he thought they would react to it with great
      enthusiasm. Instead, he was jeered out of court. Since no one at
      court was willing to recognize the importance of paper, Ts'ai Lun
      decided that the only way to convince people of its value was
      through trickery. He would use paper, he told all who would
      listen, to bring back the dead!<br>
      <br>
      With the help of some friends, Ts'ai Lun feigned death and had
      himself buried alive in a coffin. Unknown to most of those who
      witnessed the internment, the coffin contained a small hole;
      through it, a hollow bamboo shoot had been inserted, to provide
      the trickster an air supply.<br>
      <br>
      While his family and friends mourned his death, Ts'ai Lun
      patiently rested in his coffin below the earth. Then, some time
      later, his conspirators announced that if some of the paper
      invented by the dead man were burned, he would rise from the dead
      and once again take his place among the living. Although highly
      sceptical, the mourners wished to give the departed every chance,
      so they set a sizable quantity of paper ablaze. When the
      conspirators felt that they had generated enough suspense, they
      exhumed the coffin and ripped of the cover. To the shock and
      amazement of all present, Ts'ai Lun sat up and thanked them for
      their devotion to him and their faith in his invention.<br>
      <br>
      The resurrection was regarded as a miracle, the power of which was
      attributed to the magic of paper. So great an impression did the
      Houdini-like escape create that shortly thereafter the Chinese
      adopted the custom, which they still follow to this day, of
      burning paper over graves of the dead.<br>
      <br>
      Ts'ai Lun himself became an overnight celebrity. His invention was
      accorded the recognition it deserved and the inventor was
      appointed to an important position at court. But his fame was his
      undoing. As the new darling at court, rival factions sought to win
      him over to their side in the never-ending squabbles of life among
      the rich and powerful. Without meaning to, Ts'ai Lun became
      embroiled in a power battle between the empress and the emperor's
      grandmother. Court intrigue was simply too much for the inventor,
      and when he was subsequently summoned to give an account of
      himself, instead of appearing before his inquisitors, his
      biography states that he went home, took a bath, combed his hair,
      put on his best robes, and drank poison.[15]<br>
      <br>
      Although entertaining, the story of Ts'ai Lun's invention is
      apocryphal. The discovery of fragments of paper containing hemp
      fiber in a grave in China dating back to the first century B.C.,
      puts the invention long before the time of Ts'ai Lun. Why Ts'ai
      Lun was given credit for the invention, however, is still a
      mystery.<br>
      <br>
      The Chinese kept the secret of paper hidden for many centuries,
      but eventually it became known to the Japanese. In a small book
      entitled A Handy Guide to Papermaking, dating back to the fifth
      century A.D., the author states that "hemp and mulberry... have
      long been used in worshipping the gods. The business of paper
      making therefore, is no ignoble calling."[16]<br>
      <br>
      It was not until the ninth century A.D. that the Arabs, and
      through them the rest of the world, learned how to manufacture
      paper. The events that led to the disclosure of the paper-making
      process are somewhat uncertain, but apparently the secret was
      pried from some Chinese prisoners captured by the Arabs during the
      Battle of Samarkand (in present-day Russia).<br>
      <br>
      Once the Arabs learned the secret, they began producing their own
      paper. By the twelfth century A.D., paper mills were operating in
      the Moorish cities of Valencia, Toledo, and Xativa, in Spain.
      After the ousting of the Arabs from Spain, the art became known to
      the rest of Europe, and it was not long before paper mills were
      flourishing not only in Spain, but in France, Italy, Germany, and
      England, all of them using the ancient Chinese system "invented"
      by Ts'ai Lun.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Magical Marijuana</b><br>
      <br>
      During the course of its long history in China, hemp found its way
      into almost every nook and cranny of Chinese life. It clothed the
      Chinese from their heads to their feet, it gave them material to
      write on, and it became a symbol of power over evil.<br>
      <br>
      Like the practice of medicine around the world, early Chinese
      doctoring was based on the concept of demons. If a person were
      ill, it was because some demon had invaded his body. The only way
      to cure him was to drive the demon out. The early priest-doctors
      resorted to all kinds of tricks, some of which were rather
      sophisticated, like drug therapy, which we will examine shortly.
      Other methods involved outright magic. By means of charms,
      amulets, spells, incantations, exhortations, sacrifices, etc., the
      priest-doctor did his utmost to find some way of getting the upper
      hand over the malevolent demon believed responsible for an
      illness.<br>
      <br>
      Among the weapons to come out of the magical kit bag of the
      ancient Chinese conjurers were cannabis stalks into which
      snake-like figures were carved. Armed with these war hammers, they
      went to do battle with the unseen enemy on his home ground - the
      sickbed. Standing over the body of the stricken patient, his
      cannabis stalk poised to strike, the priest pounded the bed and
      commanded the demon to be gone. If the illness were psychosomatic
      and the patient had faith in the conjurer, he occasionally
      recovered. If his problem were organic, he rarely improved.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the outcome, the rite itself is intriguing. Although
      there is no way of knowing for sure how it came about, the Chinese
      tell a story about one of their emperors named Liu Chi-nu that may
      explain the connection between cannabis, snakes, and illness. One
      day Liu was out in the fields cutting down some hemp, when he saw
      a snake. Taking no chances that it might bite him, he shot the
      serpent with an arrow. The next day he returned to the place and
      heard the sound of a mortar and pestle. Tracking down the noise,
      he found two boys grinding marijuana leaves. When he asked them
      what they were doing, the boys told him they were preparing a
      medicine to give to their master who had been wounded by an arrow
      shot by Liu Chi-nu. Liu Chi-nu then asked what the boys would do
      to Liu Chi-nu if they ever found him. Suprisingly, the boys
      answered that they could not take revenge on him because Liu
      Chi-nu was destined to become emperor of China. Liu berated the
      boys for their foolishness and they ran away, leaving behind the
      medicine. Some time later Liu himself was injured and he applied
      the crushed marijuana leaves to his wound. The medicine healed him
      and Liu subsequently announced his discovery to the people of
      China and they began using it for their injuries.<br>
      <br>
      Another story tells of a farmer who saw a snake carrying some
      marijuana leaves to place on the wound of another snake. The next
      day the wounded snake was healed. Intrigued, the farmer tested the
      plant on his own wound and was cured.[17]<br>
      <br>
      Whether these stories had anything to do with the idea that
      marijuana had magical power or not, the fact is that despite the
      progress of Chinese medicine far beyond the age of superstition,
      the practice of striking beds with stalks made from marijuana
      stems continued to be followed until the Middle Ages.[18]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal Marijuana</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although the Chinese continued to rely on magic in the fight
      against disease, they also gradually developed an appreciation and
      knowledge of the curative powers of medicines. The person who is
      generally credited with teaching the Chinese about medicines and
      their actions is a legendary emperor, Shen-Nung, who lived around
      the twenty-eighth century B.C.<br>
      <br>
      Concerned that his priests were suffering from illness despite the
      magical rites of the priests, Shen-Nung determined to find an
      alternate means of relieving the sick. Since he was also an expert
      farmer and had a thorough familiarity with plants, he decided to
      explore the curative powers of China's plant life first. In this
      search for compounds that might help his people, Shen-Nung used
      himself as a guinea-pig. The emperor could not have chosen a
      better subject since he was said to possess the remarkable ability
      of being able to see through his abdominal wall into his stomach!
      Such transparency enabled him to observe at firsthand the workings
      of a particular drug on that part of the body.<br>
      <br>
      According to the stories told about him, Shen-Nung ingested as
      many as seventy different poisons in a single day and discovered
      the antidotes for each of them. After he finished these
      experiments, he wrote the Pen Ts'ao, a kind of herbal or Materia
      Medica as it later became known, which listed hundreds of drugs
      derived from vegetable, animal, and mineral sources.<br>
      <br>
      Although there may originally have been an ancient Pen Ts'ao
      attributed to the emperor, no original text exists. The oldest Pen
      Ts'ao dates back to the first century A.D. and was compiled by an
      unknown author who claimed he had incorporated the original herbal
      into his own compendium. Regardless of whether such an earlier
      compendium did or did not exist, the important fact about this
      first-century herbal is that it contains a reference to ma, the
      Chinese word for cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      Ma was a very popular drug, the text notes, since it possessed
      both yin and yang. The concepts of yin and yang that pervade early
      Chinese medicine are attributed to another legendary emperor, Fu
      Hsi (ca, 2900 B.C.) whom the Chinese credit with bringing
      civilization to the "land of mulberry and hemp". Before Fu Hsi, so
      the legends say, the Chinese lived like animals. They had no laws,
      no customs, and no traditions. There was no family life. Men and
      women came together instinctively, like salmon seeking their
      breeding ground; they mated, and then went off on their separate
      ways.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing Fu Hsi did to produce order out of chaos was to
      establish matrimony on a permanent basis. The second thing was to
      separate all living things into the male and female principle -
      the male incorporating all that was positive, the female embodying
      all that was negative. From this dualistic principle arose the
      concept of two opposing forces, the yin and the yang.<br>
      <br>
      Yin symbolized the weal, passive, and negative feminine influence
      in nature, whereas yang represented the strong, active, and
      positive masculine force. When these forces were in balance, the
      body was healthy. When one force dominated the other, the body was
      in an unhealthy condition. Marijuana was thus a very difficult
      drug to contend with because it contained both the feminine yin
      and the masculine yang.<br>
      <br>
      Shen-Nung's solution to the problem was to advise that yin, the
      female plant, be the only sex cultivated in China since it
      produced much more of the medicinal principle than yang, the male
      plant. Marijuana containing yin was then to be given in cases
      involving a loss of yin from the body such as occurred in female
      weakness (menstrual fatigue), gout, rheumatism, malaria,
      beri-beri, constipation, and absentmindedness.<br>
      <br>
      The Pen Ts'au eventually became the standard manual on drugs in
      China, and so highly regarded was its author that Shen-Nung was
      accorded the singular honour of deification and the title of
      Father of Chinese Medicine. Not too long ago China's drug guilds
      still paid homage to the memory of Shen-Nung. On the first and
      fifteenth of each month, many drugstores offered a 10 percent
      discount on medicines in honor of the legendary patron of the
      healing arts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Painless Surgery</b><br>
      <br>
      As physicians became more and more familiar with the properties of
      drugs, ma continued to increase in importance as a therapeutic
      agent. In the second century A.D., a new use was found for the
      drug. This discovery was credited to the famous Chinese surgeon
      Hua T'o, who is said to have performed extremely complicated
      surgical procedures without causing pain. Among the amazing
      operations he performed are organ grafts, resectioning of
      intestines, laparotomies (incisions into the loin), and
      thoracotomies (incisions into the chest). All these difficult
      surgical procedures were said to have been rendered painless by
      means of ma-yo, an anaesthetic made from cannabis resin and wine.
      The following passage, taken from his biography, describes his use
      of cannabis in these operations:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the malady resided in the parts on which
      the needle [acupuncture], cautery, or medicinal liquids were
      incapable of acting, for example, in the bones, in the stomach or
      in the intestine, he administered a preparation of hemp [ma-yo]
      and, in the course of several minutes, an insensibility developed
      as if one had been plunged into drunkenness or deprived of life.
      Then, according to the case, he performed the opening, the
      incision or the amputation and relieved the cause of the malady;
      then he apposed the tissues by sutures and applied linaments.
      After a certain number of days the patient finds he has recovered
      without having experienced the slightest pain during the
      operation.[19]<br>
      <br>
      Although modern research has borne out marijuana's anaesthetic
      properties and has shown that alcohol does indeed augment many of
      marijuana's actions, it is unlikely that Hua T'o could have
      produced total insensibility to pain by the combination of these
      drugs unless he administered so much of them that his patients
      lost consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      While ma's stature as a medicinal agent began to decline around
      the fifth century A.D., it still had its advocates long into the
      Middle Ages. In the tenth century A.D., for example, some Chinese
      physicians claimed the drug was useful in the treatment of "waste
      diseases and injuries", adding that it "clears blood and cools
      temperature, it relieves fluxes; it undoes rheumatism; it
      discharges pus".[20]<br>
      <br>
      <b>An Early Psychedelic</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Since the Chinese are the first people on record to use the
      marijuana plant for their clothes, their writing materials, their
      confrontation with evil spirits, and in their treatment of pain
      and disease, it is not surprising that they are also the first
      people on record to experience marijuana's peculiar psychedelic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      As so many other testimonials to marijuana's multifaceted past
      have been found interred deep within the bowels of the earth, so
      too was the proof of China's early flirtation with marijuana's
      intoxicating chemistry found buried away in an ancient tomb.
      Rather than any piece of cloth or handful of seeds, however, the
      evidence takes the form of an inscription containing the symbol
      for marijuana, along with the adjective or connotation meaning
      "negative".[21]<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, we will never know what the gravediggers had in
      mind when they were chiselling these words in granite. Was it just
      a mindless piece of graffiti? Even if it were, it indicates that
      the Chinese were well aware of marijuana's unusual properties from
      very ancient times, whether they approved of them or not.<br>
      <br>
      Many did not approve. Due to the growing spirit of Taoism which
      began to permeate China around 600 B.C., marijuana intoxication
      was viewed with special disdain. Taoism was essentially a "back to
      nature" philosophy which sought ways of extending life. Anything
      that contained yin, such as marijuana, was therefore regarded with
      contempt since it enfeebled the body when eaten. Only substances
      filled with yang, the invigorating principle in nature, were
      looked upon favorably.<br>
      <br>
      Some Chinese denounced marijuana as the "liberator of sin".[22] A
      late edition of the Pen Ts'au asserted that if too many marijuana
      seeds were eaten, they would cause one to "see demons". But if
      taken over a long time, "one can communicate with the
      spirits".[23]<br>
      <br>
      However, by the first century A.D., Taoists became interested in
      magic and alchemy,[24] and were recommending addition of cannabis
      seeds to their incense burners. The hallucinations thus produced
      were highly valued as a means of achieving immortality.[25]<br>
      <br>
      For some people, seeing spirits was the main reason for using
      cannabis. Meng Shen, a seventh-century physician, adds, however,
      that if anyone wanted to see spirits in this way, he would have to
      eat cannabis seeds for at least a hundred days.[26]<br>
      <br>
      The Chinese have always been a highly reserved people, a nation
      rarely given to excesses. Temperance and restraint are cherished
      virtues of their society. But these are ideal traits, not always
      easy to live up to. And on more than one occasion, the waywardness
      of segments of the Chinese population was denounced by the
      authorities.<br>
      <br>
      In a book attributed to Shen-Nung's successor, the "yellow
      emperor", for example, the author felt that alcoholism had truly
      gotten out of hand:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays people use wine as a beverage and they
      adopt recklessness as usual behaviour. They enter the chamber of
      love in an intoxicated condition; their passions exhaust their
      vital forces; their cravings dissipate their essence; they do not
      know how to find contentment with themselves; they are not skilled
      in the control of their spirits. They devote all their attention
      to the amusement of their minds, thus cutting themselves off from
      the joys of long life. Their rising and retiring is without
      regularity. For these reasons they reach only one half of the
      hundred years and then they degenerate.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Alcohol, in fact, was a much more serious problem in China than
      marijuana, and opium overshadowed both in the attention it later
      received. The Chinese experiment with marijuana as a psychoactive
      agent was really more of a flirtation than an orgy. Those among
      the Chinese who hailed it as the "giver of delight" never amounted
      to more than a small segment of the population.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Japan</b><br>
      <br>
      As in China, hemp fiber was highly regarded among the Japanese and
      figured prominently in their everyday lives and legends.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp (asa) was the primary material in Japanese clothes, bedding,
      mats and nets. Clothes made of hemp fiber were especially worn
      during formal and religious ceremonies because of hemp's
      traditional association with purity in Japan.[28] So fundamental
      was hemp in Japanese life that it was often mentioned in legends
      explaining the origins of everyday things, such as how the
      Japanese earthworm came to have white rings around its neck.<br>
      <br>
      According to Japanese legend, there were once two women who were
      both fine weavers of hemp fiber. One woman made fine hemp fabric
      but was a very slow worker. Her neighbor was just the opposite -
      she made coarse fabric but worked quickly. During market days,
      which were held only periodically, it was customary for Japanese
      women to dress in their best clothes, and as the day approached,
      the two women began to weave new dresses for the occasion. The
      woman who worked quickly had her dress ready on time, but it was
      not very fashionable. Her neighbor, who worked slowly, only
      managed to get the unbleached white strands ready, and when market
      day came, she didn't have her dress ready. Since she had to go to
      market, she persuaded her husband to carry her in a large jar on
      his back so that only her neck, with the white undyed hemp strands
      around it would be visible. In this way, everyone would think she
      was clothed instead of being naked inside the jar. On the way to
      the market, the woman in the jar saw her neighbor and started
      making fun of her coarse dress. The neighbor shot back that at
      least she was clothed. "Break the jar", she told everyone who
      could hear, "and you will find a naked woman". The husband became
      so mortified that he dropped the jar, which broke, revealing his
      naked wife, clothed only in hemp strands around her neck. The
      woman was so ashamed as she stood naked before everyone that she
      buried herself in the earth so that she would not be seen and she
      turned into an earthworm. And that, according to the Japanese, is
      why the earthworm has white rings around its neck.[29]<br>
      <br>
      Hemp fiber also played a part in love and marital life in Japan.
      Another ancient Japanese legend tells of a soldier who had been
      romancing a young girl and was about to bid her farewell without
      giving her as much as his name, rank, or regiment. But the girl
      was not about to be jilted by this handsome and charming paramour.
      Unbeknownst to her mysterious lover, she fastened the end of a
      huge ball of hemp rope to his clothing as he kissed her farewell.
      By following the thread, she eventually came to the temple of the
      god Miva, and discovered that her suitor had been none other than
      the god himself.[30]<br>
      <br>
      Besides its roles in such legends, hemp strands were an integral
      part of Japanese love and marriage. Hemp strands were often hung
      on trees as charms to bind lovers[31] (as in the legend), gifts of
      hemp were sent as wedding gifts by the man's family to the
      prospective bride's family as a sign that they were accepting the
      girl,[32] and hemp strands were prominently displayed during
      wedding ceremonies to symbolize the traditional obedience of
      Japanese wives to their husbands.[33] The basis of the latter
      tradition was the ease with which hemp could be dyed. Just as hemp
      could be dyed to any color, so too, according to an ancient
      Japanese saying, must wives be willing to be "dyed in any color
      their husbands may choose".[34]<br>
      <br>
      Yet another use of hemp in Japan was in ceremonial purification
      rites for driving away evil spirits. As already mentioned, in
      China evil spirits were banished from the bodies of the sick by
      banging rods made from hemp against the head of the sickbed. In
      Japan, Shinto priests performed a similar rite with a gohei, a
      short stick with undyed hemp fibers (for purity) attached to one
      end. According to Shinto beliefs, evil and impurity cannot exist
      alongside one another, and so, by waving the gohei (purity) above
      someone's head the evil spirit inside him would be driven
      away.[35]<br>
      <br>
      <b>India: The First Marijuana-Oriented Culture</b><br>
      <br>
      India has known little peace. Invaded from both land and sea, it
      has seen many conquerors and has witnessed many empires come and
      go. Cyrus and Darius of Persia sent their armies there. On the
      heels of the Persians came Alexander the Great. After Alexander
      came more Greeks, then Parthians from Iran, Kushans from beyond
      the mountains in the north, then Arabs, followed by Europeans.
      Unlike China, which remained remote and isolated from the rest of
      the world for much of its history. India was known to all the
      great nations of the ancient world.<br>
      <br>
      Although the inhabitants of India are descended from a people
      known as the Aryans or "noble ones", the Aryans were not the
      original natives of the Indian subcontinent but instead invaded it
      from north of the Himalayas around 2000 B.C. Before the Aryans,
      who were light-skinned and blue-eyed, a dark-skinned and dark-eyed
      people, Australoid in origin, inhabited India. When the Aryans
      entered the country, they found a complex civilization, including
      well-designed housing, adjoining toilet facilities, and advanced
      drainage systems. The early inhabitants worked with gold and
      silver, and they also knew how to fashion tools and ornaments from
      copper and iron.<br>
      <br>
      When the Aryans first settled in India they were predominantly a
      nomadic people. During the centuries that followed their invasion,
      they intermarried with the original inhabitants, became farmers,
      and invented Sanskrit, one of man's earliest written languages.<br>
      <br>
      A collection of four holy books, called the Vedas, tells of daring
      exploits, their chariot battles, conquests, subjugation of enemy
      armies, eventual settlement in the land of the Indus, and even how
      their god Siva brought the marijuana plant down from the Himalayas
      for their use and enjoyment.<br>
      <br>
      According to one of their legends, Siva became enraged over some
      family squabble and went off by himself in the fields. There, the
      cool shade of a tall marijuana plant brought him a comforting
      refuge from the torrid rays of the blazing sun. Curious about this
      plant that sheltered him from the heat of the day, he ate some of
      its leaves and felt so refreshed that he adopted it as his
      favorite food, hence his title, the Lord of Bhang.<br>
      <br>
      Bhang does not always refer to the plant itself but rather to a
      mild liquid refreshment made with its leaves, and somewhat similar
      in potency to the marijuana used in America.<br>
      <br>
      Among the ingredients and proportions of them that went into a
      formula for bhang around the turn of the century were:<br>

      Two other concoctions made from cannabis in India are ganja and
      charas. Ganja is prepared from the flowers and upper leaves and is
      more potent than bhang. Charas, the most potent of the three
      preparations, is made from flowers in the height of their bloom.
      Charas contains a relatively large amount of resin and is roughly
      similar in strength to hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Bhang was and still is to India what alcohol is to the West. Many
      social and religious gatherings in ancient times, as well as
      present, were simply incomplete unless bhang was part of the
      occasion. It is said that those who spoke derisively of bhang are
      doomed to suffer the torments of hell as long as the sun shines in
      the heavens.<br>
      <br>
      Without bhang at special festivities like a wedding, evil spirits
      were believed to hover over the bride and groom, waiting for an
      opportune moment to wreak havoc on the newlyweds. Any father who
      failed to send or bring bhang to the ceremonies would be reviled
      and cursed as if he had deliberately invoked the evil eye on his
      son and daughter.<br>
      <br>
      Bhang was also a symbol of hospitality. A host would offer a cup
      of bhang to a guest as casually as we would offer someone in our
      home a glass of beer. A host who failed to make such a gesture was
      despised as being miserly and misanthropic.<br>
      <br>
      War was another occasion in which bhang and more potent
      preparations like ganja were often resorted to. Indian folksongs
      dating back to the twelfth century A.D. mention ganja as a drink
      of warriors. Just as soldiers sometimes take a swig of whiskey
      before going into battle in modern warfare, during the Middle Ages
      in India, warriors routinely drank a small amount of bhang or
      ganja to assuage any feelings of panic, a custom that earned bhang
      the cognomen of vijaya, "victorious" or "unconquerable".[37]<br>
      <br>
      A story is told of a guru named Gobind Singh, the founder of the
      Sikh religion, which alludes to bhang's usage in battle. During a
      critical skirmish in which he was leading the troops, Gobind
      Singh's soldiers were suddenly thrown into a panic at the sight of
      an elephant bearing down on them with a sword in its trunk. As the
      beast slashed its way through Gobind Singh's lines, his men
      appeared on the verge of breaking rank. Something had to be done
      to prevent a disastrous rout. A volunteer was needed, a man
      willing to risk certain death to accomplish the impossible task of
      slaying an elephant. There was no shortage of men to step forward.
      Gobind Singh did not take time to pick and choose. To the man
      closest to him he gave some bhang and a little opium, and then
      watched as the man went out to kill the elephant. Fortified by the
      drug the loyal soldier rushed headlong into the thick of battle
      and charged the sword-wielding elephant. Deftly evading the
      slashing blows that could easily have severed his body in two, he
      managed to slip under the elephant and with all his strength he
      plunged his own weapon into the unprotected belly of the beast.
      When Gobind Singh's men saw the elephant lying dead in the field,
      they rallied and soon overpowered the enemy. From that time forth,
      the Sikhs commemorated the anniversary of that great battle by
      drinking bhang.<br>
      <br>
      <b>"To the Hindu the Hemp Plant Is Holy"</b><br>
      <br>
      The earliest allusion to bhang's mind-altering influence is
      contained in the fourth book of the Vedas, the Atharvaveda
      ("Science of Charms"). Written some time between 2000 and 1400
      B.C., the Atharvaveda (12:6.15) calls bhang one of the "five
      kingdoms of herbs... which release us from anxiety." But it is not
      until much later in India's history that bhang became a part of
      everyday life. By the tenth century A.D., for example, it was just
      beginning to be extolled as a indracanna, the "food of the gods".
      A fifteenth-century document refers to it as "light-hearted",
      "joyful", and "rejoices", and claims that among its virtues are
      "astringency", "heat", "speech-giving", "inspiration of mental
      powers", "excitability", and the capacity to "remove wind and
      phlegm".[38]<br>
      <br>
      By the sixteenth century A.D., it found its way into India's
      popular literature. The Dhurtasamagama, or "Rogue's Congress", a
      light farce written to amuse audiences, has two beggars come
      before an unscrupulous judge asking for a decision on a quarrel
      concerning a maiden at the bazaar. Before he will render his
      decision, however, the judge demands payment for his arbitration,
      In response to this demand, one of the beggars offers some bhang.
      The judge readily accepts and, tasting it, declares that "it
      produces a healthy appetite, sharpens the wits, and acts as an
      aphrodisiac".[39]<br>
      <br>
      In the Rajvallabha, a seventeenth-century text dealing with drugs
      used in India, bhang is described as follows:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India's food is acid, produces infatuation, and
      destroys leprosy. It creates vital energy, increases mental powers
      and internal heat, corrects irregularities of the phlegmatic
      humor, and is an elixir vitae. It was originally produced like
      nectar from the ocean by churning it with Mount Mandara. Inasmuch
      as it is believed to give victory in the three worlds and to bring
      delight to the king of the gods (Siva), it was called vijaya
      (victorious). This desire-filling drug was believed to have been
      obtained by men on earth for the welfare of all people. To those
      who use it regularly, it begets joy and diminishes anxiety.[40]<br>
      <br>
      Yet it was not as a medicinal aid or as a social lubricant that
      bhang was preeminent among the people of India. Rather, it was and
      still is because of its association with the religious life of the
      country that bhang is so extolled and glorified. The stupefaction
      produced by the plant's resin is greatly valued by the fakirs and
      ascetics, the holy men of India, because they believe that
      communication with their deities is greatly facilitated during
      intoxication with bhang. (According to one legend, the Buddha
      subsisted on a daily ration of one cannabis seed, and nothing
      else, during his six years of asceticism.[41]) Taken in early
      morning, the drug is believed to cleanse the body of sin. Like the
      communion of Christianity, the devotee who partakes of bhang
      partakes of the god Siva.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis also held a preeminent place in the Tantric religion
      which evolved in Tibet in the seventh century A.D. out of an
      amalgam of Buddhism and local religion.[42] The priests of this
      religion were wizards known as lamas ("superiors"). The high
      priest was called the Dalai Lama ("mighty superior").<br>
      <br>
      Tantrism, a word that means "that which is woven together", was a
      religion based on fear of demons. To combat the demonic threat to
      the world, the people sought protection in the spells,
      incantations, formulas (mantras), and exorcisms of their lamas,
      and in plants such as cannabis which were set afire to overcome
      evil forces.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis was also an important part of the Tantric religious yoga
      sex acts consecrated to the goddess Kali. During the ritual, about
      an hour and a half prior to intercourse the devotee placed a bowl
      of bhang before him and uttered the mantra: "Om hrim, O
      ambrosia-formed goddess [Kali] who has arisen from ambrosia, who
      showers ambrosia, bring me ambrosia again and again, bestow occult
      power [siddhi] and bring my chosen deity to my power."[43] Then,
      after uttering several other mantras, he drank the potion. The
      delay between drinking the bhang and the sex act was to allow the
      drug time to act so that it would heighten the senses and thereby
      increase the feeling of oneness with the goddess.[44]<br>
      <br>
      At the turn of the twentieth century, the Indian Hemp Drugs
      Commission, which had been summoned in the 1890s to investigate
      the use of cannabis in India, concluded that the plant was so much
      an integral part of the culture and religion of that country that
      to curtail its usage would certainly lead to unhappiness,
      resentment, and suffering. Their conclusions:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian
      lives in the bhang leaf... To see in a dream the leaves, plant, or
      water of bhang is lucky... No good thing can come to the man who
      treads underfoot the holy bhang leaf. A longing for bhang
      foretells happiness.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Besides as a cure for fever, bhang has many
      medicinal virtues... It cures dysentry and sunstroke, clears
      phlegm, quickens digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tongue of
      the lisper plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to
      the body and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful
      ends for which in his goodness the Almighty made bhang... It is
      inevitable that temperaments should be found to whom the
      quickening spirit of bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge.
      In the ecstasy of bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into
      light the murkiness of matter... Bhang is the Joygiver, the
      Skyflier, the Heavenly-guide, the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother
      of Grief... No god or man is as good as the religious drinker of
      bhang... The supporting power of bhang has brought many has
      brought many a Hindu family safe through the miseries of famine.
      To forbid or even seriously to restrict the use of so holy and
      gracious an herb as the hemp would cause widespread suffering and
      annoyance and to large bands of worshipped ascetics, deep-seated
      anger. It would rob the people of a solace in discomfort, of a
      cure in sickness, of a guardian whose gracious protection saves
      them from the attacks of evil influences... So grand a result, so
      tiny a sin![45]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Persia</b><br>
      <br>
      India was not the only country to be invaded by the Aryans. By
      1500 B.C., Persia, Asia Minor, and Greece had been overrun and the
      Aryans were establishing permanent settlements as far west as
      France and Germany. Although the people who settled in these
      countries eventually developed into different nationalities, with
      different customs and traditions, their common Aryan ancestry can
      still be traced in their languages which collectively are called
      Indo-European. For example, the linguistic root an, which is found
      in various cannabis-related words, can be found in French in the
      word chanvre and in the German hanf. Our own word cannabis is
      taken directly from the Greek, which in turn is taken from canna,
      an early Sanskrit term.<br>
      <br>
      When the Aryans first settled in Persia (modern-day Iran, "the
      land of the Aryans"), they separated into two kingdoms - Medea and
      Parsa (Persia). Four centuries later, Cyrus the Great, the ruler
      of Parsa, unified the country, and with the combined forces of the
      Medes and Parsa behind him, he led his armies eastward and
      westward. By 546 B.C., the Persian or Achaemenid Empire as it was
      called (from Achaemenes, Cyrus' ancestor), reached from Palestine
      to India. Twenty years later, the Persians defeated Egypt and
      extended their control over that great kingdom as well.<br>
      <br>
      It was not until 331 B.C. that the Persian empire finally
      collapsed; its nemesis - the Greeks and their brilliant leader -
      Alexander the Great.<br>
      <br>
      The Aryans who settled in Persia came from the same area in
      central Russia as their cousins who invaded India, so it is hardly
      surprising that the Persian word bhanga is almost identical to the
      Indian term bhang.<br>
      <br>
      The Zend-Avesta is the Persian counterpart to the Vedas. However,
      unlike the Vedas, many of the books that were once a part of the
      Zend-Avesta have disappeared. The book itself was said to have
      been written by the Persian prophet Zoroaster, around the seventh
      century B.C., and reputedly was transcribed on no fewer than 1200
      cowhides containing approximately two million verses!<br>
      <br>
      Professor Mirceau Eliade, perhaps the world's foremost authority
      on the history of religions, has suggested that Zoroaster himself
      may have been a user of bhanga and may have relied on its
      intoxication to bridge the metaphysical gap between heaven and
      earth.[46] One of the few surviving books of the Zend-Avesta,
      called the Vendidad, "The Law Against Demons", in fact calls
      bhanga Zoroaster's "good narcotic",[47] and tells of two mortals
      who were transported in soul to the heavens where, upon drinking
      from a cup of bhanga, they had the highest mysteries revealed to
      them.<br>
      <br>
      The Vendidad also contains a cryptic reference to bhanga's being
      used to induce abortions, but this seems not to have been an
      accepted usage of the drug in ancient Persia since the abortionist
      is called an old hag, not a doctor.[48]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Cult of the Dead</b><br>
      <br>
      Around the seventh century B.C., yet another swarm of Aryan
      warriors came out of central Siberia looking for new lands upon
      which to graze their animals. This time they claimed a vast
      territory stretching from northern Greece and beyond the Black Sea
      to the Altai Mountains in central Siberia as their new homeland.<br>
      <br>
      Known as the Scythians, these conquerors, like their Aryan
      ancestors before them, were skilled in warfare and renowned for
      their horsemanship. And also like their ancestors who settled in
      India and Persia, the Scythians were no strangers to the
      intoxicating effects of marijuana. According to Herodotus, a Greek
      historian who lived in the fifth century B.C., marijuana was an
      integral part of the Scythian cult of the dead wherin homage was
      paid to the memory of their departed leaders.<br>
      <br>
      Herodotus' passion for detail and devotion to fact has often
      provided scholars with their only contact with long-forgotten
      people and their customs. Nowhere was this more true than in the
      case of the Scythians. Were it not for Herodotus' description of
      the funerary customs of the Scythians, for example, one of the
      best known instances of the use of marijuana in the ancient world
      would never have been recorded.<br>
      <br>
      The funereal practice alluded to by Herodotus took place among the
      Scythians living northeast of Macedonia on the first anniversary
      of the death of one of their chiefs. The ceremony that
      commemorated that passing was a rather grisly affair, not one for
      the faint of heart, but of course the Scythians could hardly have
      been accused of being faint-hearted. First, it called for the
      death of fifty of the chief's former bodyguards, along with their
      horses. The bodies of these men were then opened, their intestines
      and inner organs were removed, various herbs were placed in the
      open cavities, and the bodies were then stitched back together.
      Meanwhile, their horses, each fully bridled, were killed and
      impaled on stakes arranged in a circle around the chief's tomb.
      The dead bodies of the chief's erstwhile protectors were then
      lifted onto the horses and were left to rot as they stood their
      last watch over the tomb of their former leader.<br>
      <br>
      Following this sobering rite, all those who had assisted in the
      burial cleansed themselves in a unique purification ritual. First,
      they washed their bodies thoroughly with cleansing oil. Then they
      erected small tents, into which they placed metal censors
      containing red-hot stones. Next, the men crawled into the tents
      and dumped marijuana seeds onto the hot stones. The seeds soon
      began to smolder and throw off vapors, which in the words of
      Herodotus, caused the Scythians to "howl with joy".[49] Seemingly,
      the purification was the Scythian counterpart to the hard-drinking
      frazzled Irish wake, with marijuana instead of alcohol as the
      ceremonial intoxicant.<br>
      <br>
      Even though Herodotus' accuracy in recording history has often
      been borne out by other historical documents, scholars found this
      bizarre burial custom including the marijuana-induced intoxication
      too incredible to be true.<br>
      <br>
      But in 1929 a Russian archaeologist, Professor S.I. Rudenko, made
      a fantastic discovery in the Pazyryk Valley of central Siberia.
      Digging into some ancient ruins near the Altai Mountains on the
      border between Siberia and Outer Mongolia, Rudenko found a trench
      about 160 feet square and about 20 feet deep. On the perimeter of
      the trench were the skeletons of a number of horses. Inside the
      trench was the embalmed body of a man and a bronze cauldron filled
      with burnt marijuana seeds![50] Clearing the site further, Rudenko
      also found some shirts woven from hemp fiber and some metal
      censors designed for inhaling marijuana smoke which did not appear
      to be connected with any religious rite. To Rudenko, the evidence
      suggested that inhalation of smoldering marijuana seeds occurred
      not only in a religious context, but also as an everyday activity,
      one in which Scythian women participated alongside the men.<br>
      <br>
      Although he does not identify them, Herodotus had also heard of
      another tribe of nomads who used marijuana for recreational
      purposes. Speaking of these people, Herodutus states that when
      they "have parties and sit around a fire, they throw some of it
      into the flames. As it burns, it smokes like incense, and the
      smell of it makes them drunk, just as wine does. As more fruit is
      thrown on, they get more and more intoxicated until finally they
      jump up and start dancing and singing."[51]<br>
      <br>
      The Scythians eventually disappeared as a distinct national
      entity, but their descendants spread through Eastern Europe. While
      remembrances of their ancestors were lost, memories of ancestral
      customs were still retained, although, of course, these were
      modified down through the centuries. It is in this regard that
      anthropologist Sula Benet's comment that "hemp never lost its
      connection with the cult of the dead"[52] takes on added
      significance since she has traced the influence of the Scythians
      and their hemp funerary customs down to the modern era in Eastern
      Europe and Russia.<br>
      <br>
      On Christmas Eve, for instance, Benet notes that the people of
      Poland and Lithuania serve semieniatka, a soup made from hemp
      seeds. The Poles and Lithuanians believe that on the night before
      Christmas the spirits of the dead visit their families and the
      soup is for the souls of the dead. A similar ritual takes place in
      Latvia and in the Ukraine on Three Kings Day. Yet another custom
      carried out in deference to the dead in Western Europe was the
      throwing of hemp seeds onto a blazing fire during harvest time as
      an offering to the dead - a custom that originated with the
      Scythians and has seemingly been passed on from generation to
      generation for over 2500 years.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Babylonia, Palestine, and Egypt</b><br>
      <br>
      The farthest west marijuana fibers have ever been found in the
      ancient world is Turkey. Sifting through artefacts dating back to
      the time of the Phrygians, a tribe of Aryans who invaded that
      country around 1000 B.C., archaeologists unearthed pieces of
      fabric containing hemp fibers in the debris around Gordion, an
      ancient city located near present-day Ankara.[53]<br>
      <br>
      Although the Scythians had contacts with the people of Babylonia,
      who lived to the west of the Phrygians, no hemp fiber or definite
      mention of hemp (Cannabis sativa) to the west of Turkey can be
      found until the time of the Greeks.[54] There are some vague
      references, however, which may or may not be cannabis. In a letter
      written around 680 B.C. by an unknown woman to the mother of the
      Assyrian king Esarhaddon, for example, mention is made of a
      substance called qu-nu-bu[55] which could be cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      There is also very little evidence that the Egyptians ever
      cultivated the plant during the time of the Pharaohs. Papyrus
      documents from ancient Egypt list the names of hundreds of drugs
      and their plant sources, but there is no unequivocal mention of
      marijuana in any of its forms.[56] While some scholars have
      contended that the drug smsm t, mentioned in the Berlin and Ebers
      papyri, is cannabis,[57] this opinion is conjecture. No mummy has
      ever been discovered wrapped in fabric made from cannabis. In the
      ruins of El Amarna, the city of Akhenaton (the Pharaoh who tried
      to introduce monotheism to ancient Egypt), archaeologists found a
      "three ply hemp cord" in the hole of a stone and a large mat bound
      with "hemp cords",[58] but unfortunately they did not specify the
      type of hemp. Many different bast fibers were called hemp and no
      one can be certain that the fibers at El Amarna are cannabis,
      especially since Deccan hemp (Hibiscus cannabinus) grows in
      Egypt.[59]<br>
      <br>
      The earliest unmistakable reference to cannabis in Egypt does not
      occur until the third century A.D., when the Roman emperor
      Aurelian imposed a tax on Egyptian cannabis.[60] Even then,
      however, there was very little of the fiber in Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      There is no evidence that the ancient Israelites ever knew of the
      plant, although several attempts have been made to prove that they
      did. Because the Arabs sometimes referred to hashish as grass,
      some writers have argued that the "grass" eaten by Nebuchadnezzar
      was actually hashish. Another contention is that the
      phantasmagoria of composite creatures and brilliant colors seen by
      Ezekiel are unintelligible except from the standpoint of hashish
      intoxication.<br>
      <br>
      In the most recent attempt to infuse marijuana with biblical
      antiquity, the Old Testament has been tickled, teased, and twisted
      into surrendering secret references to marijuana that it never
      contained. From the fact that the Scythians had made contact with
      the people of Palestine during the seventh century B.C., it has
      been suggested that knowledge and usage of the plant was passed on
      to the Israelites through some kind of cultural exchange.
      Linguistic arguments are then advanced to prove that the
      Israelites were users of marijuana.<br>
      <br>
      For example, because the Hebrew adjective bosm (Aramaic busma),
      meaning "aromatic" or "sweet-smelling", is found in connection
      with the word qeneh (which can also be written as kaneh or kaneb)
      and because of the similarity between kaneh and bosm, and the
      Scythian word kannabis, it is argued that they are one and the
      same.[61]<br>
      <br>
      However the word kaneh or qeneh is a very vague term[62] that has
      disconcerted more than a few biblical scholars. A reference to
      qeneh in Isaiah 43:24 refers not to a "sweet-smelling" but a
      "sweet-tasting" plant. Few people would ever say that marijuana
      leaves taste sweet. Because of this reference to a sweet-tasting
      plant, some biblical scholars and botanists believe that qeneh is
      probably sugarcane.<br>

      Although the Bible states that qeneh came from a "far country"
      (Jeremiah 6:20), sugar grew in India, which is in keeping with the
      passage from Jeremiah. The reference to qeneh as a spice in Exodus
      30:23 also suggests sugar rather than cannabis.[63]<br>
      <br>
      The earliest reference to cannabis among the Jews actually does
      not occur until the early Middle Ages when the first unmistakable
      mention of it is found in the Talmud.<br>
      <br>
      The Jews of Talmudic times were particularly concerned about
      certain precepts which prohibited the mingling of heterogeneous
      substances, and on at least one occasion the sages argued over
      whether hemp seeds could be sown in a vineyard. The majority
      opinion was that such intermingling was permissible, indicating
      that they recognized a certain similarity between cannabis and the
      grape. This similarity could not have been due to the appearance
      of the two plants and must have centered around the intoxication
      produced by each.<br>
      <br>
      A similar question likewise arose concerning the purification of
      wicker mats which were placed over grapes during wine pressing to
      keep them from scattering. The decision rendered by the rabbis was
      that if the baskets were made of hemp they could be used, provided
      they were thoroughly cleaned.[64] However, if they were made of
      some other material, the rabbis ruled that they could not be
      employed in wine pressing until twelve months had elapsed since
      the time they were last used.<br>

      <b>The Birthplace of Democracy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Greece: land of myth and beauty, home to some of the greatest
      minds the world has ever known - Socrates, Plato, Aristotle -
      birthplace of democracy; Greece was all of these and more. It gave
      the world its first great art, literature, theater, political
      institutions, sporting events, scientific and medical discoveries
      - the list is endless.<br>
      <br>
      Yet despite these monumental achievements, Greece was a turbulent
      country and war was no stranger to its inhabitants. When they were
      not fighting among themselves, the Greeks faced the threat of
      invasion from empires like that of Darius and Xerxes. When
      Alexander the Great came to power, the Greeks in turn became world
      conquerors.<br>
      <br>
      Alexander's was not the first campaign outside the Greek mainland.
      The Trojan war (ca. 1200 B.C.) saw Greek armies encamped on the
      shores of the Dardanelles in Asia Minor almost ten centuries
      before Alexander.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Greek poet Homer (ca. 850 B.C.), who described
      the events of that war in the Iliad, the war was fought over a
      woman, the most beautiful mortal in the world - Helen, daughter of
      the great god Zeus and his human paramour. The Iliad tells of the
      great battles that took place before the walls of Troy, and the
      great heroes who fought them. It ends, however, not with the fall
      of Troy, but with the death of Hector, the Trojan prince, at the
      hands of the great Achilles. The actual conquest of Troy and the
      homeward journey of the Greeks is chronicled in Homer's other
      great epic, the Odyssey. Although it is primarily the story of the
      events that befell the great hero Odysseus as he tries to return
      to his island-home of Ithica, the story contains a brief scene in
      which some readers believe they have come across one of the
      earliest references to cannabis in Greek literature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Mysterious Nepenthe</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On their way back from Troy, Helen, who had been reunited with her
      husband, Menelaus, stopped off in Egypt for a brief layover. While
      Menelaus took on new supplies, his wife went about exploring what
      was even in those times an ancient civilization. During this brief
      visit to the land of the Pharaohs, Helen paid a visit to a woman
      by the name of Polydamna. Polydamna was a dealer in drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Many years later, during a magnificent party thrown by Menelaus in
      his palace in Sparta, the conversation naturally turned to the
      recent war in Troy. Someone remarked how sad it was that Odysseus,
      who had been a great friend of Menelaus' as well as many of the
      guests at the party, had not been heard of since his departure
      from Troy. The mention of Odysseus cast a shadow over the
      festivities and everyone started to become morose. The more the
      guests spoke of the lost hero, the sadder they became. The party
      was turning into a wake.<br>
      <br>
      As spirits plummeted, Helen herself started feeling remorseful,
      not because of any grief she felt over the missing Odysseus, but
      because all this sadness and melancholy were spoiling her party.
      If she did not do something quickly, the party would die, the
      guests would go home, and, sooner than she cared for, she would
      have to return to the boring life of being a woman in an age when
      women were seen, made love to, but rarely heard or spoken to.<br>
      <br>
      The situation called for emergency measures and Helen met the
      situation head on. Reaching into her bag of tricks, she came up
      with a drug given her by Polydamna. Secretly, she placed the
      compound into the wine of her guests. The drug, which Homer only
      identifies as nepenthe ("against sorrow"), was a compound with the
      power to suppress despair. Whoever drank this mixture, Homer
      wrote, would be incapable of sadness, even if his mother and
      father lay dead, or his son were slain before his very eyes.[65]<br>
      <br>
      The drug was an instant success. The guests forgot their sorrow
      and regained their spirits. Although the conversation still
      revolved around Odysseus, it no longer evoked any grief. Helen
      even told the guests how she and Odysseus had once spent some
      compromising moments together. All the while her husband listened
      to the news that he had been cuckolded by his best friend, he
      remained calm and indifferent, so great was the power of
      Polydamna's drug.<br>
      <br>
      What was this soporific, this stupefying drug that restrained even
      the deepest sense of grief and sorrow? No one really knows. There
      is no reason for Homer not to have identified it if he had some
      specific drug in mind.<br>
      <br>
      To add even more mystery to this enigma, the Greek historian
      Diodorus of Sicily, who visited Egypt in the first century B.C.,
      also refers to a "nepenthic" drug from that country which brought
      forgetfulness of all sorrows.[66] Like Homer, he too never gives
      this drug a name.<br>
      <br>
      Conjecture always lurks in the shadow of uncertainty, and
      throughout the ages many have tried to identify Homer's elusive
      nepenthe. One of the more interesting guesses is that the drug was
      cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      For example, when poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge invited a friend to
      come for a visit, he coaxed him to bring along some drugs "and I
      will give a fair trial to opium, henbane, and nepenthe. By the
      bye," he added, "I have always considered Homer's account of
      nepenthe as a banging lie."[67] At the time he wrote this letter
      in 1803, Coleridge was one of the few Europeans who were
      acquainted with the Indian beverage bhang. His pun indicates that,
      as far as he is concerned, nepenthe and bhang were one and the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      E.W. Lane, editor of The Thousand and One Nights, was similarly
      convinced: "'Benj', the plural of which in Coptic is 'nibendji',
      is without doubt the same plant as the 'nepenth', which has so
      much perplexed the commentators of Homer. Helen evidently brought
      the nepenthe from Egypt, and benj is there still reported to
      possess all the wonderful qualities which Homer attributes to
      it."[68]<br>
      <br>
      Not everyone agreed. Thomas De Quincey, author of Confessions of
      an Opium Eater, rejected cannabis as the sorrow-killing agent
      mentioned by Homer preferring his own favorite, opium, which he
      regarded as a "panacea, a pharmakon nepenthes" for all woes.[69]<br>
      <br>
      While no one will ever know what drug Homer had in mind, it is
      certain that it was not cannabis since cannabis was not known in
      Egypt until more than a thousand years after Homer wrote his
      stirring epics. On the other hand, opium is mentioned in ancient
      Egyptian writings, and of all the possibilities that have been
      suggested it still remains the most likely.<br>
      <br>
      While the ancient Greeks remained ignorant of the intoxicating
      properties of the cannabis plant, they were not slow to appreciate
      the durability and strength of its fiber. As early as the sixth
      century B.C., Greek merchants whose Milesian colonies served as a
      middle station between mainland Greece and the eastern coast of
      Asia Minor, had been carrying on a lucrative business transporting
      cannabis fiber to the ports along the Aegean.[70]<br>
      <br>
      The Thracians, a Greek-speaking people living in the Balkans who
      were probably more closely related to the Scythians than to the
      Greeks, were especially adept at working hemp. Writing around 450
      B.C., Herodotus says of their clothes that they "were so like
      linen that none but a very experienced could tell whether they
      were of hemp or flax; one who had never seen hemp would certainly
      suppose them to be linen.[71]<br>
      <br>
      Herodotus does not say whether the Thracians used any of the other
      parts of the plant, but Plutarch (46-127 B.C.), writing some 400
      years later, mentions that after their meals, it was not uncommon
      for the Thracians to throw the tops of a plant which looked like
      oregano into the fire. Inhaling the fumes of this plant, the
      people became drunk and then so tired they finally fell
      asleep.[72]<br>
      <br>
      However, Thrace was far from the center of Greek culture and most
      Greeks remained ignorant of cannabis's intoxicating properties.
      Theophrastus, the famous Greek botanist (372-287 B.C.), does not
      list cannabis among the native plants of Greece and nowhere is
      there any reference to it in the Greek myths, although various
      drugs such as datura (Jimson weed), mandragora (mandrake), and
      hyoscyanus (henbane) are described as consciousness-modifying
      drugs in use at ancient Greek shrines and oracles.[73]<br>
      <br>
      In the third century B.C., Hiero II (270-15 B.C.), ruler of the
      Greek city-state of Syracuse, did not send his envoys to the Black
      Sea city of Colchis which supplied many Greek cities with hemp,
      but to the far-off Rhone Valley in France.[74] So sophisticated
      about the various characteristics of hemp fiber was he that only
      the most superior varieties were to be used to make ropes for his
      proposed armada. (This incident is the earliest reference to
      cannabis in Western Europe known to historians.)<br>
      <br>
      Since the Greeks had become so knowledgeable about the kinds of
      fibers produced by cannabis growing in different geographical
      regions, they would no doubt also have mentioned the intoxicating
      properties of the plant had these been known. Although there are
      references to cannabis both as a delicacy and a remedy for
      backache in Greek literature dating back tot he fourth century
      B.C.,[75] no notice of the plant as an intoxicant occurs until the
      nineteenth century.[76]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rome</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Roman Empire was the last and greatest colossus of the ancient
      world. At the summit of its glory, it extended from England in the
      west to Russia in the east. No fewer than 100 million people lived
      within its frontiers.<br>
      <br>
      It was an empire primarily governed by a small elite aristocracy
      in Rome whose commands were dutifully administered by a well-oiled
      bureaucracy which could call upon a highly trained and devoted
      army whenever force was necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the everyday chores in the city were performed by slaves.
      About one-half million lived in Rome. A middle-class businessman
      might own about 10; the emperor owned about 25,000.<br>
      <br>
      Wealthy Romans spent most of their time eating, bathing, gambling,
      and whoring. But some also had a taste for the arts. Since the
      Romans did not excel very greatly in the latter, prominent men
      would bring Greek writers, painters, philosophers, and scientists
      to Rome to work for them and to converse with whenever the feeling
      moved them. Of this Graecophilia, the Roman poet Horace observed:
      "Captive Greece has taken captive her rude conqueror."<br>
      <br>
      Among the eminent Greek scientists who found employment among the
      Romans was Pedacius Dioscorides. Born in Asia Minor in the early
      part of the first century A.D., he became a physician and spent
      much of his early career in the Roman army tending the needs of
      the soldiers as they travelled the world conquering new lands to
      add to the empire. During these campaigns, Dioscorides collected
      and studied the various plants he encountered in different parts
      of the world and eventually he put what he had learned into a
      herbal.<br>
      <br>
      The first copy of this book was published in A.D. 70. Dioscorides
      called it a materia medica and it became to the Western world what
      the Pen Ts'ao was to the Chinese. It identified each of the plants
      listed according to its native habitat and the names by which it
      was known. Peculiar features were then noted, and finally,
      symptoms and conditions for which the plant had proven beneficial
      were described.<br>
      <br>
      The book became an instant success and was subsequently translated
      into nearly all of the languages of the ancient and medieval
      world. For the next fifteen centuries it remained an important
      reference for physicians, and no medical library was considered
      complete unless it housed at least one copy of this herbal.<br>
      <br>
      Among the more than 600 entries appearing in the book was
      cannabis. This plant, Dioscorides wrote, was not only very useful
      for manufacturing strong ropes, but the juice of its seeds was
      also very beneficial in treating earaches and in diminishing
      sexual desires.[77]<br>
      <br>
      Although this is all Dioscorides had to say on the subject, it was
      the first time cannabis had been described as a medical remedy in
      a Western medical text. And since Dioscorides' herbal continued to
      be one of the most important books in medicine for the next 1500
      years, cannabis became a common household remedy for treating
      earaches throughout Europe during the Middle Ages.<br>
      <br>
      Another prominent physician whose work was to influence the course
      of medical science for the next fifteen centuries was Claudius
      Galen (A.D. 130-200). Born in Pergamum, a country located in
      modern-day Turkey, Galen was the son of a wealthy and ambitious
      landowner who dreamed one night that his son would become the most
      famous physician in the world. The lavish praise and attention
      bestowed upon him by his father made Galen an insufferable
      egotist. "Whoever seeks fame need only become familiar with all
      that I have achieved," he once told his pupils.[78]<br>
      <br>
      Such a statement may seem conceited, but it was true. Galen was to
      become the most famous physician of the ancient and Middle Ages,
      and a thorough study of his writings was mandatory for any doctor.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare his son for the future, Galen was recognized as the
      leading authority on anatomy and physiology. He was a prolific
      writer, his medical pronouncements were never challenged, and his
      writings became the standard references of the medical profession.
      These writings, along with Dioscorides' herbal, were the most
      influential books in Western medicine for centuries.<br>
      <br>
      Like Dioscorides, Galen had little to say about cannabis, but he
      does state that the Romans, at least those with money, used to top
      off their banquets with a marijuana-seed dessert, a confectionery
      treat which left guests with a warm and pleasurable sensation. To
      be avoided, however, was an overindulgence in this confection, for
      among the adverse after-effects of too many seeds were dehydration
      and impotence. Other properties Galen mentions are antiflatulence
      and analgesia. "If consumed in large amounts," he says, it
      "affects the head by sending to it a warm and toxic vapor."[79]<br>
      <br>
      Following Galen, Oribasius, court physician to the emperor Julian
      (fourth century A.D.), wrote that cannabis seeds "harms the head",
      had antiflatulent effects, produced a "warm feeling", and caused
      weight-reduction.[80]<br>
      <br>
      Most Romans, however, had little familiarity with cannabis seed.
      Very little hemp was raised in Italy.[81] If anything, the Romans
      were interested in the plant because of its fiber, for with good
      strong fiber Rome could outfit its expanding navy and keep it at
      sea longer.<br>
      <br>
      Most of Rome's hemp came from Babylonia.[82] The city of Sura was
      particularly renowned for its hempen ropes.[83] Other cities such
      as Colchis, Cyzicus, Alabanda, Mylasa, and Ephesus, which had been
      leading producers during the Greek empire, continued to produce
      and export hemp as their chief product under the Romans.<br>
      <br>
      The only other Roman author to give cannabis more than just a
      passing reference was the indefatigable encyclopedist of the
      ancient world, Caius Plinius Secundus (A.D. 23-79), otherwise
      known as Pliny the Elder. One of the best known members of the
      Roman establishment, Pliny preferred reading and writing to the
      more usual pastimes of the aristocracy. At the time of his death
      in A.D. 79, he left behind 160 manuscripts, many of which
      unfortunately have long since disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      His most famous work, copies of which have been preserved down
      through the ages, was called the Natural History. These volumes
      are a collection of fact and fantasy which Pliny copied from other
      books or which he transcribed from conversations with various
      people throughout the empire. Most of the factual material was
      taken from Aristotle's books. The fantasy included anything and
      everything. Nothing was too incredible to be recorded. Pliny
      records that there are some men without mouths who inhale the
      fragrance of flowers instead of eating food, that horses will
      commit suicide if they discover that they have engaged in an
      incestual relationship with a close relative, etc. Exotic animals
      such as the unicorn and the winged horses are also given their
      due.<br>
      <br>
      But like his contemporaries, Pliny had very little to record about
      cannabis. The fibers of the plant, he noted, made superb rope. The
      juice of the cannabis seed was also useful for extracting "worms
      from the ears, or any insect which may have entered them." While
      the seeds could also render men impotent, they were beneficial in
      alleviating gout and similar maladies.[84]<br>
      <br>
      Wherever the people of the ancient world roamed, they carried with
      them the seeds of the precious cannabis plant. From China in the
      east to the Rhone Valley in the west, the seeds were spread. Cold
      weather, hot weather, wet or dry, fertile soil or barren, the
      seeds were not to be denied.<br>
      <br>
      Except in India and China, most of the ancient world was
      completely ignorant of the intoxicating properties of the plant.
      Ancient European legends and herbals had little to say regarding
      its peculiar psychological effects.<br>
      <br>
      If Europeans saw any magic in cannabis, it was its fibers, not its
      intoxicating power, that aroused their awe and admiration. Farther
      to the south, however, cannabis eventually inspired sentiments of
      a different kind in a people who challenged Europe for world
      domination.<br>

      <hr width="100%" size="2"><a name="HashishArabs"></a><br>

            Hashish and the Arabs</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Arab countries are hot. Hot and dusty. But mainly hot. It is
      only in recent times that a privileged few have found some respite
      from the heat through the miracle of air conditioning. The rest of
      the people are not so fortunate. Like their forefathers, they must
      endure temperatures that often soar to over 100 F. The excessive
      heat dictates that the people work only in the mornings and the
      evenings ("Only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday
      sun").<br>
      <br>
      The sun also dictates the kinds of animals and plants that will
      survive. The camel has adapted in a way that allows it to go
      without water for days. Not only can it store large quantities of
      water in its body, but the camel also does not sweat. By a similar
      adaptation, plants are able to survive by being able to retain
      their water. It is because of this capacity to minimize
      evaporation that plants such as cannabis are able to live in the
      parching Arabian heat.<br>
      <br>
      The means by which cannabis accomplishes this amazing feat is by
      producing a thick, sticky resin that coats its leaves and flowers.
      This protective canopy prevents life-sustaining moisture from
      disappearing into the dry air.<br>
      <br>
      But this thick stocky resin is not an ordinary goo. It is the
      stuff that dreams are made of, the stuff that holds time suspended
      in limbo, the stuff that makes men forgetful, makes them both sad
      and deliriously happy, makes them ravenously hungry or completely
      disinterested in food. It is a god to some and a devil to others.
      It is all of these things and more. This resin, this shield
      against the sun, this sticky goo... hashish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Discovery of Hashish</b><br>
      <br>
      Little is known of the first Arab who discovered the marvellous
      properties of hashish. There is no shortage of legends, however,
      to fill in the dark, long-forgotten memories of that eventful
      moment. One of the most colorful of these stories tells how
      Haydar, the Persian founder of a religious order of Sufis,
      discovered hashish in A.D. 1155.[1]<br>
      <br>
      According to the legend, Haydar was an ascetic monk who lived a
      life of rigid privation and self-chastisement in a monastery which
      he built in the mountains of Persia. For ten years he lived in
      this distant retreat, never leaving it for even a brief moment,
      seeing no one except his disciples.<br>
      <br>
      One hot summer day, however, Haydar fell into a state of
      depression and, contrary to his custom of never venturing out of
      his monastery, he wandered off into the fields to be alone. When
      he returned, his disciples, who had become alarmed at his unusual
      absence, noted a strange air of happiness and whimsy in his
      demeanour. Not only that, the hitherto reclusive monk even allowed
      them to enter his personal chambers, something he had never done
      before.<br>
      <br>
      Astounded by this dramatic change in their master's character, his
      disciples eagerly questioned the monk about what it was that had
      put him into this frame of mind. Haydar responded to their
      curiosity with amusement and proceeded to tell them how he had
      been wandering in the fields and had noticed that of all the
      plants near the monastery, only one had not been standing
      motionless in the oppressive heat of the day. Unlike its torpid
      and inanimate neighbors, this unusual plant seemed to dance
      joyfully in the sun's warmth. Overwhelmed by curiosity, Haydar
      picked a few of its leaves and ate them to see what they would
      taste like. The result was the euphoric state his disciples now
      observed in him.<br>
      <br>
      Upon hearing of this wonderful plant and desirous of sharing their
      master's pleasure, Haydar's pupils entreated him to show them this
      strange plant so that they too could partake of its marvellous
      virtues. Haydar agreed, but not before he made them promise under
      oath that they would not reveal the secret of the plant to anyone
      but the Sufis (the poor). So it was, according to legend, that the
      Sufis came to know the pleasures and contentment of hashish.<br>
      <br>
      After his discovery, Haydar lived another ten years, allegedly
      subsisting on cannabis leaves. Shortly before his death in A.D.
      1221, he asked that cannabis leaves be sown around his tomb so
      that his spirit might walk in the shade of the plant that had
      given him such pleasure during his lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      Such is the legend of Haydar and his discovery of the powers of
      hashish. It is a simple story, amusing and entertaining, and, of
      course, apocryphal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Smell of Death</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although sometimes called the "wine of Haydar", hashish was known
      to the Arabs long before its alleged discovery by the ascetic
      monk. In the tenth century A.D., an Arab physician, Ibn Wahshiyah,
      wrote of it in his book On Poisons, claiming that the odor of
      hashish was lethal:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it reaches the nose, a violent tickle occurs
      in the nose, then in the face. The face and eyes are affected by
      an extreme and intense burning; one does not see anything and
      cannot say what one wishes. One swoons, then recovers, then swoons
      again and recovers again. One goes on this way until he dies. A
      violent anxiety and fainting occurs until one succumbs, after a
      day, a day and a half, or more. If it is protracted, it may take
      two days. For these aromatics, there is no remedy. But if God
      wills to save him, he may be spared from death by the continuance
      of vomiting or by another natural reaction.[2]<br>
      <br>
      While Ibn Wahshiyah was more ignorant than knowledgeable of the
      properties of hashish, he was at least superficially familiar with
      some of its effects. In general, however, Arab physicians before
      and after Ibn Wahshiyah had very little to say about the medicinal
      virtues of cannabis and most of what they did say was taken from
      Galen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hippies of the Arab World</b><br>
      <br>
      The apocryphal oath by which Haydar entrusted his disciples not to
      reveal the secret of hashish to anyone but the Sufis underlies the
      close association between the drug and the Sufi movement in the
      Arab community.<br>
      <br>
      The origin of the name Sufi is connected with the wearing of
      undyed garments made from wool (suf) rather than cotton. Such
      clothing was originally worn as a symbol of personal penitence,
      but was condemned by religious leaders because it suggested that
      such people were dressing in imitation of Jesus rather than
      Mohammed, who wore cotton.<br>
      <br>
      The Sufis were the hippies of the Arab world. Their origins were
      in Persia where they began as a group of ascetics who banded
      together to discuss religious topics and to recite the Koran
      aloud. Some of these bands eventually formed fraternities and
      established monasteries such as those founded by Haydar.<br>
      <br>
      Although the original leaders of the movement were orthodox in
      their religious principles, their successors and the new members
      who were drawn to the movement adopted a more mystical approach
      toward religion which was contrary to Islamic orthodoxy.
      Furthermore, since most of the new devotees came from the lower
      and middle classes, the socio-political attitudes of this new sect
      were increasingly regarded with distrust and suspicion by the
      upper classes and by the authorities.<br>
      <br>
      Religious leaders were unfavorably inclined toward them because
      the mystical philosophy of the Sufis taught that divine truth and
      communion with God cannot be imparted to others. Instead, it had
      to be experienced directly. To the Sufis, the mind was simply
      incapable of articulating such understanding; it had to be
      acquired by oneself through experience.<br>
      <br>
      One of the ways the Sufis encouraged the attainment of these
      spiritual insights was through the arousal of ecstatic states.
      There were several different ways of achieving this condition, but
      the one most commonly resorted to was through intoxication by
      means of drugs such as hashish. It was because of their frequent
      usage of hashish that the Sufis were credited both with the
      dissemination of the drug and with the downfall of Islamic
      society. For the Sufis, however, hashish was merely a means of
      stimulating mystical consciousness and appreciation of the nature
      of Allah. To the Sufi, a Moslem critic wrote, eating hashish is
      "an act of worship".<br>
      <br>
      Sufism was much more than a heretical religious movement. It
      represented a counterculture within the Arab community in the same
      way that the hippies of the 1960's represented an ideological and
      behavioral counterculture within American society. Both were
      peopled by "drop-outs" who rejected the dominant economic system
      in favor of communal living and sharing of material goods. Both
      had their symbols. For the hippies, it was long hair and beads;
      for the Sufi, garments made of wool.<br>
      <br>
      Since neither the hippie nor the Sufi had any interest in
      advancing himself in society or in economic gain, both were looked
      down upon by the Establishment in their respective eras as being
      lazy and worthless. In many cases, their behavior was attributed
      to the effects of drugs.<br>
      <br>
      More than intriguing, the dominant drug in both countercultures
      was made from cannabis. For the hippie, it was marijuana; for the
      Sufi, hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Since the drugs were similar, it is not surprising that many of
      the accusations levelled at cannabis have a familiar ring. Both
      marijuana and hashish were accused of sapping the user's energy,
      thereby robbing him of his willingness to work. This
      "amotivational syndrome", as it is presently called, was regarded
      as a threat to the dominant culture since it undermined the work
      ethic.<br>
      <br>
      Insanity was another evil attributed to chronic use of these
      drugs. Hashish drove men to madness, its Arab critics declared, by
      drying up the moistures in the lower parts of the body. This
      resulted in vapors rising to the brain, thereby causing the mind
      to weaken and be destroyed. Many critics contended that hashish
      produced physical dependence. As a result of this dependence, the
      hashish addict spent all his time and efforts looking for more
      hashish.[3]<br>
      <br>
      A second feature common to both the hippies and the Sufis was
      their physical withdrawal from the dominant culture. The country
      commune of the hippie and the remote monastery started by Haydar
      were both created to remove each group from the hostility of the
      Establishment. In these retreats, the devotees could follow their
      own way of life without incurring the wrath of those who disagreed
      with their ideas. These communes were also similar in their
      devotion to spiritual leaders who were looked up to as
      fountainheads of enlightenment. Timothy Leary and Haydar both
      enjoyed the respect and admiration of their followers. Both also
      recommended drugs as a means of expanding consciousness. They were
      heroes to the counterculture, false prophets to nonbelievers.<br>
      <br>
      The hippie and Sufi movements were also similar in their attitudes
      toward family and contemporary sexual morality. Both went to
      extremes, but in this case they went to opposite extremes. The
      hippies were accused of being promiscuous; the Sufis, of being
      effeminate and homosexual. In both cases, however, cannabis was
      blamed for their sexual deviations. Marijuana, the critics of the
      twentieth century declared, caused hippies to become sex-crazed.
      Hashish, on the other hand, was accused of diminishing the libido,
      causing men to turn from women to other men.<br>
      <br>
      Further parallels between the hippies and the Sufis could be
      drawn, the point being that despite the 1000-year gulf between
      them, the two movements resembled one another in more ways than
      they differed. But perhaps the most interesting parallel of all is
      the answers the Sufis and the hippies gave in response to those
      who criticized their use of cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      Both ardently maintained that cannabis gave them otherwise
      unattainable insights into themselves. It allowed them to see new
      and different meanings in what appeared to be otherwise trivial
      experiences. It made them feel more witty and gave them deeper
      understanding. It caused them to see beautiful colors and designs
      in what seemed commonplace to others. It increased their pleasure
      in music. It gave happiness, and reduced anxiety and worry.[4]<br>
      <br>
      The one comparison that breaks the link between the Sufis and the
      hippies is social background. In contrast to the hippies, many of
      whom came from well-to-do middle-class families, most Sufis were
      form the lower classes. One of the main reasons the Sufis chose
      hashish over other intoxicants like alcohol was that hashish was
      cheap. Although proscribed in the Koran, wine was always available
      to those who could afford it. But wine was a luxury, the
      intoxicant of the rich; hashish was all the poor could afford.<br>
      <br>
      Their heretical religious stance and their refusal to conform to
      the standards of Arab society combined to make the Sufis pariahs
      in the Arab world. And because hashish was so much a part of the
      Sufi's everyday life, it came to be looked upon as the cause of
      their unholy, contemptible, and disgusting behavior. By
      eliminating hashish, the Arab world felt it could rid itself of a
      loathsome drug habit that encouraged defiance, insubordination,
      and a general disregard for the status quo. While the efforts to
      eliminate hashish were often quite dramatic, all attempts proved
      futile. Every society seems to have evolved its own escape route
      from reality. For the Sufis, that escape route took the form of
      hashish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Gardens of Cafour</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although hashish was well known in the eastern Arab countries by
      the eleventh century A.D., it was not until the middle of the
      thirteenth century that it was introduced into Egypt. For this
      information, we are indebted to a Moslem botanist named Ibn
      al-Baytar (d. A.D. 1248).<br>
      <br>
      Ibn al-Baytar was born in Malaga in Spain, apparently the son of
      wealthy parents for he was able to afford to travel to far-off
      lands. Generally, the early sightseers in the Arab world left home
      to make the honored pilgrimage to the holy cities of Mecca and
      Medina. This was a religious duty required of every Moslem, but
      the farther away from these holy shrines, the more difficult was
      such an undertaking. For those who could afford the pilgrimage,
      however, the trip offered a wonderful opportunity to visit other
      countries and meet new people.<br>
      <br>
      In the course of his journey, Ibn al-Baytar passed through Egypt
      where for the first time he observed hashish being eaten. The main
      users of the drug, he noted, were the Sufis.<br>
      <br>
      According to Ibn al-Baytar, the Sufis had a special way of
      preparing their hashish. First they baked the leaves until they
      were dry. Then, they rubbed them between their hands to form a
      paste, rolled it into a ball, and swallowed it like a pill. Others
      dried the leaves only slightly, toasted and husked them, mixed
      them with sesame and sugar, and chewed them like gum.<br>
      <br>
      The sight of these people and their unconventional clothes and
      behavior unsettled Ibn al-Baytar, and he voiced his opinion in his
      diary. "People [i.e. the Sufis] who use it [hashish] habitually
      have proved its pernicious effect," he writes, for "it enfeebles
      their minds by carrying to them maniac affections, sometimes it
      even causes death." Ibn al-Baytar then adds: "I recall having seen
      a time when men of the vilest class alone dared to eat it, still
      they did not like the name takers of hashish applied to them."[5]
      This latter comment reflects the attitude of the upper-class
      Moslem's opinion of the Sufis and their use of hashish. It also
      shows, however, that by the twelfth century, the label "hashish
      user" had become so derogatory that even the Sufis were upset at
      being so taunted.<br>
      <br>
      One of the favorite gathering places for hashish users in Egypt
      was the "gardens " of Cafour in Cairo. "The green plant which
      grows in the garden of Cafour replaces in our hearts the effects
      of old and noble wine," states a poem written in tribute to the
      renowned gathering place of hashish connoisseurs. Another poem
      coos: "Give me this green plant from the garden of Cafour, this
      plant which surpasses wine itself in the number of people it
      enslaves."<br>
      <br>
      The authorities felt differently. Unwilling to tolerate the rabble
      collecting in the city's garden spot, the governor of Cairo
      ordered out the troops. In A.D. 1253, all the cannabis plants
      growing in the area were chopped, gathered, and hurled onto a
      massive pyre the flames of which could be seen for miles around.
      "A just punishment of God," was the pronouncement of the more
      pious citizens of Cairo, as they watched the fire destroy the
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      With Cafour gone, hashish devotees had to go elsewhere to obtain
      their heady rations. Their inconvenience was only temporary.
      Seeing an opportunity to make some easy money, the farmers on the
      outskirts of Cairo began sowing cannabis seeds.<br>
      <br>
      At first this was a legitimate enterprise, since these farmers
      paid a tax for the privilege. But in A.D. 1324, the new governor
      decided that the situation had once more gotten out of hand.
      Troops were summoned into action. Every day for an entire month,
      the army foraged into the countryside on search-and-destroy
      missions; the enemy - hashish plants.<br>
      <br>
      After this show of force, the fields remained barren of cannabis
      for a few months. Cultivation then resumed as before. There was
      just too much money to be made to give up production permanently.
      To protect themselves from renewed interference, growers and
      merchants offered bribes and it was business as usual.<br>
      <br>
      But in A.D. 1378 another order came down from the office of the
      governor to destroy the cannabis fields. This time the farmers
      decided to resist. Not one to back down, the governor dispatched
      Egypt's version of a S.W.A.T. team against the hashish farmers.
      But the farmers were determined to preserve their lucrative
      business, and eventually the troops backed off and instead of
      fighting, decided to place the area under siege, hoping to starve
      the farmers into submission.<br>
      <br>
      The people held out for several months, but the outcome was never
      in doubt. When the soldiers finally broke through the defences and
      poured into the valley there was no alternative but to capitulate.
      The resistance crushed, the soldiers placed the valley under
      martial law. Fields were set ablaze. Towns were either razed to
      the ground or placed under strict surveillance. Local cafes which
      had previously been known as centers for the hashish trade were
      closed. Proprietors of these businesses were hunted down and
      killed. Patrons of these shops who were known to the authorities
      had a different fate in store for them. All known hashish addicts
      were assembled in the town square, and in full view of all the
      townspeople, the soldiers wrenched out their teeth.[6]<br>
      <br>
      By A.D. 1393, however, the hashish business was once again a
      thriving enterprise, a situation which prompted the Egyptian
      historian Maqrizi, who was a contemporary, to write: "as a
      consequence [of hashish use], general corruption of sentiments and
      manners ensued, modesty disappeared, every base and evil passion
      was openly indulged in, and nobility of external form alone
      remained in these infatuated beings."[7] But deplore the situation
      though Maqrizi might, hashish had become too much a part of the
      Arab way of life for it to be forsaken, whatever the criticisms
      and pressures against it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Diary from Prison</b><br>
      <br>
      They came from all parts of Genoa in Italy to listen to these
      fantastic tales of far-off lands, of strange customs and wealth
      beyond the imagination. They came not to the theater, or the
      palace, but the dungeon.<br>
      <br>
      From the damp, dimly lit underground prison, a Venetian merchant
      was dictating to a copyist the details of a fascinating journey he
      had just completed, a journey that had taken him from Venice to
      the court of the Kublai Khan, great emperor of China. He had been
      gone twenty-five years and had travelled thousands of miles. Now
      he could only travel the length of his cell.<br>
      <br>
      At first the jailers and townspeople laughed. This Venetian must
      think that the inhabitants of Genoa were mad. Who could believe
      these incredible stories of cannibals, shark charmers, and houses
      built of gold and silver? But the laughter soon gave way to a
      hushed awe as the storyteller repeatedly checked his notes to make
      sure that his facts were accurate. His sincerity, if not his
      sanity, could not be doubted.<br>
      <br>
      The storyteller was a merchant named Marco Polo. The year was A.D.
      1297. Venice and Genoa were at war. Polo had been taken prisoner
      during a sea battle on his return from the Far East. Now, as he
      awaited his fate, he was recording memories of the eventful
      expedition he had just completed. Whatever his fate, he would
      leave behind a record of all the marvellous things he had seen and
      heard.<br>
      <br>
      Even after his release from prison and the publication of his
      travel record, few people were willing to believe Polo sane.
      Nevertheless, the book was one of the most fascinating adventure
      stories of the day and it was widely copied and circulated. Two
      centuries later, it was to excite the imagination of an Italian
      visionary named Christopher Columbus and made him dream of a
      similar journey to these far-off lands. Only instead of going
      overland, he would go by sea, sailing westward around the world.<br>
      <br>
      Columbus was not the only person to be influenced by Marco Polo's
      travelogue. Seven centuries after Polo's death, the Congress of
      the United States and the American public were once again treated
      to an excerpt from Marco Polo's writings. It was an excerpt that
      was widely cited in the 1920s and 1930s as proof that hashish was
      a drug that incited fanaticism, lust, and uncontrollable violence.
      The irony of this presentation was that Marco Polo himself had
      never even heard of hashish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marco Polo's Version of Paradise</b><br>
      <br>
      As Marco Polo was passing through northern Persia on his way to
      China, the people of the area told him an amazing story about a
      legendary ruler known as the "Old Man of the Mountains" and his
      ruthless band of cutthroats knows as the Assassins. For two
      centuries, beginning around A.D. 1050, these daggermen had struck
      fear into the hearts of even the most powerful Arab leaders. It
      was only in A.D. 1256 that their stranglehold over the Middle East
      was finally ended at the hands of the Mongols.<br>
      <br>
      According to Marco Polo's diary,[8] the terrorist leader kept his
      minions blindly loyal to his will by brainwashing them; should
      they die in his service, they would be certain to enter Paradise.
      To convince sceptics of his ability to make good such a promise,
      he gave each potential candidate a foreshadowing of what lay in
      store for him.<br>
      <br>
      According to the legend, he accomplished this ploy through a
      beautiful garden landscape in his mountain stronghold of Alumut,
      the "Eagle's Nest". The garden was filled with exotic flowers and
      fountains brimming with milk and honey. Sensuous girls strolled
      this oasis ready to grant even the slightest wish. Everything was
      designed for the immediate gratification of any whim. But before
      he could enter this magnificent garden spot, the potential convert
      was required to partake of a powerful drug which rendered him
      unconscious. In this comatose state he was carried into the
      garden. When he awoke, he could gratify himself to his heart's
      content.<br>
      <br>
      After being allowed to savor "Paradise", the recruit was drugged
      once again and brought before the "Old Man". When he awoke, the
      novice begged to be readmitted. The "Old Man" promised to do so,
      provided his orders were followed meticulously and without
      question.<br>
      <br>
      Such was the story told by Marco Polo. Although a mere fantasy
      with little truth to it at all, there was an "Old Man of the
      Mountains", and there was a group of fanatics called the Assassins
      who were completely devoted to him. What, then, was the truth?
      Before answering this question, there are a number of points worth
      noting about Marco Polo's account, the most important of which is
      the mysterious potion referred to by the explorer.<br>
      <br>
      The first point is that the potion is never identified. Marco Polo
      makes no mention of hashish at all, and yet most retellings of
      this story always identify it as hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Second, whatever the drug, it was not given to anyone who was sent
      out on a mission. The potion was given only before entry into the
      garden and before being taken out.<br>
      <br>
      Third, the mysterious potion was soporific. It put its users to
      sleep. There is no mention of delirium or excitement connected
      with the drug.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Origins of the Assassins</b><br>
      <br>
      The roots of the fraternity of Assassins go back to A.D. 632, the
      year in which the prophet Mohammed died without leaving any
      designated heir. The religion of Islam, which Mohammed founded,
      began in the year A.D. 622, following the entry of the prophet
      into the city of Medina. It was the culmination of a meteoric
      career that saw a penniless unknown emerge to forge a religion
      that would unite a disorganized nation of nomads into one of the
      greatest empires of the world.<br>
      <br>
      Born some time between A.D. 570 and 580, Mohammed became an orphan
      at a very early age and was raised in the city of Mecca by his
      grandfather. Although born into poverty, he became wealthy and
      respectable by marrying the widow of a rich merchant and taking
      over his business.<br>
      <br>
      It was not until he was about forty years old that Mohammed began
      to feel the proverbial "call to religion". Dissatisfied with the
      tribal religions and idolatry of his fellow Arabs, and unable to
      accept either Judaism or Christianity, he began to preach against
      the evils of the old Arab religion and announced the coming of a
      new era. While he initially had no idea that he was beginning a
      new religion, he did succeed in converting a number of people to
      his way of thinking. Foremost among these new converts were his
      wife and his cousin Ali, who was later to become Mohammed's
      successor.<br>
      <br>
      The more he criticized the existing religion, the more his
      activities came to the attention of the authorities, who looked
      with disfavor upon this challenge to their own position.
      Persecuted, Mohammed and his tiny band of converts fled to
      Abyssinia. From this relatively safe haven, Mohammed continued to
      preach his message, and the more he spoke, the more the people
      listened. When at last he felt that he had a strong enough
      following, Mohammed brought his entire religion to Medina in
      present-day Saudi Arabia, an event celebrated today as the
      starting point in the Arab calendar. From that time on, the
      religion became so widely accepted that Mohammed was able to
      overcome all opposition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Blood Feud</b><br>
      <br>
      The religion of Islam which Mohammed founded was based on the
      recognition of the one god, Allah, and his prophet Mohammed. When
      Mohammed died in A.D. 632, the new religion faced the difficult
      problem of choosing a successor (caliph). Among those nominated
      was Ali, cousin to the prophet and one of his first converts. Also
      in Ali's favor was the fact that he was the husband of Fatima,
      Mohammed's only surviving daughter.<br>
      <br>
      But Ali was not chosen. Instead, the office was given to an
      elderly man whom Mohammed had once asked to lead the daily
      prayers. This first caliph did not live very long, however, and a
      new successor had to be chosen. Again Ali was skipped over. Two
      more caliphs were elected before Ali was finally chosen in A.D.
      656. Five years later he too was dead, the victim of a feud
      between Arab factions that supported him as caliph and those who
      refused to accept his appointment.<br>
      <br>
      The bloodletting associated with the succession issue eventually
      split Islam into two main sects, the Sunnis and the Shiites. The
      Sunnis saw themselves as the upholders of orthodoxy in Islam. They
      contended that the people had a right to elect whomever they
      wished to be caliph. The Shiites, on the other hand, insisted that
      the only legitimate successors were those in whom the blood of the
      Prophet himself flowed. This meant Ali and his descendants.<br>
      <br>
      Although the differences between the two parties appeared to rest
      on the problem of the rightful heir to the office of caliph, the
      animosities were much deeper and involved basic differences in
      racial background and ancient traditions. Racially, the Shiites
      were mainly Persians of Aryan ancestry. It was their custom, based
      on a tradition that reached back to the time of the great Persian
      empire, to be governed by a hereditary monarchy. The Sunnis, who
      represented the majority of Arabs, were Semitic in origin. Their
      custom was to elect leaders on the basis of personal merit., not
      blood line.<br>
      <br>
      Since the Sunnis far outnumbered the Shiites, they exerted the
      dominant influence in Islam. The Shiites, however, refused to
      accept the caliphs chosen by the Sunnis, and instead pledged their
      allegiance to the family of the Prophet. These descendants were
      treated as divinely inspired and divinely appointed interpreters
      of the faith. Obedience to their commands, whatever these might
      be, was regarded as an integral part of the religion of Islam.<br>
      <br>
      Ali's descendants were many in number, however, and while the
      Shiites agreed on the fundamental principle of hereditary
      succession, they were often unable to agree on who that legitimate
      successor ought to be. This internal disagreement resulted in a
      schism within the Shiite party which eventually led to the
      creation of the Ismaili sect, the party to which the Assassins
      belonged.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A House Divided against Itself</b><br>
      <br>
      The precipitating event in the Shiite schism occurred during the
      reign of Caliph Jafar-i-Sadiq. According to Shiite custom, the
      eldest son succeeded his father to the office of caliph. However,
      one day Jafar-i-Sadiq discovered his eldest son, Ismail, drinking
      some wine, an act expressly forbidden by the Koran, the holy book
      of Islam. Outraged at this abomination, the caliph announced that
      his eldest son was unfit to serve as his successor and he
      designated his younger son, Musa, for the job.<br>
      <br>
      While most Shiites accepted the nomination, a small group remained
      loyal to Ismail, claiming that the succession belonged to the
      eldest son. In response to the accusation that Ismail had violated
      the proscription against drinking alcohol, these supporters
      pointed out that the successor-designate was divine and without
      sin. If he drank wine, it was to teach his followers that the
      statements in the Koran against drinking alcohol were to be taken
      figuratively, not literally. Wine, they argued, was a symbol for
      pride and vanity. It was these traits of character that the Koran
      forbade, not the juice of the grape.<br>
      <br>
      But Ismail had few followers compared to the majority of the
      Shiites who recognised Musa as leader. After his death, Ismail's
      supporters went underground and continued in relative obscurity
      while the faithful waited for a new leader to reveal himself and
      restore the House of Ali to its rightful heir. Their patience was
      finally rewarded in the tenth century when the Fatamids, a dynasty
      loyal to the Ismaili doctrine, seized the throne of Egypt. Soon
      after their accession to power, they began sending out
      missionaries throughout the Arab world to make converts to Ismaili
      orthodoxy. One of the converts eventually won over to their side
      was a young Persian named Hasan-ibn-Sabah, who was to become known
      to his enemies as the "Old Man of the Mountains".<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Old Man of the Mountains</b><br>
      <br>
      The two men strolled along the walls of the mountain fortress
      silhouetted against the clear Persian sky. The year was A.D. 1092.
      One of the men was a personal envoy of the sultan. The host was
      Hasan-ibn-Sabah, the "Old Man of the Mountains". The envoy had
      come to demand the surrender of the fortress. There was no use in
      resisting, he attested, for the sultan had more than enough
      soldiers to capture the garrison. Surrender and he and his men
      would be treated with compassion; resist and they would meet Allah
      long before their time.<br>
      <br>
      The ruler of the mountain stronghold listened to the offer in
      silence. When the envoy finished his message, Hasan pointed to a
      guard standing watch high atop a lookout post. The envoy watched
      as his host signalled to the guard and blinked in disbelief as the
      man saluted and threw himself from his post down into the chasm a
      thousand feet below. There were 70,000 more like him., Hasan told
      the startled envoy, all prepared to lay down their lives at his
      slightest bidding. Were the sultan's minions any match for these
      devoted followers? Shaken, the envoy took leave of his host
      wondering if anyone would believe what he had just witnessed.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently the sultan did not believe, for he sent his armies
      against Hasan. It was a mistake. Soon after the abortive attack he
      was murdered, poisoned by one of Hasan's henchmen.<br>
      <br>
      Who was this incredible leader for whom men were prepared to kill
      themselves and others at a mere wave of a hand? Although
      villainized by his enemies, there is no question that
      Hasan-ibn-Sabah was a man of exceptional abilities and
      self-discipline. He was intelligent, ambitious, and ruthless, a
      political opportunist who believed that the ends justified the
      means. He was a man totally lacking in compassion. He demanded
      blind obedience and was prepared to sacrifice those who loyally
      served him without giving their deaths a second thought.<br>
      <br>
      Born in A.D. 1050, Hasan was the son of a Shiite merchant who
      withdrew from society to a monastery and sent his son to an
      orthodox Moslem school. Two of Hasan's classmates were also
      destined for prominence in the Arab world. The first was
      Nizam-al-Mulk, prime minister to two sultans of the Arab empire,
      and the second was Omar Khayyam, tent maker, astronomer, and
      unparalleled poet of the Arab world.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons his father had sent Hasan to this particular
      school was the widely held belief that all who studied there would
      eventually attain great importance. The students were also aware
      of this belief, and one day Nizam, Omar, and Hasan made a pact
      that whosoever of them would fulfil the prediction first would do
      his utmost to help the other two.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest of the three to advance his career was Nizam-al-Mulk
      who rose to a high position in the court of the sultan. As he had
      promised he tried to help his friends. When Omar Khayyam came to
      him for support, Nizam obtained a pension for the poet generous
      enough for him not to be burdened with earning a living, and the
      poet was able to compose his famous Rubaiyat poems without
      distraction.<br>
      <br>
      Next, Hasan presented himself at court. Nizam cordially received
      his other friend and got him an interview with the sultan, who
      took an immediate liking to him and made Hasan his chamberlain.
      But Hasan was overly ambitious. And an ingrate. As soon as he had
      his foot in the palace door, he tried to undermine Nizam in the
      sultan's eyes and install himself in his erstwhile friend's place.<br>
      <br>
      Hasan thought he saw his opportunity when the sultan asked Nizam
      to draw up a record of all the income and expenses of the empire.
      Asked how long such an undertaking would require, Nizam estimated
      a time no less than a year. At this point Hasan jumped in and
      challenged that he could do it in forty days. The sultan was
      greatly pleased at such a possibility and gave him the job
      instead.<br>
      <br>
      True to his word, Hasan had the accounts ready within the
      designated period. But Nizam was not one to be brushed aside so
      easily. By some trick he managed to alter the records, and when
      Hasan presented the accounts to the sultan they were so distorted
      that he was banished from the court for his impertinence. Although
      he protested his innocence, Hasan could not explain how his
      records had been doctored since they were written in his own
      script.<br>
      <br>
      Humiliated but not discouraged, Hasan next journeyed to Egypt
      where he allied himself with the Fatamids and was introduced into
      the secret doctrines of the Ismaili sect.<br>
      <br>
      If Hasan had been searching for some way to gain power, Egypt was
      a well-chosen starting place. The Fatamids had founded a school in
      which they trained recruits in the Ismaili doctrine and in the art
      of assassination. The techniques he would learn at this school
      subsequently proved invaluable to Hasan.<br>
      <br>
      The Egyptian rulers welcomed Hasan to their court when they
      learned of his arrival. A recent member of the sultan's personal
      retinue could bring only prestige to the Fatamid court. But Hasan
      once again involved himself in some chicanery at court and he was
      arrested and thrown into jail. But the moment he entered the
      prison, a minaret broke in two and crashed to the earth. The event
      was seen as a sign that Hasan was no ordinary man. Apprised of the
      coincidence, the Egyptian ruler immediately released Hasan and
      sent him away laden with gifts.<br>
      <br>
      Hasan next made his way to Syria by boat. It was aboard this ship
      that he made his first two converts. These conversions renewed his
      confidence in himself, and immediately upon disembarking, he began
      to spread his message, which became known as the "New Propaganda".<br>
      <br>
      Asserting that Islam and the Ismailis had grown decadent, Hasan
      promised to bring both back on a more righteous course, true to
      Allah's ways. There would have to be sacrifices, however. The
      Ismailis would have to renounce all worldly pleasures. They would
      have to rid themselves of all those things that other men found
      pleasurable. Since the Ismailis at that time were a poor,
      oppressed, discontented people seeking some meaning in a hapless
      existence, Hasan's injunctions entailed little self-denial on
      their part.<br>
      <br>
      Hasan himself was no hypocrite. An ascetic for most of his life,
      years later he expelled one of his followers from the fold for
      flute playing, and executed his own son for a minor frivolity. He
      set the example, and he expected his disciples to follow it.<br>
      <br>
      To those who asked how Allah's ways were to be made known to the
      Ismailis, Hasan answered that a true understanding of that divine
      plan was not possible for the ordinary mind to comprehend. It was
      only possible for a divinely appointed representative to
      understand and make known Allah's ways. Mohammed had been such an
      intermediary. He, Hasan, was another such representative.<br>
      <br>
      Hasan repeatedly emphasized that Allah's ways were too profound to
      comprehend through reason. Utilizing techniques he had learned in
      Egypt, Hasan created doubt in the minds of his audiences
      concerning orthodox Islamic teaching. The more confusion he was
      able to sow, the more dependent on him would his followers become,
      since he was the only source of wisdom. Only through faith and
      blind obedience could they be assured of obtaining salvation.<br>
      <br>
      Once he had convinced a small number of Ismailis that he alone
      comprehended Allah's ways, Hasan instructed them on how to win
      over new members. Each convert thus in turn became a proselytizer.<br>
      <br>
      Captivated by Hasan's dynamic personality, his utter confidence in
      himself, his self-assurance, his conviction that Islam had grown
      decadent and that salvation could only come through him, converts
      began pledging their lives in increasing numbers, often leaving
      behind their wives and children to make their way without husband
      and father.<br>
      <br>
      Hasan's next move was to order his men to infiltrate the mountain
      fortress of Alamut, the "Eagle's Nest", and to make converts of
      the soldiers stationed there. Then, after carefully laying some
      preliminary plans, Hasan approached the commander of the garrison
      and offered him 3000 pieces of gold for all the land under his
      control that could be covered by the hide of an ox. The commander
      thought Hasan mad to make such an offer, but who was he to look
      Allah's gift horse in the mouth? A wide grin appeared on his face
      as the last gold piece was counted out and handed over to him. But
      the grin quickly disappeared as he watched Hasan cut the hide into
      thin strips. The bargain was off, he shouted, as he watched Hasan
      sew the strips together and then march around the fortress.<br>
      <br>
      However, Hasan, was prepared for such a contingency. After
      surrounding the fortress with the ox hide, he produced an order
      signed by a high-ranking government official, a secret convert to
      the "New Propoganda", which ordered the commander to honor the
      terms of the bargain. The commander dutifully obeyed and marched
      out, leaving Hasan in possession of an impressive stronghold. The
      year was A.D. 1090.<br>
      <br>
      Immediately upon moving into Alamut, Hasan inaugurated a series of
      building measures to strengthen the fortification. Canals were dug
      to carry water to the fortress, the fields that surrounded it were
      irrigated, fruit trees were planted, and storerooms were erected.<br>
      <br>
      The point of these improvements was lost on Hasan's enemies who,
      in later generations, mistakenly assumed that he was constructing
      a sort of Paradise to entice new followers to his ranks. These
      mistaken stories were eventually recorded by European travellers
      such as Marco Polo, and through them, Hasan's fortress became
      known to Western readers as a palatial mansion filled with lush
      and exotic plants and populated with beautiful and sensuous women.<br>
      <br>
      There were other fantastic stories told about the ruses Hasan used
      to win over new converts. According to one legend, Hasan had a
      hole dug deep enough for a man to stand in with only his head
      above the ground. The hole was then filled in and a tray was
      fitted around his neck. To increase the effect, fresh blood was
      splashed around the "severed" neck.<br>
      <br>
      Potential candidates were then brought into the room and, after
      fixing each man with his steely gaze, Hasan announced that the
      head would speak to them of the marvellous life that awaited them
      in the other world if they were to obey his commands without
      question. At this point, the confederate opened his eyes and began
      to tell them of the Paradise his soul had recently been admitted
      to as a result of serving Hasan.<br>
      <br>
      The scene made a profound impression on all those who witnessed
      it, and they went away pledging their lives to Hasan. Shortly
      after they left the room, the confederate was actually decapitated
      and his head was prominently displayed so that no one would ever
      have second thoughts about having been duped. In this story,
      however, there is no mention of any drug being administered to
      either the initiates or the unfortunate victim.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The "Devoted Ones"</b><br>
      <br>
      With Alamut as his base of operations, Hasan began to organize his
      followers into various grades or degrees of office. At the top he
      naturally placed himself, giving his position the title of grand
      master. Next came the grand priors, the overseers, who directed
      the activities of the sect and apprised Hasan of all important
      developments. Below them came the dais, or missionaries, who
      disseminated the "propoganda" of the sect throughout the Middle
      East. The fourth and fifth orders made up the bulk of members of
      the sect. They admitted their allegiance to the grand master and
      supported the movement in various ways, usually through donations.
      The sixth group was called the fidais, the "devoted ones". These
      were the enforcers. It was their job to carry out the orders of
      their superiors.<br>
      <br>
      Once a fidai received his orders, he was committed to only one
      purpose - carrying out those instructions, no matter what the
      obstacles or the consequences to his own life. He would persevere
      for months, waiting for the right moment to strike. No matter that
      he would be captured and killed on the spot. The only thing that
      mattered was the mission. To die in the performance of his duty
      was a privilege and a ticket to Paradise. This disregard for death
      made the Assassins the most feared gang of cutthroats in the
      Middle East.<br>
      <br>
      Arab sultans, princes, and prime ministers as well as many eminent
      Crusaders all fell victim to these daggermen. With the
      assassination of Conrad, marquis of Monteferrat, however, the
      reputation of the "Old Man of the Mountains" spread far beyond the
      Middle East to the far reaches of Western Europe. The fidai
      responsible for the murder spent six months disguised as a monk in
      the camp of the Crusaders, waiting for just the right opportunity.
      Finally, the moment came and, in full view of the marquis'
      attendants, the assassin plunged his dagger into Conrad's body.<br>
      <br>
      Once their reputation had spread throughout the Middle East, it
      was no longer necessary for the Assassins to liquidate their
      enemies. Often, all that was required was a threat. On one
      occasion, for example, Saladin, one of the most able Arab generals
      of that era, decided that the Assassins had to be put in their
      place and he mounted a campaign to take the Alamut fortress.
      Shortly before the siege, however, he awoke one night to find a
      dagger stuck in the ground beside him. Attached to the knife was a
      curt message advising him to reconsider. Saladin wisely changed
      his mind and directed his efforts elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      How was it that Hasan was able to enlist such a devoted band of
      selfless followers who were more than willing to lay down their
      lives at his bidding?<br>
      <br>
      According to Marco Polo, Hasan kept his men blindly loyal to his
      will by convincing them that should they die in his service, they
      would be certain to enter Paradise.<br>
      <br>
      This theme appears also in the story of the "severed" head and in
      an anecdote related by an emissary to the emperor Frederick
      Barbarossa in A.D. 1175. According to this report,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Hasan had] many of the sons and daughters
      brought up from early childhood... These young men are taught by
      their teachers from their earliest youth to their full manhood,
      that they must obey the lord of their land in all his words and
      commands; and that if they do so, he, who has power over all
      living gods, will give them the joys of Paradise... When they are
      in the presence of the Prince, he asks them if they are willing to
      obey his commands, so that he may bestow Paradise upon them...
      They throw themselves at his feet and reply with fervor that they
      will obey him... Thereupon the Prince gives each one of them a
      golden dagger and sends them out to kill whichever prince he has
      marked down.[9]<br>
      <br>
      In all the stories about Hasan's ability to instil blind loyalty
      in his followers, the one common element is the promise of
      entering Paradise in return for serving the grand master. Only in
      Marco Polo's account is there any mention of a drug.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What's in a Name?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the most puzzling questions about the Assassins is how they
      got their name. The members of the sect never referred to
      themselves as such. They called each other fidais, "devoted ones".
      Only their enemies called them Assassins.<br>
      <br>
      In a report to Frederick Barbarossa, ruler of the Holy Roman
      Empire, they are called Heyssessini. William, Archbishop of Tyre,
      wrote that "both our people and the Saracens called them
      Assissini," but, he adds, "we do not know the origin of the
      name."[10]<br>
      <br>
      By the thirteenth century, however, the word "assassin" and its
      variants were being used in Europe in the sense of a paid
      professional killer. The word was derived from the name of the
      sect, but no one suggested that they got that name because of
      their usage of hashish, although a twelfth-century friar, Abbot
      Arnold of Lubeck, did state that the Assassins used hashish: "hemp
      raises them to a state of ecstasy or falling, or intoxicates them.
      Their sorcerers draw near and exhibit to the sleepers, phantasms,
      pleasures and amusement. Then they promise that these delights
      will become perpetual if the orders given them are executed with
      the daggers provided."[11]<br>
      <br>
      Travel books such as the seventeenth-century Purchas His Pilgrimis
      repeated Marco Polo's story about a mysterious potion but made no
      mention of hashish. Another writer of that era, Denis Lebey de
      Batilly, wrote only that the name given to the sect by its enemies
      was Arabic for hired killer.<br>
      <br>
      Various other explanations were subsequently proposed, among them
      that the name was derived from "asas", a word meaning foundation,
      which was applied to the religious leaders of Islam; that assassin
      was derived from the Arabic word hassas, which, among other
      things, meant "to kill"; or that the name was applied to the
      followers of Hasan.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Tale of the Hashish Eater</b><br>
      <br>
      Between A.D. 1000 and 1700, a collection of stories from the Arab
      world came into being which today are known as The Thousand and
      One Nights. Although loosely joined, the thread that holds the
      collection together is the delightful fantasy of how a wily young
      harem girl enchanted the sultan and saved her life. It was through
      these stories that most Europeans first learned of hashish.<br>
      <br>
      According to the storyline, the sultan Shahriyar had ordained that
      each of his future wives was to be put to the death the morning
      after consummating their marriage nuptials. This ritual went on
      through several wives until Scheherazade, the daughter of the
      grand vizier, tricked the sultan into revoking this postamatory
      rite.<br>
      <br>
      The ruse she used consisted of telling the sultan an amusing story
      on the night of their marriage and then breaking it off in the
      middle, promising to finish it the next night. But each night she
      also started a new story, breaking that one off as well so that it
      would have to be ended the next night. In this way she succeeded
      in delaying her execution for a thousand and one nights, until at
      last the sultan became so enamored of this spinner of tales that
      he fell in love with her and decided to cancel his former edict.<br>
      <br>
      One of the stories Scheherazade amused the sultan with was called
      "The Tale of the Hashish Eater", and in it she recounted the saga
      of a hashish user who had been reduced to poverty as a result of
      wasting his savings on his drug and on women. Yet by means of his
      cherished drug, he was able to escape into a dream world where he
      was no longer a beggar but a handsome and prosperous lover.<br>
      <br>
      One day this pauper took some hashish in a public bath and dropped
      off into a dream in which he was transported into an enchanting
      room filled with beautiful flowers and the smell of exotic
      perfumes. All this time, however, he sensed that this was only a
      dream and that it would not be long before his presence in the
      public bath would be noticed and he would be beaten and thrown
      out. Even so, he continued to enjoy the dream.<br>
      <br>
      As he fell deeper into his reverie, he saw himself being carried
      to another luxurious room filled with soft, plush cushions where
      he was sexually aroused by a sensuous slave girl. Just as he was
      about to embrace the girl, he was awakened from his dream by the
      laughter of the patrons in the bath who had become highly amused
      at the sight of this tumescent beggar. And just as he foresaw, he
      was beaten and ejected from the premises.<br>
      <br>
      Readers of this story were not only amused by it, they were also
      able to appreciate the state of "double consciousness" the beggar
      found himself in as a result of taking hashish. in this state, the
      hashish user hallucinates, but he is also aware that he is
      hallucinating - he does not lose complete touch with reality.
      Hashish causes him to dream, but it enables him to remain
      conscious of his dream so that he can appreciate the images and
      themes his mind is producing. It was this aspect of the hashish
      experience that was later to intrigue European writers, especially
      the French Romantic authors of the middle and latter part of the
      nineteenth century, for in this mysterious drug of the Arab world
      they saw untold possibilities of delving into the hitherto buried
      niches of the human mind.<br>
      <br>
      The debasing influence of hashish was not the only theme in
      popular Arab literature. The ways in which the drug corrupted high
      officials also delighted audiences and readers. One such favorite
      anecdote tells of a hashish "pusher" who was apprehended and
      brought to court to appear before a judge presiding over a
      community that did not permit the use of hashish. This "pusher"
      had been fined on many occasions for his illegal activities, but
      to no avail. He simply paid his fine and went back to selling his
      illegal wares.<br>
      <br>
      Fed up with this unrepentant drug peddler, the judge finally
      threatened him with a huge fine if he did not permanently cease
      his offensive activities. Faced with the threat of an exorbitant
      penalty, the "pusher" agreed to find another means of earning a
      living. To make sure that there would be no misunderstanding, the
      judge made the man swear an oath in which he enumerated all the
      different names and preparations, many were completely new to him
      and he suggested that since the judge knew so much about the
      subject he ought to administer the oath to himself as well![12]<br>
      <br>
      A similar story tells of the hypocrisy and quick thinking of a
      Moslem priest. During a wild and animated sermon in which he was
      haranguing his audience on the evils of hashish, his tunic opened
      and a bag of the vile drug fell to the ground right before the
      startled eyes of the onlookers. Without hesitating an instant, the
      priest pointed to the bag and shouted, "This is the demon of which
      I warned you; the force of my words have put it to flight, take
      care that in leaving me, it does not throw itself on one of you
      and enslave him." The crowd continued to listen to his sermon, but
      their eyes were glued on the hashish. Yet no one dared to pick it
      up. After the priest finished, the parishioners dispersed, leaving
      only the priest and the bag of hashish, which the holy man
      promptly picked up and stuffed back into his tunic.[13]<br>

      <b>Hashish and the Arab World: Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Every culture has some kind of escape hatch, some ersatz respite
      from the overburdening realities of everyday existence. For over a
      thousand years, hashish has been this escape hatch for a large
      segment of Arab society.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest groups to use hashish on a large scale were the
      Sufis, an economically and socially despised sector of Moslem
      society, who justified their use of the drug, to themselves at
      least, as a way of communicating with their god.<br>
      <br>
      The association of hashish with the Sufis had the effects of
      identifying it as a contemptible substance, a drug that sapped a
      man's energy and his willingness to work, a drug that made him a
      pariah rather then a contributor to his community. The lowly
      social standing of the poor was attributed to their use of
      hashish, and the very term "hashish user" became an insulting
      epithet for what the upper classes regarded as the social misfits
      of their society. Thus, when the Arabs spoke of someone such as
      Hasan or his followers as "ashishin" (or Assassins, as the
      Crusaders pronounced the word), they were referring to them
      figuratively and abusively. Whether the Assassins did or did not
      use hashish was immaterial.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, it was because of the association of this term with
      the infamous band of cutthroats, the resourceful terrorists of the
      Middle Ages, that many centuries later hashish gained for itself a
      reputation as a drug that inspired mayhem.<br>
      <br>
      Curiously, the Arabs themselves have never regarded hashish as a
      drug which inspires violence. Perhaps the Arabs are simply too
      familiar with the actions of hashish to attribute violence to its
      seemingly endless list of effects. Yet in America, a country with
      a history of violence and little familiarity with cannabis as a
      mind-altering substance, hashish was to become known as the
      "killer drug".<br>

      </b><b>Rope and Riches</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1896, a German archaeologist, Hermann Busse, unearthed an
      ancient tomb at Wilmersdorf, near modern-day Brandenburg, which
      contained a funerary urn dating back to the Fifth century B.C. It
      was not the oldest grave to be discovered in Europe. People had
      been living in what is now Europe for thousands of years and
      remnants of their existence were not uncommon. The thing that made
      Busse'e discovery unique was that the funerary urn that had lain
      buried in the earth for almost 2500 years contained various
      identifiable plant fragments, among them cannabis seeds.[1]<br>
      <br>
      How did these seeds get there? Did the Scythians penetrate this
      far west in their restless search for new lands and people to
      conquer? Hiero II of Greece had sent men to the Rhone Valley in
      France in the third century B.C., but this discovery placed
      cannabis in northern Europe 200 years before that, and indicates
      that even at this early date, cannabis had acquired a special
      significance in the burial rites of the dead.<br>
      <br>
      A thousand years later, the limestone tomb of the French queen
      Arnegunde, who was buried around A.D. 570 in Paris, likewise
      contained cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      As was typical of the crypts in which the medieval French nobility
      were laid to rest, Arnegunde's tomb was lavishly furnished with
      precious objects. Gold coins, rich jewellery, and costly garments
      were all interred with the dead to guarantee that they would enjoy
      as comfortable a life in the next world as that from which their
      souls had just departed.<br>
      <br>
      The buckles on her shoes and garters were made of silver. Around
      her neck was a gold broach. At the side of her temples were gold
      pins which held a veil of red satin over her face. On each ear was
      a gold filigree earring. Her body was dressed in violet silk and
      rested on a bright-red blanket over which was draped a cloth made
      from hemp,[2] a material apparently deserving of this place of
      honor among the rich and elegant burial wardrobe of the French
      nobility during the early Middle Ages.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis in one form or another has been found in other parts of
      Europe as well during this early period of history. Hempen ropes,
      for instance, have been found in a well from a Roman fort in
      Dunbartonshire, Britain, which was occupied between A.D. 140 and
      180. However, modern scientific studies of pollen in soil samples
      shows that cannabis was not cultivated in England until around
      A.D. 400[3] when the Anglo-Saxons migrated to the island from
      their homes in mainland Europe. Since they had no way of knowing
      if there would be enough cannabis in the lands they conquered to
      meet their needs, the Romans took hemp ropes with them. When these
      ropes wore out, orders were sent back home for replacements. The
      pieces of hemp rope from Dunbartonshire were thus made elsewhere
      and sent to England as part of the supplies needed for the
      occupation.<br>
      <br>
      Hempen ropes have also been found in Iceland among artefacts that
      date back to the early Middle Ages. These ropes were carried there
      by the intrepid Vikings, for whom strong rope often meant the
      difference between survival or disaster in the vast uncharted
      Atlantic. Pieces of cloth and fishing line made from hemp have
      also been discovered in Viking graves in Norway, and cannabis
      seeds have been found in the remains of Viking ships that date
      back to A.D. 850.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis in its various forms was thus no stranger to Western
      Europe by the beginning of the Middle Ages. However, it was the
      Italians who began the first large-scale cultivation of the plant
      and eventually turned hemp into haute couture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Virgins and the Pirates</b><br>
      <br>
      During the Middle Ages, the Italians ruled the seas and nothing
      surpassed the strength and durability of the hempen ropes with
      which their ships were outfitted. To maintain their supremacy on
      the seas, the Italians had to be assured that their supplies of
      hemp fiber would not be jeopardized by foreign control of hemp.
      Only by raising their own crop of the precious fiber could they be
      certain that Italian shipbuilders would never be blackmailed by
      foreign suppliers. Foremost among those who promoted domestic
      production of hemp were the merchants and shipbuilders from the
      city of canals and gondolas.<br>
      <br>
      Although Venice emerged as one of Italy's most powerful
      city-states, initially it was but a swamp village at the head of
      the Adriatic Sea and it was only goaded into asserting its
      dominance by the abduction of its virgins by a gang of daring
      pirates.<br>
      <br>
      The event that led to Venice's rise to a major sea power began
      inauspiciously enough on February 1, A.D. 945. For centuries, all
      Venetian marriages took place on the first day of February. It was
      an event celebrated with great pomp and ceremony by rich and poor
      alike. It was a day of expectation, excitement, anticipation - a
      day of love.<br>
      <br>
      From all parts of the city they came, the young radiant girls of
      Venice and their proud mothers and fathers. Their destination -
      the Church of San Pietro di Castello in the eastern sector of the
      city. At the church door, the nervous bridegrooms rubbed their
      hands and shuffled their feet. Inside, the bishop was giving
      last-minute instructions to the choirboys. The doge (ruler) was
      seated in the front row, ready to give his blessing as well to the
      newlyweds.<br>
      <br>
      The people of Venice were wealthy and respected, but they had
      their enemies. Among those who eyed their money with envy was a
      gang of resourceful pirates whose base of operations was the
      seaports of Dalmatia located opposite Venice on the other side of
      the Adriatic Sea. From these harbors the pirates ventured out in
      search of booty, plundering far and wide - the entire
      Mediterranean Sea their prey. No ship was safe once it left port.
      Even the Venetians paid extortion money when it was demanded,
      preferring to surrender some of their profits than to challenge
      the pirates and possibly lose everything.<br>
      <br>
      Like most people who lived around the Adriatic Sea, the Dalmatian
      pirates knew of the annual nuptials about to be performed in
      Venice. Acting as much out of villainy as greed, the pirates
      decided to humiliate the Venetians by kidnapping their blushing
      brides on their wedding night. After all, what better time to
      attack? No one would be expecting them. The men would be too drunk
      to offer much resistance. And the women would both satisfy their
      lustful appetites and bring a bountiful ransom.<br>
      <br>
      Silently they meandered their ships into Venetian waters. A token
      force was left to guard the boats while the main group of pirates
      stealthily made their way toward the Church of San Pietro. In the
      distance, the pirates could hear the music and celebrations. They
      grinned at one another. The plan was going well.<br>
      <br>
      They struck at midnight. Swooping down on the unsuspecting
      merrymakers, the pirates burst into the midst of the festivities,
      and before anyone realized what had happened, the pirates were
      back aboard their ships with the irate brides and a cargo full of
      expensive wedding presents.<br>
      <br>
      The raid caught the Venetians by surprise, but somehow the tipsy
      bridegrooms managed to sober themselves. Soon the whole city was
      aroused. From every quarter the men rushed to the port, swearing
      revenge on the pirates. At the head of the rescue mission was the
      doge himself.<br>
      <br>
      The Venetian ships skimmed over the waves. Not an inch of canvas
      was left unfurled. Not only was the virtue of their women at
      stake, the honor of Venice itself had been besmirched. The gap
      between the fleeing pirates and the pursuing bridegrooms finally
      closed at Carole. The Venetians were inflamed, but the pirates
      were wily fighters. The battle waged for hours. When the smoke
      finally cleared, however, the brides were back with their husbands
      and those pirates who had managed to remain alive were in full
      flight. From that day on, the scene of the battle was called the
      Porto della Damigelle, the Port of Young Women.<br>
      <br>
      The pirates had lost the battle, but the war was unresolved.
      Finally, in A.D. 1000 the Venetians decided that they had had
      enough. They had beaten the pirates before, they could do it
      again. On Ascension Day, the doge assembled all the fighting men
      and all the ships in Venice and set sail toward Dalmatia. Up and
      down the coast they hunted their pirate quarry. Every city that
      gave refuge was attacked and punished. No longer would anyone dare
      to threaten Venetian shipping. Her enemies were no more. Venice
      was now undisputed sovereign of the Adriatic and the
      Mediterranean.<br>
      <br>
      It was the Crusades, however, which saw the emergence of Venice
      from a Mediterranean to a world power. Owing to its strategic port
      location, Venice was able to demand huge fees to transport the
      Crusaders from Europe to the Holy Land. Venice supported the war
      against the Moslem infidels, but its Christian fervor had a price.
      With each Crusade, Venice's power increased. By A.D. 1200, Venice
      had control over all the trade in three-quarters of what remained
      of the ancient Roman Empire. Virtually anything that moved across
      the Adriatic, the Aegean, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and
      the Sea of Marmara sailed in Venetian ships. From outposts in the
      conquered Moslem cities of Sidon and Tyre, Venice also controlled
      the entire trade route from Constantinople to Western Europe.
      Venice had become the trade merchant of the world.<br>
      <br>
      This preeminence among European powers continued until the middle
      of the fifteenth century. With the discovery of an Atlantic route
      around the Cape of Good Hope to the Far East in A.D. 1486,
      European ships no longer had to sail by way of the Mediterranean
      to gain access to the East. This discovery, more than any other
      single event, initiated Venice's gradual decline to a second-rate
      power. Venice's demise did not happen overnight, however. The city
      remained a wealthy and important influence in the world until
      almost the end of the eighteenth century when it was finally
      conquered in 1797 by Napoleon and was made into an Austrian
      possession.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Venetian Hemp Guild</b><br>
      <br>
      In Italy, hemp was once called quello delle cento operazioni, "the
      substance of a hundred operations", because of the many processes
      to which the plant was subjected before its fibers could be used.<br>
      <br>
      long before the days of automation, young girls would assemble in
      the houses where hemp was to be split and they would work well
      into the night preparing hemp for the craft industries. It was not
      easy work. Each girl took five or six stalks in one hand and what
      remained of the roots in the hollow of her other hand. Then, with
      a quick snap, she broke the stalk about twelve inches from the
      root. Next, she crooked the middle finger of her left hand and
      passed the fibers through the crook. While the thumb and
      forefinger of her right hand still held the unbroken part of the
      stalk, she grasped the woody part of the stem and pulled it away
      from its fibers.<br>
      <br>
      The stripped fibers were held between the thumb and little finger
      of her left hand and they were twisted into a coil. The coils were
      then placed in piles to be beaten and swingled. Beating involved
      pounding the fibers to make them soft. First, the fibers were tied
      into tight round bundles. If the beating were to be done by hand,
      the bundles were placed on a stone and were either pounded
      manually with a heavy wooden mallet or flayed with a whip. In hemp
      mills, the pounding action was done by rolling a heavy millstone
      over the hemp manually or by a water wheel.<br>
      <br>
      Next the hemp was swingled. This was done by placing the hemp
      strands over a wooden board and removing any visible splinters.
      The last main step was combing - the separation of any fibers that
      still clung together by passing them through a rough and then a
      fine-toothed comb.<br>
      <br>
      Very often these tasks were done in groups and they took on the
      atmosphere of a social get-together, much like the American sewing
      and quilting bees. In many villages, the townspeople worked on the
      hemp at night in someone's home and ended the evening on a festive
      note with games and dancing.<br>
      <br>
      Whether hemp was processed in private homes or in large factories,
      the end product was fiber that was without equal for strength and
      durability. The Venetian Senate recognized the importance of hemp
      fiber for its shipbuilding and trade industries, and to ensure
      that Venetian hemp standards would remain high, it established a
      state-run factory called the Tana to oversee the quality of all
      the hemp that was processed into the rigging and anchor lines of
      the Venetian fleet. On "the manufacture of cordage in our home of
      the Tana," declared the Senate, rests "the security of our galleys
      and ships and similarly of our sailors and capital."[5]<br>
      <br>
      According to Venetian statutes, all rigging for Venetian ships had
      to be manufactured from the highest grade of hemp. Unfortunately,
      the best hemp came from Bologna, and the Florentines who owned the
      Bolognese fields charged exorbitant prices for the commodity.
      Although it had no intention of using inferior hemp in its ships,
      the Tana tried to dupe the Florentines into believing that because
      of their high prices, Venice was going to import a lower and
      cheaper quality of hemp from Montagnana. The ruse worked and the
      Florentines lowered their prices, a compromise that fattened
      Venetian pockets considerably.<br>
      <br>
      Even with the lowered price, however, Bolognese hemp was still
      more expensive than Montagnese, so the Venetians decided to try
      and cut their costs even more by improving the quality of hemp
      grown around Montegnana. As part of its plan, the Venetian Senate
      hired a Bolognese hemp expert, Michele di Burdrio, to teach the
      Montegneseans how to grow a better quality of hemp. Such corporate
      looting was not regarded very favorably by the people of Bologna,
      and for divulging the closely guarded secrets of his homeland, di
      Burdrio was banished perpetually from his native city and all his
      property was confiscated. The Venetians, however, were prepared to
      compensate him for his losses, financial or otherwise. Di Burdrio
      received a handsome salary, a monetary settlement equal to his
      losses, and his descendants were hired as salaried supervisors in
      the hemp fields for many generations thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the improvements in Montagnese hemp that followed the
      hiring of di Burdrio, the overall quality of the Montagnese
      product remained inferior to the Bolognese variety, and the Tana
      insisted the two varieties be clearly labelled. To ensure that the
      inferior product would not inadvertently find itself destined for
      one of the city's important shipping districts, procedures were
      implemented so that the two varieties of hemp would never be
      together in the same room. First-grade Bologna hemp also carried a
      white label attached to it, while first-grade Montagnana hemp was
      identified by means of a green label. In this way, the buyer was
      sure of the material he was purchasing.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp spinners in Venice all belonged to a craft union and were
      paid according to the quantity of work they produced rather than
      on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage. Those who were employed
      by the Tana were closely supervised by factory foremen. Each
      spinner was given a specially marked bobbin so that his work could
      be easily identified. Removal of these "trademarks" or the use of
      someone else's bobbin was considered a criminal offence punishable
      by whipping and/or dismissal from the craft for up to ten years.
      Foremen regularly inspected all ropes made by Tana spinners and
      inferior workmanship was also punishable by fines.<br>
      <br>
      By insisting on only the highest grade of hemp and by enforcing
      rigid codes of excellence in her rope factories, Venice outfitted
      a fleet second to none in Europe. Any cargoes, whatever their
      value, had a better chance of reaching their destination if
      carried by a Venetian ship than by any other vessel. Because of
      its superiority, the Venetian merchant marine dominated the
      Mediterranean for centuries, an accomplishment due in no small
      measure to the high quality of raw materials such as hemp which
      went into each and every one of her sea-going armada.<br>
      <br>
      During the nineteenth century, Italy became one of the world's
      main hemp-producing centers, supplying hemp fiber to Switzerland,
      Germany, England, Portugal, and Spain. It was not for cord or
      heavy rope that Italian hemp was prized, however, but for the fine
      fabric and clothes that could be manufactured from its whitish
      fiber. In skilled Italian hands, hemp fiber was turned into a
      thread that almost equalled silk in its delicacy. It was much
      finer than cotton and certainly much stronger. Two and one-half
      pounds of hemp, for instance, could be spun into 600 miles of lace
      threads![6] For those who could afford them, tablecloths and
      specially designed dresses spun from fine Italian hemp were prized
      possessions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hemp Magic</b><br>
      <br>
      In keeping with hemp's importance as a major agricultural crop,
      carious customs and ceremonies based on the homeopathic magical
      principle that like begets like were performed during the Middle
      Ages expressly to influence the growth of the hemp plant in the
      forthcoming year.<br>
      <br>
      In many parts of Europe, for instance, peasant farmers kindled
      huge bonfires and danced around or leaped over the flames. The
      idea was that just as the flames and dancers soared into the air,
      so too would the hemp crop grow high into the sky. So seriously
      did the peasants regard these hemp dances, writes the noted
      anthropologist Sir James G. Frazer, that anyone not contributing
      to the fire could look forward to a bad crop next year and "his
      hemp in particular would not grow".[7]<br>
      <br>
      In parts of France, to make doubly sure that the hemp harvest
      would be good, the women dancers performed their leaps while
      slightly drunk.[8] Unfortunately, we do not know if this
      drunkenness was another instance of the magical belief in like
      begetting like - the drunkenness of the women influencing the
      production of psychoactive plant material.<br>
      <br>
      Another French custom designed to influence the hemp growth was
      for the farmer to hitch up his trousers as high as possible while
      he sowed his hemp seeds in the hope that the hemp plants would
      grow to the height he had raised his pants.[9]<br>
      <br>
      In many parts of Europe, it was also customary for farmers to sow
      their hemp seed on days dedicated to the celebration of saints
      remembered as being rather tall. By asking for the help of these
      tall saints, the peasants believed their hemp would also be
      tall.[10]<br>
      <br>
      Various other customs were followed to coax hemp into growing
      tall. In some countries, the hemp dances were performed on
      rooftops. In Germany, hemp seeds were flung high into the air in
      the hope that the stalks of these seeds would be able to find
      their way back into the air one day.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Yet another quaint custom related to hemp growing involved the
      election of a King and Queen of the Bean on the Twelfth Day (the
      Epiphany, January 6). As part of this custom, which began in the
      sixteenth century, a huge cake was baked on the eve of the Twelfth
      Day. Two beans were then inserted into the cake. Pieces of cake
      were then distributed and whoever got the beans became the King
      and Queen of the Bean.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as the king and queen were chosen, they were saluted and
      hoisted onto the soldiers of their subjects so that they could
      make crosses on the beams of the houses. These crosses were
      supposed to protect the houses during the coming year against evil
      spirits. But the real point of the selection was augury: it was an
      attempt to peer into the future to determine what the next year's
      hemp crop would be like. If the king were taller than the queen,
      then the male plant would be taller than the female (and the fiber
      would therefore be better). If the queen were taller, then the
      female hemp plants would be taller and the fiber would nor be as
      good.[12]<br>
      <br>
      In the Balkans, an ancient folk ritual (still practised in the
      early part of the twentieth century) involved not so much dancing
      as running through a circle of burning hemp. As the peasants
      scampered through the flames, they chanted in unison: "We have
      been in the fire and not been burnt, we have been in the midst of
      illness and not caught it."[13]<br>
      <br>
      Behind this ceremony is the idea that fire has a cleansing action
      and can thus protect people from disease. The reason the fires
      were made of hemp is unknown, but no doubt it was because of
      hemp's connection with magic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>In Search of Gold</b><br>
      <br>
      Between A.D. 1400 and 1700, Western Europe was gradually
      transformed from a backward provincial potpourri of motley nations
      into a nationalistically minded assembly of world-conquering and
      world-colonizing empires. The Cinderella-like metamorphosis came
      about largely as a result of a technological innovation. First
      introduced by the Mediterranean nations and subsequently copied
      and improved on by Western Europe, the innovation that changed the
      course of history was the triangular sail.<br>
      <br>
      By suspending a triangular sail from an oblique yardarm, sailors
      could sail against the wind. Hitherto, the square sail was the
      only means of propelling a ship, and most vessels were outfitted
      with only a single mast. After the triangular sail, galleons with
      three or four masts became commonplace and European ships began
      embarking from the safety of their ports to challenge the winds
      and the oceans of the world.<br>
      <br>
      The triangular sail opened up new possibilities. The Italians had
      a solid hold on the Mediterranean. North Africa and the Middle
      East were controlled by the Arabs. Below Egypt lay the vast
      wastelands of the Sahara. Caravans sometimes trickled across the
      hot sands with their precious chests of gold, spices, and silks,
      but the journey was too hazardous and too costly to rely on an
      overland route to India and the Far East. Until the heroic
      rounding of the Cape of Good Hope in 1488 by the Portuguese
      adventurer Bartholomew Diaz, Western Europe had to be satisfied
      with its subordinate position.<br>
      <br>
      But the triangular sail altered the balance of power and allowed
      Europe to master the treacherous winds that hitherto had made long
      voyages down the coast of Africa, and subsequently across the
      Atlantic, almost impossible feats of navigation. Beginning in the
      fifteenth century, the Portuguese king popularly known to history
      as Prince Henry the Navigator set out to break the monopoly of the
      Italians and the Arabs. Henry's ultimate goal was to make Portugal
      master of the trade routes to the East, and to accomplish his
      goal, he was prepared to meet any expense.<br>
      <br>
      Portugal was not a large country, however. During the fifteenth
      century it had fewer than a million people, most of whom were
      peasant farmers. What land there was was not very fertile. Most of
      it was stony. Only the river valleys were productive. During the
      Middle Ages, much of Portugal's food had to be imported from other
      countries.<br>
      <br>
      Portugal's main economic asset was its long coastline with its
      teeming schools of fish. But fishing did not give Portugal a
      positive trade balance and the country was deeply in debt.
      Portugal needed gold. The Italians had it; the Portuguese wanted
      it.<br>
      <br>
      There were two ways to get gold: take it from the Italians, or
      find some new route to some country, hitherto inaccessible, where
      gold was produced or where goods were made that could be sold for
      gold. Portugal wisely chose the latter alternative.<br>
      <br>
      To get the gold Portugal needed, Henry's plan called for Portugal
      to outflank the Arabs in Africa by joining with a legendary hero
      of the Christian world, Prester John, whose headquarters were
      believed to be located somewhere in Africa. Since Prester John was
      said to command an army of millions, an alliance with his forces
      would certainly lead to victory over the Arabs and would result in
      a transfer of the trade monopoly from the Arabs and their Italian
      business partners to the Portuguese.<br>
      <br>
      The Portuguese never linked up with Prester John. They couldn't
      have. He didn't exist. But their search for the elusive champion
      of Christianity got Portugal the gold she needed - at least for a
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Every time Portuguese captains touched port in Africa, a new
      Portuguese outpost was established. It was not long before
      Portuguese ships were returning to Portugal laden with gold,
      ivory, and spices, just as Henry had dreamed.<br>
      <br>
      Ten years after Diaz successfully rounded the Cape of Good Hope,
      another Portuguese adventurer, Vasco da Gama, dropped anchor in
      the waters off Calcutta and laid claim to the whole subcontinent
      in the name of the Portuguese monarch.<br>
      <br>
      The empire which Portugal established in Africa and India was not
      based on colonization, however. Instead, the Portuguese erected a
      string of forts and naval bases. In this way she hoped to beat off
      rival nations who might also be looking for some foothold in these
      lands.<br>
      <br>
      But aspire to greatness though she might, the territories which
      Portugal claimed were simply too vast and far-flung for her to
      retain control over. Portugal was too small a nation with too
      small a population to govern and maintain her newly acquired
      colonies. In addition to establishing a bureaucracy in each
      territory, she needed ships and sailors to man a navy large enough
      to guarantee the safety of her merchant marine and defend her
      colonial possessions.<br>
      <br>
      Even if Portugal had had the manpower, the resources necessary to
      govern such an empire would have cut deeply into the profits
      gained from exploitation of these colonies. When rival Western
      nations finally began to flex their muscles at the beginning of
      the seventeenth century, tiny Portugal was forced to consolidate
      its holdings, and claims to vast territories in Africa and India
      had to be abandoned. Into the power vacuum sailed the Dutch and
      the English.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Confrontation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Dutch were the first to challenge Portugal's domination of the
      East. Late in the sixteenth century, the Dutch East India Company
      established its overseas headquarters at Batavia on the island of
      Java. From this outpost, it quickly took control of the spice
      trade and deliberately destroyed plant life in the East Indies to
      dry up supply sources. The effect of an increasing demand for
      sugar, cinnamon, and other spices, and a market deliberately
      crippled through manipulation of raw materials, was a skyrocketing
      increase in prices. The wealthier the Dutch became, the harder
      they tried to keep other nations from securing a foothold of their
      own in the rich spice lands of the East.<br>
      <br>
      While the Portuguese and the Dutch were staking claims to the East
      Indies and Spain was establishing colonies in the New World,
      England was slowly coming to the realization that she was being
      left out of one of the greatest moneymaking opportunities ever to
      present itself to the European economy. One of the main reasons
      England was unable to compete was that she lacked the ships
      necessary for exploration and trade. To expand her economy and
      keep up with her European rivals, England had to build new ships
      and develop new trade routes. And if she hoped to be able to
      protect her merchant ships from attack, she had to have a navy
      capable of repulsing an enemy. To build such a fleet, she needed
      raw materials. In 1562, both Holland and England sent ships to the
      Baltic countries for these supplies. The Dutch sent 1192 vessels.
      The English sent as many as they could muster - 51.<br>
      <br>
      The situation was acute and England rose to meet the challenge.
      Spurred on by hopes of sharing in the new riches of overseas
      trade, English mercantilists sponsored the building of more and
      more ships. A new mercantile industry, legalized piracy, or
      privateering as it became known, also stimulated the demand for
      ships, and huge profits from goods commandeered on the high seas
      whetted English business appetites even more.<br>
      <br>
      With her growing successes on the seas, and her support for
      Protestant causes in Europe, the new upstart could no longer be
      ignored. Spain, whose ships dominated the Atlantic, began to make
      hostile overtures. A confrontation was brewing. In 1587, war was
      finally declared.<br>
      <br>
      The great naval clash came in 1588. Under the swashbuckling
      privateer Sir Francis Drake, the English prepared to fight the
      Spanish for control of the Atlantic. The Spanish plan of attack
      had two objectives. The first was to gain control of the English
      Channel; the second was to land a large military force in England.
      The troops to be used in the invasion were to consist of soldiers
      brought from Spain and from Spanish garrisons in the Netherlands.<br>
      <br>
      The Spanish sent out 130 ships carrying 29,305 sailors, oarsmen,
      and soldiers. Opposing them was an English fleet of 197 ships
      manned by some 16,000 men. The cannons carried by the Spanish were
      most effective at close range. The English relied more on
      small-calibre cannons that could demolish the rigging of an enemy
      at a distance, thereby crippling them and making them vulnerable
      to attack.<br>
      <br>
      Although outnumbered, the English crews were better trained than
      the Spanish and the English artillery was manned by more
      experienced gunners than those who manned the Spanish weaponry.
      The Spanish in their huge ocean-going galleons also found it
      difficult to manoeuvre in the stormy waters of the English
      Channel, and when the two navies finally met, the great Spanish
      Armada had its bows slung full of grapeshot by the smaller, more
      manoeuvrable English vessels.<br>
      <br>
      The Spanish never recovered from the humiliation of that defeat
      and the victory established England as the leading naval power in
      Europe. Now there was nothing to prevent her from founding her own
      colonial empire across the seas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>England's Need for Hemp</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Even before the fateful battle in the English Channel, the kings
      of England recognized the need for hemp if their realm were ever
      to compete with Europe. Initially, the monarchs tried to coerce
      their subjects to raise hemp. The first such fiat came in 1533
      when King Henry VIII commanded that for every sixty acres of
      arable land a farmer owned, a quarter acre was to be sown with
      hemp. The penalty for not doing so was to be three shillings and
      four pence.<br>
      <br>
      Thirty years later, and long before the clash with Spain, his
      daughter Queen Elizabeth I reissued the command, raising the
      penalty to five shillings.[14] Elizabeth may not have had the best
      interests of the realm in mind when she issued this proclamation,
      however. Most of the hemp seed in England was sold by a Lawrence
      Cockson, a man who enjoyed the queen's favor. If English farmers
      complied with the royal proclamation, he stood to make a lot of
      money.[15]<br>
      <br>
      Despite the law, few Englishmen complied with the royal decrees.
      The simple fact was that any landowner or small farmer could make
      more money by raising almost any crop other than hemp. Not only
      were the prices they received too low for them to make a good
      profit, farmers also complained that hemp exhausted the soil and
      made it unsuitable for growing other crops. It also gave off a bad
      odor when retted:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now pluck up they hempe, and go beat out the
      seed,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and afterward water it as ye see need.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not in the river where cattle should
      drinke,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for poisoning them and the people with
      stinke.[16]<br>
      <br>
      English farmers were also reluctant to substitute hemp seed for
      grain since they claimed the seed gave an "ill flavor to the flesh
      of the bird that feeds on it".[17]<br>
      <br>
      Since ships needed hemp and English farmers refused to supply it,
      merchants had to go elsewhere for their supplies. Most of the hemp
      that found its way into English ships during this period came from
      the Baltic. The best quality hemp came from Danzig, and on several
      occasions the British government ordered its agents in that city
      to buy all the hemp they could get their hands on so that England
      would have enough rope for her ships.[18] Toward the middle of the
      sixteenth century, growing competition from Russia lured English
      buyers away from Danzig to the Russian cities of Riga and St.
      Petersburg. By 1630, Russia was supplying over 90 percent of
      London's hemp. By 1633, almost 97 percent came from Russia.[19]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Russian Brack</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Russia was the world's major exporter of hemp since it alone, of
      all the major hemp-producing countries, was able to supply the
      most hemp and produce it at the cheapest prices. Since England had
      no other source of supply that could meet its needs, England was
      Russia's best customer, importing two-thirds of all Russia's
      exports by the eighteenth century.[20]<br>
      <br>
      The center of Russia's hemp industry was located in the Ukraine
      and in the countryside between Poland and Moscow. Farmers raised
      and cleaned their hemp for sale to wholesalers, who bought it from
      them and transported it to retailers in the towns, who in turn
      shipped it to various ports such as Riga and St. Petersburg.<br>
      <br>
      Since hemp was sold on the basis of weight, it was relatively easy
      to increase its cost either by adding stones, timber, rotten hemp,
      or rubbish to the bales, by wetting down the fibers, or simply by
      giving the buyer a false weight. Because of the widespread fraud
      among Russian retailers, the Russian government instituted a
      formal inspection office called the brack, consisting of local
      port officials whose job was to make sure that fraud was not being
      perpetrated on buyers. Brack inspectors were supposed to be
      financially liable to a buyer on proof of fraud, but it was almost
      impossible to prove fraud until the hemp was unloaded in England.
      In some ports such as Riga inspection was rigorous, whereas in
      ports such as St. Petersburg it was lax and fraud was rampant.<br>
      <br>
      In 1717, English merchants became so fed up with Russian cheating,
      they complained loudly enough to Parliament to pressure the
      English secretary of state to threaten the Russian ambassador that
      unless the abuses stopped once and for all England would go
      elsewhere for its hemp, such as its American colonies. It was a
      bluff, but the czar fell for it. Believing that Russia was in
      danger of losing its lucrative export trade with the English, he
      ordered abuses stopped, and offenders were threatened with loss of
      property, hard labor in the mines, and even death.[21]<br>
      <br>
      Conditions still remained unsatisfactory in most Russian ports,
      however, and despite efforts and negotiations to change the brack
      so that English buyers would also serve as brack inspectors,
      English buyers had to grin and bear the dishonesty. They simply
      needed the hemp and had nowhere else to get it. While Poland,
      Prussia, and France also were exporters, they were not able to
      sell enough to satisfy England's enormous needs for the product.<br>
      <br>
      England's dependence on foreign hemp placed her in a precarious
      position should hostilities break out between her and Russia or
      with any third country that controlled the sea route to Russia.
      Without a reliable source of hemp, England could not build ships.
      Without ships, she would remain an island isolated from Europe and
      the rest of the world.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The royal navy and the navigation of England
      under God, the wealth, safety and strength of this kingdom
      [Parliament lamented] depends on the due supply of stores
      necessary for the same, which [are] being now brought in mostly
      from foreign parts in foreign shipping at exorbitant and arbitrary
      rates...[22]<br>
      <br>
      A pamphlet written by a Sir Richard Haines spoke directly at
      England's need to become self-sufficient in hemp:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a further advantage by this planting of hemp,
      etc., will accrue towards making of sails, cables, and other
      cordage necessary for shipping, of which may be made at home,
      without being beholden to our neighbours for a commodity so
      important to navigation, parting with our money to strangers for
      it, as we usually do to a very great yearly value.[23]<br>
      <br>
      To induce hemp workers who were fleeing persecution in Europe to
      seek refuge in England, Parliament passed a law in 1663 that any
      foreigner who settled in England or Wales and established a
      hemp-related industry within three years would, upon taking the
      oath of allegiance to the king, be accorded the same rights and
      privileges as natural-born citizens.[24]<br>
      <br>
      But despite all her efforts to induce her own farmers at home to
      comply with the laws to raise hemp, and the inducements she
      offered refugees abroad to come to England if they promised to
      practice their trades once they got there, there was never enough
      hemp. Faced with failure at home, the monarchy turned to her loyal
      subjects abroad for cooperation. <br>

      <div align="center"><font size="+1"><i><b>Marijuana - The First

            Cannabis Comes to the New World</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Like her greedy European neighbors, England eyed the New World
      with Midas eyes. Spain's conquistadors were sending a stream of
      gold and silver booty from the Aztec and Inca Empires. The English
      believed that they too could become rich by looting the native
      empires to the north of the Spanish colonies. There was also the
      possibility that this northern part of the New World might contain
      a passageway to the South Seas that would take the English ships
      on to the East Indies and their spice-laden treasures. With
      colonies solidly established in the New World, England could
      control a monopoly in any trade with the East.<br>
      <br>
      The dream never materialized. There was no gold, no silver, no
      passageway to the Indies. There was, however, a different kind of
      wealth to be extracted from the Americas. The natives, in their
      ignorance, were willing to exchange furs - beaver, otter, seal,
      deer - for a pittance. The country was thick with trees; the
      waters were teeming with fish. The possibilities for trade were
      boundless. And by promoting the production of raw materials in the
      New World badly needed at home, England might become
      self-sufficient.<br>
      <br>
      Sir Walter Raleigh became especially excited at the prospect of
      harvesting hemp in the American colonies as early as 1585 after
      Thomas Heriot, his friend and tutor, told him that he had seen a
      hemp-like plant growing wild in what was to become Virginia.
      Heriot's hemp, however, was Acnida cannabinum, a plant which also
      yields a fiber suitable for weaving, but one that is far inferior
      in strength to cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      Even when the American variety of hemp proved not to be the same
      as that grown in Europe, the possibility of raising cannabis in
      the American colonies sent imaginations soaring. If only the
      energies of the colonists could be directed towards raising hemp,
      England might yet free herself from he heavy commercial debts.<br>
      <br>
      The first settlers who founded the colony at Jamestown, Virginia,
      in 1607, however, did not make the long journey across the
      Atlantic to become hemp farmers. Like most Englishmen, they came
      to America in the belief that the country abounded in gold and
      silver. These early colonists expected to make a quick and easy
      fortune and planned to return home as soon as possible. When they
      found no gold or anything else of material value, they became so
      discouraged they refused to work to support themselves. Had it not
      been for the friendliness of the Indians who gave them food and
      showed them how to raise some basic crops, they would have starved
      to death.<br>
      <br>
      In 1611, formal orders to raise hemp were finally received in the
      colony.[1] Speaking to a motley gathering of His Majesty's loyal
      subjects, the new governor, Sir Thomas Dale, informed the
      colonists that the king expected them to grow hemp.<br>
      <br>
      The colonists were indifferent to the royal proclamation. They
      cared as little about raising hemp as they did any other crop. Yet
      by 1616, colonist John Rolfe could boast that the inhabitants of
      Jamestown had raised hemp "none better in England or Holland".[2]
      However, Rolfe had also begun to experiment with growing tobacco,
      and it was not long before the demand for American tobacco was
      greater than anyone could have anticipated. Faced with a choice
      between raising tobacco and becoming rich or complying with the
      Crown's wishes that they grow hemp, the colonists planted tobacco
      in every nook and cranny of the Jamestown settlement.[3]<br>
      <br>
      To combat this abstinence, in 1619 the Virginia Company directed
      every colonist in Jamestown to "set 100 [hemp] plants and the
      governor to set 5,000" and it allotted one hundred pounds to a
      Gabriel Wisher to hire skilled hemp dressers from Sweden and
      Poland at ten pounds, ten shillings per man, if they would
      emigrate to the new colony.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Parliament was also prepared to offer sizable inducements. In
      1662, Governor William Berkely was empowered to offer each
      colonist two pounds of tobacco for every pound of hemp delivered
      to market. Similar bounties for hemp production were also offered
      in Maryland in 1671, 1682, 1688, and 1698.<br>
      <br>
      In 1682, Virginia tried to encourage hemp production by making
      hemp legal tender for as much as one-fourth of a farmer's debts.
      Similar laws were enacted by Maryland in 1683 and by Pennsylvania
      in 1706.[5]<br>
      <br>
      While these laws and bounties had the effect of increasing hemp
      production throughout Virginia and Maryland, very little hemp ever
      found its way into English ports. If there was any extra hemp in
      the colonies, Yankee merchants wanted it. Hemp was so scarce in
      the north that supply could not keep up with demand and New
      England merchants were prepared to buy all the available hemp they
      could get their hands on.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hemp in New England</b><br>
      <br>
      The story of the Pilgrims is known to every schoolchild in
      America. Ostensibly, the Pilgrims left Europe to find a place in
      the New World where they could practice their religious beliefs in
      freedom. But not all the Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth in 1620
      came to America because of religious convictions. In fact, most
      passengers on the Mayflower hoped to earn enough money through
      fishing or trading for them to return to their homeland without
      having to worry about the future. Few of the Pilgrims were
      prepared or were willing to spend even part of their lives
      providing raw materials for the enrichment of England's merchants.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, cannabis was among the first crops to be introduced
      into the Massachusetts Colony, and initially there was great hope
      that it might even become an economically viable staple in New
      England. The General Court of Massachusetts was particularly
      interested in urging hemp production on the colonists because of
      the possibility that, without fibers with which to make clothing,
      the colony might freeze to death during the winter. To forestall
      such a possibility,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [it] desired and expected that all masters of
      families should see that their children and servants should bee
      industriously implied, so as the mornings and evenings and other
      seasons may not bee lost, as formerly they have beene, but that
      the honest and profitable custome of England may be practiced
      amongst us; so as all hands may be implied for the working of hemp
      and flaxe and other needful things for clothing, without abridging
      any such servants of their dewe times for foode and rest and other
      needful refreshings.[6]<br>
      <br>
      In 1629, shipbuilding was started in the village of Salem, and if
      there was any hemp available, Salem's merchants were prepared to
      buy all they could get their hands on. But hemp was so scarce that
      it had to be imported from abroad.[7]<br>
      <br>
      Despite the exhortations of the Massachusetts court and the
      clamorings of Salem's business interests, production fell far
      short of administrative expectations, and in 1639 the court
      formalized its demands by passing a law requiring every
      householder to plant hemp seed.<br>
      <br>
      In 1640, the General Assembly of Connecticut also tried to
      persuade its colonists to sow hemp "that we might in time have
      supply of linen cloth among ourselves."[8] Like her sister colony,
      the Connecticut Assembly feared that the colonists might die of
      exposure if they did not take steps to raise fiber-bearing crops
      such as hemp.<br>
      <br>
      Clothes were not the only concern of the colonists. The growth of
      the New England shipbuilding industry was creating yet another
      demand for hemp in the form of rope. Without rope, shipbuilders
      could not make rigging to hoist sails, and without sails, ships
      were useless. Although rigging could be made from a number of
      other raw materials, the preferred material was hemp because of
      its strength and durability.<br>
      <br>
      Although ropemaking had become an established and respected trade
      in England by the thirteenth century, few colonists were trained
      ropemakers. In 1635, the first ropewalk - a factory for making
      rope from hemp - was established in Salem. Rival businessmen in
      Boston soon recognized the advantage of having a local ropemaker
      and they invited John Harrison to come to Boston from England and
      set up shop. Harrison arrived in 1642 and went into business in
      the open lot next to his house on Purchase Street.<br>
      <br>
      By the terms of the agreement he worked out with Boston's town
      fathers, he was to have a total monopoly on making rope until
      1663. During that time, Harrison's business prospered and he
      raised eleven children. When the monopoly expired, a John Heyman
      "set up his posts" and began making fishing lines, Harrison
      immediately began to worry that the competition would cut into his
      own business and he successfully persuaded the town fathers to
      revoke Heyman's permit. Despite Boston's need for rope, the town
      fathers continued to honor Harrison's monopoly until his death.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, however, ropewalks were being erected all up and
      down the seacoast to meet the incessant demand of the fledgling
      shipbuilding and fishing industries. By the time of the
      Revolution, almost every town on the eastern seaboard had at least
      one. Boston alone had fourteen ropewalks. It was the taunting of
      His Majesty's soldiers by these Boston ropeworkers that eventually
      set off the "Boston Massacre" of 1770.<br>
      <br>
      The early ropewalks were relatively primitive industries. All that
      was needed was a large open field, a number of posts to rap the
      rope around, and of course, a good supply of hemp fiber. The rope
      was made by turning two hemp strands in opposite directions around
      one another. When the strands untwisted they came apart somewhat,
      but the friction between them held them together and produced a
      strong durable cord. These cords were then twisted with another
      set, and on and on, until thick strong ropes were created.<br>
      <br>
      Later on, when ropemaking became a major industry in America, the
      fields were enclosed in long covered alleyways, some of which
      stretched over 1,000 feet in length and 20 feet in width, with
      three or four ropemakers working side by side. The sight of one
      such enterprise later inspired Longfellow's poem, the "Ropewalk"
      (1854):<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that building, long and low,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With its windows all a-row,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the port-holes of a hulk,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human spiders spin and spin,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backward down their threads so thin<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropping, each a hempen bulk.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Life of the Hemp Farmer</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons that American farmers were unable to produce
      enough hemp to satisfy England and their own colonial needs was
      the scarcity and high cost of labor needed to harvest the crop.
      Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson tried to raise hemp
      and both lost money doing so.[9] Exasperated at England's
      incessant demands that the colonies send her more hemp, Benjamin
      Franklin railed at Parliament's ignorance of the shortages of hemp
      in America: "Did ever any North American bring his hemp to England
      for this bounty. We have not yet enough for our own consumption.
      We began to make our own cordage. You want to suppress that
      manufacture, and would do it by getting the raw material from us.
      You want to be supplied with hemp for your manufactures, and
      Russia demands money."[10]<br>
      <br>
      The shortage of labor in the colonies was only one of the reasons
      farmers were unable to raise enough hemp to meet domestic demand
      for the crop. Another important reason was that hemp farming was
      not the easiest of jobs.<br>
      <br>
      To prepare his land for hemp seed, the farmer usually had to plow
      his acreage at least three times, once in the fall, a second time
      in early spring, and a third time just before sowing. Immediately
      before the seeds were actually planted, the ground had to be
      carefully raked to break up any clumps so that the seeds would be
      distributed evenly. Seeds would be scattered throughout the field
      beginning in late March until the end of June. Generally, a farmer
      sowed his land at least two or three times just in case his seeds
      failed to germinate. About forty to fifty pounds of seed were sown
      per acre, and unless his seed was less than a year old, the farmer
      could not expect a good crop. Hemp seed had to be fresh and had to
      have been stored properly. Because older seeds were so unreliable,
      most farmers refused to have anything to do with suppliers they
      did not know personally. Although England regularly shipped hemp
      seed to the colonies, it was usually stored improperly and was
      often too old to be any good. It was in no small measure due to
      the shortage of good hemp seed from England that the colonists
      were unable to meet the demand for hemp at home and in the mother
      country.<br>
      <br>
      About four to six days after sowing, the cannabis seed began to
      germinate. Some young plants grew at an astonishing rate of five
      or six inches per day. Once his plants began to grow, the farmer
      could forget about them since no weed was a match for hemp and
      insects rarely attacked the plants. Thirteen to fifteen weeks
      later, the plants turned from green to a yellowish brown, the
      leaves began to droop and fall to the ground, and the flowers
      began to release their pollen, filling the air with clouds of hemp
      dust. The plants were finally ready to be harvested. Now came the
      back-breaking toil dreaded by all hemp growers.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, farmers pulled out each plant out of the ground to get
      as much of the stem as possible. A farmer who uprooted his crop
      could clear a quarter of an acre per day. If he used a knife and
      cut the stems above ground, he could clear about a half acre.<br>
      <br>
      Once a number of stalks had been pulled or cut, the farmer tied
      them into sheaves about as thick as a man's leg. These bundles
      were then leaned against a fence or against each other and allowed
      to dry for two to three days. After drying came the rotting (or
      retting as it was usually called). Retting was done to weaken the
      glue-like resin that caused the outer fibers to stick to the
      stalk.<br>
      <br>
      The colonists used one of three methods, and the law stated that a
      dealer had to specify the way the hemp had been retted. Water
      retting was considered to be the best method as far as the
      resulting quality of the hemp fiber was concerned. This involved
      immersing the hemp in a stream or pond for four to five days if
      done in summer, or thirty to forty days if done in winter.
      European hemp was usually water retted, but this was not generally
      done in America. Instead, Americans preferred winter retting.<br>
      <br>
      Winter retting was easier than water retting and it did not
      require a nearby water source. To winter-ret his hemp, the farmer
      simply threw the stalks on the ground when it began to get cold,
      leaving the rain, frost, and snow gradually to loosen the gum
      binding the fibers. Winter retting generally took about two to
      three months, and the result was a fiber measurably inferior in
      strength to water-retted hemp.<br>
      <br>
      The third method was dew retting. This was to become the most
      common practice in Kentucky, but in colonies such as Virginia it
      was not used very much. Dew retting involved spreading the hemp
      plants on the ground at night to catch the dew and then tying them
      together in the morning so that they would remain wet for as long
      as possible. It was both time-consuming and produced a very
      inferior grade of hemp. Shipbuilders refused to buy dew-rotted
      hemp, but cotton growers preferred it because it was cheap. All
      they wanted it for was to bale their cotton shipments.<br>
      <br>
      After the hemp was retted by one of these three methods, it was
      allowed to dry once more. Then came the most tedious task of all,
      the "breaking" or freeing of the outer fibers from the stalk.
      During the Middle Ages, breaking was done by hand. But this was
      too slow a process and eventually "hand brakes" were introduced
      into the hemp industry. The simplest of these devices usually
      consisted of several vertical boards attached end to end with a
      movable arm hinged at one corner to the top board. The hemp was
      placed over the stationary edge and the top arm, which was
      sharpened somewhat, was brought down onto the hemp stalks with
      enough force to cut the fiber but not enough to go through the
      entire stalk. It was a task that required a great deal of skill as
      well as strength and stamina. Thomas Jefferson, one of Virginia's
      major hemp producers, gave up on hemp because of the back pain his
      slaves experienced in connection with the herculean breaking
      process:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shirting for our laborers has been an
      object of some difficulty. Flax is so imperious to our lands, and
      of so scanty produce, that I have never attempted it. Hemp, on the
      other hand, is abundantly productive and will grow forever on the
      same spot. But the breaking and beating it, which has always been
      done by hand, is so slow, so laborious, and so much complained of
      by our laborers, that I have given it up...[11]<br>
      <br>
      Before the slaves were put to work in the hemp fields, the English
      had toyed with the idea of shipping the "multitude of loyterers
      and idle vagabonds" to the New World "where they would be put to
      worke in beatinge and workinge of hempe for cordage" as they were
      in England. The Virginia Assembly had also considered the
      possibility of "seating all convicts that should be imported into
      Virginia, in a county by themselves, under the care of proper
      overseers, who should confine them from doing any hurt, and keep
      them to their labor by such methods as used in Bridewell."[12]<br>
      <br>
      In fact, jail was where a great deal of hemp was processed, as
      shown in William Hogarth's (1697-1764) The Harlot's Progress, a
      series of engravings depicting what to Hogarth was the insidious
      influence of city life on the morality of a country girl named
      Mary Hackbout.[13]<br>
      <br>
      The fourth illustration in the series depicts Mary beating hemp in
      Bridewell Prison, a house of correction in Tothill Fields,
      Westminster, for harlots such as herself and other sundry immoral
      characters. Hogarth portrays her holding a large mallet in her
      hands while the hemp strands lie in front of her on two tree
      stumps. A prison officer is shown standing beside her drawing
      Mary's attention to the pillory, already occupied, which bears the
      warning: "The Wages of Idleness." To the far right of the picture
      an effigy of a "Sr. J. G." is shown hanging from a gallows, a
      starkly realistic foreboding of one of the uses to which the hemp
      Mary is working on is to be put.<br>
      <br>
      Mary herself is pictured dressed in finely designed clothing
      totally inappropriate to prison life, whereas close beside her
      another woman is shown destroying the vermin in her pest-ridden
      garments. Quite possibly, Hogarth may have got the idea for Mary's
      attire from the September 24, 1730, issue of the Grub Street
      Journal which contained an item concerning a Mary Muffet who had
      recently been sent to Bridewell. The lady was a "woman of great
      note in the hundreds of Drury," said the Journal, "who about a
      fortnight ago was committed to hard labor in Tothill-fields,
      Bridewell... where she is now beating hemp in a gown very richly
      laced with silver."[14]<br>
      <br>
      In any case, it was commonplace for prisoners to be put to work
      breaking hemp by their jailers. The work was arduous and
      punishing. However, prisoners were not made to work on hemp to
      teach them remorse. The fact was that few English men or women
      would willingly do such work. Forcing prisoners to do so kept them
      busy and also provided their keepers with a product that could be
      sold in the marketplace. With the money they earned from
      exploiting their charges, jailers were expected to pay the prison
      food bill. More often than not, a little something extra ended up
      in the jailer's pockets at the expense of a little something extra
      in the prisoner's bellies.<br>
      <br>
      Frequently, the very hemp prisoners broke in jail was used to snap
      a fellow inmate's neck. In fact, because rope was so often made of
      hemp, the word "hemp" gave rise to several slang terms and
      expressions that were once familiar in England and America, but
      which have now disappeared from our language. Among the more
      current terms of a bygone era were "hempen collar", meaning a
      hangman's noose, and "hempen widow", a woman widowed by the
      hangman's hempen noose. "To die of hempen fever" was another way
      of saying a man had been hanged. During the heyday of the American
      Wild West, vigilantes were sometimes referred to as "hemp
      committees", and "sowing hemp" was another way of saying that
      someone was on his way to a rendezvous with the hangman.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hemp Farmer's Wife</b><br>
      <br>
      Once hemp had been splintered into shreds on the brake, it was
      ready for market. More often than not, however, the farmer kept
      his harvest for his own needs.<br>
      <br>
      During pre-Revolutionary times, hemp fabric was one of the most
      common materials in the colonial hempstead. Hempen cloth covered
      the backs of farmers and their entire families, hempen towels
      wiped their hands, and hempen tablecloths graced their fine
      furniture. There was virtually no household that did not contain
      an item made from hemp.<br>
      <br>
      The popularity of hemp and the consequent dearth of hemp fiber to
      leave the American colonies for England was in no small measure
      due to the enterprising and dedicated pioneer women of the
      colonies, who transformed the raw fibers from the fields into
      cloth and fine linen. It was not an easy task.<br>
      <br>
      After her husband brought her the broken hemp fiber, the farmer's
      wife placed it across the top of a "swingling" block, a strong
      wooden board three to four feet high mounted on a sturdy wooden
      frame. She and her older daughters now began to pound the fibers
      as hard as they could with wooden paddles until it was beaten free
      of woody particles. The long fibers that survived this beating
      were then drawn through a hatchel, a wooden comb that removed
      remaining short fibers. Hatcheling was done several times, each
      time with a comb with teeth set more closely together than the
      previous one. After the final combing, the fine soft pliable
      threads were spun into cloth. Short fibers removed during the
      preliminary hatchelings were called tow, and were made into heavy
      thread for burlap and cord.<br>
      <br>
      Spinning involved twisting loose fibers together to make a single
      strand. The pioneer woman who was lucky enough to own a spinning
      wheel sat facing her prized possession and pulled a few strands of
      hemp from a rod or spindle and twisted these onto a bobbin. The
      bobbin was then set revolving by pressing down on a foot treadle.
      As the bobbin turned, it caused the thread to be wound. After a
      number of bobbins had been filled, the thread was wound onto
      skeins on a hand-turned reel. The number of strands per skein was
      determined by the number of times a projecting peg tripped another
      peg.<br>
      <br>
      After "reeling", the yarn was bleached to give it color. This too
      was a time-consuming job. First, the yarn was submerged in running
      water. Then, it was covered with piles of ashes and hot water,
      rewashed, pounded again, and washed once more. Now it was ready
      for bleaching. To give the yarn a white color, it was soaked in
      flaked lime and buttermilk. Walnut bark gave a brown tinge; oak
      and maple gave purple; hickory bark produced a yellowish color;
      sumac berries produced pinks and reds; blueberries gave blue.<br>
      <br>
      Once dyed, the yarn was ready for weaving. This step involved
      passing a horizontal or "weft" thread over and under alternating
      vertical or "warp" threads. There were various types of looms in
      the colonies and there were always improvements in loom
      technology. Basically, however, the loom was an elaborate tool
      that allowed the weaver to hook the weft thread over and behind
      warp threads faster than could possibly be done by hand.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mercantilism and the "Spinning Bee"</b><br>
      <br>
      As long as spinning and weaving were primarily household
      activities, they were encouraged by Parliament. But when they
      developed to the point that colonial imports began declining due
      to homemade goods, England tried to restrict these activities.<br>
      <br>
      The mercantile system which England adopted as an integral part of
      her policy toward her American colonies was basically one which
      required the colonists to be suppliers of raw materials to and
      consumers of finished goods from the mother country. By the
      eighteenth century, spinning and weaving had increased to such a
      degree that British merchants began to complain to Parliament that
      the colonists were not buying enough British-made goods given
      their alleged dependency on English manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      In response to this pressure from the business sector, Parliament
      passed the Wool Actin 1699 which essentially deprived the
      colonists of the right to import wool. To circumvent this
      restriction, the colonists made more and more use of hemp and flax
      fibers. In 1708, Calib Heathcote, a New York colonist seeking a
      contract from the British Board of Trade to supply naval stores to
      England, wrote that his neighbors "were already so far advanced
      that three fourths of the linen and woolen used, was made amongst
      them... and if some speedy and effectual ways are not found to put
      a stop to it, they will carry it on a great deal further..."[15]<br>
      <br>
      Parliament demanded an explanation from Governor Dudley of
      Massachusetts concerning the reluctance of the colonists to buy
      British goods. Dudley replied that Americans would be more than
      happy to buy and wear goods made in England if they could pay for
      them. But since they could not earn enough money from chopping
      wood and sawing lumber, they were forced to make and sell their
      own goods, leaving those that were made in Britain to more
      affluent New Englanders.<br>
      <br>
      The event which ultimately transformed the colonies from part-time
      household producers of clothing to full-time manufacturers, and
      caused more than one ulcer in the British business community, was
      the arrival in Boston in 1718 of a number of professional spinners
      and weavers from Ireland. Although colonial women had been
      spinning their own thread for some time, their expertise was
      nowhere near that of the professional European craftsmen. When
      these newcomers landed in Boston, the women of the town asked them
      for advice on how to make better cloth. The immigrants were more
      than obliging, and soon Boston's women, young and old, rich and
      poor, were flocking to the Common where a makeshift spinning
      school had been set up to teach the colonists how to spin thread
      professionally. The whir of spinning wheels soon filled the air
      from morning to night as each woman competed with her neighbor to
      produce more and better thread. Boston's womenfolk, it was said,
      had been bitten by the "spinning craze".<br>
      <br>
      It was the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765, however, that really
      sent the women of New England to their spinning wheels in earnest.
      The new law promulgated by Parliament did more to crystalize
      opposition to the import and consumption of British goods in the
      colonies than did any other single measure. Businessmen refused to
      purchase any products made in England and colonists agreed not to
      wear any clothing except that manufactured domestically. In New
      England, the campaign not to buy British goods was led by a group
      of women who called themselves the Daughters of Liberty. To meet
      the expected demand that a boycott against British goods would
      create in the colonies, the Daughters turned to "spinning bees",
      as the "spinning crazes" were now called.<br>
      <br>
      Between 1766 and 1771, women across New England met in churches,
      meeting halls, private homes, and anywhere else that was
      available, to spin in groups. Speaking at one such gathering, held
      in Providence, Rhode Island, the Boston Chronicle on April 7,
      1766, wrote that the women gathered there "exhibited a fine
      example of industry, by spinning from sunrise until dark, and
      displayed a spirit for saving their sinking country, rarely to be
      found among persons of more age and experience."<br>
      <br>
      These spinning bees were not without results. Production of cloth
      materials increased in every town and village, and it was not long
      before there was more than enough homemade cloth to clothe anyone
      who wanted American-made garments.<br>
      <br>
      The spinning bee soon spread to other colonies as well. In
      Philadelphia, a market was opened especially for the sale of
      domestic fabrics. In Virginia, George Washington erected a
      spinning house on his plantation. Even as far as South Carolina,
      domestic production of fabrics increased markedly as the spirit of
      resistance filtered down from New England to the southern
      colonies.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of these spontaneous gatherings, the colonists became
      self-sufficient in clothes. When the Revolution came and textile
      materials from England were completely cut off, the colonists were
      not faced with the kind of predicament they might have been in had
      they not learned to manufacture their own household goods. Until
      trade relations could be started with other countries, the
      colonists were able to supply uniforms and basic clothing for
      their army.<br>
      <br>
      <b>More Valuable Than Cash</b><br>
      <br>
      To maintain their newly declared independence, the American
      colonies not only had to field an army, they had to become
      self-reliant in all the resources necessary to support that army
      and the civilian population. Grain and beef suddenly became the
      chief priorities for the fledgling nation.<br>
      <br>
      Once they were sure of food, the colonists could devote their
      efforts to raising raw materials for the war effort. Foremost
      among the raw materials being demanded was hemp. The Revolution's
      impact on the hemp industry was reflected in the price for hemp
      fiber. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities, hemp sold for about
      twenty-seven to thirty-five shillings per hundredweight. Between
      1780 and 1782, the price soared to three hundred shillings.[16]<br>
      <br>
      Much of Virginia's hemp was produced by small farmers and was
      subsequently processed into rope and cordage. There were no fewer
      than eighteen "ropewalks" in Virginia transforming raw hemp fiber
      into badly needed rope during the Revolution, and there was still
      a shortage of rope. These ropewalks and various sailmaking
      factories sprang up all over the colony to supply the needs of the
      colonial navy. So important were rope and sail to the war effort
      that any man who worked at these jobs for at least six months was
      excused from military duty for the duration of the war.[17]<br>
      <br>
      Virginia's ropewalks were also considered an important war
      industry by the British. In April 1781, when Benedict Arnold led a
      force of British infantry up the Jones River and penetrated as far
      as Richmond, one objective of his mission was the "Public Rope
      Walk" in Warwick, which he destroyed. This ropewalk was the
      biggest rope-manufacturing factory in Virginia and its loss dealt
      a considerable blow to Virginia's rope production for the war
      effort.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to making clothes and rope from hemp, the Americans
      had another equally important need for the precious fiber during
      the Revolution - paper. Although hemp was a basic ingredient in
      the invention of paper, other materials such as flax and cotton
      had long since replaced it. However, in 1716, a pamphlet was
      published on the art of papermaking entitled Essays for the month
      of December 1716, to be continued monthly by a Society of
      Gentlemen for the benefit of the people of England, which urged
      papermakers to return once again to hemp. Detailed instructions
      were given as to how to prepare the hemp for the job and paper
      mill owners were invited to plant hemp in their yards so that they
      would have their own supply of raw material.<br>
      <br>
      In 1765, a dedicated English paper manufacturer named Jacob
      Christian Schaffer began writing a long and thorough text on the
      art of papermaking which was based on experiments he himself had
      made during his career in the paper industry. In going over the
      different materials that had been used to make paper in the past,
      Schooner noted that while rage and worn-out linen were the main
      raw materials for making paper in his day, "The dearth of this
      material is now complained of everywhere." To deal with this
      shortage Schooner proposed hemp fiber as an alternative, and to
      prove its feasibility, he printed portions of the third volume of
      his textbook on pages made form hemp fiber.[18]<br>
      <br>
      Several years after the publication of Schaffer's books on the art
      of papermaking, Robert Bell, an American printer who in 1777
      identified his shop as "next door to St. Paul's Church, in Third
      Street, Philadelphia," likewise suggested that hemp be used as a
      raw material for making paper in the colonies, since now they had
      declared their independence from England they could no longer
      count on cotton or flax imports.<br>
      <br>
      The problem was, however, that once war broke out, hemp became
      just as scarce as any other fibrous materials. For a time American
      papermakers had to scrounge, beg, and plead for people to bring
      them their old rags so that the United States would have paper
      upon which money, business accounts, military commands, etc.,
      could be written. The shortage did not last forever and after the
      War of Independence papermakers could choose what materials to use
      in producing paper. But for a time, the acute hemp and paper
      shortage threatened to undermine the American war effort.<br>
      <br>
      One of the better known Virginia landowners who astutely
      anticipated both the war and the demand for hemp was Robert "King"
      Carter, an early ancestor of President Jimmy Carter. Although he
      owned more than 300,000 acres in Virginia, Carter was much more
      than just a wealthy land baron. During his career, he held many
      colonial offices among which were justice of the peace, member of
      the House of the Burgesses, speaker of the House, colonial
      treasurer, and commander of the local militia. The Carters and
      other Virginia aristocrat societies were leaders in every social,
      religious, and political event that took place in the colony. So
      held in awe was Carter that it was said no Christian save the
      minister would think of entering Christ's Church on the Sabbath
      before "King" Carter arrived.<br>
      <br>
      In 1774, on the eve of the Revolution, Carter took stock of the
      political situation in the colonies and decided that tobacco would
      no longer be a profitable concern. Accordingly, he wrote to one of
      his foremen, "I apprehend that tobacco which may be here, next
      summer will be in little demand... [Therefore] in place of tobacco
      - hemp and flax will be grown."[19] At the same time, he erected a
      spinning factory on his plantation to process the future hemp
      crop.<br>
      <br>
      Even with the hemp from his own vast farmlands, Carter did not
      have enough hemp to suit his needs. In 1775, he bought five
      hundred pounds from his stepbrother. In 1776, he bought two tons
      more. Much of this hemp was spun into osnaburg, a coarse fabric
      used to make shirts and trousers for workmen and the Revolution's
      soldiers.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp was more than just fiber for clothes, however. It was also
      money. In 1781, Governor Thomas Jefferson received a note from
      David Ross, Virginia's purchasing agent, stating that his buyer in
      Philadelphia "writes me the 2,000 Stand of Arms will be ready this
      week." But to pay for them, he was "obliged to engage hemp" since
      there was "no encouragement from Congress that they can do
      anything for [us] in money matters. Tobacco will not do there and
      we have nothing to depend upon but our hemp."[20] In a later note,
      Ross acknowledged that Jefferson was reserving "The hemp in the
      back country... to be used in paying for articles bought in
      Philadelphia and a valuable Fund..."[21] A year later, a
      Philadelphia businessman likewise noted that "hemp, tar, pitch,
      and turpentine command cash in preference to any other goods".[22]<br>
      <br>
      The reason hemp was more valuable than cash was simple. Paper
      money had no value in the colonies. A thousand dollars in Virginia
      currency, for example, was only worth one dollar in silver.
      Because of the lack of faith in paper money, the American economy
      operated on the barter system. And because of hemp's "comparitive
      uniformity, its comparative freedom from deterioration, the
      universal and steady demand for it, and its value, which exceeded
      all other raw produce", it "was recognized as the standard
      commodity for the first three or four decades" of the new American
      republic.[23] Anything and everything could be bartered for hemp,
      from the local newspaper to the services of stud racehorses.[24]<br>
      <br>
      The American Revolution altered the lives of the American people
      in many ways. Hitherto, the colonists had relied heavily on
      imports from England, especially for clothing. Had it not been for
      organizations like the Daughters of Liberty, whose enthusiasm and
      efforts encouraged colonial women to make their own clothes, the
      disastrous winter of 1778 at Valley Forge might have been typical
      of life throughout the northern colonies.<br>
      <br>
      To make sure the army had uniforms and Americans did not freeze to
      death, Congress implored the colonists to raise as much hemp as
      possible so that clothing could be manufactured. Soldiers needed
      uniforms not only to keep warm, but also to keep up their morale.
      On at least one occasion, for instance, the Americans looked so
      pitiful next to the elegantly uniformed French.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Kentucky's Hemp Industry</b><br>
      <br>
      Although Kentucky was to become the nation's most productive hemp
      supplier, hemp production was not started there until 1775. By
      1810, however, hemp had become "The grand staple of Kentucky". In
      1850, there were 8327 hemp plantations in the United States,
      putting hemp second only to cotton and tobacco production.[25]
      Most of these plantations were located in Kentucky; the remainder
      were spread throughout Tennessee, Missouri, and Mississippi.<br>
      <br>
      The major reason for hemp production began to increase once again
      following the initial depression of the hemp markets after the
      Revolution was the import tariffs Congress levied against hemp
      brought into the United States from abroad. In 1792, the tariff
      was placed at twenty dollars per ton. During the war of 1812, it
      rose to forty dollars per ton, and by 1828, it was sixty dollars
      per ton.[26] These tariffs were first imposed at the urging of
      Alexander Hamilton, who as secretary of the treasury, saw these
      imposts against foreign hemp as a means of stimulating domestic
      hemp supplies and thereby making the United States independent of
      foreign nations for this essential military item. After Hamilton,
      the fight to retain the tariff was spearheaded by one of
      Kentucky's most distinguished spokesman, the indefatigable Henry
      Clay.<br>
      <br>
      Clay was not a native Kentuckian. He had been born in Virginia but
      had moved to Lexington in 1797 where he became a well-known trial
      lawyer and husband to Lucretia Hart, the daughter of a rich hemp
      manufacturer. Soon after his marriage, Clay began to espouse the
      cause of Kentucky's hemp farmers, a career that helped elect him
      to Congress where he was instrumental in promoting Kentucky's hemp
      industry through the tariff.<br>
      <br>
      Not suprisingly, northern manufacturers and shipbuilders were
      opposed to these tariffs. Through Daniel Webster, their spokesman
      in Congress, they demanded an unrestricted supply of cheap raw
      hemp to make rope and cordage, and since they refused to use
      southern hemp because of its poor quality, they had to rely on
      imports. Placing a tariff on hemp from abroad hurt their business
      and they pressured their own congressmen to vote against the
      tariffs. But, more often than not, Clay and his supporters won out
      over Yankee business interests.<br>
      <br>
      However, the tariffs did little to discourage imports from foreign
      countries. Their main effect was simply to increase prices to
      consumers. Before 1800, the United States imported about 3400 tons
      of hemp a year. At the time of the War of 1812, imports rose to
      4200 tons, and by the 1830s they increased to 5000 tons per
      year.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Northern manufacturers preferred foreign hemp, especially that
      from Russia, to domestic hemp because of the superior manner in
      which the fiber was processed abroad. In Russia, for example, the
      stalks were hung on rocks as soon as they were cut. If the weather
      remained dry, the stalks were not disturbed. If it rained they
      were placed in a kiln. Regardless of how they were initially
      dried, on the third day after harvesting the plants were
      completely submerged in warm water for three weeks and then cold
      water for five weeks more. Then they were allowed to dry for two
      additional weeks, followed by a second kiln drying for twenty four
      hours. Finally, the stalks were broken. The husks were torn off
      and the fiber was carefully hatcheled. The finished fiber was then
      placed in storerooms until it was sold.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the Russian method of production, Kentucky growers
      left the chopped cannabis stalks on the ground to become dew
      retted. Water retting was discouraged because Kentucky farmers
      believed that fish and livestock that drank from a pond in which
      hemp had been placed would be poisoned. Then, too, the water
      smelled like rotten eggs after hemp had been soaking in it, "which
      was considered unhealthy for slaves and twice as bad for
      whites."[28]<br>
      <br>
      Not only were the northern manufacturers reluctant to use
      dew-retted hemp, the United States Navy also refused to buy
      Kentucky hemp despite Congress's efforts to promote the industry.
      In 1824, Congress inquired as to the basis for this
      discrimination. The secretary of the navy's reply was that "cables
      and cordage manufactured from it [Kentucky hemp]... are inferior
      in color, strength and durability to those manufactured from
      imported hemp, and consequently are not safe or proper for use in
      the navy,"[29] An expert in rope making was quoted as stating "I
      would not use cordage made from Kentucky yarn or hemp, even if I
      could produce it at one half the price of cordage made from
      Russian."[30]<br>
      <br>
      Actual experiments conducted in the 1820s aboard the USS North
      Carolina supported the navy's position. Although initially as
      strong as cordage made from Russian hemp and able to support a
      weight of 125 pounds when new, after eighteen months at sea
      cordage made from Kentucky-raised hemp could not even support a
      weight of 18 pounds![31]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hemp and Slavery</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the industries to experience a sudden growth as a result of
      the shortage of labor and the demand for hemp was slavery.<br>
      <br>
      Before the war there were only about 2500 slaves in Virginia's
      Shenandoah Valley. By 1790 there were 10,000.[32] Although the
      demand for hemp declined precipitously after the war, rope and
      cordage were still important commodities and large-scale hemp
      production required manpower. "Take away slaves," argued William
      C. Bullitt, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1849
      which debated the slavery issue, "and you destroy the production
      of that valuable article, which is bound to make the rich lands of
      Kentucky and Missouri still more valuable."[33]<br>
      <br>
      After Virginia's farmers lost interest in raising hemp due to the
      drop in prices, Americans in other parts of the country decided to
      move into the hemp market. Foremost among these new hemp producers
      were the farmers of Kentucky. And like their neighbours in
      Virginia, Kentuckians found that the only profitable way to raise
      hemp was through slave labor.<br>
      <br>
      "Without hemp," writes J.F. Hopkins in his History of the Hemp
      Industry in Kentucky, "slavery might not have flourished in
      Kentucky, since other agricultural products of the state were not
      conducive to the extensive use of bondsmen. On the hemp farm and
      in the hemp factories the need for laborers was filled to a large
      extent by the use of Negro slaves, and it is a significant fact
      that the heaviest concentration of slavery was in the hemp
      producing area."[34]<br>
      <br>
      Kentucky hemp growers estimated that three slaves could cultivate
      about fifty acres. This resulted in a yield of about 35,700 pounds
      of fiber and a return of about thirty-five dollars per acre.[35]<br>
      <br>
      Although working in the hemp fields was backbreaking toil, many
      slaves preferred it to other kinds of labor since it was task
      work. Under the task system, the slave was given a fixed amount of
      work for the day. If he finished his work, he could spend his
      remaining time as he wanted. A slave could even earn money on the
      task system, although his wages were minimal. For every pound of
      hemp over the 100 pounds he was required to break per day, the
      slave was paid one cent.[36] A good worker could break about 300
      pounds,[37] so it was possible to earn about two dollars a
      day.[38] Some slaves earned enough money in this way to buy their
      freedom. Under the gang system, which was more common in the
      cotton fields, slaves worked in groups under the watchful eye of a
      driver whose job it was to get as much work out of each fieldhand
      as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Labor in the hemp factory was also task work. A northern visitor
      to a Lexington ropewalk in 1830 wrote that there were "60 to 100
      negro slaves, of all ages," working in the factory and they were
      "all stout, hearty, healthy and merry fellows, some of whom
      contrive to while away the time and drown the noise of the
      machinery by their own melody."<br>
      <br>
      On another occasion, this same visitor remarked that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every man and boy in this establishment, as I
      before mentioned, has his allotted portion or his stint to
      perform, and each one is paid for what he does beyond it. This
      keeps them contented, and makes them ambitious, and no one, who
      knows anything of mankind, will doubt but that more labor is
      obtained from the same number of hands than could possibly be
      forced from them by severity... I have never seen a happier set of
      workmen than these boys; there was no overseer in their apartment;
      each boy placed his raw material beside his wheel, spun his thread
      the length of the room, returned to his place, and after winding
      the thread upon his reel, went on with his spinning with the
      utmost regularity and good order, singing the while with great
      earnestness, and not altogether without melody."[39]<br>
      <br>
      Another surprised northerner told the readers of the Boston
      Courier on November 10, 1830: "I have no hesitation in saying that
      to the best of my knowledge, there is more real freedom of body,
      and quite as much independence of mind, among the slaves of
      Kentucky, as there is to be found in any other portion of our
      country..."[40]<br>
      <br>
      These favorable reports were not welcomed by northern
      Abolitionists, who preferred to read and tell stories of beatings
      and torture. While such atrocities occurred, they were far less
      common than the Abolitionists contented. It would have been poor
      business to treat any slave brutally since this would have
      impaired his ability to work, and cheap labor was what slavery was
      all about.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to his fellow workers in the cotton fields, however, the
      slave who worked in the hemp factory was far better off, and there
      are records showing that some of these laborers earned as much as
      nine hundred dollars under the task system.[41] This was more than
      many white workers were able to earn and save during their
      lifetimes.<br>
      <br>
      One of the slaves who worked in the Kentucky rope factories and
      who later wrote about his experiences was William Hayden. Born in
      Virginia in 1785, Hayden was separated from his mother and taken
      to Kentucky when he was only five years old. In 1803, he was hired
      out to the owner of a ropewalk in Lexington where he showed
      himself to be so proficient that he was taken into the foreman's
      home. It was during this time that he learned to read and write.
      In his memoirs, which he wrote as a free man in Cincinnati, Hayden
      boasted that not only was he very good at his work, he was
      actually "acknowledged to be the best spinner in the country", and
      when he asked for an increase in his wages to six dollars a year,
      his request was immediately granted.<br>
      <br>
      Hayden's task quota was forty-eight pounds of spun hemp per day,
      which he proudly observes was "considered a good day's work for
      two men." Yet not only was he able to accomplish this work, he was
      so proficient that he was able to gain two days in every week,
      exclusive of the sabbath: "The proceeds of these two days amounted
      to three dollars, which it was optional for me to make, or devote
      my time to pleasure, if I fit so to do."<br>
      <br>
      Hayden later went to work in Georgetown and "notwithstanding there
      was an experienced white man superintending the business, he could
      show me nothing that I did not already know, hence I soon became
      foreman of the factory. From this time I was treated more as a
      white man than any thing else." By 1824, Hayden had saved enough
      money to purchase his freedom. Able to go where he pleased, he
      left the hemp factories of Kentucky and eventually moved to
      Cincinnati where he spent the remainder of his life working as a
      barber in his own shop.[42]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Demise of the American Hemp Farms</b><br>
      <br>
      The death blow to the American hemp industry came in the wake of
      the Civil War. Once trade broke off with the north, suppliers in
      the south lost a major market for bagging and cordage. Things were
      no better in the south. With no cotton to be shipped to the north
      or to Europe, the Confederate Congress prohibited the raising of
      cotton except for home use. Since no cotton was being baled, there
      was no need for bale rope and farmers lost their best customers.<br>
      <br>
      While northern demand for hemp was unabated, businessmen had to
      rely exclusively on costly foreign fiber even for jobs that did
      not need high-quality fiber. With the loss of the cotton trade, an
      investigation was begun to consider the practicality of producing
      thread from hemp. Congress appropriated twenty thousand dollars to
      pay a Pennsylvanian congressman to look into the matter. His
      report was offered in 1865, too late to have any impact, and was
      ignored. Moreover, all the information he submitted was taken from
      contemporary encyclopaedias and from some letters written to the
      commissioner of agriculture.[43]<br>
      <br>
      After the Civil War, hemp production never recovered. Faced with
      competition in the form of iron wire cables and bands, and cheaper
      jute bagging, many farmers simply gave up on hemp and turned
      instead to other agricultural staples such as wheat.<br>
      <br>
      Yet hemp did not disappear from the American landscape. As late as
      1890, thirty-three million dollars' worth of cordage was
      manufactured in the United States, and during World War I the hemp
      industry experienced a temporary revival. But the vast hemp
      plantations in Kentucky, Missouri, and Mississippi were gone
      forever. In later years it would even become illegal to grow hemp,
      as Americans learned that the once-commonplace plant was a
      "depraver of youth" and a "provoker of crime" called marijuana.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hemp Plant in Canada</b><br>

      Like their English rivals, when the French laid claim to North
      America in the sixteenth century, they too envisioned the New
      World as a vast repository of naval supplies, especially hemp and
      timber. These hopes were fuelled by reports from her early
      explorers such as Jacques Cartier who, like many others, had
      mistaken Acnida cannabina for Cannabis sativa.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the English, however, the French did not need to import
      hemp. They wanted more so that they could sell it to other
      countries.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest record of hemp in France foes back to around 200
      B.C., when the Greeks brought hemp from the Rhone Valley to outfit
      their ships. The manufacture of French fabrics made from hemp is
      almost as ancient.<br>
      <br>
      The export of hemp abroad began around the fifteenth century. By
      the sixteenth century, France was said to possess "two magnets"
      which attracted the wealth of Europe. One of these was wheat. The
      other was hemp. The yearly exports to England alone between 1686
      and 1688 were over two million pounds. It was not without reason
      that the English complained so bitterly about the draining of the
      economy as a result of their imports of hemp from France.<br>
      <br>
      "This most prosperous kingdom," declared the chancellor of France
      in 1484, "has a great number of provinces which, because of the
      beauty of the countryside, of the fertility of the soil, of the
      health-giving air, easily surpasses all the countries of the
      earth."[44] To take advantage of these bountiful assets, French
      workers were continually urged to work harder to produce wool,
      flax, and especially hemp.<br>
      <br>
      Ironically, despite the abundance of hemp, French merchants still
      imported large quantities of fiber from countries such as Italy
      and Sweden. The reason was that French merchants were able to make
      greater profits selling hemp abroad than they could possibly earn
      by manufacturing it and selling it domestically. Thus, while
      France sold enormous amounts of hemp to countries like England and
      Spain, she herself imported large quantities from other European
      countries. Consequently, when French merchants heard that hemp was
      growing wild in the New World, they sensed an opportunity for
      enormous profits. (Unfortunately, Cartier was a better explorer
      than a naturalist. The European variety of hemp did not grow wild
      in the New World.)<br>
      <br>
      After the first disappointments subsided, the French thought they
      could still make a profit in hemp if they could simply persuade
      the colonists who were settling in New France to cultivate
      cannabis as a crop. To this end, Samuel Champlain, the great
      explorer and colonizer, brought hemp seeds with him on his early
      expeditions to New France. By 1606, hemp was growing in Port Royal
      in Nova Scotia under the watchful eye of the colony's botanist and
      apothecary, Louis Hebert.[45]<br>
      <br>
      However, like their counterparts in the British colonies, the
      early French settlers were faced with an acute labor shortage and
      the pioneers had trouble just trying to grow enough food to stay
      alive. For anyone to spend time clearing land to grow hemp would
      mean time lost growing food. To deal with such abstinence, Jean
      Talon, the wily finance minister of the Quebec colony, confiscated
      all the thread in the colony and declared he would sell it only in
      return for hemp. At the same time, he gave hemp seed free to
      farmers with the understanding that they were to plant it
      immediately and replace the gift with seed from their next year's
      crop. Since their children had to be clothed, the women either
      persuaded their husbands to raise hemp or they bought it
      themselves and used it to barter with Talon. In this way, Talon
      created a demand for hemp and an industry to supply that
      demand.[46]<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, relations between France and England were rapidly
      deteriorating and eventually the two countries went to war. The
      French proved to be no match for the English, and in 1763 all of
      New France became an English domain. Almost immediately, England
      tried to promote hemp production in her new colony. When her
      initial entreaties failed, the new governor of Quebec was told not
      to grant any land to any settler unless he promised to raise hemp
      on his new holdings. It was to no avail. Despite these efforts,
      England received only token amounts of hemp from the colonists in
      Canada.<br>
      <br>
      After the American Revolution and the loss of her colonies tot he
      south, England redoubled her efforts to promote hemp production in
      Canada. In 1790, 2000 bushels of Russian hemp seed were brought to
      Quebec and were distributed free to all agricultural districts of
      the province. Only fifteen farmers showed any interest.<br>
      <br>
      By 1800, Russia was charging sixty-one pounds per ton of hemp.
      England reacted by urging her governors to offer more bounties. A
      public relations campaign of sorts was also initiated claiming
      hemp was a valuable commodity to colony and mother country alike.
      If hemp production increased, there would be more money and more
      employment. The standard of living would rise. Prosperity was
      within each colonist's grasp if only he would turn his efforts to
      growing hemp.<br>
      <br>
      The appeal fell upon deaf ears. There were simply too few people
      to work in the hemp fields. Whatever manpower was available could
      be more profitably used clearing land to grow food crops essential
      for survival. An equally formidable problem was the Catholic
      Church. Since hemp was exempt from tithes, the Catholic clergy
      refused to encourage their parishioners to grow hemp. Even had
      they had the time and will, French Canadians would not have
      listened to the English pleas. In Nova Scotia, the hemp shortage
      became so acute that the legislature complained that hangings had
      to be delayed![47]<br>
      <br>
      Not easily discouraged, Parliament offered a deal to James
      Campbell and Charles Grece, two experts in hemp production. Should
      either of them sow twenty-five acres of land with hemp with hemp
      during their first year of settlement in Canada, and agree to
      continue cultivation on a scale thereafter deemed satisfactory to
      the local authorities, and should they also be willing to teach
      the settlers the finer points of hemp production and serve as
      inspectors for all finished hemp, they would be assured of a
      purchase price of forty-three pounds per ton for any hemp they
      raised, for five years. In addition, each man would be given an
      annual allowance of two hundred pounds, a loan of four hundred
      pounds which had to be forfeit if the contract were broken, free
      passage to Canada, money to pay hemp dressers, free seed, and 150
      acres of land to use for experimentation. And as frosting on the
      cake, Parliament promised a lifetime annuity of two hundred pounds
      if the venture proved a success.<br>
      <br>
      Alas both men failed. Grece tried very hard to raise a crop the
      first year, but a combination of bad seed, late sowing, and poor
      weather was less than conducive to success. Campbell fared no
      better. What the spring floods left of his crop, the fall frost
      destroyed.[48]<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile Napoleon's brilliant victories in Europe were beginning
      to pose a threat to England's Baltic hemp suppliers. If Napoleon
      defeated Russia, England would no longer have a reliable hemp
      source. In desperation, she once again turned to Canada. Promises
      of seventy pounds per ton and 300 acres of land were made to
      anyone who would raise five tons of hemp in a year. To make sure
      these offers were heard throughout the country, they were issued
      from church pulpits immediately after services were concluded.
      Yet, even with these substantial inducements, little hemp ever
      made its way from Canada to England.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hemp in Latin America</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Even before the English and the French were thinking about
      exploiting the New World, Spain was trying to promote hemp
      production in her colonies throughout Latin America. As early as
      1545, hemp seed was sown in the Quillota Valley, near the city of
      Santiago in Chile. Most of the hemp fiber from these initial
      experiments were used to make rope for the army stationed in
      Chile. The rest was used to replace worn-out rigging on ships
      docked at Santiago. Eventual surpluses were shipped north to Lima,
      Peru.[49] Attempts were also made at cultivating hemp in Peru and
      Colombia, but only the Chilean experiments proved successful.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp is believed to have been brought to Mexico by Pedro Cuadrado,
      a conquistador in Cortes's army, when the conqueror made his
      second expedition to Mexico. Cuadrado and a friend went into
      business raising hemp in Mexico and were very successful at it. In
      1550, however, the Spanish governor forced the two entrepreneurs
      to limit production because the natives were beginning to use the
      plants for something other than rope.[50]<br>
      <br>
      In the eighteenth century, Spain's economy began to plummet
      drastically and she began to turn to her colonies. In 1777,
      several hemp experts were sent to various colonial outposts in
      Spanish America to teach the inhabitants the fine points of
      growing and preparing hemp for market.[51] Three years later,
      special orders from the king instructed all viceroys to encourage
      hemp production throughout New Spain.<br>
      <br>
      In Mexico, the authorities decided that the province of California
      would be an ideal place to begin hemp farming. But despite pleas
      to church prelates for cooperation, the missions and the
      individual farmers in the parishes preferred raising food crops
      and cattle to hemp.<br>
      <br>
      When no hemp arrived for shipment to Spain, experts were sent to
      California to instruct the people how to grow and prepare hemp for
      market. The area around San Jose was chosen as an experimental
      farm area in 1801 and an earnest effort was made to raise hemp for
      market.<br>
      <br>
      The first results were encouraging. By 1807, California was
      producing 12,500 pounds of hemp. About 40 percent came from Santa
      Barbara. Good harvests were also reported around San Jose, Los
      Angeles, and San Francisco. By 1810, California was producing over
      220,000 pounds of dressed hemp.<br>
      <br>
      Production would probably have continued to increase, but in 1810
      a revolution in Mexico effectively isolated California from the
      main seat of government. As a result, the subsidies that had
      stimulated hemp production were no longer available, and with the
      elimination of this incentive, commercial production of hemp
      ceased and was never started up again.[52]<br>
      <br>
      No one knows for certain when cannabis was introduced into Brazil,
      Portugal's main colony in South America. The words for marijuana
      in Brazil include maconha, liama, and diamba, which closely
      resemble the West and South African terms such as riamba, diamba,
      and liamba. On the basis of this linguistic similarity it is
      possible that Negro slaves abducted from their homes in Africa and
      brought to Brazil as plantation laborers may have brought some
      seeds with them to the New World. This is not very likely,
      however. The ships that crossed the Atlantic loaded with slaves
      did not afford any opportunity for comfort. Seeds that happened to
      be hidden in some clothing would have been eaten on ship, not
      saved for future farming. More probably the Portuguese themselves
      brought hemp seed to Brazil, since they too recognized its
      economic potential. Once sown, however, the slave would have used
      the plant as they had in their native land. There was no need to
      invent new terms for plants already familiar to them.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest actual reference to cannabis in Brazil dates back to
      the early decades of the 1800s. In 1808, the king and queen of
      Portugal fled to Brazil rather than risk capture by Napoleon who
      at that time was threatening to overrun the Iberian Peninsula.
      After Napoleon's defeat, the royal couple returned to Lisbon in
      1814. Three years later the queen became ill and death was
      imminent. As she lay awaiting her death, she summoned a Negro
      slave who had accompanied her to Brazil and asked her to "bring me
      an infusion of the fibers of diamba do amazonas, with which we
      sent so many enemies to hell."[53] The slave concocted an infusion
      of marijuana and arsenic for her mistress which had such analgesic
      properties that the queen felt no further pain, and shortly before
      her death she sang and played her guitar.[54]<br>
      <br>
      Although this anecdote casts a favorable light on marijuana, the
      sentiment was not shared by Brazilians. In 1830, for example, the
      Municipal Council of Rio de Janeiro prohibited importation of
      marijuana into the city. Anyone selling the drug was liable to a
      large fine and any slave found using it could be sentenced to
      three days' imprisonment.[55]<br>
      <br>
      There is also no exact date for the importation of hemp to
      Jamaica. Around 1800, the British sent a Russian hemp expert to
      Jamaica to see if the plant could be profitably raised on the
      island, but the attempt failed and production was abandoned.[56]
      Nevertheless, the plants began to grow wild. When indentured
      laborers from India came to work in Jamaica following the
      emancipation of the Negro slaves in the British Caribbean in the
      mid-nineteenth century, they found ganja already growing there.<br>
      <br>
      In 1793, cannabis was brought to Cuba to see if it could be grown
      profitably on that island, but the planters were more interested
      in growing sugarcane and little effort was devoted to hemp
      production.[57] About the same time, hemp was introduced into
      Guatemala. Although serious efforts were made to cultivate the
      plant on a large scale in that colony, very little hemp was ever
      produced.<br>

      <b>New Uses for the Old Hemp Plant</b><br>
      <br>
      The discovery of the passage to the East Indies by way of the Cape
      of Good Hope was one of the great events of Western European
      history. Besides bringing great wealth, the explorations that
      followed the trade routes, the conquests, and the early
      settlements in the East helped to free Western Europeans from the
      shackles of medieval parochialism. Once their imaginations had
      been whetted, Europeans craved to know more and more about the
      people who lived in these far-off lands. What the people of India
      looked like, what they ate, how they dressed, acted, thought,
      etc., fascinated erstwhile provincially minded Europeans. Even the
      momentous landing on the moon pales before the excitement
      generated by the landings of the first explorers in the East
      Indies.<br>
      <br>
      In the marketplace of ideas, the demand for news far outstripped
      supply and created an insatiable outlet for travelogues, or
      itineraries as they were often called. To supply this demand,
      anyone and everyone who visited these far-off places, and had the
      ability to put what he had seen into words, became the bestselling
      authors and the most sought after raconteurs of their day.<br>
      <br>
      These books and storytellers were the eyes and ears of Europe.
      They were the entertainment media in an age of boredom. But the
      stories that were told did more than just entertain readers and
      listeners. They were the grist for European brain mills to process
      into new thoughts and ideas. It was through these stories, for
      instance, that many Europeans learned that the hemp plants that
      grew wild in their fields were used as medicines by the people of
      India. Even more surprising, Europeans were told that the people
      in the lands of the east actually made a beverage from this plant
      which caused them to act as though they were drunk with wine!<br>
      <br>
      Such revelations were startling. Had these same Europeans visited
      their own countryside and villages, or the urban hovels where the
      unskilled and uneducated lived, they would have known of such
      things long before they were written about in the travel books
      that poured off the printing presses. The people who craved
      vicarious adventure and escapism such as that offered by
      travelogues were mainly the well-to-do. Although European
      craftsmen and businessmen used enormous quantities of hemp, their
      familiarity with the cannabis plant was totally related to its
      fiber. Even the Italian hemp dealers and artisans who were so
      expert in evaluating the different grades of hemp fiber were
      totally unaware of the plant's other properties. The Decameron,
      Giovanni Bocaccio's ribald masterpiece of the Fourteenth century,
      refers at one point to the "Old Man of the Mountain", and to some
      mysterious potion, but Bocaccio never identifies the drug by name:
      "He sought out a powder of marvelous virtue which he had gotten in
      the parts of the Levant of a great prince who avouched it to be
      that which was wont to be used by the 'Old Man of the Mountain'
      when he would fain send anyone sleeping into paradise."[1]<br>
      <br>
      In the next century, the French writer and physician Francois
      Rabelais wrote at length about cannabis, calling it Pantagruelion.
      Pantagruelion, says Rabelais, "is sown at the first coming of the
      swallows, and is taken out of the ground when the grasshoppers
      begin to get hoarse." Its stalk is "full of fibers, in which
      consists the whole value of the herb" (italics mine). Following
      Pliny, he declares that the seeds produced by the male plant
      "destroy the procreative germs in whosoever should eat much of it
      often." Referring to Galen, he says, "still is it of difficult
      concoction, offends the stomach, engenders bad blood, and by its
      excessive heat acts upon the brain and fills the head with noxious
      and painful vapors."[2]<br>
      <br>
      If Rabelais knew anything more about the effects of cannabis, he
      did not record them. Probably he did not. Beyond what he recorded
      from these classical sources, it is unlikely Rabelais was in any
      was familiar with cannabis as a medicament or as a psychoactive
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Witches' Brew</b><br>
      <br>
      Away from the hustle and bustle of the major urban centers, in the
      relative peace and serenity of the countryside, or in the wretched
      shacks that housed the unskilled city dwellers, where superstition
      passed for truth, where magic and sorcery were a way of life,
      where witches revelled with the devil in hallucinatory stupor,
      hemp was appreciated for marvelous powers unknown to Bocaccio and
      Rabelais.<br>
      <br>
      "During the whole time that Catholicism had the spiritual
      direction of Europe," writes Emile Grillot de Givry, "a veritable
      Church of Evil opposed... the Church of God, a Church of the devil
      defying the Church of God... like the latter [it possessed] its
      priests, its rites, its cult, its books, its congregations, and
      its supernatural visitants."[3]<br>
      <br>
      The Church of Evil was the church of the discontented and the
      ungratified, men and women who looked upon the glories to God -
      his splendid churches, his powerful clergy, the pomp and ceremony
      dedicated to his worship - with awe and envy. Condemned to poverty
      and destitution through no fault of their own, they questioned the
      fairness of their plight and decided that if God were not on their
      side, then maybe they would be better off serving Satan. After
      all, Satan was the renowned master of mortal wealth. Serving him
      could lead to no worse adversity than that which they were already
      experiencing.<br>
      <br>
      Many were content simply to worship the devil. Others aspired to
      higher satanic office and proclaimed themselves sorcerers
      (priests) and witches (priestesses). The main duties of these
      servants of the devil was to cast spells on those whose misfortune
      they desired. In so doing, they called upon the Prince of Darkness
      to do their bidding. Sorcerers and witches also officiated at the
      Black Mass - the Witches' Sabbath - an assemblage of worshippers
      of the devil presided over by Satan himself.<br>
      <br>
      Invariably, whenever medieval artists turned to the subject of the
      Witches' Sabbath, they depicted a group of women, who were usually
      naked, compounding a mysterious drug in a large cauldron. As early
      as the fifteenth century, demonologists declared that one of the
      main constituents that the witches compounded for their heinous
      ceremony was hemp.<br>
      <br>
      In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued a papal fiat condemning
      witchcraft and the use of hemp in the Satanic mass.[4] In 1615, an
      Italian physician and demonologist, Giovanni De Ninault, listed
      hemp as the main ingredient in the ointments and unguents used by
      the devil's followers.[5] Hemp, along with opium, belladonna,
      henbane, and hemlock, the demonologists believed, were commonly
      resorted to during the Witches' Sabbath to produce the hunger,
      ecstasy, intoxication, and aphrodisia responsible for the
      glutinous banquets, the frenzied dancing, and the orgies that
      characterized the celebration of the Black Mass. Hemp seed oil was
      also an ingredient in the ointments witches allegedly used to
      enable them to fly.[6]<br>
      <br>
      Jean Wier, the celebrated demonologist of the sixteenth century,
      was quite familiar with the exhilarating effects of hemp for
      sinister purposes. Hemp, he wrote, caused a loss of speech,
      uncontrollable laughter, and marvelous visions. Quoting Galen, he
      explained that it was capable of producing these effects by
      "virtue of affecting the brain since if one takes a large enough
      amount the vapors destroy the reason."[7]<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis sill retained its importance as a key ingredient in
      magical potions well into the nineteenth century. An occult French
      publication, The Prophet's Almanac, in its 1849 edition, for
      example, shows a crowd of people standing in front of a wizard who
      is gazing through a telescope into the future. Two of the men in
      the throng carry banners; one banner has "ether" printed on it,
      the other bears the word "hashish".[8]<br>
      <br>
      Sorcerers and witches were not the only people to attribute
      magical properties to the marijuana plant. In the Ukraine, peasant
      farmers used to pluck marijuana flowers on St. John's Eve in the
      belief that this would keep the evil eye from hurting their farm
      animals.[9] Ukrainian girls of marriageable age used to carry hemp
      seeds in their pockets when they whispered magical spells designed
      to hasten their wedding day. After they pronounced these spells,
      they stripped naked and scampered around their homes to complete
      the magic.[10] In Ireland, young maidens sowed hemp seed during
      Halloween, believing that if they looked behind them while sowing,
      they would see the ghost of their future husbands,[11] In other
      parts of Great Britain, this rite was not confined to Halloween
      alone. For example, a love poem of bygone days states:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A eve last Midsummer no sleep I sought,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to the field a bag of hemp-seed brought;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I scatter'd round the seed on ev'ry side,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And three times, in a trembling accent, cried<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This hemp-seed with my virgin hand I sow.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall my true love be, the crop shall
      mow.[12]<br>
      <br>
      While occult in nature, the basis of these superstitious rites are
      lost in time.<br>
      <br>
      Hemp was also mentioned in many medieval herbals as a medicinal
      agent. In 1530, and again in 1548, the English herbalist William
      Turner states that the plant was known as hemp in English,
      "hanffe" in Dutch, and "chanvre" in French, but he does not list
      any of its therapeutic properties.[13] About the same time,
      Mattioli, an Italian herbalist, described the characteristics of
      male and female hemp plants and listed the therapeutic properties
      of their seeds, roots, leaves, and sap.[14] In 1564, another
      Italian herbalist, Dioscobas Tabernaemontanus, wrote that hemp
      seeds and roots were used as medicinal agents and prescribed the
      application of an ointment of dry cannabis leaves and butter for
      burns and scalds.[15]<br>
      <br>
      Hemp was also a particularly familiar ingredient in the folk
      medicine of Eastern Europe. In Poland, Russia, and Lithuania,
      peasant farmers relied on the vapor given off by smoldering hemp
      seeds to relieve their toothaches.[16] In some parts of Eastern
      Europe, doctors advised patients whose gums and teeth were thought
      to be infested with worms to inhale hemp seed fumes so that the
      worms would become intoxicated and fall out on their own![17]
      Other common folk uses for the plant were in easing childbirth;
      reducing inflamation, fever, and the swelling of joints;
      preventing convulsions; and curing jaundice and rheumatism.[18]
      Many of these uses later found their way into the pharmacopoeias
      of modern European medicine in the nineteenth century.<br>
      <br>
      The use of cannabis in magic and folk medicine clearly shows that
      the European peasantry was well aware that the hemp plant had
      other important properties besides the marvelous virtue of its
      indomitable fiber. But this awareness of the plant's other uses
      seems not to have gone beyond the peasant farmers and the
      practioners of the occult. Hence, it was a revelation for many
      Europeans to learn that in the Arab countries, and especially in
      India, the hemp plant was hardly valued at all for its fiber and
      instead was actually eaten and made into a beverage which was said
      to have the same intoxicating effects as alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      The first reports came from Africa. In 1510, Leo Africanus, a
      Moroccan convert to Christianity, told his readers of a compound
      called "Lhasis" used by the people of Tunis which made them burst
      into laughter, caused them to act as if half drunk, and "provoked
      them into lust."[19]<br>
      <br>
      Toward the end of the sixteenth century, a physician by the name
      of Prosper Alpini published a widely read book in its day entitled
      The Medicines of the Egyptians (1591), in which he stated that
      hashish caused men to revel in ecstasy. He compared the early
      stages of hashish intoxication to that of alcohol, but emphasized
      that the visions hashish users experienced were to an important
      extent dependent on their intelligence and their psychological
      state at the time they took the drug.<br>
      <br>
      During the next two centuries, Europe entered a period of
      unprecedented colonialism. As more and more ships made their way
      down the coast of Africa and on to India, Europeans who remained
      at home were able to keep abreast of what was happening in these
      far-off lands through the various books that seemed to crop up
      everywhere. Many of these books were diaries and travelogues,
      written by adventurers, sea captains, wealthy travelers, priests,
      traders, administrators - in short, anyone who could write about
      the people of Africa and the East Indies did so. At home, the
      people eagerly awaited any and every bit of information that these
      returning voyagers might bring concerning the habits and customs
      of the people who lived in these "newly discovered" parts of the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      Since Portugal was the first to establish outposts in India, it is
      not surprising that the earliest books to be written about life in
      the East Indies were authored by Portuguese writers. The first
      European book to deal with the effects and uses of marijuana was
      written by a Portuguese physician whose writings were posthumously
      burned in public because a secret he had carefully guarded all his
      life was finally revealed after his death.<br>
      <br>
      <b>A Closet Heretic in India</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the many to be fascinated with the anecdotal titbits about
      India that began filtering back to Portugal wa a young doctor,
      Garcia Da Orta (1501-68). After hearing about Inida and its
      people, Da Orta decided to enlist in the Portuguese civil service
      as personal physician to the viceroy of the Indian provinces so
      that he could observe firsthand the truth of all these strange and
      exotic customs. Da Orta was also curious about the reports he had
      heard concerning strange new drugs that the people of India used
      and decided to record everything he could about India's materia
      medica. It was as a result of these writings that the people of
      Europe learned of a new and previously unimagined use for the
      familiar hemp plant. Although Da Orta's book subsequently became a
      classic in the literature of drugs, almost every copy was
      destroyed when the Portuguese church found out that he had been a
      closet Jew who had hidden his religion nearly all his life.<br>
      <br>
      Da Orta was not a native-born Portuguese citizen but the son of
      Spanish Jews who had been forced into exile when Spain banished
      all Jews from that country in 1492. Like many other Spanish Jews,
      Da Orta's father sought refuge in neighboring Portugal. The king
      and the church allowed them to stay until 1497. In that year, Jews
      were once again faced with the threat of exile if they did not
      convert to Christianity.<br>
      <br>
      Tired of flight, Da Orta's father let it be known that he had
      diavowed his Jewish heritage. This enable him to remain in the
      country and allowed his son Garcia to enter the Spanish
      universities of Salamanca and Alcala de Henares where he studied
      arts and medicine. It was shortly after receiving his degree in
      medicine that Garcia left Europe to serve in Portugal's new
      territories in the east.<br>
      <br>
      Da Orta got more than he bargained for, however, for in serving in
      India he was occasionally required to take part in military
      campaigns against the native populace. The life of a military
      surgeon seems not to have been to his liking, for as soon as his
      enlistment ran out he left the army and went into private practice
      in Goa, the Portuguese colony off the coast of India. It was
      during this period that he wrote his famous Colloquies on the
      Simples and Drugs of India, which was subsequently published in
      Goa in 1563.[20]<br>
      <br>
      The book was to become the most important text on natural
      medicines since Dioscorides' herbal, hitherto the most influential
      text of its kind for the previous 1500 years.<br>
      <br>
      The Colloquies is a landmark in the history of psychopharmacology.
      Written in the form of a dialogue between himself and a colleague
      from Salamanca named Ruano, Da Orta describes for his readers the
      effects of various hallucinogenic drugs commonly used in India.
      Among those which receive special attention are opium, datura, and
      of course, bangue, the concoction made from cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      Bangue, Da Orta said, makes a man laugh foolishly and lifts him
      above all cares and anxieties. It had aphrodisiac effects ("I hear
      that many women take it when they want to dally and flirt with
      men") as well as soporific actions ("I've heard it said, although
      it may not be true, that the great captains, in ancient times,
      used to drink it with wine or opium so that they could get some
      rest from their work, banish their cares, and get to sleep").<br>
      <br>
      Da Orta also remarked on what was already a well-known phenomenon
      regarding marijuana, namely that the drug's effects on mood
      depended on the user's feelings at the time he took it:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself saw a Portuguese jester... eat a slice
      or two of the electuary and at night he was pleasantly
      intoxicated, his utterance not intelligible. Then he became sad,
      began to shed tears, and was plunged into grief. In his case the
      effect was sadness and nausea... Those of my servants who took it,
      unbeknownst to me, said that it made them so as not to feel their
      work, to be very happt, and to have a craving for food. I believe
      that it is generally used and by such a lagre number of people,
      that there is no mystery about it. But I myself have not tried it,
      nor do I wish to do so. Many Portuguese have told me that they
      have taken it and they experienced the same feelings, more
      especially female partakers.[21]<br>
      <br>
      Da Orta's book created quite a stir when it first appeared in
      Europe. The book was widely read by his colleagues and by those
      interested in the customs of the people of India, and very often
      his observations were copied verbatim in subsequent medical
      treatises or travel narratives, often without giving any credit as
      to the source. Owing largely to Da Orta's writings on the subject,
      physicians began to regard cannabis in a new light. Prepared
      properly, hemp could be made into a drug the actions of which
      included euphoria, sedation, stimulation of appetite,
      hallucinations, and aphrodisia.<br>
      <br>
      However, Portuguese physicians were not able to keep Da Orta's
      book on their library shelves for very long. Soon after the
      author's death, his wife confessed to the Portuguese Inquisition
      that her husband had been secretly practicing his Jewish faith. He
      had only adopted the outward signs of Christianity to deceive the
      authorities.<br>
      <br>
      When it heard this confession, the Inquisition had Da Orta's body
      exhumed and cremated in public as a lesson to all other Jewsih
      apostates who thought that they might get away with deceiving the
      church as to their conversions. Furthermore, all copies of Da
      Orta's book that could be located were confiscated and burned as
      well. (Fortunately, a Flemish botanist discovered a copy in a
      Lisbon bookshop and kept it from being destroyed. The book was
      later republished in Latin, Italian, French, and English, and was
      widely quoted whenever any reference was made to the
      hallucinogenic plants of India.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>More about Bangue</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1578, a Portuguese colleague of Da Orta's, Cristobal Acosta
      (1524-94), published his own textbook, On the Drugs and Medicines
      from the East Indies, in which he dealt at some length with the
      properties of bangue. Acosta had also sailed to India in the
      service of the government. He too had had to take part in military
      campaigns against the native populace, and on one occasion was
      actually captured and imprisoned in Bengal. After his release, he
      traveled to Goa where he visited Da Orta, and the two doctors
      exchanged information on what they had learned about the exotic
      drugs of the Indies.<br>
      <br>
      Like Da Orta, Acosta had found that bangue was used by different
      people for different reasons: "some take it to forget their
      worries and sleep without thoughts; others to enjoy in their sleep
      a variety of dreams and delusions; others become drunk and act
      like mertry jesters; others because of love sickness."[22]<br>
      <br>
      Also like Da Orta, Acosta noted that various other ingredients
      were added to bangue for various purposes. Gum areca (Indian betel
      nut), opium, and sugar were common additives. For those who wished
      to hallucinate ("enjoy a variety of dreams"), the recipe called
      for the addition of camphor, clove, nutmeg, and mace. Increased
      sexual potency could be had by adding amber, musk, and sugar.<br>
      <br>
      The last major book of the sixteenth century to mention marijuana
      was written by a Dutchman, John Huyghen van Linschoten. Van
      Linschoten had been especially intrigued by Da Orta's descriptions
      of India and its exotic drugs. He realized the potential for
      success and wealth in catering to Europe's new appetitie for
      vicarious wanderlust by supplying more of the same.<br>
      <br>
      Van Linschoten was a man of single-minded purpose. To visit India
      he had to be employed by the Portuguese since they still
      controlled the subcontinent. Consequently, he left his native
      Holland and took up residence in Portugal, learned the language,
      and eventually got a job in the Portuguese colonies. After his
      tour of duty, he returned to his native Holland and began to write
      about what he had seen overseas. His travel log, or Itinerario as
      he called it, was published in 1596 and was an instant bestseller.<br>
      <br>
      But while he claimed to have written about things he himslef had
      seen, much of the Itinerario's description of the effects of
      bangue were taken almost verbatim from other books such as Da
      Orta's Colloquies. Van Linschoten was not content with simply
      copying Da Orta's text, however. In several instances he
      deliberately embellished or distorted the material he copied to
      make it more interesting. It was also through van Linschoten's
      Itinerario that many readers got the mistaken impression that
      bangue and opium were identical in their effects.<br>
      <br>
      Fifty years later, in 1649, a Portuguese missionary, Fray
      Sebastien Manrique, also mistakenly equated the two drugs in a
      book he wrote describing his own travels in India: "This country
      also produces a plant called Anfion resembling our own hemp [which
      is uded by the people] to assit in the gratification of lust and
      lewdness, by increasing their sexual power... Bangue and posto
      [cannabis spiked with opium] have a similar effect."[23]<br>
      <br>
      Summing up his attitude toward these drugs and the people who used
      them, the friar said: "Being mere barbarians and people ignorant
      of out true and sacred religion, they think only of the pleasure
      of the flesh, believing that the highest pitch of human beatitude
      lies in them [that is, in drugs such as opium and bangue]."[24]<br>
      <br>
      Such errors were not peculiar to the Portuguese. In 1628, Peter
      Mundy, an employee of the British East India Company, wrote that
      bangue had the same effect as opium "soe that most commonly they [
      the natives] will call a druncken fellow either Amphomee [opium
      eater], Postee [opium drunkard] or Bangguee [hemp eater]..."[25]<br>
      <br>
      In 1698, John Freyer, a physician employed by the same British
      company, made a similar mistake. Freyer in fact believed that
      opium was made from bangue. "It [bangue] grows," he said, "as our
      hemp, the juice of whose seed ground in a bowl like mustard-seed,
      and mixed with any other liquor... [causes its users to develop] a
      craving for this poisonous drink... [and when mixed with
      belladonna] bangue is the inebriating confection of the Post
      [opium]."[26] Apparently Freyer was under the impression that the
      cannabis in Post was more potent than the opium in it.<br>
      <br>
      Freyer also describes a form of punishment Inidan rulers meted out
      to subjects who were too important to execute outright:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon an offence they are sent by the King's
      order, and committed to a place called the Post (from the
      punishment inflicted), where the Master of the Post is acquainted
      with the heinousness of the crime; which being understood, he
      heightens by a drink, which they first refuse, made of Bang (the
      juice of the intoxicating hemp), and being mingled with Dutry (the
      deadliest sort of Solanum or Nightshade) name Post, after a week's
      taking, they crave more than ever... [and die].[27]<br>
      <br>
      The French journalist Bernier also remarked on this strange
      torture:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Miscreants] whose heads the Monarch is
      deterred by prudential reasons from taking off... [are brought] a
      large cup of this beverage... early in the morning, and they are
      not given anything to eat until it be swallowed; they would sooner
      let the victim die of hunger. This drink emaciates the wretched
      victims, who lose their strength and intellect by slow degrees,
      become torpid and senseless, and at length die.[28]<br>
      <br>
      The fact that opium was actually mixed with bangue may have been
      responsible for the notion that the two were one and the same or
      that bangue could be chemically transformed into opium. Whatever
      the basis for the error, the idea that bangue had the same
      addicting effects as opium began to take shape in the minds of
      Europeans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The World of Bangue</b><br>
      <br>
      As more and more travelers visited India, more and more began to
      be written about bangue and its effects. A well-known herbal of
      the eightheenth century in which bangue was given special
      attention was published in 1695 by a physician living in India
      named Rumphius. Rumphius remarked that bangue was widely used in
      India to treat all kinds of diseases from gonorrhea to diarrhea.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly interesting account of bangue and its uses in
      Persia and India is contained in another seventeenth-century
      medical treatise by Englebert Kaempfer. Kaempfer was a German
      physician who was equally well known as a historian, political
      scientist, diplomat, and botanist. Very early in life, Kaempher
      earned a reputation as a brilliant scientist, and so impressed the
      king of Sweden that he asked Kaempfer to be one of the ambassadors
      he was sending to Persia to coax the Persians to break ties with
      the Arab empire and begin trading with the West. After the
      unsuccessful delegation returned to Sweden, Kaempfer signed on
      with the Dutch East India Company as fleet surgeon. It was during
      this time that he observed a fascinating spectacle in India
      involving bangue:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of the sacrifices in honor of
      Vishnu, vurgins pleasant to behold and richly adorned, were
      brought to the temple of the Brahmins. They came out in public to
      appease the god who rules over plenty and fine weather. To impress
      the spectators, these young women were previously given a
      preparation with a basis of hemp and datura, and when the priest
      saw certain symptoms, he began his invocations. The Devadassy (the
      term for these girls) then danced, leapt about yelling, contorted
      their limbs, and, foaming at the mouth, their eyes ecstatic,
      committed all sorts of eccentricities. Finally, the priests
      carried the exhausted virgins into a sanctuary, gave them a potion
      to destroy the effect of the previous one, and then showed them
      again to the people in their right mind, so that the crowd of
      spectators might believe that the demons had fled and the idol was
      appeased.[29]<br>
      <br>
      Although intrigued by such spectacles, Kaempfer was no stranger to
      cannabis. During his student days at the University of Cracow he
      says that he used to eat food made with cannabis, so he probably
      had some personal experience with its effects. He was also
      familiar with Pliny's description of the drug as well as its uses
      as a medicinal agent in ancient times, mentioning its properties
      as a soporific and an antispasmotic. From his writings, it appears
      that by the seventeenth century the medicinal properties of the
      plant were fairly well known to the medical profession.<br>
      <br>
      Among the popular travel logs that entertained English readers was
      A Geographical Account of Countries Round the Bay of Bengal,[30]
      an interesting memoir published some time around 1680 by a wizened
      old sea dog named Capt. Thomas Bowrey.<br>
      <br>
      Bowrey was a frequent visitor to India between 1669 and 1679, and
      had sailed up and down the subcontinent carrying supplies and
      goods to and from the various outposts that dotted the seacoast.
      Unlike many Europeans, who lived in India and observed the customs
      and foods of the native people without participating in what they
      saw, Bowrey often partook of the food and especially the
      intoxicating beverages of the country. His observations, as
      described in his book, were English readers' first detailed
      insight into the effects of bangue as experienced by a fellow
      Englishman.<br>
      <br>
      Bowrey began his discussion by noting that bangue had different
      effects on different individuals depending on their temperament:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It operates accordage to the thoughts or fancy
      of the Partie that drinketh thereof, in such manner that if he be
      merry at that instant, he shall continue soe with exceedinge great
      laughter for the before mentioned space of time [four to five
      hours], rather overymerry than otherways, laughinge heartilie at
      every thinge they discerne; and, on the contrary, if it is taken
      in a fearefull or melancholy posture, he shall keep great
      lamentation and seem to be in great anguish of spirit, takinge
      away all manly gesture or thought from him.[31]<br>
      <br>
      In the following excerpt from his travelogue, Bowrey describes his
      first reactions to bangue. Note the precautions he and his
      comrades took to keep from being observed, and the effect of the
      drug on the participants, especially the man who stuck his head in
      a jar:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight or tenne of us to trye practice, wee wold
      needs drinke every man his pint of bangha, which we purchased in
      the bazaar for the value of 6d English. I ordered my man to bringe
      alonge with him one of the Fackeers (who frequently drinke of this
      liquor), promisinge him his dose of the same to come and compound
      the rest for us, which he cordially and freely accepted of, and it
      was as welcome to him as a crowne in moneys. Wee dranke each man
      his proportion, and sent the Fackeer out of dores, and made fast
      all dores and windows, that none of us might run into the street,
      or any person come in to behold any of our humors thereby to
      laught at us.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fackeere sat without the sreet dore,
      callinge us all kings and brave fellows, fancyinge himselfe to be
      at the gates of the Pallace at Agra, singinge to that purpose in
      the Hardostan languadge.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It soon tooke its operation upon most of us,
      but merrily, save upon two of our number, who I suppose feared it
      might doe them harme not being accustomed thereto. One of them sat
      himselfe downe upon the floore, and wept bitterly all the
      afternoone, the other terrified with feare did runne his head into
      a great Mortavan Jarre, and continued in that posture 4 hours or
      more; 4 or 5 of the number lay upon the carpets (that were spread
      in the roome) highly complimentinge each other in high termes,
      each man fancyinge himslefe noe less than an emperor. One was
      quarrelsome and fought with one of the wooden pillars of the
      porch, until he had left himselfe little skin upon the knuckles of
      his fingers. My selfe and one more sat sweatinge for the space of
      3 hours in exceedinge measure.[32]<br>
      <br>
      For his part, Bowrey regarded the effects of cannabis rather
      favorably, speaking of it as "theire so admirable herbe". But
      despite his praises for the drug, Bowrey seems to have suffered a
      mild withdrawal effect after he stopped using it regularly. "Taste
      it hath not any, in my judgement less faire water, yet it is of
      such bewitchinge Scottish nature, that whoever use it but one
      month or two cannot forsake it without muche difficultie."[33]
      Judging from this mild dependency reaction, it is likely tha
      Bowrey's bangue contianed more than a little opium.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The French Itineraria</b><br>
      <br>
      The French also had their world travelers who brought back exotic
      tales of the East and their experiences with hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Laurent D'Arvieux visited the Middle East in 1665-6 and described
      his adventures in Voyage in Palestine, To the Grand Emir, Chief of
      the Arabian Princes of the Desert, Known as the Bedouins.
      D'Arvieux relates that he took a drug called Berge which mat have
      been hashish, but he identifies it at one point as opium and at
      another time as henbane.<br>
      <br>
      In 1686, Jean Chardin, published an account of his adventures in
      the Middle East in Voyages to Persia and Other Parts of the
      Orient, a widely read book which was reissued several times. Like
      most of the European observers, Chardin did not experience the
      effects of cannabis firsthand, but merely related what he had seen
      and been told.<br>

      Regarding cannabis, Chardin distinguishes between the bueng used
      by the Persians and that used in India. Perian bueng, he says, is
      actually a mixture of cannabis, opium, and nux vomica, which is
      also called "Poust". Like John Freyer, Chardin relates to "Poust"
      was given to "state criminals whose lives are to be ended, so as
      to take away their spirit", as well as to "children of royal blood
      whom they wish to render incapable of reigning. They say it is
      less inhumane than killing them, as is done in Turkey, or in
      blinding them as the Persians do." On the othe hand, Indian bueng,
      he says, consists only of cannabis "but in all sects it is only
      the worthless people who drink it, particularly tramps and
      beggars."[34]<br>
      <br>
      In 1681, another French traveler, Pere Ange, who had journeyed to
      Persia to study the plants used by the people, also reported
      (Pharmacopoea Persica) that the Persians used a mixture of
      cannabis and opium which, he says, produced effects similar to
      those Herodotus described when he wrote about the Scythians.<br>

      <b>The Danish Expedition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With all the excitement and curiosity being generated by the
      fascinating accounts of life in other lands, the urge to send even
      more expeditions was infectious. Yet another monarch to be caught
      up in the ebullience of the times was the king of Denmark.<br>
      <br>
      Less interested in staking claim to new territories than in
      learning more about the culture of the Arab world, the knig agreed
      to finance an expedition to the unmapped region of the Yemen, a
      hitherto isolated region of Arabia once known as the Incense
      Trail.<br>
      <br>
      In 1759, the expedition set out to make the long voyage to the
      south. The fact-finders were five prominent scholars - a botanist,
      a zoologist, a philologist, an artist, and a mathematician. Each
      was to exercise his skills as best he could in learning about
      Yemen and its people.<br>
      <br>
      Yemen is an incredibly hot country. The temperature often soars to
      over 120F. Parts of it are almost impassible. When the expedition
      arrived in the country, the villages were primitive outposts built
      either of stone on the highlands or of mud in the low regions.<br>
      <br>
      The country took its toll. Of the five explorers, only one, the
      mathematician Carsten Niebuhr, survived, and even he contacted
      malaria. Seven years after he first set out, Niebuhr finally
      returned to Denmark and filed his report to the king. In 1772, he
      formally published his observations in a book which he called
      Travels in Arabia.<br>
      <br>
      Like many of his fellow explorers who had witnessed and been
      intrigued by the widespread use of bangue or hashish, niebuhr
      reflects in his book the European fascination with the popularity
      of these drugs among non-Europeans.<br>
      <br>
      "The lower people [Sufis] are fond of raising their spirits to a
      state of intoxication," Niebuhr told his readers, explaing that
      they did so by smoking hashish. "which is the dried leaves of a
      sort of hemp." He explained:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoke exalts their courage and throws them
      into a state in which delightful visions dance before their
      imagination. One of our Arabian servants, after smoking Haschisch,
      met with four soldiers in the street, and attacked the whole
      party. One of the soldiers gave him a sound beating, and brought
      him home to us. Notwithstanding his mishap, he would not make
      himself easy, but still imagined, such was the effect of his
      intoxication, that he was the match for any four men.[35]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cannabis in Medicine</b><br>
      <br>
      The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries marked the appearance not
      only of travel books dealing with cannabis, but also of
      "dispensatories" which began referring to cannabis as a medicinal
      agent. Typically, however, these texts were rather cautious in
      their advocacy of hemp as a therapeutic agent. In most instances,
      cannabis's antibiotic and analgesic properties were emphasized.<br>
      <br>
      Although as early as 1621 Robert Burton had suggested that
      cannabis might be of value in the treatment of depression,[36]
      this proposal was never tried in England. The New London
      Dispensatory, published in 1682, contained only a brief reference
      to hemp seeds, claiming that they cured coughs and jaundice but
      filled the head with vapors," but the Complete English
      Dispensatory of 1720 took issue with the recommendation to use
      hemp seeds in treating jaundice, asserting that such
      recommendation is "not hitherto with authority enough to bring
      them into prescriptions of any knid."[37]<br>
      <br>
      The New English Dispensatory of 1764 recommended boiling hemp
      roots and applying them to the skin to reduce inflammation, a folk
      medicinal treatment that had been popular in eastern Europe for
      centuries. Other uses for the concoction were in drying up tumors
      and dissolving deposits in the joints.<br>
      <br>
      The Edinburgh New Dispensatory of 1794, carried a relatively long
      description of the effects of hemp in medicine, indicating that
      its popularity in this regard had begun to increase. "This plant,"
      the text stated, "when fresh, has a rank narcotic smell, the water
      in which the stalks are soaked, in order to facilitate the
      separation of the tough rind for mechanical uses [e.g. rope], is
      said to be violently poisonous, and to produce its effects as soon
      as drunk." Regarding the seeds, the text claims that they yield an
      "insipid" oil when pressed, and that when this oil is added to
      milk, an emulsion is formed which is useful in treating coughs,
      "heat of urine [venereal disease]," and "incontinence of urine."
      The authors also state that cannabis was believed to be useful in
      "restraining venereal appetites," but adds that "experience does
      not warrant their having any virtue of this kind." The section on
      cannabis closes with a foreshadowing of the future: "Although the
      seeds only have hitherto been principally in use, yet other parts
      of the plant seem to be more active, and may be considered as
      deserving further attention."[38]<br>
      <br>
      A few years later, Nicholas Culpepper, the foremost herbalist of
      his time, summarized all the conditions for which cannabis was
      reputed to be an effective medicinal agent. Culpepper repeats many
      of the claims for cannabis contained in the previously mentioned
      dispensatories and adds a few from the classical writings of Galen
      and Pliny, including some of his own recommendations. For example,
      he mentions that cannabis "dries up the natural seed for
      procreation," and "being boiled in milke and taken, helps such as
      have a dry hot cough." "It is held very good to kill worms in men
      and beasts; and the juice dropped into the ears kills worms in
      them; and draws forth earwigs, or other living creatures gotten
      into them." Furthermore, "the emulsion or decoction of the seed
      stays lasks and continual fluxes, eases the colic, and allays the
      troublesome humours in the bowels, and stays bleeding at the
      mouth, nose and other places." Regarding its other effects,
      Culpepper mentions that "the decoction of the root allays
      inflamation of the head, or any other parts; the herb itself, or
      the distilled water thereof doth the like. The decoction of the
      roots eases the pains of the gout, the hard humours of knots in
      the joints, the pains and shrinking of the sinews, and the pains
      of the hips. The fresh juice mixed with a little oil and butter,
      is good for any place that hath been burnt with fire, being
      thereto applied ."[39]<br>
      <br>
      It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that
      cannabis was to be given serious consideration by the medical
      preofession. Until that time, it was sparingly used as a folk
      remedy for certain disorders, but it never enjoyed any popularity
      and there is absolutely no indication that the English ever became
      intoxicated as a result of eating cannabis leaves or seeds. The
      variety of cannabis that grew in England did not produce enough
      resin for it inadvertently to intoxicate any proponent of the
      plant as a home remedy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Linnaeus versus Lamarck</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1753, the hemp plant was christened Cannabis sativa by the
      Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, in his Species Plantarum, and it
      has borne this name ever since.<br>
      <br>
      However, almost as soon as Linnaeus dubbed hemp Cannabis sativa,
      other botanists began to argue that there were two distinct types
      of hemp plant and therefore it was a mistake to lump all hemp-like
      plants under one name. The most notable dissenter was the French
      biologist Jean Lamarck.<br>
      <br>
      In 1783, Lamarck contended that the European hemp plant and the
      Indian hemp plant each warranted its own name. The latter, he
      noted, contained far more resin than the European plant and it
      also appeared noticeably different in other distinct ways. Because
      of these differences, Lamarck reserved the name Cannabis sativa
      for the European plant and gave the name Cannabis indica to the
      Indian plant - indica referring to its place of origin.<br>
      <br>
      Lamarck was not the first or the only scientist to point out the
      differences between the two plants, but he was the first to
      contrast clearly the two types, and his arguments were very
      convincing.<br>
      <br>
      This early argument as to whether there is one species of cannabis
      which includes many different varieties or several species still
      remains to be settled.<br>

            The Indian Hemp Drug Debate</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      India was one of England's most lucrative colonial ventures. The
      English gentry made fortunes several times over from their
      investments in India. Exploitation of natural resources was
      assumed whenever European countries established territorial
      rights, and Parliament usually gave its blessing to any such
      enterprise in expectation of sharing in windfall profits.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes, however, despite the most stringent economic, social,
      and political regulations imposed on the native peoples of another
      country, business ventures failed. Such was the case with the
      British East India Company. The problem was not that the company
      did not make money - its profits were enormous. But many of the
      company's top executives were not adverse to pocketing a little
      extra money at the company's expense. Consequently, while the
      fortunes of the company's managers skyrocketed, the profits of the
      company and its stockholders plummeted. By 1770, the finances of
      the British East India Company were in such a dismal state that it
      was forced to ask Parliament for a loan so that it could avoid
      bankruptcy.<br>
      <br>
      Parliament debated the issue of extending money to such a poorly
      managed enterprise for some time, but finally agreed to underwrite
      such a loan. On condition - the company had to place its operation
      under direct Parliamentary control.<br>
      <br>
      The company's directors had no other recourse. They had to agree.
      As soon as arrangements were made, Parliament began to examine
      various options to get its money back and then some. Among the
      suggestions subsequently adopted was a tax directed at India's
      intoxicating hemp drugs, namely bhang, ganja, and charas.<br>
      <br>
      According to the new law which came into effect in 1798, no one
      was permitted to manufacture or sell hemp drugs without first
      obtaining a license from the Zillah, the administrative office set
      up to collect such revenues. Such a regulation was adopted, the
      law stated, "with a view to check immoderate consumption, and at
      the same time to augment the public revenue."[1]<br>
      <br>
      Although professing altruistic motives, the fact that the law also
      included substances such as tobacco and toddy in its list of
      taxable drugs indicates that the legislation was clearly motivated
      by economic considerations. Any thought for the welfare of the
      people of India was merely lip-service to pacify a small coterie
      of native Indian bureaucrats and the few English government
      workers who felt that widespread abuse of hemp drugs was
      endangering the population.<br>
      <br>
      Among those who believed that hemp drugs were ruining the country
      was the governor general. Drugs such as charas and ganja, along
      with opium and alcohol, "are of so noxious a quality, and produce
      a species of intoxication so extremely violent," he warned, "that
      they cannot be used without imminent danger to the individual as
      well as to the public."[2] The sale of all such drugs, he urged,
      ought to be totally prohibited in India. Poverty, ignorance,
      disease, crime, political corruption, all of which were endemic to
      the country, were attributed to drug abuse, especially bhang,
      ganja , and charas.<br>
      <br>
      The Board of Revenue met to consider these allegations but decided
      that the dangers to the country and its people were not so dire as
      the governor general implied, and decided that if curtailment were
      in the best interests of the country, such curtailment ought to be
      achieved through taxation. These drugs, it declared, "are not for
      the most part represented as producing any very violent or
      dangerous effects of intoxication except when taken to excess...
      we do not recommend that the sale of any of them be altogether
      prohibited, but shall proceed to state what appears to us the best
      means of restricting the use of them, and improving the revenue by
      the imposition of such taxes as are best adapted to the nature of
      the cause."[3]<br>
      <br>
      Such measures were routine answers to the country's problems. Back
      in England, thousands of miles away, Parliament's main interest in
      India was how to extract more money from the country. The people
      could intoxicate themselves as much as they liked. As long as
      England profited form their intoxication and the country remained
      peaceful, Parliament could not have cared less.<br>
      <br>
      England, in fact, was one of the world's main drug suppliers and
      cannabis was but a minor revenue-generating resource. The big
      money lay in opium, and India grew more opium than any other
      country. Thousands and thousands of pounds of opium were offered
      annually at public auctions to English merchants who bought the
      drug and resold it to the Chinese at an enormous profit. When the
      Chinese government tried to stop the flow of opium into the
      country, England sent gunboats into Chinese waters to protect
      British interests. Revenue, not altruism, was Parliament's
      concern.<br>
      <br>
      In 1838, a survey of the agricultural products raised in East
      India was conducted under the auspices of the British government.
      In the course of his report, the official in charge of the survey
      noted that despite the taxes on ganja, it was still being used
      daily by the natives. Furthermore, the drug was being sold
      illicitly in many places and the colonial office suggested that
      perhaps India's hemp drugs ought to be banned outright.<br>
      <br>
      Parliament responded in its own inimitable fashion. It considered
      how to get more taxes out of the people. Since the revenues were
      not so great as had been anticipated, a new method of taxation was
      imposed, one based on the weight of the drug sold instead of on
      potency. When this tactic failed to generate any noteworthy
      increases to the treasury, the overall tax was boosted once more.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, Parliament began hearing reports that Sepoys,
      native Indian soldiers serving in the British army, were using
      ganja and, as a result, the efficiency of Her Majesty's armed
      forces was being undermined.<br>
      <br>
      Criticism started mounting from other directions as well. Bhang,
      it was said, was causing indigestion, coughing, melancholy,
      impotency, insanity, idiocy, and most alarming of all, crime.<br>
      <br>
      Behind the rising complaints against the drug was the nuisance, to
      England at least, of growing Indian nationalism.<br>
      <br>
      In 1870, the financial secretary of the government of India added
      his voice to the growing condemnation of cannabis: "Every lunatic
      asylum report," he stated, "is full of instances of insanity and
      crime due to the use of ganja."[4]<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, little was ever said against bhang or charas. For
      one thing, bhang was rather weak. It was a beverage consumed as
      nonchalantly as a cup of tea. A sizable quantity of bhang would
      have to be consumed before any serious effects would be
      experienced.<br>
      <br>
      Charas was a different story altogether. It was the most potent of
      the three cannabis drugs, and one might expect that if any of
      these three would be accused of inducing abnormality, it would
      have been charas. But charas was also the most expensive of the
      three. It could only be afforded by the wealthy. Hence, the number
      of those using it to excess was comparatively few. Moreover,
      should a situation arise in which some well-to-do user did require
      special attention, relatives and friends could afford to keep him
      out of the public eye.<br>
      <br>
      Ganja, on the other hand, was potent, not very expensive, and
      popular. Those who enjoyed it usually came from the lower classes.
      If they ran afoul of the law, there was no one to speak up for
      them. Generally, they were either thrown into jail or into an
      insane asylum.<br>
      <br>
      When the outcry against cannabis could no longer be brushed aside,
      India's local administrators were instructed to look into the
      charges that cannabis was inciting the natives to criminal acts
      and insanity. On October 10, 1871, the secretary to the government
      of India issued a directive in which he stated the conditions that
      had prompted the inquiry and informed the administrators what they
      should concern themselves with:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has frequently been alleged that the abuse
      of ganja produces insanity and other dangerous effects... you will
      be so good as to cause such investigations as are feasible to be
      carried out in regard to the efforts of the use of or abuse of the
      several preparations of hemp. The inquiry should not be simply
      medical but should include the alleged influence of ganja in
      exciting to violent crime.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The study was conducted without a great deal of fanfare and the
      report was submitted to the central office. After sifting through
      the correspondence, the government issued a statement to the
      effect that there was no proof that cannabis drugs specifically
      incited criminal activities to a greater degree than did any other
      drugs. On the insanity issue, the government admitted that while
      there was "no doubt that its habitual use does tend to produce
      insanity, the total number of cases of insanity is small in
      proportion of the population, and not large even in proportion to
      the number of ganja smokers..."[6] No doubt a major consideration
      in weighing the evidence was that a substantial revenue from the
      taxes imposed on cannabis was finally beginning to be realized.<br>
      <br>
      While local officials continued clamoring that cannabis was
      ruining the country, British lawmakers contended that total
      prohibition would only lead to contraband use. The only way to
      reduce consumption, the government asserted, was to increase the
      cost of these drugs to consumers. Such impositions, it admitted,
      would also raise more income for Her Majesty's coffers.<br>
      <br>
      Local administrators refuse to be silenced, however, and in 1877
      enough pressure was brought to bear upon the cannabis issue that a
      special task force was commissioned to look into the problem. Once
      again the government admitted that excessive use of cannabis drugs
      was harmful, and once again it insisted that the only way of
      reducing consumption was by increasing "the tax on this article as
      high as it can possibly bear... The policy of Government must be
      to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without
      placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will
      insist on having it."[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission</b><br>
      <br>
      Thus far, most of the demands for something to be done about the
      alleged cannabis problem in India had come from local native
      administrators. These officials were drawn primarily from the
      middle and upper classes, and although sincere in their beliefs
      about the dangers associate with cannabis drugs, they viewed the
      issue from the point of view of class distinction. To these
      observers, it was not that the lower classes were poor and
      destitute, not that their opportunities for betterment were
      minimal if not nonexistant, not that they lived in squalor and
      often had to beg or steal to feed themselves and their families,
      not that they were placed in insane asylums because of failing
      health due to inadequate nutrition or disease. Instead, all these
      problems were blamed on the use of ganja and other hemp drugs.<br>
      <br>
      By 1890, however, more and more of the English bureaucracy
      stationed in India were starting to agree with their local
      underlings and they began to express their feelings in the
      newspapers. These statements could not be ignored or dismissed as
      the exaggerated claims of ignorant native administrators. Nor
      could they be brushed aside as the rantings of a rabble of
      dissidents whose criticism of British policy, whatever it might
      be, was their only interest. The authors of these statements were
      respectable English gentlemen and as such they attracted attention
      from other respectable English gentlemen.<br>
      <br>
      Because these statements were issued by English administrators and
      not Indians, they received a certain amount of attention in
      England. The ganja menace, as it was being called, eventually
      caught the attention of the Temperance League, and one of the
      leaders of that movement, who also happened to be a member of
      Parliament, requested Lord Kimberly, secretary of state for India,
      to form a commission to inquire into the cannabis issue in India
      with a view to determining whether cannabis should be prohibited
      altogether in that country. Kimberly agreed, and on March 16,
      1893, he ordered such a commission to be appointed.<br>
      <br>
      The committee that was finally chosen was composed of four English
      and three Indian members. Its mandate was extensive. It was to
      study the method used to cultivate cannabis, the kind of drugs
      made from the plant, and the effects of their consumption on the
      moral and social life of the people of India. In keeping with
      Parliament's primary concern, namely revenues, the committee was
      also instructed to inquire into "the various systems employed for
      taxing the drugs or cultivation of the plant... with special
      reference to the comparative incidence of this taxation in
      different parts of India and to the comparative efficacy of the
      taxation imposed in restricting consumption..."[8]<br>
      <br>
      Once they had dealt with the taxation issue, the committee members
      were to give special attention to two points:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of these is the danger lest
      prohibition, or restrictive measures of a stringent character, may
      give rise to serious discontent, and be resented by the people as
      an unjustifiable interference with long-established social
      custom... It is believed that in some parts of the country bhang
      is, in a special degree, the poor man's narcotic and the possible
      unpopularity of a measure which would deprive the very poorest of
      the population of the use of a narcotic to which they have always
      been accustomed should not be overlooked.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point to which the attention of the
      Commissioners should be directed is the probability or possibility
      that, if the use of hemp drugs id prohibited, those who would
      otherwise continue to use them may be driven to have recourse to
      alcohol, or to stimulants or narcotics which may be more
      deleterious.[9]<br>
      <br>
      Further directives required the commission to recommend "reforms
      and improvements... for controlling the cultivation of the hemp
      plant, and the manufacture, sale, and taxation of hemp drugs,"
      should the evidence warrant the prohibition of any cannabis
      preparation. On this score, the commissioners were advised that
      "absolute prohibition, or repressive measures of a stringent
      nature, may involve inquisitorial proceedings of an unpopular
      character, and afford opportunities for the army of
      blackmail..."[10]<br>
      <br>
      The commission met on August 3, 1893, and remained in session
      until August 6 of the following year. During this time, it
      received written and oral testimony from 1193 witnesses from all
      provinces of India. These witnesses were either summoned directly
      or were sent by local authorities to give testimony. A number of
      witnesses also gave voluntary evidence.<br>
      <br>
      Few of those who appeared before the commission had expertise in
      any matter about which they gave testimony. Most were individuals
      who were supposed to know something about the effects of cannabis
      drugs because of contact with people who used them. Very few were,
      or admitted to being, actual users of cannabis drugs.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of the witnesses were English and native physicians,
      civil and medical officials, magistrates and policemen, farmers,
      traders, and missionaries. The evidence which they gave consisted
      of their answers to carefully worded questions prepared by the
      commission.<br>
      <br>
      So that the commissioners could better evaluate the answers
      received, all witnesses were requested to indicate the source of
      their information and how they had arrived at their opinions and
      statements.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the commissioners also made on-the-spot visits
      throughout the country to inspect firsthand, the role of hemp
      drugs in the lives of the people of India.<br>
      <br>
      The commission's findings were recorded and published in a massive
      seven-volume report. While it is not possible to summarize the
      entire text, some of the more interesting conclusions are
      noteworthy:<br>
      <br>
      Extent of Use. Although ganja was the main revenue-generating
      cannabis drug, bhang, which was not subject to taxation, was the
      most popular of the three cannabis drugs and was the most widely
      used drink among the Hindus.<br>
      <br>
      Among the reasons cited for its popularity was that it was cheap,
      not very potent, and that it not produce unpleasant effects even
      after consumption of large quantities. Charas, by contrast, was
      very expensive and could only be afforded by people of better
      means.<br>
      <br>
      Usage of charas and ganja, the commission noted, was actually
      declining among the upper classes as a result of its rising cost.
      In its place, a newly acquired taste for alcohol, which sold at a
      substantially lower price, had begun to develop among the
      well-to-do.<br>
      <br>
      Social and Religious Usage. Although none of the religious books
      of India required devotees to use cannabis drugs, there was a
      long-standing tradition of such usage in connection with religious
      ceremonies throughout the country. Ganja was especially associated
      with worship of the god Siva. Devotees of this cult believed that
      ganja was a special attribute of this god and their partaking of
      ganja in connection with his worship was akin to communion in the
      Catholic church. The same held true for the Sikh religion. During
      a holiday called Dasehra, every Sikh was required to drink bhang
      in commemoration of the founder of the Sikh religion, Gobind
      Singh.<br>
      <br>
      Effects. To the commission's surprise, neither the native nor the
      European witnesses had any real knowledge or familiarity with
      cannabis's effects. Casual users of these drugs could not be
      readily identified. Moderate users were generally unknown except
      to those who also used these drugs. Since it was not customary to
      use cannabis drugs in the presence of someone considered to be
      inferior, few witnesses would admit using or knowing users of
      these drugs. The only users who were easily identifiable were the
      public inebriants who usually appeared intoxicated and dissipated.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the fact that most witnesses readily admitted being
      unfamiliar with the effects of moderate usage of cannabis drugs,
      the commission was astounded to find them more than willing to
      express dogmatic opinions.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some witnesses know only the medical use of the
      drugs and are prepared to say nothing but good of them, being
      really ignorant of their use as intoxicants. There are also
      witnesses who do not know the use of the drugs as intoxicants, but
      know only moderate use. They have nothing to say of the drugs as
      would be said of alcohol by the man who only had seen a glass of
      wine taken at his own table or at the table of a friend. He knows
      nothing of the effects of excess. Others again have only
      experience of excessive consumption. The moderate consumer has not
      attracted their attention. The ruin wrought in certain classes by
      excess alone attracted their attention. they feel towards these
      drugs as that man feels towards alcohol whose experience had been
      mainly gained among the social wrecks of the lowest parts of the
      great city.[11]<br>
      <br>
      Any understanding of cannabis's effects, the commission concluded,
      had to take into account frequency of usage and potency of
      preparation. Furthermore, the fact that cannabis drugs also
      contained other substances such as opium, datura, and hyoscyamis,
      made it extremely difficult to determine whether the adverse
      effects attributed to ganja and charas were valid. With respect to
      addiction, the commission noted that while most witnesses believed
      that moderate usage eventually developed into excessive usage,
      this belief was based primarily on a general opinion that such
      progression occurred for all intoxicants.<br>
      <br>
      Adverse Physical Effects. Few witnesses were willing to state that
      moderate use of cannabis drugs was harmful to the body. On the
      other hand, most witnesses stated categorically that excessive
      consumption was dangerous. The evidence for this assertion, as was
      the case for most of the claims the commission heard, was based on
      casual observation of very few heavy users. In fact, the
      commission was singularly impressed with the dearth of such
      claims; "The most striking feature of the medical evidence is
      perhaps the large number of practitioners of long experience who
      have seen no evidence of any connection between hemp drugs and
      disease."[12]<br>
      <br>
      Adverse Physiological Effects. The alleged connection between
      cannabis and insanity was a particularly controversial issue.
      Although most asylum superintendents stated categorically that
      excessive cannabis usage led to insanity, the commission noted
      that these officials "know nothing of the effects of the drugs at
      all... and they have generalized from the few cases that were
      brought to them in which the patient's illness was attributed to
      cannabis usage... the opinions they have expressed in stereotyping
      the popular opinion and giving it authority and permanence"[13]
      had only added to the confusion.<br>
      <br>
      Since the testimony of medical experts was so contradictory and
      vague, asylum statistics were examined. However, this effort
      proved valueless because of a lack or a concealment of
      information, lack of agreement as to diagnosis, and simple
      bureaucratic bumbling. The available information, the commission
      noted, usually consisted of guesses by police officers regarding
      the backgrounds and habits of friendless and homeless wanderers.<br>
      <br>
      An examination of 222 cases of insanity reported in 1892,
      allegedly precipitated by cannabis revealed that in only 61 cases
      could a reasonable claim for cannabis-related insanity be made. To
      this the commission cautiously added that "it must be borne in
      mind that it is impossible to say that the use of hemp drugs was
      in all the sole cause of insanity, or indeed any part of the
      cause." Despite this admission, the commission still endorsed such
      a link: "Taking these accepted cases as a whole, we have a number
      of instances where the hemp drug habit has been so established in
      relation to the insanity that, admitting (as we must admit) that
      hemp drugs as intoxicants cause more or less of cerebral
      stimulation, it may be accepted as reasonably proved, in the
      absence of evidence of other causes, that hemp drugs do cause
      insanity."[14]<br>
      <br>
      Crime. In exploring the relation between cannabis and crime, the
      commission separated premeditated crimes such as robbery and
      unpremeditated crimes such as assault arising as a consequence of
      intoxication.<br>
      <br>
      No connection between cannabis and unpremeditated criminal
      behavior could be substantiated. The view that such a relationship
      existed was based on the fact that those who used cannabis drugs
      to excess were usually people from low social and economic status
      groups.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of unpremeditated crimes, especially in crimes of
      violence, most witnesses were of the opinion that, rather than
      increasing the likelihood of violence, habitual users became timid
      and quiet. A number of witnesses did insist, however, that they
      knew of many cases in which cannabis usage led to "temporary
      homicidal frenzy." When questioned further on this point, however,
      these witnesses invariably stated that they could not give any
      examples of such behavior. The witnesses have "a more or less
      vague impression that hemp drugs and violent crime have been
      occasionally associated, but they cannot recall cases," the
      commission noted.[15]<br>
      <br>
      When an inspector general of police was questioned concerning his
      statement that "running amok is always the result of excessive
      indulgence [in cannabis]," he admitted that "I have never had
      experience of such a case. I only state what I have heard." Such
      "witnesses also are typical of a considerable class," the
      commission added, "who refer to hearsay, to rumor, and to
      newspapers as the basis of their opinion."[16]<br>
      <br>
      A third class of witness was also identified "who do not profess
      at all to require any basis of fact for their opinion. They
      speculate on probabilities." Since alcohol incited some people of
      a naturally violent temperament, they imagined that cannabis drugs
      were equally capable of a similar effect. "All this," the
      commission concluded, "tends greatly to lessen the weight of
      evidence in support of the affirmative answer to this question and
      to strengthen the impression that it is but rarely that excessive
      indulgence in hemp drugs can be credited with inciting to crime or
      leading to homicidal frenzy."[17]<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions. Having examined the evidence, the commission
      concluded: (1) Moderate use of cannabis drugs had no appreciable
      physical effects on the body. As with all drugs, excessive use
      could weaken the body and render it more susceptible to diseases.
      Such circumstances were not peculiar to cannabis, however. (2)
      Moderate use of cannabis drugs had no adverse effects on the
      brain, except possibly for individuals predisposed to act
      abnormally. Excessive use, on the other hand, could lead to mental
      instability and ultimately to insanity in individuals predisposed
      by heredity to mental disorders. (3) Moderate use of cannabis
      drugs had no adverse effect on morality. Excessive usage, however,
      could result in moral degradation. Although in certain rare cases
      cannabis intoxication could result in violence, such cases were
      few and far between.<br>
      <br>
      In summarizing the evidence overall, the commission remarked that
      the facts showed "most clearly how little injury society has
      hitherto sustained from hemp drugs."[18]<br>
      <br>
      Recommendations. Taking all the evidence into consideration, the
      commission felt that suppression of bhang would be "totally
      unjustifiable" because its usage was so much part of the social
      and religious life in India, and in moderation it was harmless.
      Moreover, usage of bhang would be difficult to suppress,
      suppression would be very unpopular, and finally, should
      suppression occur, it would have the effect of causing the people
      to turn to more harmful drugs. Although charas and ganja were
      potentially harmful if taken in excess, the commission felt that
      suppression of these drugs was also unadvisable.<br>
      <br>
      As to the tax issue, the commission felt that the government's
      policy of trying to restrict the use of cannabis through taxation
      was the best plan possible: "In the opinion of the Commission, the
      general principle may be fearlessly asserted that it is right to
      tax intoxicants; and the higher they are taxed the better... If it
      necessary to put briefly in words a description of what the policy
      of the Government should be in regard to hemp drugs, it would be
      somewhat as follows: To control their use, and especially their
      harmful use, in such a manner as to avoid a worse evil, and
      subject to this proviso, to tax them as fully as possible."[19]<br>
      <br>
      The report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission has been widely
      praised for its thoroughness and impartiality. "The most complete
      and systematic study of marijuana undertaken to date," one critic
      has said.[20] Another has described the report as "by far the most
      complete collection of information on marijuana in existence."[21]<br>
      <br>
      Without detracting from the report's merits, the fact is that all
      of the evidence submitted to the commission was in the form of
      opinions, and these came from persons who had had very little
      direct contact with cannabis users. As such, it has many
      shortcomings. Its major contribution lies not in the information
      which it collected, but rests instead on its cognizance and
      insight into the many problems that must be addressed in gathering
      and evaluating such information.<br>
      <br>
      Since the data the commission had to evaluate was so biased, the
      only conclusion that ought to have followed was that the opinions
      it had heard were of dubious value. Without comparisons of
      cannabis users and nonusers from the same social and economic
      background, there was simply no way to evaluate issues such as
      cannabis's relationship to physical health, adverse psychological
      impact, criminal behavior, etc.<br>
      <br>
      At the time it was issued, it was indeed the most comprehensive
      study of cannabis ever conducted. But it was merely a first step
      in collecting relevant information, no more than that.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Hashish Problem in Egypt</b><br>
      <br>
      In addition to its territorial possessions in India, England was
      also entrenched in Egypt, although its hold on that country was
      not so tight-fisted as in the eastern subcontinent. Furthermore,
      in contrast to its Indian hemp policy, the English Parliament
      supported local attempts in Egypt to eradicate cannabis. In this
      regard, it is worth noting that England received no revenues from
      the use of cannabis drugs in Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      As in India, local officials in Egypt were alarmed at the large
      numbers of inhabitants who used hashish directly or in
      confections, many of which were exported to Europe. Among the
      variety of confectionery treats containing hashish that were sent
      abroad were "Turkish Delight", square pieces of hashish containing
      sugar and gelatin which were a particular favorite of the students
      at Cambridge University in England.[22] Other well-known treats
      were "Sesame Sweetmeat", flat pieces of hashish, sesame seeds, and
      honey; "Bird's Tongue", black gelatinous pieces of hashish coated
      with sugar; "Saffron", an orange-colored slab of hashish, saffron,
      and spices; "Banana", small banana-shaped pieces of hashish and
      sugar; and "Crocodile's Penis", a black paste made of hashish.
      (The last derived its name from the belief that the penis of the
      crocodile was a potent aphrodisiac and that hashish was capable of
      infusing the amorous spirit in its users.)<br>
      <br>
      An initial attempt to suppress the sale of hashish was made in
      1868 when the Egyptians passed a law making possession a capital
      offence. However, in 1874, importation of hashish into Egypt was
      permitted provided a duty was paid, but possession was still
      prohibited!<br>
      <br>
      In 1877, the sultan of Turkey, who still ruled over Egypt, ordered
      a nationwide campaign to confiscate and destroy the drug. This
      fiat was followed in 1879 by another law making importation
      illegal. In 1884, cultivation of cannabis became a criminal
      offence, but instead of destroying confiscated hashish, customs
      officers were allowed to sell the drug abroad. The money from such
      sales was to be divided among informers and customs officers
      responsible for the seizures.<br>
      <br>
      These laws had very little effect on the use of hashish in Egypt.
      Nevertheless, they were reissued in 1891 and 1894. In 1898, over
      10,000 kilos of hashish were seized and over 500 businesses were
      closed because their proprietors had allowed hashish to be used on
      the premises. In 1908, there were almost 2000 such closings. Yet
      all the attempts to outlaw hashish in Egypt during the nineteenth
      century were as unsuccessful as the earlier attempts of the
      thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had been. They were failures
      all.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever measures officials adopted to keep hashish from being
      grown or imported, they were no match for the ingenuity of the
      hashish dealers. For example, one method used by smugglers to
      bring hashish into the country was to wrap the drug in waterproof
      bags attached to sacks of salt. If a government cruiser happened
      to come across some smugglers, the cargo was quickly dropped
      overboard. Weighed down by the bags of salt, the contraband sank
      to the bottom. In a few days, after the salt had dissolved, the
      bags rose to the surface and were picked up by the smugglers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish in Greece</b><br>
      <br>
      Despite the subjugation of Greece by the Ottoman Turks during the
      Middle Ages, the Greeks were almost totally unaware of hashish and
      its effects prior to the nineteenth century. The first mention of
      the drug in a Greek pharmacopoeia occurred in 1837 and this was
      based on a Bavarian text.[23] In an 1855 pharmacology text,
      cannabis is described as "a plant, indigenous in the East and
      especially in Persia, but cultivated in many areas of Europe and
      Greece..."[24] Apparently, the author was familiar with hemp fiber
      but not hashish. It was not until 1875 that the plant's medicinal
      and narcotic properties were alluded to in Greek medical
      texts.[25]<br>
      <br>
      The entry of hashish into mainland Greece occurred some time
      between 1870 and 1880 following the development of Piraeus as a
      major trade depot in the Aegean. Immigrants from Egypt, Cyprus ,
      and various Mediterranean countries streamed to the port city in
      search of work, and not surprisingly they brought with them their
      hashish habit.<br>
      <br>
      Hashish usage, however, was confined primarily to the poor. The
      drug, in fact, was nicknamed the "weed of the poor",[26] and was a
      favorite among dock workers, shippers, cargo carriers, wagoners,
      deckhands, and barmen.[27] Local demand among the working classes
      became so great for the drug that cultivation of cannabis became a
      major enterprise, with enough grown for export to other countries.<br>
      <br>
      Middle-class Greeks, however, quickly became concerned about the
      spreading use of hashish. They saw the drug as a social danger and
      they regarded hashish users as degenerates and criminals.
      "Criminal", in fact, soon became a popular term for users of
      hashish.[28]<br>
      <br>
      By 1890, the authorities became so alarmed at the widespread use
      of hashish that they officially outlawed the cultivation,
      importation, and usage of this drug.[29] But the law was not
      strictly enforced and hashish usage was only minimally affected.<br>
      <br>
      After World War I, a dramatic rise in hashish usage occurred in
      Greece prompted by the return of Greek soldiers and the
      repatriation of about half a million Greek citizens from Asia
      Minor. These soldiers and citizens had been living in areas where
      hashish was accepted and cultivation was a normal part of life.
      When these people returned to the Greek mainland, they brought
      their acquired habits and familiarity with hashish with them.[30]<br>
      <br>
      During the 1920s, Greece became a major producer of hashish.
      According to one chronicler of the times, it was not uncommon for
      women returning from the hashish harvest to enter their villages
      covered with flowers and singing and dancing as if they were
      drunk. Their unconventional behavior at such times was generally
      attributed to their being overcome by the fumes from ripe cannabis
      blossoms.[31]<br>
      <br>
      Although hashish use is still prevalent in Greece, its popularity
      fell after the German occupation of World War II, primarily
      because most of the users died of starvation.[32] <br>

      <br>
      Long before greed and ambition prompted the countries of Western
      Europe to send their armies to conquer the New World, Europeans
      were exploring and exploiting Africa. The incentives that beckoned
      the white race to the "dark continent" were many, but chief among
      them were goods such as gold, ivory, and spices. Once they began
      to colonize the New World, however, European interest focused on
      yet another African treasure - the slave. The growth of the
      plantation system in both North and South America had created a
      sudden demand for cheap and obedient labor, and to meet this
      demand Europeans looked to Africa.<br>
      <br>
      Africa was no stranger to the slave trade. Human bondage is one of
      man's earliest atrocities. It was commonplace throughout the
      ancient and early medieval worlds. But until the coming of the
      Europeans, slavery had existed on only a relatively small scale.
      Once the people of Western Europe "discovered" the continent,
      however, slavery became big business. Approximately ten million
      natives were taken from their homes between the middle of the
      fifteenth to the end of the nineteenth century to destinations
      sometimes halfway around the world, to be dispassionately sold
      like chattel.<br>
      <br>
      By virtue of their early conquest of the treacherous seas off the
      African coast, the Portuguese were the first to establish outposts
      in Africa, but it was not long before the Dutch, the English, and
      the French began to challenge Portugal's claim to Africa and her
      domination of the slave trade. Unable to retain its grip over the
      entire continent, Portugal had to content herself with a few
      territories while her European rivals each staked claim to
      different parts of Africa. Ironically, Portugal was the last of
      the great European powers to maintain a colonial empire in Africa.<br>
      <br>
      The trading posts and settlements that were subsequently
      established throughout the continent soon brought the Europeans
      into intimate contact with the different native tribes of Africa.
      And just as Europe craved to know all about the lives of the
      savages of India and the New World, so too did they eagerly await
      any news of the quaint and curious customs of the African
      aborigines.<br>
      <br>
      What intrigued Europeans most about these native peoples was their
      primitiveness. They had no police and no jails. Their law was
      uncomplicated: a man who committed a crime was either fined if his
      offence was not serious by tribal standards, or he was executed.
      Their religion was pagan. They had never heard of Jesus. They were
      neither Moslems nor Jews. Instead, they worshipped many gods and
      paid homage to the spirits of the dead. They ate human flesh and
      they offered human sacrifices. Their lives were painfully simple.
      They had no books. They lived in mud huts without windows and
      shared their cramped living quarters with their animals. They sat
      on wooden stools. They ate with their fingers. They wore few
      garments, and those that they did wear were made of animal skins.
      Their women did all the work; their men hunted, looked after the
      cattle, farmed a little, and occasionally went to war. Surely,
      Europe rationalized, God had ordained such people to be slaves to
      the superior white race.<br>
      <br>
      One of the native customs that seemed especially unusual to the
      European mind was their peculiar penchant for eating and smoking
      hemp leaves. To a part of the world that thought of hemp only as a
      source of fiber, this strange practice seemed particularly
      puzzling and fascinating.<br>

      <br>
      When the natives first began using cannabis as a drug is not
      known. The plant is not indigenous to Africa. The only way the
      African natives could have learned about it would have been
      through their contact with outsiders, and the most likely point of
      contact was the Arabs.<br>
      <br>
      The earliest evidence for cannabis in Africa outside of Egypt
      comes from fourteenth-century Ethiopia, where two ceramic
      smoking-pipe bowls containing traces of cannabis were recently
      discovered during an archaeological excavation.[1] From Ethiopia,
      cannabis seeds were carried to the south by Bantu-speaking natives
      who originally lived in North Africa, and from them the use of
      cannabis as an intoxicant spread to other native Africans such as
      the Bushmen and the Hottentots.[2]<br>
      <br>
      One of the books about the people of Africa to mention the
      cannabis habit was written by a Dominican priest, Joao dos Santos,
      in 1609. The plant, he said, was cultivated throughout Kafaria
      (near the Cape of Good Hope) and was called bangue. The Kafirs
      were in the habit of eating its leaves, and those that used it to
      excess, he said, became intoxicated as if they had drunk a large
      quantity of wine.<br>
      <br>
      Far from cowering before the white man, these Kafirs were a proud
      and confident people whose king received his white visitors as
      vassals rather than conquerors. Speaking of their chief, Quiteve,
      dos Santos writes: "if the Kafirs have a suit, and seek to speak
      with the king, they crawl to the place where he is, having
      prostrated themselves at the entrance, and look not upon him all
      the while they speak, but lying on one side clasp their hands all
      the time and having finished they creep out of doors as they came
      in." Visiting Europeans such as dos Santos were required to act in
      like manner. Those the chief desired to entertain were offered
      food and intoxicating spirits which "they must drink, although
      against their stomach, not to condemn the king's bounty."[3] One
      of these intoxicating spirits was bangue.<br>
      <br>
      In 1658, Jan van Riebeeck, the first governor of the Dutch colony
      at the Cape of Good Hope, described the use of cannabis by yet
      another tribe, the Hottentots. These were a yellowish-skinned
      people who spoke a "click" language. They were not a "pure" native
      tribe, but rather the offspring of Egyptian soldiers who had
      deserted their posts in Ethiopia around 650 B.C. and Bushmen
      women.<br>
      <br>
      Although they had once been a warrior tribe, by the time the Dutch
      came to Africa the Hottentots were a tribe of cattle and sheep
      herders. The Dutch called them "beachcombers" because the
      Hottentots frequented the shoreline searching for any edible meat
      still on the carcasses of seals and whales stranded on the
      beaches. This curious scavenging for meat in the midst of herds of
      cattle intrigued the Dutch, as did the Hottentot's reluctance to
      trade his cattle.<br>
      <br>
      The explanation was simple enough, as the Dutch soon learned. To
      the Hottentots, cattle were status symbols. The more a man owned,
      the more respectable his position in the tribe. Frustrated at not
      being able to buy cattle from these natives at a reasonable price,
      the Dutch brought their own cattle to the Cape Colony, along with
      farmers (Boers) to look after them. The coming of the Boers, it
      turned out, signalled the enslavement of the Hottentots.<br>
      <br>
      At first, the Dutch and the Hottentots got on fairly well
      together. But as more and more Boers came to the Cape Colony, more
      and more of the Hottentot's land was expropriated, including their
      valuable grazing fields. The Boers were not merely content with
      robbing the Hottentots of their land, they also began raiding
      their herds.<br>
      <br>
      The Hottentots offered only a token resistance. They were herders,
      not warriors; and their spears were no match for gunpowder. To
      preserve their precious cattle, many of the Hottentots moved
      further north into the interior. Those who tried to make a fight
      of it were either killed or taken prisoner and made to serve as
      domestic servants for the rest of their lives.<br>
      <br>
      The Hottentot custom that most intrigued the Dutch, judging by the
      frequency with which they refer to it, was their unique use of
      hemp, which they called dagga.[4] Dagga, van Riebeeck
      incredulously noted, was more valued than gold by the Hottentots,
      adding that it "drugs their brain just as opium".[5] Since the
      Hottentots had no pockets, they carried their dagga in small
      leather pouches which they pushed under the ivory rings they wore
      around their arms.[6]<br>
      <br>
      In 1661, a Dutch surgeon named van Meerhof, who had married a
      Hottentot girl who spoke both Dutch and Portuguese, stated that
      the Hottentots had tried to smoke dagga but they could not master
      the technique. By 1705, however, both the Hottentots and their
      neighbors, the Bushmen, were smoking, having been taught the art
      by the white man.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lighting Up</b><br>
      <br>
      Once the natives learned the technique of smoking, the inhalation
      of burning dagga leaves quickly spread from tribe to tribe. The
      popularity of smoking even created a new demand for pipes, and a
      new skill, pipe making, came into being.<br>
      <br>
      Intoxication by means of smoking instead of chewing also altered
      African culture. No longer was dagga consumed alone. Smoking
      transformed the taking of dagga into a communal event, especially
      among those tribes that had few pipes.<br>
      <br>
      Pipe bowls were made of various materials such as wood, stone,
      bone, or pottery, and were often fitted to a horn filled with
      water.<br>
      <br>
      At the start of a typical native "smoke-in", a quantity of water
      was put into the horn, the mouth was applied to the large orifice
      of the horn, and the smoke, after being drawn through the water,
      was inhaled quickly three or four times and then exhaled in a
      violent fit of coughing, causing tears to stream down the cheeks:
      "This was considered the height of ecstasy to the smoker. The
      process continued until the fumes of the dagga produced a kind of
      intoxication or delirium and the devotee commenced to recite or
      sing, with great rapidity and vehemence, the praises of himself or
      his chief during the intervals of coughing or smoking."[7]<br>
      <br>
      Quite often, however, a tribe could not afford the luxury of a
      bowl and instead the natives improvised as best they could.
      Sometimes this took the form of a hole in the ground in which the
      dagga was placed. The drug was then mixed with burning manure and
      tunnels were dug into the sides of the mound. To inhale the fumes,
      the smokers lay down with their mouths over the holes. These
      earthen pipes were very common among the Hottentots, Bushmen, and
      the Bantus.[8]<br>
      <br>
      By the end of the eighteenth century, the natives had also begun
      to use tobacco, but they found it too weak for their tastes and
      usually mixed it with dagga. Wrote the Dutch explorer C.P.
      Thunberg,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp [is] a plant universally used in this
      country, though for a purpose very different from that to which it
      is applied by the industrious Europeans. The Hottentot loves
      nothing so well as tobacco, and, with no other can they become so
      easily enticed into a man's service; but for smoking and for
      producing a pleasing intoxication, he finds this poisonous plant
      not sufficient strong; and therefore in order to procure the
      pleasure more speedily and deliciously he mixes his tobacco with
      hemp chopped very fine.[9]<br>
      <br>
      In 1818, the English Explorer, G. Thompson wrote that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the leaves of this plant [hemp] are eagerly
      sought after by the slaves and Hottentots to smoke, either mixed
      with tobacco or alone. It possesses much more powerfully
      stimulating qualities than tobacco, and speedily intoxicates those
      who smoke it profusely, sometimes rendering them for a time quite
      mad. This inebriating effect is, in fact, the quality for which
      these poor creatures prize it. But the free use of it, just like
      opium, and all such powerful stimulants, is exceedingly
      pernicious, and gives the appearance of old age in a few years to
      its victims.[10]<br>
      <br>
      Despite his disapproval of the drug, Thompson says that the white
      landowners cultivated cannabis for their servants, even though its
      intoxicating and deleterious effects were not in the best
      interests of the whites. The reason for this anomaly, explains
      Thompson, was that the white man used dagga "as an inducement to
      retain the wild Bushmen in their service whom they have made
      captives at an early age... most of these people being extremely
      addicted tot he smoking of dacha (dagga)".[11]<br>
      <br>
      There were some whites such as evangelist Hugo Hahn who shared
      Thompson's belief that continued use of dagga was not in the best
      interests of the natives. Hahn had come to Africa to save the
      souls of the savages. Their use of dagga, Hahn felt, was a vile
      habit that would keep their souls from entering heaven. Not one to
      sit idly by while souls were at stake, Hahn raided Boer farms,
      burning the wicked plants wherever he found them. His actions did
      little to endear him to either the natives or the white settlers
      of the area.[12]<br>
      <br>
      Although he could not have cared less about the souls of the
      natives, another crusader who condemned the natives' indulgence in
      dagga was the famous American journalist Henry M. Stanley, whose
      rendezvous with the English missionary, David Livingstone in 1871
      is immortalized in his terse greeting: "Mr. Livingstone, I
      presume".<br>
      <br>
      Unlike the compassionate Livingstone, Stanley had little regard
      for the African native whom he described as "wild as a colt,
      chafing, restless, ferociously impulsive, superstitiously timid,
      liable to furious demonstrations, suspicious and
      unreasonable..."[13]<br>
      <br>
      Stanley was in fact totally prejudiced against the native African.
      Regarding the natives' use of cannabis, which he believed weakened
      their bodies and made them unfit to carry his cumbrous cargo, he
      wrote:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly most deleterious to the physical
      powers is the almost universal habit of vehemently inhaling the
      smoke of the Cannabis sativa or wild hemp. In a light atmosphere,
      such as we have in hot days in the Tropics, with the thermometer
      rising to 140 Fahr. in the sun, these people, with lungs and
      vitals injured by excessive indulgence in these destructive
      habits, discover they have no physical stamina to sustain them.
      The rigor of a march in a loaded caravan soon tells upon their
      weakened powers, and one by one they drop from the ranks,
      betraying their impotence and infirmities.[14]<br>
      <br>
      Had Stanley had the misfortune to encounter the Zulus during his
      adventurous treks through the African jungle he might have thought
      otherwise of cannabis's devitalizing effects. According to at
      least one white explorer, A. T. Bryant, whose intimate contact
      with the Zulus is described in his book The Zulu People, "young
      [Zulu] warriors were especially addicted [to dagga] and under the
      exciting stimulation of the drug were capable of accomplishing
      hazardous feats."[15] Some historians have even suggested that the
      Zulus were intoxicated with dagga when they attacked the Dutch at
      the Battle of Blood River in 1838.[16]<br>
      <br>
      The Zulus were not the only tribe to smoke cannabis before going
      into battle. Speaking of the Sothos, David Livingstone wrote that
      the warriors "sat down and smoked it [hemp] in order that they
      might make an effective onslaught."[17]<br>
      <br>
      Apparently, the unwillingness of the natives to risk their lives
      and break their backs so that Stanley could become famous was not
      due to dagga's weakening of their spirits. Yet, for the most part,
      both white man and black man agreed that indulgence in cannabis
      was not in the best interest of the individual or his tribe.
      Contrary to the Zulus, for instance, the Ja-Luo tribe of eastern
      Uganda prohibited their warriors from smoking dagga.[18] In some
      tribes, the men forbade their wives to smoke dagga "on account of
      some evil effect it is said to have upon her or her child, should
      she be about to become a mother".[19]<br>
      <br>
      In his Life of a South African Tribe Henri Junod mentions that the
      Thonga likewise did not condone the use of dagga. To coax their
      sons off the dagga habit, they "break the pipe and take a little
      of the soot which is found inside and mix it with their food
      without their being aware of it. When this has been done three
      times it is said to fill them with disgust for hemp".[20]<br>
      <br>
      Despite attempts to eradicate the cultivation of dagga by both the
      white settlers and the natives, the dagga habit was too much a
      part of the African natives' way of life. Some tribes such as the
      Bergdama of South West Africa, for example, carried on a regular
      trade with neighboring tribes in which they bartered dagga for
      valuable commodities such as cattle, goats, iron, and copper. And
      when the Bergdama paid annual tribute to their overlords, the
      Saan, they did so in the form of dagga cakes.[21]<br>
      <br>
      Smoking dagga was a recreational activity for many tribes, which
      in turn spawned its own recreational games. One such game played
      by the Zulus and the Thonga was a spitting contest. Two
      contestants deeply inhaled the smoke from a dagga pipe and held it
      in their lungs as long as possible. Each player then spit what
      saliva he could muster onto the ground, sometimes with the aid of
      a reed, the object being to form a circle of bubbles around his
      opponent. The bubble symbolized the warriors of an army and the
      idea was that, once surrounded by this army of bubble soldiers,
      the opponent was trapped and thus defeated.[22] The real
      achievement of the game came from the ability to spit, since
      cannabis has the effect of drying up the secretions of the mouth,
      much like atropine, thereby making it extremely difficult to
      produce any saliva at all.<br>
      <br>
      In the French Congo, the Fang had a different use for dagga.
      Before Fang warriors went out to battle, the witch doctor erected
      an altar in the forest. A human sacrifice, usually a captive from
      a neighboring tribe, was then dragged out into the forest and tied
      to the altar. The binding of the victim was the signal for the
      chief to pronounce a ritual chant while the warriors began
      painting themselves and dancing around the altar. After the dance
      was over, the victim was forced to his knees, a white line was
      drawn across his neck, his arms were grasped firmly behind him,
      his head was jerked backward, and a single slash severed his head
      from his body. To prevent any struggling, the hapless victim was
      given a concoction containing dagga shortly before his sacrificial
      offering to the Fang war gods.[23]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The African Hemp Cults</b><br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the most interesting anecdote concerning cannabis in
      Africa relates the way in which the drug transformed the
      Bashilange from a tribe of feuding miscreants to one dedicated to
      peace and goodwill. The storyteller is a German explorer, Herman
      von Wissman.<br>
      <br>
      The Bashilange were originally a very warlike people, Wissman
      tells us:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One tribe with another, one village with
      another, always lived at daggers drawn... The number of scars
      which some ancient men display among their tatooings gives
      evidence of this. Then, about twenty-five years ago [ca. 1850]...
      a hemp-smoking worship began to be established, and the narcotic
      effect of smoking masses of hemp made itself felt. The Ben-Riamba,
      "Sons of Hemp", found more and more followers; they began to have
      intercourse with each other as they became less barbarous and made
      laws.[24]<br>
      <br>
      The transition from feud to friendship was only one of the changes
      initiated by the hemp cult. An entire religion came into being
      based onriamba, the Bashilange word for cannabis, which became the
      symbol of peace, camaraderie, magic, and protection. Tribesmen
      were no longer permitted to carry weapons in their villages, they
      called each other friend, and they greeted one another with the
      word moyo, meaning "life" and "health". Although formerly
      cannibals, they abjured their previous custom of eating the bodies
      of their captured enemies.<br>
      <br>
      For their religious ceremonies, which occurred nightly, the men
      stripped naked and shaved their heads. Then they sat in a large
      circle and smoked cannabis from large pipes. Those who did not
      take part in the communal smoke-in were charged with beating
      drums, blowing ivory trumpets, and chanting. In addition to these
      nightly get-togethers, cannabis was smoked on all important
      holidays and at the conclusion of all alliances.<br>
      <br>
      Although widely used by the men, Bashilange women were rarely
      allowed to smoke cannabis. The prohibition was a matter of tribal
      policy and reflected the position of the female in Bashilange
      society. It was she who was required to perform all the routine
      jobs in the village and her busy schedule allowed her no time for
      idleness, especially of the kind endengered by dagga.<br>
      <br>
      Following the adoption of the cannabis cult, the Bashilange also
      began to believe in reincarnation. The appearance of von Wissman
      in their village was in fact greeted as proof that the dead could
      return. This white man, they believed, was the reincarnation of
      their dead chief Kassongo. The German, the people said, had lost
      his black skin in the big water. When the joyful reconciliation
      ended, the natives brought von Wissman his old "wife", informing
      him that his other wives and his former property would be returned
      to him as well. Unfortunately, von Wissman did not record his
      reaction to his new matrimonial status.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis also assumed a special importance in Bashilange
      jurisprudence. Any native accused of a crime was required to smoke
      dagga until he either admitted his crime or lost consciousness. In
      cases of theft, the robber had to pay a fine, consisting of salt,
      to each person who witnessed his smoking. The crime of adultery
      required that the guilty male smoke dagga as well. However there
      was no fine. The amount of dagga to be smoked depended on the
      status of the man who had been cuckolded. If the latter were
      important, the guilty man had to smoke until he lost
      consciousness. He would then be stripped, pepper would be dropped
      into his eyes and/or a thin ribbon would be drawn through his
      nasal bone. More serious crimes were accompanies by additional
      punishments.<br>
      <br>
      Not all the Bashilange were favorably disposed toward the new
      cult. For one thing, many Bashilange began to take advantage of
      the leniency of the new laws. Before the cult, the seduction of a
      woman carried a heavy fine, and inability to pay the fine usually
      resulted in bloodshed. The new law of the bene riamba forbade the
      payment of any such fines, much to the annoyance of many
      disgruntled fathers.<br>
      <br>
      The Bashilange nobility was also upset by the new changes.
      Hitherto, high-status tribesmen were permitted to wear cotton
      garments. The new laws of brotherhood did away with such class
      distinctions. Now anyone who could afford them could wear such
      clothes.<br>
      <br>
      The Bashilange also suffered a great loss of wealth after the
      adoption of the cult. Previously, neighboring tribes that were
      vassals of the Bashilange had paid them tribute. Now that their
      former masters had renounced the spear for the dagga pipe, these
      vassals refused to continue paying tribute, and without going to
      war the Bashilange had no way to enforce their demands.<br>
      <br>
      All these problems came to a head around 1876 when a serious
      rebellion against the chief broke out. The chief, his brother, and
      his sister were accused of having killed a man by sorcery. It was
      a trumped-up charge, but the accused had to smoke dagga until they
      became unconscious. When finally they fell to the ground, they
      were attacked and stabbed by their enemies. Had it not been for
      the intervention of some of the other villagers, they would have
      been killed. Having failed in their attempt to assassinate the
      royal family, the leaders of the rebellion deserted the village,
      but they soon returned to their homes and were never punished for
      their crime.<br>
      <br>
      The end was near at hand, however, and it was not long before the
      anticannabis forces mustered enough support to overthrow the
      riamba cult. The tribe returned to many of its old customs, but
      many of the changes initiated as a consequence of the adoption of
      the cult remained. The Bashilange ceased their warlike activities
      against their neighbors, much of the legal system was preserved so
      that harsh penalties were rarely applied, and cannabis still
      remained an integral part of their daily lives.<br>
      <br>
      Another African hemp cult about which very little is known was
      located in the Sudan. The founding of the cult was attributed to a
      mysterious woman named Sirdar. Its purpose is not well known, but
      it appears that the participants shared feelings of opposition to
      the local chiefs in the area.<br>
      <br>
      Directly under Sirdar were two lieutenants known as her mudirs.
      These officers had their own subordinates who supervised yet
      another group further down the hierarchy. The lowest level of the
      echelon was charged with establishing cliques to promote the
      smoking of dagga throughout the district. Sirdar's organization
      and her message, whatever it was, was apparently a huge success
      for gifts regularly poured into her camp from locales as far as
      two or three days' journey from her headquarters. Yet, like the
      riamba cult, Sirdar's influence in the Sudan eventually declined
      and the hemp cult she introduced also disappeared.[25]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The "Coolie" Problem</b><br>
      <br>
      By the time the white man came to Africa, dagga had become a part
      of the native's way of life. In the quest for altered
      consciousness and escape from the humdrum characteristic of nearly
      all societies, primitive or highly industrialized, Africa had
      become a country of dagga cultures whereas Europe besot itself in
      alcohol. Like alcohol, dagga was a relaxant, a social lubricant,
      an integral part of religious ceremony, and a drug of abuse. Since
      Europe sat in judgement of Africa alcohol was rarely given a
      second thought, whereas the natives' use of dagga was considered
      by many to be morally reprehensible. As long as dagga was taken
      primarily by the black man, white Africa took little interest,
      other than amusement, in these peculiar drug cults. When cannabis
      subsequently took root in their own cities, however, the fear of
      contamination by such foreign practices began to alarm segments of
      white society. The change in attitude occurred shortly after 1843,
      when the Republic of Natalia (Natal), on the northeast coast of
      South Africa, was annexed by England and made part of the Cape
      Colony. Following the development of the sugar industry in the new
      province, more and more laborers were needed to work the fields.
      When native manpower proved unequal to the task, workers were
      sought from other countries, especially from the British colony of
      India, and about 6000 mainly low-caste Indians entered the
      country.[26]<br>
      <br>
      Although brought over expressly to work in the sugar fields, these
      "coolies", as they were called, left the fields as soon as they
      were able to satisfy their indenture obligations and they sought
      jobs in other industries. Many became semiskilled laborers,
      domestic servants, farmers, storekeepers, fishermen, etc. But
      while they fitted into the European way of life, they never became
      part of it. Their dark skins, culture, social and religious
      background, and language set them apart from both the Europeans
      and the native Africans.<br>
      <br>
      Europeans were also suspicious of them because of their use of
      cannabis, a habit which they brought with them from India.
      Cannabis, the Europeans believed, made the "coolies" sick and lazy
      and therefore unable to work, and also led them to commit criminal
      acts.<br>
      <br>
      The Indian emigrees had not had to import cannabis seeds with
      them; cannabis was already a popular drug among the natives and it
      was probably from them that the Indians obtained their cannabis.
      It was not long, however, before legal steps were adopted to
      curtail such usage. By 1870, European settlers became so alarmed
      at the alleged dangers of cannabis to South Africa that they
      passed a law "prohibiting the smoking, use, or possession by the
      sale, barter, or gift to, any coolies whatsoever, of any portion
      of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa)..."[27]<br>
      <br>
      But just as identical laws in other countries had no effect on the
      use of cannabis, so too was it ignored in Africa. In 1887, the
      Wragg Commission (named after its chairman, Supreme Court Judge
      Walter Wragg) concluded that the "coolies" were still using
      cannabis and that the drug posed a danger to white South Africans.
      Again, measures were taken to outlaw the sale, cultivation,
      possession, and use of cannabis. Such laws were no more successful
      than previous ones.<br>
      <br>
      In 1923, South Africa tried to enlist the aid of the League of
      Nations in outlawing cannabis on an international scale, but to no
      avail. Five years later, the country passed yet another
      anticannabis law. This was followed by still more anticannabis
      laws. The result was always the same - try though they might to
      legislate cannabis out of existence, South African lawmakers were
      never a match for the plant's tenacious hold over its devotees..<br>

      For twenty years Napoleon had led his loyal minions against the
      armies of Europe. His spectacular victories, often against
      overwhelming odds, filled France with a feeling of pride and
      ebullience. No matter that the cost of victory had been two
      million French casualties. These dead were heroes. [1]<br>
      <br>
      Despite his ultimate defeat and the terrible price of the
      transient glory he gave France, Napoleon would always be
      remembered for what he did on the battlefield and for what he
      accomplished on the domestic front, especially in the area of
      civil liberties.<br>
      <br>
      Although it had not been his intention of doing so, Napoleon's
      military exploits were also responsible for introducing thousands
      of French soldiers to hashish. The initiation came about as a
      consequence of the French invasion of Egypt in 1798 and caused
      Napoleon some concern that his troops might become dissipated and
      unruly because of their indulgence in the drug.<br>
      <br>
      Then, as now, army life was basically a series of endless routines
      and insurmountable boredom. To pass the time, some men will drink
      themselves into oblivion. But in Moslem Egypt, alcohol was not the
      intoxicant of choice. The Egyptians preferred another drug, and
      that drug, of course, was hashish. So widespread did the hashish
      habit become among his men that in October 1800 Napoleon issued
      the following ordinance to the French army of occupation:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is forbidden in all of Egypt to use certain
      Moslem beverages made with hashish or likewise to inhale the smoke
      from seeds of hashish. Habitual drinkers and smokers of this plant
      lose their reason and are victims of violent delirium which is the
      lot of those who give themselves full to excesses of all sorts.
      [2]<br>
      <br>
      The soldiers heard the order, probably nodded in agreement, and
      went right on using hashish. Along with the soldiers, three French
      scientists - Silvestre de Sacy, Rouyer, and Desgenettes - whom
      Napoleon had brought with him to study the country and its people,
      also began using hashish, ostensibly to see for themselves what
      this drug did to the human body. Intrigued by their experiences
      with hashish, they sent some back to France for their colleagues
      to conduct further experiments in their laboratories.<br>
      <br>
      The first of these studies to be published appeared in 1803 by a
      Dr. Virey, who made various extracts of hashish, hoping to track
      down the drug's elusive active principle. After studying the drug
      at length, it was Virey's opinion that hashish was nothing less
      than the mysterious nepenthe used by Helen of Troy to drug her
      guests into a stupor of forgetfulness.<br>
      <br>
      Soon after the army's return, the French began hearing about the
      incredible effects of hashish from both the soldiers who had used
      it themselves and from the country's scientists who had had an
      opportunity to study the drug and its mystique while serving with
      the army in Egypt. It was shortly after the army's return to
      France, for instance, that Silvestre de Sacy, the foremost Arabic
      scholar in the world at that time, announced that he had at last
      solved the long-baffling mystery of the origin of the name of the
      Assassins - the Arabic gang of cutthroats who had terrorized the
      Middle East at the time of the Crusades. In an address to the
      Institute of France in 1809, Silvestre de Sacy claimed that the
      word "assassin" was derived from hashish, a common term for
      herbage or grass in the Arab world. He then argued that cannabis
      was considered to be like grass and that the mysterious potion
      mentioned by Marco Polo was in fact hashish:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intoxication produced by the hashish [can
      lead to a] state of temporary insanity [such that] losing all
      knowledge of their debility [users] commit the most brutal
      actions, so as to disturb the public peace... it is not impossible
      that hemp, or some parts of that vegetable, mixed with other
      substances unknown to us, may have been sometimes employed to
      produce a state of frenzy and violence. [3]<br>
      <br>
      In 1818m a Viennese writer, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall,
      capitalized on European interest in the Assassins and the stories
      of hashish, the exotic drug of the Arab world, by publishing the
      first full-length book to be written about the sect. Originally
      published in German, the book became so popular it was soon
      translated into French (1833) and English (1835). The link between
      hashish and the Assassins became firmly soldered in cannabis
      folklore from that time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Drugs and Dreams</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prior to 1800 there were only about ten references to cannabis in
      all of French literature, travel books or botanical books. Between
      1800 and 1850, no fewer than thirty articles and books were
      published on the subject in France. The Thousand and One Nights,
      with its tales of hashish intoxication, drug-induced
      hallucinations, and "double consciousness", topped the bestseller
      lists for many years. Famed Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy's
      warning that hashish produced ecstasy, delirium, insanity, and
      even death, only whetted the public's appetite for more.<br>
      <br>
      Among those to become enthralled by the furor over this strange
      drug were a number of young writers, poets, and artists, who
      thought that hashish's peculiar effects on the mind might be a way
      to enhance their creativity.<br>
      <br>
      The post-Napoleonic era in France and throughout the rest of
      Europe was a time of soul searching. People seemed disenchanted
      with the achievements of the "rational age" which had only made
      war more terrifying, and searched instead for the hidden,
      irrational, emotional self that was buried deep within the human
      mind, whose activity could be glimpsed only in dreams. If only
      they could discover the entrance to this hidden world, they could
      communicate with the unconscious.<br>
      <br>
      At first they relied on opium. Opium's potential for psychic
      enlightenment came to the attention of the literary world as a
      result of a series of articles appearing in London Magazine in
      1821. Thomas de Quincey, the author of these Confessions of an
      Opium Eater, had held his readers spellbound with descriptions of
      his weekly excursions into the world of this mind-altering drug
      and the excruciating torment he later suffered as a consequence of
      his addiction. For many writers, opium promised to be the key that
      would unlock the invisible bonds shackling them to the mundane
      world of the conscious self. Once freed, perhaps it might be
      possible to conjure up the hidden muse of creativity. Out of
      drug-inspired dreams and altered consciousness might come plots
      for stories, images for poems, ideas for art.<br>
      <br>
      It was especially the potential for producing dreams that first
      attracted novelists, poets, and artists to opium. Many of the
      major literary giants kept notes of their dreams and used these
      notes in their work. Browning, Coleridge, Poe, Wordsworth, etc.,
      all kept pad and pen beside their beds to record their nightly
      visitations from their dream muses. Not to be able to remember a
      dream was a regrettable loss to a writer's creativity. The
      drug-induced dream promised enhanced creativity with each swallow.<br>
      <br>
      But many who chose this route to the hitherto inaccessible regions
      of the human mind later regretted their decision; De Quincey was
      not the only one to experience the agony of addiction. Their
      experiences in opiate hell led to the search for some other drug,
      some other type of chemical concoction with opium's desirable
      effects, yet free of its nightmarish properties.<br>
      <br>
      There were stories of such a drug. Veterans of the Egyptian
      campaign used to tell about a drug right out of the pages of the
      Arabian Nights, a drug known as hashish. There were also rumors
      that a well-known doctor in Paris was asking for volunteers to
      test this drug.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish and Madness</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jacques-Joseph Moreau (1804-84) had studied psychiatry under
      one of its most important innovators, Jean Esquirol. It was due to
      Esquirol's influence, for instance, that psychiatrists began to
      recognise that the events preceding mental breakdown sometimes
      held the key to the mystery of mental illness. It was also due to
      Esquirol's influence that psychiatrists such as Moreau became
      intrigued with hallucinations, believing that if psychiatry could
      only determine what caused them, it might be able to get at the
      cause of insanity itself.<br>
      <br>
      Duly impressed with his teacher's emphasis on causality and
      hallucinations as the keys to understanding and treating mental
      illness, Moreau pondered how to experience insanity without first
      suffering a mental breakdown:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To understand an ordinary depression it is
      necessary to have experienced one; to comprehend the ravings of a
      madman, it is necessary to have raved oneself but without losing
      the awareness of one's madness, without having lost the power to
      evaluate the psychic changes occurring in the mind. [4]<br>
      <br>
      By knowing what a patient was experiencing, Moreau felt that he
      might eventually understand the psychotic state and devise a
      method to treat it. His tool for producing this "model psychosis"
      was to be hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Moreau had first tries hashish during a trip through the Arab
      countries in the 1830's. He was no doubt already familiar with
      some of the properties of hashish through the writings of other
      doctors, but it was not until 1840 that he became intrigued at
      hashish's potential for exploring the mind after reading a
      scientific article by Dr. Aubert Roche entitled "Du typhus et de
      la pests en Orient" (Concerning Typus and the Pestilence in the
      Orient). Although Roche had only claimed that the Egyptians were
      less susceptible to diseases that plagued Europeans because of
      their indulgence in hashish, Moreau began to think seriously of
      other uses for the drug.<br>
      <br>
      "There are two modes of existence - two modes of life - given to
      man," Moreau mused. "The first one results from our communication
      with the external world, with the universe. The second one is but
      the reflection of the self and is fed from its own distinct
      internal sources. The dream is an in-between land where the
      external life ends and the internal life begins." [5] With the aid
      of hashish, he felt that anyone could enter this in-between land
      at will.<br>
      <br>
      During the course of his studies with hashish. Moreau began to
      notice a peculiar relationship between the amount of the drug he
      administered and its effects. A small dose produced a sense of
      euphoria, calmness, lassitude, and apathy. A little higher dose
      and attention began to wander. Ideas appeared at random. Time
      sense was distorted; minutes became hours. Thoughts rushed
      together. Sensory acuity seemed greater. More drug yet, and dreams
      began to flood the brain. These dreams Moreau felt, were like the
      hallucinations of insanity.<br>
      <br>
      Moreau's experiments with hashish led him to the conclusion that
      insanity was not due to brain damage, as many of the leading
      psychiatrists of his day maintained, but was instead due to a
      change in the way the brain functioned, a change that was caused
      by a chemical alteration in the nervous system. A hundred years
      later, psychiatrists working with LSD would come to a similar
      conclusion.<br>
      <br>
      Because his supply of hashish was limited, Moreau decided not to
      explore possible therapeutic applications to which hashish might
      be put. Instead, he decided to follow through on his initial idea
      to use the hashish experience as a model psychosis. To conduct
      such studies, however, he had to be able to observe the effects of
      hashish objectively. By experimenting on himself, he had gained
      some insight into what the drug did to the mind. But perhaps these
      subjective impressions were inaccurate? Hashish distorted time
      sense; might it not also distort other impressions? Only by
      enlisting the aid of volunteers could he observe the drug's
      effects on others while he himself was free of hashish's reverie.
      It was in this role as dispassionate scientist that Moreau became
      drug dispenser tot he Hashish Club, a coterie of France's leading
      writers, poets, and artists.<br>
      <br>
      Although Moreau's work in psychopharmacology is now recognized for
      its pioneering approach to the study of the way drugs affect the
      brain, his own colleagues failed to recognize the value and
      importance of his studies.<br>
      <br>
      In 1846, a year after the publication of his 439-page book, Diu
      Hachish et de l'alienation mentale - etudes psychologiques
      (Hashish and Mental Illness - Psychological Studies), Moreau
      decided to enter it in a competition sponsored by the French
      Academy of Sciences. The other entries consisted of other medical,
      surgical, and neurological books. Six of these entries receive
      prizes; two received honorable mentions, among them Moreau's book.
      Even this distinction might have eluded him had not one of the
      judges been impressed with the intriguing relationship between
      drug dosage and subjective effects. Were it not for Theophile
      Gautier and the Hashish Club, Moreau would probably be even less
      known than he already is, although he was one of the earliest
      scientists to study hashish and to propose drugs as tools in the
      study of mental aberrations.<br>
      <br>
      Far from being disinterested in hashish, however, French
      scientists seemed very curious and intrigued about its therapeutic
      potentials. In 1847, the Pharmaceutical Society of Paris posted a
      prize for the isolation of the active principle in cannabis, which
      was eventually won in 1857. In 1848, the first doctoral thesis on
      hashish was written by DeCourtive, whose pharmacopoeia Charles
      Baudelaire later relied on for much of his information about
      hashish.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish's Advance Man</b><br>
      <br>
      Among the luminaries of the French world who sought in hashish the
      key to expanded consciousness was Pierre Jules Theophile Gautier.
      A failure as a painter and poet, Gautier became an overnight
      sensation in 1835 at the age of twenty-four with Madamoiselle de
      Maupin, the story of a transvestite, hailed by one critic as "the
      most daring novel... that ever a full-fledged Romantacist could
      write." [6]<br>
      <br>
      Gautier's view of life is best stated in the preface to this
      novel. A special award ought to be given to people who invent new
      pleasures, he tells his readers, "for enjoyment seems to me to be
      the end of life, and the only useful thing in the world." [7]<br>
      <br>
      No doubt, one of the first recipients of such an award, had
      Gautier had his way, would have been Moreau, who introduced him to
      the wonders of hashish. As a result of this encounter with Moreau,
      Gautier subsequently founded the famous Hashish Club (Club des
      Hachichins) which met on a monthly basis in the elegant Hotel
      Lauzun in Paris's Latin Quarter. It was during these sessions that
      Moreau dispensed dawamesk (a mixture of hashish, cinnamon, cloves,
      nutmeg, pistachio, sugar, orange juice, butter and cantharides) to
      such notables as Alexandre Dumas, Gerard de Nerval, Victor Hugo,
      Ferdinand Boissard, Eugene Delacroix, and Gautier himself.<br>
      <br>
      Gautier's own interest in hashish stemmed in large part from
      curiosity. He had heard the gossip of the French soldiers who had
      first tried the drug in Egypt and was intrigued by their stories.
      Gautier was also astute enough to realize that the French public
      would be just as interested as he himself was in hashish. They too
      had heard stories of this mysterious drug, and the popularity of
      books about the Arab countries such as The Thousand and One Nights
      was proof enough that articles of this kind would sell.<br>
      <br>
      In 1843, Francois Lallemand anonymously published Le hachych, the
      first book to incorporate hashish as a plot device. The book
      became popular enough to warrant reissue in 1848 and this time it
      carried Lallemand's name as the author. But it was Gautier's "Le
      hashish", also published in 1843, which captured and held
      imaginations. It was a relatively short article describing the
      various hallucinations Gautier experienced while under the
      influence of the drug - the changes in colors and designs; the
      disfigurement of bodies; and the sensation of being able to hear
      colors and see sounds (a phenomenon known as synesthesia) - and
      its popularity encouraged Gautier to write another.<br>
      <br>
      His second article appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes in 1846
      and was entitled "Le Club des Hachichins". Although it contained
      relatively little concerning his experiences under the influence
      of hashish that he had not already described, it was to become the
      better known of his writings on the subject because of his
      description of the Hotel Lauzun and the members of the club that
      gathered there.<br>
      <br>
      The hotel immortalized by Gautier was built in 1657 by the duc de
      Lauzun as his personal palace, and he lived there until his death
      at the age of ninety in 1723. In its time it was a magnificent
      architectural feat, but by the 1840s it was more rundown than
      remarkable. When first erected, the building's three stories made
      it one of Paris's skyscrapers. Its large windows, tiny panes of
      glass, and stone balcony were city landmarks. To the left of the
      front door were red, bright-yellow, and gold-colored iron posts.
      At about the level of the first floor was a gargoyle dragon that
      looked down on all who called upon the duke. The popularity of
      Gautier's writings on hashish, it has been said, was not so much
      due to his descriptions of the hashish experience as to the moody
      atmosphere of the gathering place of the Hashish Club and the
      eminent people who assembled there to partake of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      The fascination evoked by Gautier's article is immediate. Gautier
      sets the mood with deliberation. It is night. A fog drifts in of
      the Seine. Nothing is discernible. Shapes are indistinct, fuzzy,
      there and gone. When at last Gautier finds the hotel and knocks at
      the door, he is met by an old porter who points the way with a
      "skinny finger stretched outwards".<br>
      <br>
      Among those who greet him at the top of the stairs is a mysterious
      doctor (Moreau) who hands him a "morsel of paste of greenish jam
      about as large as a thumb from a crystal vase", as he cautions
      that "this will be deducted from your share in Paradise". [8]<br>
      <br>
      Gautier then goes on to tell his readers about the Old Man of the
      Mountain and the Assassins, declaring that the "green paste that
      the doctor had just passed out among us was precisely that which
      the Old Man of the Mountain used to administer to his fanatics...
      that is, hashish, whence come hashisheen or hashish-eater, the
      root of the word 'assassin', whose ferocious meaning is readily
      explicable of the blood thirsty habits of the votaries of the Old
      Man of the Mountain". [9]<br>
      <br>
      The sinister relationship between hashish and death is further
      developed in Gautier's description of his table fellows -
      "long-haired, bearded, moustached or singularly shorn guests,
      brandishing sixteenth century daggers, Malayan drisses or
      navajas..." [10]<br>
      <br>
      As the meal draws to a close, Gautier begins to hallucinate. The
      faces of the people at the table change shape and color, and
      "madness, like a wave foaming against a rock, which withdraws to
      hurl itself once more, entered and departed my brain, at length
      altogether invading it." [11]<br>
      <br>
      The guests retire to the drawing room. Gautier sinks into a chair
      by the fireplace and surrenders himself to the drug. Totally
      absorbed in his thoughts, he knows that others are with him in the
      room, but he sees no one. He is completely wrapped up in himself,
      his mind filled with grotesque characters whose faces and bodies
      are monstrously contorted.<br>
      <br>
      The rest of his narrative contains much of the same material. The
      images which Gautier calls to mind are thoroughly at home in the
      Gothic interior of the Hotel Lauzun. The grotesque shadows which
      lace through his thoughts as he hallucinates owe much to his
      surroundings. From Gautier's description, the reader senses that
      hashish is indeed the boatman ferrying passengers across the Styx
      of imagination to the netherworld of insanity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish's Troubadour</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Without doubt the best known member of the Club des Hachichins was
      the brooding melancholic Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire was no
      stranger to drugs. During his youth he lived in the Latin Quarter,
      a section of Paris like San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district of
      the 1960s, inhabited mainly by students, writers, artists, and
      thieves. The streets were narrow, dimly lit, and foul smelling.
      Students "hung out" at cafes and restaurants carousing and
      boasting about real and imagined sexual conquests. They drank to
      excess and indulged themselves in all the latest vices, among
      which were opium and hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Baudelaire first met Gautier toward the middle of 1849 thanks to a
      mutual friend, the artist Fernand Boissard. Boissard and Gautier
      were both tenants at the Hotel Lauzun, and in the course of things
      Baudelaire was invited to attend the meetings of the Hashish Club.
      Yet, always the loner, Baudelaire rarely accepted the invitation.<br>
      <br>
      In the preface to his Flowers of Evil (Fleurs du Mal), published
      in 1868, Baudelaire confesses that he usually avoided these
      clandestine soirees and that when he did attend, it was only as an
      observer. Gautier corroborates this confession:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is possible and even probable that
      Baudelaire did try hascheesh once or twice by way of physiological
      experiment, but he never made continuous use of it. Besides, he
      felt much repugnance for that sort of happiness, bought at the
      chemist's and taken away in the vest-pocket, and he compared the
      ecstasy it enduces to that of a maniac for whom painted canvas and
      rough drop-scenes takes the place of real furniture and gardens
      balmy with the scent of genuine flowers. He came but seldom, and
      merely as an observer, to the meetings in Pimodan House [Hotel
      Lauzun], where our club met..." [12]<br>
      <br>
      Gautier himself gave up hashish "after trying it some ten times or
      so,... not that it hurt me physically, but because a real writer
      needs no other than his own natural dreams, and does not care to
      have his thought controlled by the influence of any agency
      whatever." [13]<br>
      <br>
      In the introduction to The Artificial Paradises, his best known
      work on hashish, Baudelaire candidly admits that for much of his
      information concerning the actions of the drug, he relied on the
      detailed notes he had accumulated in talking to his friends who
      had been using hashish for a long time. Two other major sources
      were Sylvestre de Sacy's writings, and a popular pharmaceutical
      text of the day, L'Officine ou reportoire general de pharmacies
      practiques (The Laboratory or General Encyclopaedia of Practical
      Pharmacy), parts of which he copied verbatim. The latter was first
      published in 1844 by the pharmacist Dorvault, and became a
      standard reference manual on drugs (it was reprinted and expanded
      in 1847, 1850, and 1855). Baudelaire incorporated approximately
      three-quarters of the material on hashish from Dorvault's 1850
      edition in the Artificial Paradises which he published in 1858,
      although no mention of Dorvault appears anywhere in Baudelaire's
      writings.<br>
      <br>
      The Artificial Paradises is divided into two parts. The first
      contains Baudelaire's "Poem of Hashish"; the second is a
      translation of de Quincey's Confessions of an Opium Eater.
      Baudelaire's inclusion of these two works into a single volume was
      due to his feeling that both drugs produced very similar effects.
      Indeed, it is sometimes impossible to tell whether Baudelaire is
      writing about opium or hashish in various parts of his "Poem of
      Hashish".<br>
      <br>
      Although widely hailed as one of hashish's most articulate and
      analytical devotees, as well as one of its most tragic victims,
      Baudelaire was neither devotee nor victim of hashish. He was
      merely an observer of hashish's effects, and he died not from
      overindulgence in hashish but from syphilis. Nevertheless, aside
      from the bitter recriminations expressed at the end of his essay,
      Baudelaire's Artificial Paradises is unsurpassed as literature's
      most poetic description of the hashish experience. Gautier later
      wrote of the book:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medically speaking The Artificial Paradises
      constitute a very well written monograph of hascheesh, and science
      might find in it reliable information; for Baudelaire piqued
      himself on being scrupulously accurate, and not for the world
      would he have allowed the smallest poetic imagery to slip into a
      subject that was naturally adapted to it. [14]<br>
      <br>
      Baudelaire begins his discussion by refuting the notion that
      hashish will transform anyone into an entirely different person.
      One "will find in hashish nothing miraculous, absolutely nothing
      but an exaggeration of the natural," he says. "The brain and
      organism on which hashish operates will produce only the normal
      phenomena peculiar to that individual - increased, admittedly, in
      number and force, but always faithful to the original." [15]<br>
      <br>
      Next he cautions that the user be in the right frame of mind to
      take hashish, for just as it exaggerates the natural behaviour of
      the individual, so too does hashish intensify the user's immediate
      feelings. Obligations that require attention will keep the user
      from enjoying the otherwise pleasurable effects of the drug and
      instead he will be tortured with worry and subjected to unbearable
      agony.<br>
      <br>
      Once he has been properly prepared, the hashish user will pass
      through three successive phases. The first comes on rather slowly,
      almost imperceptibly. Because the novice has in all likelihood
      been previously told something of the effects of hashish,
      Baudelaire advises his readers that they are likely to feel
      impatient. This impatience, he warns, must be overcome for it
      could throw the novice into a state of anxiety. An indication that
      the drug is beginning to work, regardless of what the user says,
      is uncontrollable laughter. The most trivial remark assumes new
      meaning. A sense of incongruity, of puns on words, of ridiculous
      situations, are all characteristic of the mirth of hashish. A
      second indication that hashish is beginning to act is an inability
      to maintain a train of thought. Ideas race through the mind,
      becoming disjointed, fragmented, isolated; conversation is no
      longer possible.<br>
      <br>
      The second stage of intoxication is characterized by a feeling of
      coldness in the extremities and general lassitude. There is a
      sense of stupor and stupefaction. The mouth feels parched with
      incredible thirst. A heightened feeling of sensory acuity begins
      to be imagined. The senses are scrambled. Sounds have colors;
      colors contain music. It is now that one begins to see and hear
      things that are not there.<br>
      <br>
      The final stage is marked by a feeling of calmness. Time and space
      have no meaning. There is a sense that one has transcended matter.
      In this state, one final supreme thought breaks into consciousness
      - "I have become God."<br>
      <br>
      Having traced the stages of hashish intoxication, Baudelaire
      concludes his essay with a chapter entitled "moral". Here
      Baudelaire deals with the after effects of hashish. Although he
      states that there are no dangerous physical consequences from
      hashish, he contends that the same cannot be said for the user's
      psychological health. Although hashish increases creativity and
      elevates imagination, the individual who has come to rely on the
      drug for inspiration may become its prisoner, unable to think
      creatively at all unless drugged with hashish. Moreover, hashish's
      weakening of the will makes the user unable to profit from any
      creative insights he may derive from the drug. If one can
      instantly realize all the pleasures of heaven and earth through
      hashish, he asks, why should anyone actively pursue such goals?<br>
      <br>
      Baudelaire moved out of the Hotel Lauzun shortly after a botched
      suicide attempt. He was suffering from syphilis, he drank heavily,
      and he was constantly resorting to opium to help himself deal with
      a deep-seated feeling of despondency and self-hatred. Although
      respected by fellow writers and critics, Baudelaire considered
      himself a failure. He died in 1866, his brain decayed by the
      syphilitic bacterium he had contracted as a youth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Balzac and Flaubert</b><br>
      <br>
      Baudelaire was not the only well-known nonparticipant to attend
      the meetings of the Hashish Club. As Baudelaire noted, Honore de
      Balzac also preferred to watch the proceedings without personally
      partaking of the "green paste" handed out by Moreau:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Balzac no doubt held the belief that there is
      no deeper shame nor worse suffering for a man than to renounce
      control over his own will. I saw him once at a meeting where the
      prodigious effects of hascheesh were being discussed. He listened
      and asked questions with amusing attention and vivacity. Those who
      knew him will readily guess that he was interested. But the idea
      of thinking in spite of himself shocked him deeply; he was offered
      some dawamesk; he examined it, smelt it, and returned it without
      touching it. The struggle between his almost childish curiosity
      and his dislike for abdication exhibited itself on his expressive
      face in a striking manner. The love of self-dignity won the day.
      [16]<br>
      <br>
      Gautier recalls that occasion:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at Pimodan House that night, and I am in
      a position to certify to the absolute accuracy of the story. I
      will merely add this characteristic trait: as he handed back the
      spoonful of dawamesk that had been offered him, Balzac remarked
      that it would be of no use to take the test, for he was sure that
      hascheesh would have no effect upon his brain. [17]<br>
      <br>
      Balzac's curiosity finally got the better of him, however, and in
      a letter dated December 23, 1845, addressed to a Madame Hanska, he
      confesses that he finally took some hashish at one of the
      gatherings of the Hashish Club, adding that as he was leaving the
      group, he began to hear celestial voices and see divine paintings.
      [18]<br>
      <br>
      One of France's well-known writers who was profoundly influenced
      by Baudelaire's description of the hashish experience, and who
      like Balzac had certain misgivings about trying the drug himself,
      was Gustav Flaubert. Baudelaire has sent Flaubert a personal copy
      of Artificial Paradises, and in a return letter, Flaubert
      confessed that "these drugs have always aroused great longing in
      me. I've got some excellent hashish made up for me by Gastinel,
      the chemist. But it terrifies me! I blame myself bitterly for
      this!" [19]<br>
      <br>
      Although frightened by the prospect of taking hashish, Flaubert
      nevertheless took issue with Baudelaire's characterization of the
      drug as something evil. To Flaubert, Baudelaire's condemnation of
      hashish had ruined what was otherwise an excellent essay. "It
      seems to me," Flaubert wrote, "that in a subject treated so
      eminently, in a work that is the beginning of science, in a piece
      of natural observation and induction, you have emphasized too
      greatly the spirit of evil. I would have preferred that you would
      not have accused hashish and opium of excesses. It was not the
      drugs that were evil, but rather the misuse of these substances."
      [20]<br>
      <br>
      Shortly before his death, Flaubert had begun outlining a novel of
      his own entitled La Spirale, based on Baudelaire's description of
      hashish's effects. Flaubert's notes depict a tormented hero who is
      eventually confined to an institution for the insane. The cause of
      his mental breakdown is hashish, a drug habit he had acquired
      during a visit to the Arab countries, and an exceptional
      imagination and disposition for reverie upon which the drug acted.
      Saturated with hashish, his brain manufactured ecstatic visions
      and plunged him into a state of "permanent somnambulism" which
      rendered him insensible to pain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish's Tragic Apostle</b><br>
      <br>
      Gerard de Nerval was another prominent French writer who belonged
      to the Hashish Club and who wrote about the drug in his books.
      Like, Baudelaire, Nerval was plagued with fits of melancholy. Most
      of his life he lived in poverty and dissipation. Also, like
      Baudelaire, Nerval tried to kill himself. Unlike Baudelaire, he
      succeeded.<br>
      <br>
      Nerval had met Theophile Gautier while they were both students in
      Paris and the two remained friends for the rest of their lives. It
      was through Gautier that he became a member of the Club des
      Hachichins.<br>
      <br>
      Nerval's first major literary triumph was a translation of Faust,
      published when he was only twenty. The story of the man who sold
      his soul to the devil appealed to his mystical interests and was
      only one of many such stories to set his mind on a cryptic
      transcendental course. During a trip to the Near East which he
      described in his Voyages to the Orient (1847), Nerval got the idea
      for his "Story of the Calif Haken", a singularly exotic tale of
      hashish and double consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      The main character of the story lives a dual existence. By day, he
      is the caliph, the ruler of Egypt; by night, he dresses in slave's
      clothes and wanders among the common people. As the story opens,
      the caliph enters an okel, "one of those houses where taking no
      heed of the prohibition (against intoxication), infidels came to
      make themselves drunk with wine, Bouza [beer] or hashish." He
      orders some hashish which is brought to him in the form of a
      "greenish paste", and has some with a companion whom he has just
      met. As the drug is brought to them, the other man says that "this
      box contains the paradise your prophet Mohammed promised to his
      believers..."<br>
      <br>
      Nerval describes the various feelings the caliph experiences, the
      uncontrollable laughter, the languor, the rapid whirl of ideas,
      the visions, and the feeling of total relaxation. During this
      unique experience, the caliph announces that he is God, a remark
      that turns the other patrons against him for this act of
      blasphemy, and they beat him severely. Although he is forgiven
      because he has not mastered the hashish experience as yet, this
      idea remains fixed in his mind and he is thrown into an insane
      asylum. While he is a patient there, he is visited by the famous
      Arab physician Avicenna, who dismisses his protestations and his
      insistence that he is the caliph as the ravings of a
      hashish-crazed lunatic.<br>
      <br>
      The high point of the story comes when the caliph escapes from the
      asylum and sees someone else upon the throne who resembles himself
      so closely that it can only be his doppleganger. This is another
      part of his existence previously unknown to him. In the end, by a
      set of peculiar circumstances, the caliph is physically killed
      while his spiritual being, the being that sits on the throne,
      continues to rule over Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      The point of Nerval's allegory is that under the insidious
      influence of hashish, reality and illusion cannot be separated.
      The hashish user is cast under a spell in which an idea is fixed
      in his mind to the exclusion of everything else and this idea
      determines how one sees oneself on a number of different levels.
      The hashish user assumes both a physical and a spiritual entity.
      Mind and body dissociate; yet all the while the soul consciously
      and dispassionately observes what happens to each.<br>
      <br>
      Nerval also wrote several stories in which opium played a
      prominent part. Like Baudelaire, he was no stranger to drug abuse.
      His last years were spent in poverty and misery. Unable to cope
      any longer after a number of tragic love affairs exacerbated his
      already thread-bare sanity, he hanged himself.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Alexandre Dumas</b><br>
      <br>
      The fourth prominent member of the Club des Hachichins whose
      writings deal with hashish was Alexandre Dumas, one of the most
      prolific and entertaining of the French writers of the
      mid-nineteenth century. Although well acquainted with the effects
      of hashish through attending the gatherings at the Hotel Lauzun,
      there is no indication that Dumas ever used hashish or any other
      drug to excess. Like Gautier, Dumas was astute enough to realize
      that hashish had a mystique about it that fascinated the French
      reading public, and he heightened the interest of one of his best
      known stories, The Count of Monte Cristo, by making hashish a part
      of the plot. In a chapter from Monte Cristo entitled "Sinbad the
      Sailor", Dumas tells of the meeting of Franz with a mysterious
      stranger who lives on a deserted island and refers to himself only
      as Sinbad.<br>
      <br>
      Franz has come to the island, which is sometimes used as a base
      for smuggling, to do some hunting. He encounters some smugglers
      and is invited to dine with their leader Sinbad, whose quarters
      are located somewhere beneath the island. To prevent any outsiders
      from finding the entrance to these quarters, Sinbad blindfolds
      Franz and then leads him into an underground palace. magnificently
      furnished with articles from around the world.<br>
      <br>
      After a sumptuous meal, a servant places a cup on the table. Franz
      lifts the lid of the cup and sees a "greenish paste". "Taste
      this," his host says, offering the paste, "and the boundaries of
      possibility disappear, the fields of infinite space open to you,
      you advance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms
      of unfettered reverie."<br>
      <br>
      Sinbad takes some of the paste himself, and while they are resting
      he tells Franz the story of the Assassins. The mystery of the
      green paste now becomes clear to Franz. "It is hasheesh!" he
      cries.<br>
      <br>
      His curiosity soaring, Franz also takes some of the drug and the
      two men retire to another lavishly furnished chamber where they
      relax and talk about visiting the great cities of the Arab world.<br>
      <br>
      Franz experiences the various effects of hashish and then finally
      falls asleep. When he awakens, he finds himself above ground and
      alone. He tries to find the entrance to the palace so that he can
      return, but it is too well hidden. He then begins to doubt the
      whole adventure, but his servant, who has been waiting for him,
      points to a boat sailing off in the distance. Peering at the
      vessel through a telescope, Franz is able to make out the figure
      of Sinbad standing alone on the deck of the ship. It was not a
      dream. The experience had been real.<br>
      <br>
      Franz's encounter with his mysterious host, the underground
      palace, the blindfold, his initiation to hashish, the visions he
      experienced, and his dream-like impressions are all calculated to
      hold the reader's interest. They are examples of Dumas's expertise
      as a storyteller. And they are also examples of Dumas's subtle and
      masterful craftsmanship, for what the reader has actually been
      treated to is a rendering of Marco Polo's story of the Old Man of
      the Mountain and his band of Assassins.<br>
      <br>
      The mysterious Sinbad is none other than Hasan. The cave is the
      Alamut stronghold. The smugglers are the Assassins. The
      magnificent palace id the Paradise of the legend. Franz is
      blindfolded; the candidates (fidais) are given a potion to render
      them unconscious before they can enter the gorunds, and like Franz
      they are taken from the grounds in an unconscious state. The
      analogy is so well executed that even the reader who is acquainted
      with Marco Polo's narrative is unaware that he is encountering the
      very same legend in the story of Monte Cristo.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish in England</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The lurid accounts of the hashish experience by the popular French
      literati did not go unnoticed across the Channel, and it was not
      long before the English writers and students were also
      experimenting with the drug.<br>
      <br>
      In 1845, Thomas de Quincey obtained some "bang" and said that he
      would shortly be describing his reactions to it for the English
      reading public, much the same as he had done in the case of opium.
      For some unknown reason, his plan never materialized. However, he
      does state that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one farmer in Midlothian was mentioned to me
      eight months ago as having taken it, and ever since annoyed his
      neighbors by immoderate fits of laughter; so that in January it
      was agreed to present him to the sheriff as a nuisance. But for
      some reason the plan was laid aside and now, eight months later, I
      hear the farmer is laughing more rapturously than ever, continues
      in the happiest frame of mind, the kindest creature and the
      general torment of his neighborhood. [21]<br>
      <br>
      In 1848, an anonymous article appeared in Chamber's Edinburgh
      Journal, a widely read literary periodical of the era, in which
      the author warned his readers that a menace was ravaging France.
      Indulgence in hashish, he said, had spread from physicians and
      medical students to the nation's "poets, idealists, and all the
      lovers of novelty". After describing the effects of the drug, the
      "alterations" produced "upon the perceptive powers, the
      imagination, and the reason", he concludes with a grave warning to
      those Englishmen who may have been contemplating their own hashish
      romp of the senses: "It may be emphatically said that none of
      nature's law can be violated with impunity, nor can that reason
      which renders man pre-eminent be misapplied without a punishment."
      [22]<br>
      <br>
      This dour admonition seems to have been ignored since the popular
      press and the medical journals began to carry more and more
      articles on the effects of hashish. In 1850, David Urquhart, a
      member of Parliament, published a two-volume book entitled The
      Pillars of Hercules in which he added his own experiences
      regarding hashish to the literature on the subject. [23] The use
      of such a drug by a member of the government convinced many
      readers that the dangers attributed to hashish had probably been
      exaggerated, although the number of people who decided to try some
      for themselves as the result of such books was never great. It was
      personal contact with other users, not books, that increased the
      growing coterie of hashish patrons.<br>
      <br>
      The anonymous author of an 1858 article in Little's Living Age
      Magazine comforted his readers that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the English are in no danger whatever of
      becoming a nation of opium or hashish debauchies; and we feel no
      compunction in placing before them an account of some of those
      exceptional cases in which the results have been sufficiently
      delightful to constitute a temptation to one of the most ruinous
      species of debauchery. [24]<br>
      <br>
      Following this pronouncement, the author cites some interesting
      statistics regarding the use of hashish and other drugs throughout
      the world at that time: "Tobacco is the one universal narcotic;
      the others are consumed by the human race in the following
      proportions; opium by four hundred millions, hemp by between two
      and three hundred millions, betel by one hundred millions, and
      coca by ten millions." [25] Interestingly, he makes no mention of
      alcohol in spite of the fact that alcohol abuse was a major
      problem in England in the mid-nineteenth century.<br>
      <br>
      Despite all the evidence to the contrary, English writers
      repeatedly denied that any of their fellow Englishmen were turning
      to hashish. In 1877, for example, a W. Laird-Clowes wrote in the
      magazine Belgravia that "as far as I am aware - and my researches
      have been tolerably extensive - no Englishmen (non-physician) has
      hitherto noted down the latter drug [hashish]." [26] Apparently,
      Laird-Clowes was unfamiliar with Urquhart's Pillars of Hercules or
      what was being written in other popular English magazines about
      hashish. But he had read enough to know that hashish was being
      blamed for the frenzied killings committed by the Assassins. To
      the charge that hashish inspires violence, Laird-Clowes says that
      as far as his own personal experience with the drug was concerned,
      he had never had the urge to go out and kill anyone.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps I am not of a violent nature [he says
      in his concluding remarks], certainly I have no inducement to
      commit a murder; and probably a man's inborn tastes in great
      measure direct the effect that hashish will exert on his mental
      faculties... anything more foreign to the effects of the drug than
      the "creation of unpleasantness", either in thought, word, or
      deed, I cannot conceive. [27]<br>
      <br>
      Other Englishmen concurred with Laird-Clowe's contention that the
      English were in no danger of becoming hashish addicts or even
      experimenting with the drug on a large scale. "The temperament
      which is unsusceptible of exultation by narcotics into a rapturous
      or vision-beholding condition, seems happily to be rare in
      northern climates," was how one writer put it. [28] Another wrote
      that "the Theatre of Seraphim, with its gay marionette-version of
      human experience is open to all at the price of almost inevitable
      physical and moral degradation," a condition foreign to the
      English temperament. [29]<br>
      <br>
      It was not that the English were above using drugs that altered
      consciousness, but rather that they were more content with
      alcohol, and saw little need to experiment with other
      mind-altering drugs. Those who did were either members of minority
      groups, artists, writers, criminals, or students. It was the
      isolated cases that came to the attention of the press and gave
      the impression that hashish was rampant in parts of England.<br>
      <br>
      One such case took place in 1886 in the dormitories of staid old
      Cambridge University. According to a newspaper report, some
      students had obtained "Turkish Delight", and not being experienced
      users of the hashish-laden confection, had taken an overdose and
      become ill as a result. [30] Oxford also had its share of cannabis
      users. [31]<br>
      <br>
      In a footnote to "The Tale of the Hashish Eater", Richard Burton
      likewise commented that "I have heard of a 'Hashish-orgie' in
      London which ended in half the experimentalists being on their
      sofas for a week. The drug is useful for stokers, having the
      curious property of making men insensible to heat. Easterns also
      use it for 'Imsak' prolonging coition, of which I speak
      presently." [32] This observation was published in 1885 so it must
      have occurred some time earlier.<br>
      <br>
      While the medical journals began to teem with articles concerning
      possible therapeutic uses of the drug and adverse reactions
      occurring in those who took overdoses, the only nineteenth-century
      book to deal with hashish in England was an anonymous work
      entitled Confessions of an English Hashish-Eater , published in
      1884, which was patterned after De Quincey's bestseller of years
      gone by.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The "Decadents"</b><br>
      <br>
      Around the turn of the twentieth century, the spirit of ennui that
      had gripped the French Romantic writers of the mid-nineteenth
      century crossed the English Channel and settled on a coterie of
      English writers such as Arthur Symons, William Butler Yeats,
      Ernest Dowson, Oscar Wilde, and Havelock Ellis. Yeats called them
      the "Tragic Generation".<br>
      <br>
      Like their French forebears, this new generation of creators
      sought new sensations, visions, and ideas to write about, and
      agreed with Gautier that "art [should be] for art's sake" rather
      than moral reform. Because the eschewed morality in their works,
      they were called the "decadents". And just as their French
      forebears had sought inspiration and escape from boredom in drugs,
      so too did the "decadents". Absinthe was a favorite with many of
      these writers such as Oscar Wilde, mescaline was preferred by
      Havelock Ellis and W. B. Yeats, although Yeats was not averse to
      hashish; [33] Dowson preferred hashish in his youth, [34] but gave
      it up for alcohol. Their French counterparts, Arthur Rimbaud and
      Paul Verlane, "intoxicated themselves with both absinthe and
      hashish and wrote poems of hellish and heavenly music," [35] the
      best known of which is Rembaud's Illuminations, and its memorable
      lines - "This is the time of the Assassins... it began with the
      laughter of children, it will end with it."<br>
      <br>
      For Rimbaud and many of his contemporaries, hashish was, however,
      a means to an end, not an end in itself. "The Poet," he wrote,
      "makes himself a voyant through a long, immense reasoned deranging
      of all his senses. All the forms of love, of suffering, of
      madness; he tries to find himself, he exhausts in himself all the
      poisons, to keep only their quintessences." [36]<br>
      <br>
      While the "decadents" used hashish and other drugs as much as
      Gautier, Baudelaire, Nerval, and the other members of the Hashish
      Club, they did not make drugs a formal part of their socializing,
      and there was no Gautier or Baudelaire to chronicle or exploit
      their drug-oriented activities. Moreover, their use of drugs
      seemed nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cannabis in Western Medicine</b><br>
      <br>
      While the French were the first to begin experimenting with
      hashish on a relatively large scale, the introduction of cannabis
      into Western medicine is credited to a now obscure Irish
      physician, Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy. Although known today
      for his pioneering experiments with cannabis, during his own
      lifetime he was best known for introducing intravenous fluid and
      electrolyte-replacement therapy in the treatment of cholera. His
      major achievement, however, had nothing at all to do with
      medicine. Instead, after leaving the medical profession for
      engineering, O'Shaughnessy was instrumental in introducing the
      telegraph system into India - an accomplishment for which he was
      knighted in 1856 by Queen Victoria. O'Shaughnessy retired from
      military service in 1861 at age fifty-two and returned to England,
      where for some unknown reason he changed his name to William
      O'Shaugnessy Brooke. Although he lived for another twenty-eight
      years, he never returned to medical research and spent his
      retirement engaged in other activities.<br>
      <br>
      O'Shaughnessy first came to India in 1833 as a thirty-year-old
      surgeon in the employ of the British East India Company. He also
      held the position of professor of chemistry at the Medical College
      of Calcutta. Apparently, he became intrigued at cannabis's
      therapeutic potential almost as soon as he arrived in India, and
      in 1843 he reported a summary of his studies of the drug [37]
      which so captured the interest of his medical colleagues in
      England that it was not long before they were clamoring for him to
      supply them with cannabis for their own medical practices.<br>
      <br>
      O'Shaughnessy began his article by observing that while the
      intoxicating and medicinal effects of cannabis were known
      throughout the countries of the East, the drug was practically
      unknown in the West. Following a brief history of the use of the
      drug in India and in the Arab countries, O'Shaughnessy described
      the experiments he had conducted on animals, noting an observation
      that has not since been commented upon nor subjected to further
      study. In O'Shaughnessy's words, the experiments he had conducted
      "led to one remarkable result - That while carnivorous animals,
      and fish, dogs, cats, swine, vultures and crows, and adjutants,
      invariably and speedily exhibited the intoxicating influence of
      the drug, the graminivorous, such as the horse, deer, monkey,
      goat, sheep, and cow, experienced but trivial effects from any
      dose we administered." O'Shaughnessy had been nothing if not
      thorough in his preliminary studies on animals, judging by this
      statement.<br>
      <br>
      Confident that cannabis posed no danger to the well-being of his
      animal subjects, O'Shaughnessy went on to test its curative
      potential in some patients who were plagued with rheumatism. After
      treatment with the drug, O'Shaughnessy found that many reported an
      easing of their pain and a "remarkable increase of appetite",
      "great mental cheerfulness", and a feeling of aphrodisia.<br>
      <br>
      The capacity to make these patients euphoric led him next to try
      to alleviate the terrible symptoms associated with rabies in one
      of his patients. Although the man soon died of the disease,
      O'Shaughnessy was intrigued to find that the drug did relieve some
      of the patient's agony and did enable him to swallow some juice
      and moistened rice. O'Shaughnessy also experimented with cannabis
      in the treatment of cholera, tetanus, and epilepsy, reporting that
      in all cases his patients experienced relief from the symptoms of
      these disorders.<br>
      <br>
      When O'Shaughnessy returned to England in 1842, he brought back a
      quantity of cannabis and turned it over to pharmacist Peter Squire
      to convert to a form suitable for medical usage. This preparation
      came to be known as Squire's extract, and launched Squire and his
      sons into prominence as the main and most reliable suppliers of
      cannabis extract in England. [38]<br>
      <br>
      Soon after Squire's extract became commercially available,
      physicians began to prescribe it for almost any physical
      difficulty. One of the earliest conditions for which it was
      administered was childbirth. Dr. John Grigor, a pioneer in the
      obstetrical use of cannabis, wrote that while the drug was not
      effective in increasing labor contractions or reducing the pain of
      childbirth for all women, "it is capable of bringing the labor to
      a happy conclusion considerably within a half of the time that
      would otherwise have been required, thus saving protracted
      suffering to the patient, and the time of the practitioner." [39]<br>
      <br>
      Other conditions for which the drug was often prescribed were loss
      of appetite, inability to sleep, migraine headache, pain,
      involuntary twitching, excessive coughing, and treatment of
      withdrawal symptoms associated with morphine and alcohol
      addiction.<br>
      <br>
      Menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) was yet another
      condition for which cannabis was liberally administered, often
      with positive results. Dr. John Brown, an English obstetrician,
      stated that "there is no medicine which has given such good
      results... the failures are so few, that I venture to call it a
      specific in menorrhagia." [40] His colleague, Dr. Robert Batho,
      concurred. In his experience, cannabis had proven itself "par
      excellence the remedy for that condition... it is so certain in
      its power of controlling menorrhagia, that it is a valuable aid to
      diagnosis in cases which it is uncertain whether an early abortion
      may or not have occurred..." [41]<br>
      <br>
      Among the most prominent of English doctors to administer cannabis
      to his patients was Dr. J. R. Reynolds, court physician to dour
      old Queen Victoria. [42] Unfortunately, no one knows whether the
      drug's euphoric properties were ever experienced by the queen
      while she was being treated for any of cannabis's other
      therapeutic effects.<br>
      <br>
      While a great many doctors could not say enough about cannabis's
      medicinal virtues, many others were reluctant to use the drug
      because of the variability of its actions. To overcome this
      problem, chemists throughout the country attempted to identify and
      extract the active principle in cannabis so that it could be
      standardized as to purity and potency.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1890s, a group of chemists at Cambridge University, Wood,
      Spivey, and Easterfield, succeeded in obtaining a relatively pure
      extraction of cannabis which they called "cannabinol". The
      discovery was not without mishap, however. While working on the
      project, Easterfield and Spivey were each blown to bits in
      chemical explosions. Wood, the third member of the group, almost
      perished under similar circumstances. While working in his
      laboratory, he took some cannabinol and lost consciousness. A
      chemical he was working with ignited some time later and the
      laboratory burst into flames. Luckily, someone smelled the smoke
      and ran to his assistance, rescuing him from the engulfing
      inferno. [43]<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Although hemp had been a valuable and commonplace agricultural
      staple in the United States from the time of the first settlement
      in Virginia, the early Americans were totally unaware of the
      kaleidoscope of sensations lurking within the sticky resin that
      covered the plant. In fact, it was not until they read the
      exploits of their own Marco Polo, Bayard Taylor, that Americans
      learned of the existence of drugs such as hashish. But even then,
      they failed to make the connection between this exotic drug and
      the hemp weeds that grew in the vacant lots of their
      neighborhoods. Yet, because of Taylor's popularity, many of his
      impressionable thrill-seeking readers were prompted to try some of
      this strange electuary for themselves to see if they too could
      experience the bizarre sensations described by one of the
      country's favorite writers. So fashionable did the hashish habit
      become that even foreigners began to remark on the growing
      popularity of the drug in America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish in American Poetry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Among the first Americans to write about hashish was not a
      novelist or a physician, but a poet - John Greenleaf Whittier. In
      "The Haschish", a short poem in his Anti-Slavery Poems (1854),
      Whittier writes of hashish-induced hallucinations and muddled
      thinking, but it is improbable that he himself had experienced the
      effects of the drug at the time he wrote the poem. The point of
      the poem, in fact, was not to describe the effects of hashish at
      all.<br>
      <br>
      Although hashish is more potent in its ability to induce
      hallucinations than opium, and makes "fools or knaves of all who
      use it," says Whittier, when it came to enslavement hashish had to
      take a back seat to cotton. Whereas hashish enslaved the
      individual, cotton had enslaved a whole race of man.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The American Marco Polo</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Whereas Whittier had written about hashish to emphasize his
      feelings about slavery, American writers and poets who followed
      him were more interested in hashish as a plot device and therefore
      something to be sensationalized. Among the first to write about
      hashish in this way was one of the best known literary figures of
      the mid-nineteenth century - Bayard Taylor. Poet, novelist,
      translator, music lyricist, war correspondent, world traveller,
      secretary to the American legation to Russia, ambassador to
      Germany - Taylor was ever in search of recognition. Yet, except
      for his translations of German classics such as Faust, for which
      he was awarded the position of nonresident professor of German
      literature at Cornell University, his writings were never regarded
      as anything beyond mediocre by the nation's critics. Parke Godwin,
      editor of the New York Evening Post, for instance, said that
      Taylor had "travelled more and seen less than any man living." [1]
      The reading public, as is often the case, ignored the critics and
      Taylor became rich and famous as a writer.<br>
      <br>
      In 1851, heartbroken over the death of his wife of three months
      and exhausted from overwork, Taylor left the United States to
      travel in the Middle and Far East. It was during this time that he
      first became acquainted with hashish, an experience he described
      for his readers in two of his books, A Journey to Central Africa
      (1854) and The Land of the Saracens; or, Pictures of Palestine,
      Asia Minor, Sicily, and Spain (1855). [2]<br>
      <br>
      Taylor's initiation to hashish took place in Egypt. The "exquisite
      lightness and airiness", the "wonderfully keen perception of the
      ludicrous", and "the fine sensations which spread throughout the
      whole tissue of my nervous fiber, each thrill helping to divest my
      frame of its earthly and natural nature", are briefly mentioned in
      Journey to Central Africa. In Land of the Saracens, he delves more
      deeply into the hashish experience, cloaking it in a
      sensationalistic wrap calculated to entertain his readers.<br>
      <br>
      Taylor begins by introducing the legend of the Assassins, a ploy
      used by most writers to arouse in their readers' mind an
      anticipation of uncontrollable passions and violence unleashed by
      this mysterious unguent of the Arab world. The theatrics are then
      carried one step further as he tells of "a dark Egyptian", sent to
      obtain some of the drug with the admonition: "And see that it be
      strong and fresh."<br>
      <br>
      Amid friends, Taylor retires to a quiet room. He swallows one
      teaspoon of the mixture, the amount being roughly equal to that he
      had previously taken in Egypt. The lozenge is more bitter than he
      previously remembered - an intimation that it may also be more
      potent than that which he took in Egypt. But after an hour, none
      of the group felt any different.<br>
      <br>
      When some of those present "loudly expressed their conviction of
      the humbug of hasheesh," Taylor advised a second teaspoon, "though
      not without some misgivings, as we were all ignorant of the
      precise quantity which constituted a dose, and the limits within
      which the drug could be taken with safety."<br>
      <br>
      Not long after this second helping, Taylor senses "the same fine
      nervous thrill" that he had previously experienced in Egypt. But
      this time the sensation comes on suddenly and far more intensely.
      Now, he feels a kind of astral projection taking place: "The walls
      of my frame were burst outward and tumbled into ruin; and, without
      thinking what form I wore - losing sight even of all idea of form
      - I felt that I existed through a vast extent of space."<br>
      <br>
      The sensation was too much for Taylor. His curiosity is satisfied.
      He wants to stop. But, instead, the "thrills which ran through my
      nervous system became more rapid and fierce..." He loses control
      of his sensibility and bursts out in "an agony of laughter."<br>
      <br>
      His senses are hurled into a rampage of conquest. "The spirits of
      height, color, odor, sound, and motion were my slaves; and, having
      these, I was master of the universe." Time has no meaning. "Though
      the whole vision was probably not more than five minutes long in
      passing through my mind, years seem to have elapsed... One set of
      nerves was thrilled with the bliss of the gods, while another was
      convulsed with unquenchable laughter at that very bliss."<br>
      <br>
      Next comes the second wave of intoxication. He begins to feel "a
      painful tension throughout my nervous system - the effect of
      over-stimulus." Illusions became "grotesque". A burning sensation
      smolders in the pit of his stomach and his mouth and throat feel
      "as dry and hard as if made of brass." Although he frantically
      pours water into himself, he can find no relief. The nightmarish
      illusions continue for several hours more. Taylor convulses
      uncontrollably and finally falls into a stupor.<br>
      <br>
      The next day he is so incapacitated he cannot even dress himself
      and he crawls back into bed. On the morning of the second day,
      having slept about thirty hours, he is able to remain awake but
      "with a system utterly prostrate and unstrung, and a brain clouded
      with the lingering images of my visions. I knew where I was, and
      what had happened to me, but all that I saw still remained unreal
      and shadowy."<br>
      <br>
      A servant prepares him a hot bath, and while he is relaxing he is
      brought a glass of "very acid sherbet", which he claims, brings
      him "instant relief", although for the next two or three days he
      continues to experience "frequent involuntary fits of absence,
      which make me insensible, for the time, to all that was passing
      around me..."<br>
      <br>
      "Fearful as my rash experiment proved to me, I did not regret
      having made it," he confesses to his readers. "It revealed to me
      depths of rapture and of suffering which my natural faculties
      never could have sounded. It has taught me the majesty of human
      reason and of human will, even in the weakest, and the awful peril
      of tampering with that which assails their integrity." [3]<br>
      <br>
      Bayard Taylor's description of his experience with hashish was,
      for most Americans, their first introduction to the drug. Written
      intentionally for an audience that sought vicarious adventure and
      enjoyed reading about the customs of far-off peoples, Taylor's
      books were entertaining and extremely popular. Taylor gave America
      its first impression of the hashish experience. It was an
      impression that would last for quite some time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fitz Hugh Ludlow</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Among the many readers to be captivated by The Land of the
      Saracens and Taylor's experience with hashish was a young resident
      of Poughkeepsie, New York, Fitz Hugh Ludlow. Born in 1836 the son
      of an Abolitionist minister, Ludlow read extensively as a boy and
      was profoundly influenced by De Quincey's book and he deliberately
      patterned his own book, The Hasheesh Eater: Being Passages from
      the Life of a Pythagorean, which he anonymously published in 1857,
      on De Quincey. "I am deeply aware that, if the succeeding pages
      are read at all," he tells his readers, "it will be by those who
      have already learned to love De Quincey." [4]<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow was only sixteen years old when he first came under the
      spell of cannabis. Intrigued by the smells of medicines, he used
      to loiter about the apothecary shop of a pharmacist friend, a man
      named Anderson. The smells in the shop, he says, were "an aromatic
      invitation to scientific musing." Ludlow did more than muse,
      however. Not content merely to inhale the odors of the various
      concoctions that stood on the shelves, "with a disregard for my
      own safety, I made upon myself the trial of the effects of every
      strange drug and chemical which the laboratory could produce."
      Among those he sampled were chloroform, ether, and opium.<br>
      <br>
      "In all these experiences," he tells his readers, "research and
      not indulgence was my object, so that I never became victim of any
      habit in the prosecution of my headlong investigations. When the
      circuit of all the accessible tests was completed, I ceased
      experimenting..." [5]<br>
      <br>
      One day, some time after his sampling of these medicinal wares,
      his pharmacist friend directed him to a new drug, Cannabis indica
      by name, which the pharmacist described as "a preparation of the
      East Indian hemp, a powerful agent in cases of lockjaw,"
      manufactured by the Tilden Company.<br>
      <br>
      Without giving it a second thought, Ludlow prepared to sample some
      of this new drug when the pharmacist suddenly shouted, "Hold on,
      do you want to kill yourself? That stuff is deadly poison." Shaken
      by this warning, Ludlow returned the bottle to its place on the
      shelf.<br>
      <br>
      But Ludlow was not one to be deterred for long. An examination of
      the pharmacist's dispensatory informs him that large doses of the
      drug are indeed lethal, but moderate doses are rarely so. This
      extract, he concludes, is the hashish mentioned by Bayard Taylor
      whose experience with it "had moved me powerfully to curiosity and
      admiration."<br>
      <br>
      So as not to alarm his friend, Ludlow surreptitiously removed some
      of the drug when the pharmacist was out of sight. The dose
      produced no effect, however, and several days later he took some
      more, but again experienced no effects. Finally, several days
      later still, he took a much larger dose and when nothing happened
      immediately thereafter, he concluded that he was "unsusceptible of
      the hasheesh influence."<br>
      <br>
      Disappointed, he went to visit a friend. About three hours later,
      he suddenly began to experience unusual sensations. His first
      reaction was "one of uncontrollable terror - a sense of getting
      something I had not bargained for."<br>
      <br>
      Following this unpleasant response, Ludlow resolved never to take
      cannabis again: "The glimpse which I had gained in that single
      night of revelation of hitherto unconcerned modes of uncharted
      fields of spiritual being," he says, "seemed enough to store the
      treasure-house of grand memories for a lifetime."<br>
      <br>
      But his resolve was fainthearted. A little more than a week later,
      he was back at Anderson's. "Censure me not harshly, ye who have
      never known what fascination there is in the ecstasy of beauty,"
      he entreats his readers. "There are baser attractions than those
      which invited me." [6]<br>
      <br>
      Among the effects he now experiences are depersonalization,
      hallucinations, altered time perceptions, anxiety, and panic.
      Particularly interesting to him is the sensation of synesthesia,
      "the interchanging of the senses... the hashish eater knows what
      it is... to smell colors, to see sounds, and, much more
      frequently, to see feelings." The uncontrollable laughter, the
      rapid flow of ideas, the feeling of unquenchable thirst, the
      "awakening of perception which magnifies the smallest sensation
      till it occupies immense boundaries" - all are duly noted and
      recorded. [7]<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow continued to take cannabis on a regular basis until he
      became psychologically dependent on it. Much of his youth, he
      says, was spent in a state of perpetual cannabis intoxication.
      Although he attempted to give up his habit, he found that
      abstinence caused him considerable suffering. Unable to give it up
      "cold turkey", he tried reducing the amount he took gradually, but
      this did not help. He finally did kick the habit with the help of
      a physician, but not without difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow states that his motivation for writing his book was De
      Quincey's description of the sufferings that writer had
      experienced with opium and the fact that no such warning was
      available for cannabis. To alert the others of the dangers of
      habitually using cannabis, it was necessary to do for cannabis
      what De Quincey had done for opium.<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow was not solely an altruist, however. In September 1856,
      Putnam's Magazine carried an article entitled "The Apocalypse of
      Hasheesh", which bore more than a superficial resemblance to parts
      of Ludlow's book. Ludlow acknowledged his familiarity with this
      anonymous article and says he came across it in a bookstore in
      Niagara Falls. The article contained "such startling analogies
      to... [my] own past experience that cold drops started upon...
      [my] forehead." Unbeknownst to one another, both "had walked the
      valley of awful shadows side by side." The fact is, Ludlow wrote
      the anonymous magazine article "to give credence to his own
      exaggerated report and to bolster sales of his soon-to-be
      published work..." [8] and actually plagiarized portions of
      Taylor's book in doing so!<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow graduated from Union College in 1856, one year before he
      published The Hasheesh Eater, and he settled for a short time in
      Watertown, New York, to teach high school. He stayed at this job
      for only a short time and then resigned to study law. But the
      legal profession also held little interest for him and he
      abandoned that as well, seeking instead to earn his living as a
      drama critic, artist, and music writer. He did rather well as a
      writer and became friends with some of the well-known writers of
      his time, among them the man whose books had so influenced his
      early years, Bayard Taylor.<br>
      <br>
      In 1863, he moved to California for health reasons, but by this
      time he was a sick man. In 1870, he left the United States for
      Switzerland, hoping that he might yet regain his health in a
      sanatorium in that country. It was too late. He died that same
      year, one day after his thirty-fourth birthday. Although his death
      was attributed by many to his indulgence in hashish, the actual
      cause was tuberculosis.<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow's The Hasheesh Eater still remains the best known book on
      hashish by an American, and contains many valuable insights into
      the peculiar effects of the drug. Besides pointing out the
      pharmacological relationship between dose and response, Ludlow
      also called attention to the importance of the conditions under
      which the drug might be taken, and the particular feelings of the
      user as bearing significantly on his reaction to the drug: "At two
      different times, when body and mind are apparently in precisely
      analogous states, when all circumstances, exterior and interior,
      do not differ tangibly in the smallest respect, the same dose of
      the same preparations of hasheesh will frequently produce
      diametrically opposite effects," he told his readers. [9] Even
      more so in individuals of differing personalities. "Upon persons
      of the highest nervous and sanguine temperaments hasheesh has the
      strongest effect; on those of the bilious occasionally almost as
      powerful a one; while lymphatic constitutions are scarcely
      influenced at all except in some physical manner, such as vertigo,
      nausea, coma, or muscular rigidity." [10]<br>
      <br>
      Ludlow also called attention to a phenomenon known as "reverse
      tolerance". The characteristics of this condition is that the more
      one uses a drug such as hashish, the more sensitive one becomes,
      so that each time it is taken, less and less is needed to obtain
      the sought-after effect. "Unlike all other stimuli with which I am
      acquainted," Ludlow notes, "hasheesh, instead of requiring to be
      increased in quantity as existence on it proceeds, demands rather
      a diminution, seeming to leave at the return of the natural
      state... an unconsumed capital of exaltation for the next
      indulgence to set up business upon." [11] (This phenomenon has
      been reported by many cannabis users and has intrigued scientists
      due to its pharmacological uniqueness. However, when subjected to
      rigid test conditions, the phenomenon disappears.)<br>
      <br>
      Although The Hasheesh Eater is now recognized as a minor classic,
      and has earned the author the honor of having the Fitz Hugh Ludlow
      Library in New York named after him, during his own era his book
      was generally unknown to the American reading public. A critic who
      reviewed it in 1857 for Harper's Magazine was less than
      enthusiastic. Although he did express his dismay at the effects of
      cannabis as described by Ludlow, nevertheless, he took
      considerable comfort in declaring that Americans were fortunately
      "in no danger of becoming a nation of hasheesh eaters". [12]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Hashish Comes to America</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1857, the same year that Ludlow's book appeared on the
      booksellers' shelves, a physician named John Bell noted in the
      Boston Medical and Surgical Journal that "the various periodicals
      of this country have abounded, during the last few years, with
      accounts of hashisch; every experimenter giving the history of the
      effect it has had upon himself." [13]<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, Bell did not mention any of the periodicals he had
      come across so there is no way of knowing what he meant by
      "abounded". It seems, however, that, at least in Bell's mind, a
      growing number of Americans were beginning to experiment with
      hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Another comment from Bell's article is also worth noting.
      According to the learned doctor, specimens of hashish that he had
      obtained from Damascus contained about 25 percent opium! It is
      likely, therefore, that many of the effects attributed to hashish
      by American writers like Taylor and Ludlow, or French writers like
      Baudelaire, were in large part due to opium and not hashish.<br>
      <br>
      One of the Americans Bell may have had in mind when he alluded to
      the growing use of hashish in the United States was a medical
      quack from Philadelphia, Frederick Hollick. Hollick claimed that
      his research had taught him that the central ingredient in all
      known aphrodisiacs and exhilarants was none other than hashish.
      Accordingly, readers of his Marriage Guide (1850) were advised to
      use hashish as a sexual stimulant if their marriages were in
      trouble.<br>
      <br>
      Hollick was not only an author and lecturer, he also manufactured
      aphrodisiacs as a sideline. In one of his advertisements, he told
      potential customers:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The true aphrodisiac, as I compound it, acts
      upon the brain and nervous system, not as a stimulant, but as a
      tonic and nutritive agent, thus sustaining its power and the power
      of the sexual organs also, which is entirely dependent upon the
      nervous power.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For convenience, I have it [the aphrodisiac] so
      put up, in a dry form, air and water tight, that it can be kept
      uninjured, for any length of time, in any climate, and under any
      circumstances. It can also be taken without the inconvenience of
      measuring, using liquids, or any other troublesome requirement,
      thus ensuring secrecy and facility of use, let a man be situated
      however he may. A gentleman can keep it in his vest pocket without
      any fear of detection from smell, or appearance. It will go
      anywhere by post, with perfect safety, and in such a form that no
      one through whose hands it passes would ever suspect its nature,
      or that it is anything peculiar! [14]<br>
      <br>
      Would-be purchasers were assured that they could not obtain this
      secret preparation form any retail dealer. Only by writing to
      Hollick personally could they hope to receive this potent elixir
      of sexual nirvana. "I do this," Hollick explained, "to avoid
      trouble, and also to prevent counterfeiting which would be sure to
      be practiced if it were generally sold through agents."<br>
      <br>
      By the 1860s, so much hashish was being used in America that an
      English writer, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, told his readers:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young America is beginning to use the "bang" so
      popular among the Hindoos, though in a rather different manner,
      for young Johnathon must in some sort be an original. It is not a
      "drink", but a mixture of bruised hemp tops and the powder of the
      betel, rolled up like a quid of tobacco. It turns the lips and
      gums of a deep red, and if indulged in largely, produces violent
      intoxication. Lager beer and schnaps will give way for "bang" and
      red lips, instead of red noses [Cooke predicted, will] become the
      style. [15]<br>
      <br>
      In 1869, the periodical Scientific American carried a report to
      the effect that hashish, "the Cannabis indica of the US
      Pharmacopoeia, the resinous product of hemp, grown in the East
      Indies and other parts of Asia, is used in those countries to a
      large extent for its intoxicating properties, and is doubtless
      used in this country for the same purpose to a limited extent."
      [16]<br>
      <br>
      In that same year, Louisa May Alcott, author of Little Women,
      published a short story entitled "Perilous Play", in which she
      describes the effects of marijuana. The story begins ominously
      with Bell Daventry's plea: "If someone does not propose a new and
      interesting amusement, I shall die of ennui!" Rising to the
      challenge is a Dr. Meredith, who produces a box of "bonbons". "Eat
      six of these despised bonbons, and you will be amused in a new,
      delicious and wonderful manner," he promises. As the story
      progresses, the main characters lose their self-control as a
      result of taking the "bonbons". Rose, for example, exclaims after
      kissing Mark, "Oh what am I doing? I am mad, for I, too, have
      taken hashish." [17]<br>
      <br>
      In 1874, hashish was once again the subject of a poem. This time
      the poet was Thomas Bailey Aldrich. In "Hascheesh", a short poem
      which appeared in Cloth and Gold and Other Poems, Bailey first
      describes the beautiful visions he dreamt while under the
      influence of the drug. In the midst of all this beauty, he
      suddenly is seized with a sense of terror. Ugly creatures begin
      appearing from a black hole and start crawling toward him. "Away,
      vile drug! I will avoid thy spell," he cries, "Honey of Paradise,
      black dew of Hell!" [18]<br>
      <br>
      Aldrich's attitude toward hashish in this poem probably epitomized
      the attitude of many Americans to pleasure in general - it had to
      be paid for, and often the price was not worth the few moments of
      delight.<br>
      <br>
      Critical though they might be about those who flaunted the mores
      of the times, the American reading public still loved to read
      about the sinners in its midst and the national tabloids satisfied
      their appetites. "Secret Dissipation of New York Belles: Interior
      of a Hasheesh Hell on Fifth Avenue" ran the caption to an
      Illustrated Police News (December 2, 1876) drawing showing five
      young women, elegantly dresses, and languishing on divans in a
      stuporous condition. [19]<br>
      <br>
      In 1883, Harper's New Monthly Magazine ran a short article on the
      new hashish pastime entitled "A Hashish House in New York, , The
      Curious Adventures of an Individual Who Indulged in a Few Pipefuls
      of the Narcotic Hemp." [20] Although anonymous, the author is
      generally believed to be H. H. Kane, a prominent American
      physician of the era who published several books on what he
      regarded as the growing drug menace in the United States.<br>
      <br>
      The article begins with a conversation in which a friend tells the
      writer that "there is a large community of hashish smokers in this
      city [New York] who are daily forced to indulge their morbid
      appetites, and I can take you to a house up-town where hemp is
      used in every conceivable form, and where the lights, sounds,
      odors, and surroundings are all arranged so as to intensify and
      enhance the effects of this wonderful narcotic."<br>
      <br>
      The following evening the two men visit this hashish house, whose
      address is given as near Forty-second Street and Broadway. The
      clients "are about evenly divided between Americans and
      foreigners... all the visitors, both male and female, are of the
      better classes and absolute secrecy is the rule. The house has
      been opened about two years, I believe, and the number of regular
      habitués is daily on the increase."<br>
      <br>
      According to the author, there were about six hundred of these
      "habitués" in New York City alone. Other cities boasting
      comparable hashish dens were Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and
      especially New Orleans. In Baltimore, there was no need for
      secrecy since hashish devotees could purchase the drug in the form
      of candy in the city's business district. [21]<br>
      <br>
      In Philadelphia, during the American Centennial Exposition of
      1876, some pharmacists carried ten pounds or more of hashish on
      stock in case Americans or foreigners had a yen for the drug
      during the festivities. [22]<br>
      <br>
      Why there should have been any secrecy about hashish at all is
      puzzling, since there certainly were no laws against the drug at
      this time.<br>
      <br>
      As these magazine and newspaper articles and books on the drug
      circulated around the country, more and more Americans began
      experimenting with commercial cannabis preparations which were
      easily obtained from local pharmacies. The extent of these
      personal experiences is more than evident from the many reports of
      "cannabis poisonings" that began to fill the nation's medical
      journals and the "provings" that filled the homeopathic medical
      journals such as American Prover's Union, American Journal of
      Homeopathy and the American Homeopathic Review. In fact, the sheer
      bulk of these reports was enough to persuade many doctors that
      cannabis was a dangerous drug.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cannabis in American Medicine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Even before O'Shaughnessy published his pioneering studies of
      cannabis, the drug was familiar to European and American
      practitioners of homeopathy, a branch of medicine based on the
      principle that like cures like. In 1839, the homeopathy journal
      American Provers' Union published the first of many reports on the
      effects of cannabis. [23] In 1842, the New Homeopathic
      Pharmacopoeia and Posology or the Preparation of Homeopathic
      Medicines was published from an earlier German text. "To make the
      homeopathic preparation of hemp," the author explained, "we take
      the flowering tops of male and female plants and express the
      juice, and make the tincture with equal parts of alcohol; others
      advise only to use the flowering tops of the female plants,
      because these best exhale, during their flowering, a strong and
      intoxicating odour, whilst the male plants are completely
      inodorous." [24]<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis was first mentioned as a medicinal agent in a "formal"
      American medical text in 1843. [25] In 1846, Dr. Amariah Brigham,
      the editor of the American Journal of Insanity, brought the drug
      to the notice of American psychiatrists with a review of Moreau's
      book and experiments. Brigham was very exited about the prospect
      of using cannabis to treat insanity (homeopathy?), and he sent to
      Calcutta for some of the drug which he subsequently administered
      to several patients at the Lunatic Asylum in Utica, New York.
      "From our limited experience," he concluded, "we regard it as a
      very energetic remedy, and well worthy of further trial with the
      insane, and thank M. Moreau for having called attention to its
      use." [26]<br>
      <br>
      By 1854, the US Dispensatory began to list cannabis among the
      nation's medicinals:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical Properties Extract of hemp is a
      powerful narcotic, causing exhilaration, intoxication, delirious
      hallucinations, and, in its subsequent action, drowsiness and
      stupor, with little effect upon the circulation. It is asserted
      also to act as a decided aphrodisiac, to increase the appetite,
      and occasionally to induce the cataleptic state. In morbid states
      of the system, it has been found to produce sleep, to allay spasm,
      to compose nervous inequietude, and to relieve pain. In these
      respects it resembles opium in its operation; but it differs from
      that narcotic in not diminishing the appetite, checking the
      secretions, or constipating the bowels. It is much less certain in
      its effects; but may sometimes be preferably employed, when opium
      is contraindicated by its nauseating or constipating effects, or
      its disposition to produce headache, and to check the bronchial
      secretion. The complaints to which it has been specially
      recommended are neuralgia, gout, tetanus, hydrophobia, epidemic
      cholera, convulsions, chorea, hysteria, mental depression,
      insanity, and uterine hemorrhage. Dr Alexander Christison, of
      Edinburgh, has found it to have the property of hastening and
      increasing the contractions of the uterus in delivery, and has
      employed it with advantage for this purpose. It acts very quickly,
      and without anesthetic effect. It appears, however, to exert this
      influence only in a certain proportion of cases... [27]<br>
      <br>
      However, in recommending cannabis, the Dispensatory cautioned
      physicians that "alarming effects" were possible if large doses
      were prescribed, owing to the variability in potency of
      commercially available preparations.<br>
      <br>
      In 1859, Dr. John P. Gray, a future president of the American
      Psychiatric Association, described his clinical experiences with
      the drug and noted that there had been a widening interest in
      cannabis during the previous three to four years. [28]<br>
      <br>
      In 1860, the Ohio Medical Society catalogued the conditions in
      which cannabis had been successfully used. Among those mentioned
      were neuralgia, nervous rheumatism, mania, whooping cough, asthma,
      chronic bronchitis, muscular spasms, tetanus, epilepsy, infantile
      convulsions, palsy, uterine hemorrhage, dysmenorrhea, hysteria,
      withdrawal from alcohol, and loss of appetite - an imposing list
      of disorders drawn mainly from O'Shaughnessy's and other reports
      published in England. Little notice of the drug, however, seems to
      have filtered down to American doctors since cannabis was used
      only to a very limited extent during the Civil War, the most
      frequent applications being for the treatment of diarrhoea and
      dysentery among soldiers.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, when the number of "cannabis poisonings" began to
      attract notice, physicians found themselves in a quandary as to
      how to treat these drug overdosings. Many recommended forced
      vomitings to be followed by hot coffee, lemon juice, ammonia,
      strychnine, atropine, or nitrous oxide. Some physicians also
      recommended electric shock and artificial respiration.<br>
      <br>
      But despite the frequency of such "poisonings", physicians
      frequently noted, "an overdose has never produced death in man or
      the lower animals. Not one authentic case is on record in which
      Cannabis or any of its preparations destroyed life... Cannabis
      does not seem capable of causing death by chemical or
      physiological action." [29]<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, American doctors were never very exited by cannabis
      for drug therapy. It had too many shortcomings. The potency of
      commercially available preparations differed quite considerably
      from pharmacist to pharmacist. Quite often a given dose of drug
      obtained from one supplier would have no noticeable effects
      whereas the same amount obtained from another supplier would be
      far above the amount which produced unpleasant effects.<br>
      <br>
      Doctors were also at a loss to deal with the perplexing
      variability in the response of different patients to the same
      amount of the drug. Some patients reported that they felt much
      better after taking the drug; others complained of delirium and
      hallucinations.<br>
      <br>
      There were other drawbacks to contend with. Cannabis was not
      soluble in water and consequently it could not be given by
      injection. Compared with a fast-acting pain killer such as
      morphine, which was water soluble and could therefore be given by
      syringe, the action of cannabis was extremely slow and a doctor
      might have to remain with his patient for more than an hour after
      he swallowed the drug to make sure that not only was it having a
      desired effect, but also that the dosage had not been too high.<br>
      <br>
      Faced with such uncertainty of drug action, a lack of pure
      compounds, difficulties in administering the drug except by mouth,
      and a long delay before the drug took effect, doctors
      understandably retained little interest in the possible
      therapeutic benefits of cannabis preparations.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry continued trying to turn
      cannabis into a viable medicinal agent. By 1896, several new
      cannabis derivatives were developed, among them cannabin,
      cannabindon, cannabine, and cannabinon. Cannabis was also included
      along with other drugs in various preparations such as
      "Chlorodyne" (a stomach remedy manufactured by Squibb Co. which
      mainly contained morphine), Brown Sequard's Antineuralgic Pills,
      and Corn Colodion. [30] Most corn remedies, in fact, contained
      cannabis as a main ingredient, but it was only included as a
      coloring agent.<br>
      <br>
      At the turn of the century the US government was particularly
      interested in the therapeutic potential of marijuana and planted
      cannabis as well as opium and henbane along the banks of the
      Potomac near Washington. "The plants selected for culture in this
      government garden," the Boston Sunday Globe (Jan 10, 1904) told
      its readers, "are those that yield the deadliest of poisons... The
      most striking feature of the poison garden... is a patch of Indian
      hemp, from which the famous drug 'hasheesh' is obtained." The
      Globe then went on to explain: "Most people have read of that
      remarkable secret society in the Orient, organized for wholesale
      and systematic murder whose members called themselves Hashhashin -
      hence our word 'assassin' - and stimulated themselves for their
      deeds of atrocity by doses of this drug."<br>
      <br>
      The experiment was short-lived, however. In the wake of
      controversy over the "doping" of Americans that prompted the Food
      and Drug Act of 1906, the federally sponsored project was
      terminated and the "dope" fields were eradicated, to be occupied
      years later by the Pentagon. [31]<br>
      <br>
      Some eminent American psychologists were also very interested in
      marijuana's effects and tried it on several occasions. James
      McKeen Cattel (1860-1944) during his student days at The John
      Hopkins University in Baltimore (1882-1883) took hashish on
      several occasions. However, years later, Cattel, who eventually
      became president of the American Psychological Association,
      regretted having done so. "On reaching years of somewhat greater
      discretion I was not altogether proud of my enterprise," he
      confessed in his personal journal. [32]<br>
      <br>
      Another prominent psychologist who experimented with cannabis
      around the turn of the century was Edmund Burke Delabarre
      (1863-1945), Director of the psychology laboratory at Brown
      University in Rhode Island. Delabarre began experimenting with
      cannabis in 1893 and continued studying the effects on himself
      until 1931. In 1898, Delabarre described some of his early work at
      the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in
      New York, and, later that year, he spoke before the Art Club in
      Providence on his hashish experiments. Apparently, these reports
      were listened to with a great deal of interest, but for some
      unknown reason, most psychologists were not motivated enough to
      conduct their own studies with the drug.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We here offer a perfectly safe and reliable
      cure to those addicted to the habit of using opium or morphine in
      any manner whatever.<br>
      <br>
      This advertisement appeared in the 1905 Sears, Roebuck &amp;
      Company catalogue. The price per bottle for this cure: sixty-nine
      cents.<br>
      <br>
      At the turn of the century when this notice first appeared, about
      one million Americans were addicted to drugs such as opium and
      morphine. Most Americans have an image of the drug addict as a
      decadent denizen of a dirty inner-city metropolis. Not so during
      America's adolescent years. In the early 1900s, when most
      Americans still lived in the country, the typical addict lived in
      a small town or on an isolated farm, he attended church regularly
      on Sunday, and would have been astounded if anyone intimated that
      because of his addiction he was a degenerate, a deviate or a
      criminal.<br>
      <br>
      Opium, in fact, had been part of the American home-remedy drug
      cabinet almost from the time of the first settlements in America.
      Morphine, the active ingredient in opium, had been isolated in
      1803. Inexpensive, potent, and reliable, morphine became a staple
      of the family drug arsenal as early as the 1830s. The invention of
      the hypodermic syringe in 1845 eventually led to such
      indiscriminate administration of this powerful pain killer during
      the Civil War that withdrawal came to be known across the nation
      as the "army disease".<br>
      <br>
      After the war, the ranks of the addicted were swelled as
      well-meaning but ill-informed physicians, many of them little more
      than quacks, dispensed morphine at the sound of the faintest moan.
      To the doctor, morphine was a panacea that relieved pain and
      earned him a patient's gratitude and respect. Other sufferers, too
      isolated or poor to see a doctor, could treat themselves, as many
      did, with a variety of nostrums, usually laced with morphine,
      opium, or alcohol, which were available through the mail or from
      travelling medicine men.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is that America is now, and has always been, a nation of
      pill poppers. At the same time, it is a nation that prides itself
      on the virtues of temperance and hard work. In advertising another
      of its elixirs, "White Star Secret Liquor Cure", for instance,
      Sears claimed that this potion "has saved many from that awful
      monster, Drink, and has protected thousands against a life of
      disease, poverty and degradation... a higher moral tone is upheld;
      in a word, it makes him a man among men."<br>
      <br>
      Unlike opium, morphine, or alcohol, cannabis was a relatively
      obscure drug. The so-called hashish vice was still confined to the
      large cities and to a minority of writers, students, thrill
      seekers, and the bored upper classes. Had it not been for certain
      social and economic changes and an ambitious bureaucrat who saw
      the marijuana issue as a way to save his dying department and his
      job as czar of narcotics enforcement, most Americans probably
      would not have heard about marijuana or hashish until the 1960s.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Drugs and Minority Oppression</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The story of how marijuana and hashish, drugs about which most
      Americans were totally ignorant and could not have cared about at
      the time they were outlawed, begins in the latter half of the
      nineteenth century with the events that led to the unprecedented
      criminalization of the drug user in America.<br>
      <br>
      In the latter part of the 1860s, thousands of Chinese immigrants
      poured into the American west to work on the railways that were
      beginning to tentacle across the country. By the end of the 1870s,
      the construction boom petered out and there were more men than
      jobs. The railway and mining companies, the large farm owners, and
      manufacturers took advantage of the situation and offered the
      lowest possible wages for whatever work they had available.
      Although white laborers were unwilling to accept the pittances
      being offered, the Chinese had no such scruples. They needed to
      survive and they took what they could find. White laborers reacted
      by blaming the Chinese for ruining the economy and taking jobs
      away from native Americans.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the Chinese held menial jobs, but some saved enough to
      become shop owners and eventually became wealthy businessmen. Some
      became rich by opening brothels. With men outnumbering women by a
      ratio of almost twenty to one, these flesh shops did a thriving
      business. Still others became well-to-do by opening up opium
      houses where drug-induced stupor assuaged the loneliness and
      despair of these impoverished immigrants, strangers in a land
      thousands of miles away from homes and families.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the Chinese immigrant had a taste for opium before he
      crossed the Pacific, or whether he developed the habit once he
      settled in America, the fact is that the m den became the visible
      symbol of the Chinese presence on the West Coast and as such
      became the target of anti-Chinese sentiment. "Opium and the
      Chinese, to the mind of your average newspaper reader, are
      inseparable," wrote one newsman. [1]<br>
      <br>
      The growing spectre of the opium den in the Chinatowns of many of
      the nation's cities kindled the resentment of many Americans
      toward what they regarded as a backwards race of degenerates. An
      editorial in the February 13, 1882, edition of the Tombstone
      Epitaph did not mince its bigotry:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese are the least desired immigrants
      who have ever sought the United States... the almond-eyed
      Mongolian with his pigtail, his heathenism his filthy habits, his
      thrift, and careful accumulation of savings to be sent back to the
      flowery kingdom. The most we can do is to insist that he is a
      heathen, a devourer of soup made from the flagrant juice of the
      rat, filthy disagreeable, and undesirable generally, an incumbance
      that we have determined shall not increase in this part of the
      world. [2]<br>
      <br>
      In 1875, San Francisco passed the first city ordnance against the
      smoking or possession of opium in America. A year later, Virginia
      City, Nevada, enacted a similar law. Ostensibly, the reason for
      these laws was the adoption of opium smoking by young white boys
      and girls. Oregon's legislators gave their own reason for enacting
      its state law against opium: "Smoking opium is not our vice, and
      therefore, it may be that this legislation proceeds more from a
      desire to vex and annoy the 'Heathen Chinese' in this respect than
      to protect the people from the evil habit." [3]<br>
      <br>
      When they passed these laws against opium, city and state
      lawmakers were merely adding one more restriction to those already
      aimed at ignobling the Chinese such as the queue ordinance of
      1870, which required all prisoners in San Francisco's county jails
      to have their heads shaved.<br>
      <br>
      It was not so much the seduction of children by opium, although
      this was a concern if not a reality, which was on the mind of many
      Americans when the country became opium conscious. Rather, it was
      the growing realization that middle-class America was in danger of
      decadence through overindulgence in drugs. Besides opium and
      morphine, chloral hydrate was reputedly enslaving Americans.
      College students were allegedly being corrupted by ether and
      chloroform fumes. Cocaine was reported to be inciting southern
      blacks to mayhem. Not for want of reason had America been
      christened "a nation of drug takers." [4]<br>
      <br>
      With the increasing publicity being given to the looming menace of
      drug abuse, state governments were pressured to do something,
      especially where the opium problem was concerned. Unless steps
      were taken to restrict opiates, critics warned that "soon, the
      residents of our American cities will all be opium slaves." [5]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Pure Food and Drug Act</b><br>
      <br>
      To some extent, the antiopium laws adopted by various states were
      not meant solely to harass the Chinese, but were instead a
      reaction to what many saw as a real drug menace in America. The
      Chinese were merely the scapegoats.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the laws promulgated by individual states attempted to
      curtail availability of drugs by requiring prescriptions for any
      opiates purchased. Pharmacists were obliged to retain these
      records for at least a year in some states. However, the
      Proprietry Association of America, which manufactured the
      opiate-laden over-the-counter drugs, was able to obtain a number
      of exemptions to various state laws whereby limited amounts of
      narcotics could still be sold in patent medicines without need for
      a prescription. These patent medicines were readily available and
      were liberally used for any and all illnesses, imagined or real,
      from headaches to alcoholism.<br>
      <br>
      The more the public relied on these nostrums, the more dependent
      on their contents they became. While various states attempted to
      control the dispensing of narcotics by physicians through the
      prescription process, the restraints on the patent-drug industry
      were minimal. Restrictions on the medical profession were
      similarly lax and doctors could evade them in different ways.<br>
      <br>
      "Dope doctors" who had no desire to comply with the law or who
      resented the paperwork involved in recording their drug
      dispensations, merely ordered drugs from companies in other states
      that had no such restrictions. These drugs could then be sold
      directly to patients without disobeying the law. Other doctors,
      who resented the competition of the patent-medicine manufacturers
      and the exclusion of proprietory medicines from state control,
      began to consider legal means to regulate the distribution of
      drugs at the national level.<br>
      <br>
      The Constitution, however, made no provision for the regulation of
      drugs by the federal government. The only powers Congress might
      use involved the authority to regulate interstate commerce and
      impose taxes. After a long and involved examination of the
      problem, it was decided that the mandate over interstate traffic
      was authority enough to oversee the patent-medicine business.<br>
      <br>
      On the premise that Americans were addicting themselves simply
      because they were unaware of the contents of the nostrums they
      were taking, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 required that all
      patent medicines shipped across state lines had to list their
      ingredients if they contained more than a specified amount of
      opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, chloral hydrate, or
      cannabis. Three years later, Congress would adopt a second major
      drug law. This time, however, the impetus for such a law would
      come from international considerations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Federal Antiopium Laws</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1882, anti-Chinese feeling had risen to such a point that
      Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act which prohibited Chinese
      laborers from entering the United States for the next ten years.
      China reacted to this insult to its citizens by adopting an
      embargo against American manufactures. Faced with the loss of the
      lucrative Chinese market, and aware of China's efforts to
      eradicate its own domestic opium problem, President Theodore
      Roosevelt convened an international conference in 1909 in Shanghai
      to help China eradicate the problem of opium addiction among its
      inhabitants. By trying to impress China with its goodwill and
      concern about her drug crisis, the United States hoped to change
      China's attitude toward American goods.<br>
      <br>
      It was with some degree of embarrassment, however, that the United
      States delegates to the Shanghai convention realized that their
      own country had no federal laws prohibiting the smoking of opium.
      To avoid being accused of hypocrisy, Congress quickly enacted such
      a law. Henceforth, importation of opium into the United States
      except at specific entry points, and then only with the provision
      that it was to be used exclusively for medical purposes, was
      prohibited. It was now a crime for anyone to buy or sell opium in
      the United States. By making the opium user a criminal, Congress
      attempted to suppress opium traffic in America.<br>
      <br>
      Coming as it did while the Shanghai conference was in session, the
      delegates were greatly impressed with America's earnestness to
      deal with the problem. However, the various representatives
      attending the conference had not been empowered by their
      governments to write or adopt any international treaty for the
      control of world traffic in opium, so all they could do was
      congratulate the Americans and promise to make recommendations to
      their respective governments concerning such a global measure.<br>
      <br>
      But the United States had not achieved its primary objective of
      gaining access to the Chinese markets, and so in 1911 the United
      States urged a second international meeting, this one to be held
      at The Hague. The British were cool to the proposal since India,
      its territorial province, was still supplying enormous quantities
      of opium to the Chinese market. Any restrictions on the opium
      trade would cut off this lucrative trade. Persia and Turkey were
      lass than enthusiastic for the same reason.<br>
      <br>
      Undeterred, the Americans pressed on. Said Hamilton Wright, the
      American delegate: "Our move [the Shanghai conference] to help
      China in her opium reform gave us more prestige in China than any
      of our recent friendly acts toward her. If we continue and press
      steadily for the [Hague] Conference, China will recognize that we
      are sincere on her behalf, and the whole business may be used as
      oil to smooth the troubled water of our aggressive commercial
      policy there." [6]<br>
      <br>
      To gain this foothold in China, Wright pressured Congress to adopt
      wide-sweeping antinarcotics laws. His appeal was aimed at American
      prejudices. Opium smoking in America, Wright declared, had been
      introduced by the Chinese and "one of the most unfortunate phases
      of the habit... was the large number of women who have become
      involved and were living as common-law wives and cohabiting with
      Chinese in the Chinatowns of our various cities." [7]<br>
      <br>
      Wright also incited latent racial fears. "It has been
      authoritatively stated," he said, "that cocaine is often the
      direct incentive to the crime of rape by the Negroes of the South
      and other sections of the country." [8]<br>
      <br>
      As initially proposed, the law required pharmacists to purchase
      tax stamps for narcotics, including cannabis, and demanded that
      they keep meticulous records of purchases of such drugs,
      regardless of amount.<br>
      <br>
      The National Wholesale Druggist Association (NDWA) vehemently
      objected to such measures since the use of stamps and detailed
      record keeping would greatly increase the cost of doing business.
      The NDWA also objected to the inclusion of cannabis on the
      proscribed list. Dr. Charles West, their spokesman, said that
      there was no reason to consider cannabis in the same class as
      opium, morphine, and cocaine, since it was not habit forming. Dr.
      William Muir, spokesman for the New York Pharmaceutical
      Association, pointed out that cannabis was a major ingredient in
      corn cures. Having to keep detailed records of every sale of corn
      cures was ridiculous.<br>
      <br>
      Eventually, the retail interests won out and the proposed
      legislation was defeated. Wright accurately foresaw the course of
      events at The Hague conference now that the United States was in
      the position of advocating international control of narcotics
      without having its own domestic laws against such drugs. Other
      nations that had such laws accused the United States of hypocrisy,
      since without domestic restrictions the United States would not
      have to abide by any international agreements to ban narcotics.
      Wright assured his fellow delegates that adoption of such
      legislation was only a matter of time, but he was not persuasive
      enough and the conference disbanded without agreement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Harrison Act</b><br>
      <br>
      Disappointed but not yet beaten, Wright persuaded Congressman
      Francis Burton Harrison to introduce an amended antinarcotics bill
      in the House. The newly drafted legislation considerably
      simplified the record-keeping process, which pleased the
      pharmacists. However, the law did require pharmacists dispensing
      narcotics to register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue and pay
      for a tax stamp. By framing the law as a revenue measure, Congress
      felt that it could constitutionally oversee a law whose real
      intention was to regulate possession of opiates. When Congress
      adopted its antimarijuana law, this tax stamp pretext was again
      resorted to so that the federal government could constitutionally
      regulate possession and use of that drug as well.<br>
      <br>
      The tax stamp measure also enabled federal officers to keep track
      of all legal dispensations of narcotics and placed federal
      enforcement of the law under the Internal Revenue Branch of the
      Treasury Department. Private individuals were not allowed to
      purchase these tax stamps, and therefore they were unable to
      obtain narcotics lawfully on their own. Possession of such drugs
      by a nonmedical individual was henceforth permitted only if
      prescribed by a physician or dentist. Physicians, however, were
      permitted to dispense narcotics directly to their patients while
      attending them, without having to record such actions.<br>
      <br>
      Known as the Harrison Act, the statute was eventually adopted and
      became law in December 1914. Although it evolved into America's
      foremost drug-abuse law, the intention of the Harrison Act at the
      time of its conception and passage was really never directed
      toward the eradication of narcotic drugs but was merely a
      face-save piece of legislation, a law passed to honor American
      pledges given at The Hague convention that the United States would
      take steps to curtail criminal control of drug traffic. It was
      never meant to stand in the way of any addict who wanted to
      continue using drugs. It was merely to be a record-keeping bill, a
      piece of legislation that would cause minimum of bother to all
      concerned.<br>
      <br>
      The legislators did not intend to make addiction illegal. Addicts
      could obtain all the drugs they wanted, provided they got them
      through registered suppliers. The Narcotics Division of the
      Internal Revenue Bureau was created not as a law enforcement body,
      but as a bookkeeping department to supervise collection of tax
      stamp monies.<br>
      <br>
      But Congress got more than it bargained for. The bureaucrats who
      moved into the department began to feel the need to justify their
      existence beyond that of mere bookkeepers and they began to look
      for ways to expand and improve their worth. One way of becoming
      important was to take a more active part in overseeing the
      Harrison Act. But to do so, the terms of the act had to be
      broadened. To expand, there had to be an issue, one that Congress
      could understand and appreciate and at the same time see the need
      to bolster the Narcotics Division.<br>
      <br>
      The plan began with a media campaign aimed at the alleged evils of
      narcotics. The idea was to stir up the public, make it appear that
      the country was on the verge of a drug-induced moral collapse. The
      themes were calculated to arouse fear and apprehension: children
      were being victimized; narcotics were lethal and enslaving; drug
      users were criminals. The campaign was such an overwhelming
      success in spreading panic that the bureau resorted to the same
      ploy years later when it sought to outlaw marijuana.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time as it began its media campaign, the Bureau of
      Narcotics also prepared a second front aimed at increasing the
      scope of the Harrison Act through judicial reinterpretation of its
      terms. While the courts held that federal authorities had no right
      to arrest physicians for prescribing narcotics to known addicts in
      US vs. Jim Fuey Moy (1916), it also ruled that physicians were not
      immune to paying the tax on narcotics in US vs. Doremus (1919).
      This meant that doctors had to keep records of their
      dispensations. In a second ruling rendered the same day, the court
      also held in US vs. Webb et al. that it was unlawful for a doctor
      to give opiates to narcotics addicts merely to keep them from
      experiencing withdrawal. Only in cases of senility or intractable
      pain could an addict legally receive narcotics.<br>
      <br>
      These two decisions were to haunt the medical profession.
      Henceforth, many reputable physicians were closely watched by
      overly zealous Treasury agents. Harassment was inevitable;
      humiliation was commonplace. On the slightest suspicion, doctors
      were hauled into court to answer charges concerning their medical
      practices.<br>
      <br>
      The medical profession also began to feel that the courts were
      interfering with the prerogatives of the doctor to treat his
      patient in a manner best suited to that patient's welfare. A new
      fear also began to emerge: the country appeared to be moving
      toward state-controlled medicine and possibly compulsory health
      insurance.<br>
      <br>
      Once bitten, the American Medical Association was twice shy. Years
      later, when Congress debated outlawing marijuana, Dr. William
      Woodward, representing the AMA, was one of its most vigorous
      opponents.<br>
      <br>
      By making narcotics illegal, the price skyrocketed and addicts
      were forced to commit petty crimes to pay for their habit. Whereas
      they had previously been able to obtain narcotics from pharmacists
      and doctors, these outlets were no longer available. To meet their
      needs, addicts turned to the underworld and banded together,
      forming a drug subculture in various sections of the nation's
      large cities.<br>
      <br>
      Branded a criminal, faced with soaring costs for drugs, the addict
      began to live up to the bureau's labelling of him as a degenerate
      and a parasite. The more the public read of crimes allegedly
      committed by addicts, the more they were willing to believe that
      mind-altering drugs of any sort transformed normally law-abiding
      citizens into criminals.<br>
      <br>
      For its part, the Bureau of Narcotics's campaign to expand its
      prerogatives and jurisdiction was a huge success. Each year the
      bureau grew in prestige and manpower. The mark of its achievement
      is most clearly seen in its budgetary allowance, which skyrocketed
      from a mere $292,000 in 1915 to $1,708,528 in 1932, an increase of
      over 400 percent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prohibition</b><br>
      <br>
      Shortly after the adoption of the Harrison Act, the United States
      also passed the Eighteenth Amendment, outlawing the sale,
      manufacture, and transportation of alcohol across state lines.
      (Consumption, on the other hand, was still legal.)<br>
      <br>
      Although following in the footsteps of the antinarcotics
      legislation, the crusade against demon rum had been going on long
      before there was any interest or concern over narcotics addiction.
      But coming in the aftermath of the Harrison Act, Prohibition
      became part and parcel of the new attitude toward drugs that would
      eventually draw marijuana into its nets of legalized morality.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the antinarcotics laws, however, Prohibition came
      about with little debate. But like the Harrison Act, Prohibition
      continued the pattern of using federal authority to dictate
      morality to Americans and of placing enforcement of the law under
      the watchful eye of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<br>
      <br>
      The successes of the antinarcotics and temperance movements had
      the effects of encouraging other reformist groups to "clean up"
      America. The next targets were tobacco, dancing, and jazz. The
      cigarette was branded as evil. There was no "energy more
      destructive of soul, mind and body, or more subversive of good
      morals, than the cigarette. The fight against the cigarette is a
      fight for civilization." While some states in the south and west
      eventually did adopt laws outlawing cigarettes, these statutes
      were soon rescinded, too unpopular to enforce.<br>
      <br>
      The new dance crazes were another bugaboo of the reformists.
      Accused of encouraging sex on the dance floor, the tango,
      hesitation waltz, turkey trot, black bottom, and the Charleston
      were all denounced as licentious.<br>
      <br>
      Jazz was similarly censured as causing "mental drunkenness." Many
      agreed with the superintendent of schools in Kansas City,
      Missouri, who said, "This nation has been fighting booze for a
      long time. I am just wondering whether jazz isn't going to be
      legislated against as well."<br>
      <br>
      The reformist sentiment represented village America's resentment
      of urban America. Village America was WASP land, home of white,
      middle-class, Protestantism, home of morality, fundamentalist
      religion, and rural-minded respectability. Men beat their wives
      and children, but did it in the privacy of their own homes and
      toolsheds, not in any crowded tenement where their neighbors could
      see and hear. When they drank to excess, their wives or a neighbor
      would fetch them home, not the police. Rural Americans, who far
      outnumbered urban Americans in their rate of drug addiction at the
      turn of the century, cast not the mote from its own eye. Instead,
      they denounced minority groups, such as the Chinese and the
      Negroes for their addiction to opium and cocaine, and the Italians
      and the Irish for their boozing. These immigrants had been pouring
      into America by the millions. They had different cultures,
      different religions, and they spoke different languages. They
      crowded into cities and lived in squalid tenements, scratching for
      survival and looking for a way to escape their poverty.<br>
      <br>
      What if they should take it into their heads to start a
      revolution? What if they rose en masse and tried to take by force
      what native-born Americans had struggled so hard to achieve?
      Ordinarily, the likelihood of anything like that was not very
      great, but what if they lost their senses as a result of taking
      drugs?<br>
      <br>
      The spectre of class warfare loomed behind the actions of the
      antidrug sentiment in America. Years later, when the focus of
      attention would be centered around the dangers of marijuana, the
      antidrug reformist would rant and rave about the infamy of the
      heinous Assassins who were provoked into a frenzy of
      uncontrollable violence by their indulgence in hashish. In an
      effort to anticipate, suppress, or eliminate the imagined danger
      of an uncontrollable mass of foreigners caught up in a paroxysm of
      drug-inspired violence, the watchdogs of American morality took it
      upon themselves to obliterate these evils from the nation. Caught
      up in the furor and fears of the drug menace scare that was
      sweeping the country, marijuana, a drug that most Americans had
      never heard of, let alone seen, smelled, tasted, or smoked, was
      about to become the victim of America's next drug witch hunt.<br>
      <br>
      The attitude toward marijuana during the 1920s and 1930s was a
      logical extension of the class conflict and the fears surrounding
      opium abuse that arose during the latter half of the nineteenth
      century.<br>
      <br>
      Behind the efforts to outlaw marijuana was the belief that this
      drug could potentially release the inner city decadence of
      minority groups and America's own destitute poor. When the
      majority of addicts had been upright middle-class citizens, the
      country envisaged little danger to American society as a whole.
      However, when the bulk of the addict population began to be lower
      class, the danger seemed imminent. A society that harbored within
      it a body of indigent lazy men and women whose ways were contrary
      to the American work ethic seemed on the brink of economic chaos.<br>
      <br>
      The attitude toward the drug addict changed overnight once he
      became a criminal. Drug addiction, which hitherto had been merely
      a personal vice, was now seen as a moral pestilence, a plague that
      destroyed the spirit and left the body to rot. Such was the
      campaign against addiction that all that was necessary to see
      marijuana as a threat was to brand it a narcotic. Automatically,
      it too became a diabolical substance, a drug that could enslave a
      man in its addiction, destroy his moral fiber, turn him into a
      degenerate and a parasite, and unleash the mad dog that hitherto
      had been securely restrained in his erstwhile healthy body.<br>

      Even when it was not against the law, marijuana was used by very
      few Americans. Those who used it were typically from minority
      groups like the Mexicans and the Negroes, and this made them and
      their drug preferences highly visible. The fact that these people
      smoked marijuana for pleasure made marijuana a vice that was
      doubly suspect, since the American work ethic never recognized
      anything like an "artificial paradise".<br>
      <br>
      At the root of America's preoccupation with the potential dangers
      of drugs such as marijuana was a xenophobia that seems to
      characterize the history of the country almost from its very
      beginnings. Although settled by foreigners, native-born Americans
      blamed newcomers to the United States for many of the country's
      ills. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, newly
      arrived foreigners were blamed for the sprawling urban slums,
      depressed paychecks, and labor unrest - conditions beyond the ken
      of frontier America's whelps. Although America was built by the
      sweat of toiling immigrants, the newcomers were seldom welcomed.
      This was especially true when the blue-eyed, blond-haired,
      fair-skinned, Protestant migrations gave way to the brown- and
      green-eyed, black-haired, swarthy non-Protestants from Southern
      and Eastern Europe who settled in the coastal cities of America.<br>
      <br>
      Penniless when they arrived, they were grateful for whatever jobs
      they could get. Their readiness to toil for the lowest of wages
      was seen by native Americans as a stab in the back. These
      foreigners, they felt, were nothing less than strikebreakers.<br>
      <br>
      In the southwest, the sudden increase in Mexican immigration to
      the Untied States around 1910 set off yet another round of ethnic
      confrontation. The Mexicans were lower-class immigrants. They were
      crude, loud, uneducated. They lived in dirty shanties, ate strange
      food, and spoke a foreign language. The more resentful of these
      foreigners Americans became, the readier they were to attribute
      other negative characteristics to the Mexican. The fact that the
      Mexicans were Catholics made their situation even more touchy
      since Protestant America considered Catholicism a religion of dark
      superstition and ignorance.<br>
      <br>
      The Mexican was the Negro of the southwestern United States. While
      not a slave or a sharecropper, he was a peasant. The stereotype of
      the Mexican was that of a thief, an untamed savage, hot-blooded,
      quick to anger yet inherently lazy and irresponsible.<br>
      <br>
      When revolution broke out in Mexico in 1910, it was inevitable
      that the fighting would spill across the Rio Grande. When Pancho
      Villa attacked the tiny outpost at Columbus, New Mexico, in 1916,
      the attitude toward the Mexicans worsened considerably. As General
      Pershing's army crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico in pursuit of
      the bandit, his soldiers marched to the tune of a song that
      reflected America's attitude toward all Mexicans:<br>
      <br>
      It's a long way to capture Villa<br>
      It's a long way to go;<br>
      It's a long way across the border<br>
      Where the dirty greasers grow. [1]<br>
      <br>
      Villa's followers rode to a different song "La Cucaracha" - the
      cockroach who can't walk any longer because he doesn't have any
      marijuana to smoke:<br>
      <br>
      La cucaracha, la cucaracha<br>
      Ya no puede caminar<br>
      Porque no tiene, porque no tiene<br>
      Marihuana que fumar.<br>
      <br>
      The song was adopted as Villa's battle hymn after his capture of
      Torreon and subsequent overthrow of the Mexican government because
      many of his men had smoked marihuana before going into battle,
      much like other soldiers drinking alcohol before battle.<br>
      <br>
      When the 1930s devastated the American economy, the Mexicans bore
      the brunt of the scapegoat mentality in the southwest. Everything
      about them was abhorrent to many Americans, and there was a
      general hew and cry to kick them out of the country. Harassment
      was commonplace. The Mexicans were censured for almost everything
      they did or failed to do, including smoking marijuana. Marihuana,
      in fact, became the pretext for vexing the Mexicans just as opium
      had been the pretext for vexing the Chinese years before.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Outlawing Marihuana</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The campaign to outlaw marihuana in America began unexpectedly.
      Hamilton Wright, chief US delegate to the international conference
      at The Hague in 1911, had wanted an expert on international law as
      part of his team, but was forced to accept a California
      pharmacist, Henry J. Finger, instead, by Secretary of State P. C.
      Knox (Finger's appointment was an act of patronage to Knox's
      brother). During the conference, Finger unexpectedly rose from his
      seat to plead that cannabis be put on the list with opium and
      other narcotic drugs to be censured on a worldwide basis. The
      reason for such an unprecedented move, he said, was San
      Francisco's concern over the "large influx of Hindoos", who were
      introducing "whites into their habit".<br>
      <br>
      Italy was also in favor of restrictions on cannabis, and in fact
      stipulated that only if the cannabis issue were placed on the
      agenda would it attend the conference. Italy's interest in
      cannabis was anything but altruistic. Although it had no major
      cannabis problem of its own (and in fact was one of the world's
      major producers of fine hemp fabric), the Italians had just gone
      to war with Turkey and had won jurisdiction over the African
      colonies of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, where such a problem did
      exist.<br>
      <br>
      The other delegates, however, did not view San Francisco's plight
      or Italy's consternation seriously, and no recommendations
      regarding cannabis were adopted.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, the US House Ways and Means Committee, which
      also met in 1911 to hear proposals for federal antinarcotics
      legislation, were presented with arguments regarding whether
      cannabis should be outlawed domestically. Heading the anticannabis
      forces was Charles B. Fauns, a well-known director of a drug and
      alcohol hospital in New York City. Fauns berated those who
      minimize the dangers of cannabis. "To my mind it is inexcusable,"
      he told the congressional hearing, "for a man to say that there is
      no habit from the use of that drug. There is no drug in the
      pharmacopoeia today that would produce the pleasurable sensations
      you would get from cannabis, no not one - absolutely not a drug in
      the pharmacopoeia today, and of all the drugs on earth I would
      certainly put that on the list..." [2] Dr. William J. Schieffelin
      concurred with Fauns, although he felt that Fauns had overstated
      the case. Although very little cannabis was being used in the
      United States, he had heard that New York City's Syrian colony
      were smoking it and therefore perhaps it should be outlawed. [3]<br>
      <br>
      Charles A. West, chairman of the National Wholesale Druggists'
      Association, and Albert Plaut, representing Lehn and Fink, a New
      York pharmaceutical firm, spoke against the proposal, claiming
      that the notion that cannabis was in any way a harmful drug was
      based more on literary fantasy such as that found in The Count of
      Monte Cristo than on fact. West and Plaut were the more convincing
      speakers and cannabis was not even included in the subsequent
      debate over national restrictions on narcotic drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Unable to secure national support to outlaw cannabis, various
      state legislators moved on their own to prohibit its possession
      unless prescribed by a physician. In 1915, California passed the
      first such law. Shortly thereafter, nearly every state west of the
      Mississippi followed California's lead, e.g. Utah (1915), Wyoming
      (1915), Texas (1919), Iowa (1923), Nevada (1923), Oregon (1923),
      Washington (1923), Arkansas (1923), and Nebraska (1927).<br>
      <br>
      Yet, references in the newspapers to the adoption of these laws
      clearly show that the marihuana was relatively unknown, even in
      states with considerable Mexican populations. In Texas, for
      instance, the Austin Statesman explained to its readers that
      "marihuana is a Mexican herb and is said to be sold on the Texas
      Mexican border". [4]<br>
      <br>
      Many northern states, however, also had anticannabis laws as early
      as 1915. To the legislators of Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, and
      New York, a narcotic was a narcotic, whatever its name. Cannabis
      was considered a narcotic and therefore was accorded the same
      status as opium, morphine, heroin, and codeine, all of which were
      proscribed. Thus, when New York City's Board of Health prohibited
      cannabis from the city's streets in 1914, the New York Times (July
      30, 1914) reported that the drug was a "narcotic [with]
      practically the same effect as morphine and cocaine... [and] the
      inclusion of cannabis indica among the drugs to be sold only on
      prescription is only common sense. Devotees of hashish are now
      hardly numerous here to count, but they are likely to increase as
      other narcotics become harder to obtain."<br>
      <br>
      The motive behind these antimarihuana laws was obvious. Finger had
      alluded to San Francisco's "Hindoos" and Schieffelin had had New
      York City's "Syrians" in mind when they spoke out against the
      drug. But the Mexican connection was to outshadow these groups by
      far in future laws enacted against marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Mexican Connection</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1910, the revolution south of the Rio Grande drove thousands of
      Mexicans north into the United States. The main border crossings
      were El Paso, Texas; Nogales and Douglas, Arizona; and Calexico,
      California. The immigrants who passed through these points of
      entry usually took up temporary residence on the outskirts of
      these towns, and the Mexican ghetto or barrio became a common
      sight in parts of the southwest.<br>
      <br>
      At first the newcomers were welcomed, especially by the wealthy
      landowners and the railway companies. These people were willing to
      work for cheap wages. As bad as the pay was, it was still worse in
      Mexico. While many Mexicans were ferried as far north as Chicago
      to work in the rail yards, most were recruited as fruit and
      vegetable pickers in California's Imperial and San Joaquin
      Valleys, in Texas's Rio Grande Valley, in Arizona's Salt River
      Valley, and in the sugar beet fields of Colorado. So valuable a
      labor commodity were the Mexicans that big business pressured
      Congress to exclude them from the literacy test and head-tax
      payments that had been written into the Immigration Act of 1917.<br>
      <br>
      Small businessmen also reaped dollars from the newcomers, and as
      late as 1930 they fought all attempts to restrict Mexican
      immigration. Said one Los Angeles shopkeeper:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexican business is for cash. They don't
      criticize prices. You can sell them higher priced articles than
      they intended to purchase when they came in. They spend every cent
      they make. Nothing is too good for a Mexican if he has the money.
      They spend their entire paycheck. If they come into your store
      first, you get it. If they go to the other fellow's store first,
      he gets it. [5]<br>
      <br>
      The reaction of the townspeople, however, was less favorable:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The evils to the community at large which their
      presence in large numbers almost invariably brings may more than
      over-balance their desirable qualities. Their low standards of
      living and morals, their illiteracy, their utter lack of proper
      political interest, the retarding effect of their employment upon
      the wage scale of the more progressive races, and finally their
      tendency to colonize in urban centers, with evil results, combine
      to stamp them as a rather undesirable class of residents. [6]<br>
      <br>
      Small farmers, unable to compete with large growers because of the
      cheap wages paid to the Mexicans, were being driven out of
      business. Labor unions likewise complained of the competition from
      cheap labor. Local governments were unhappy about the number of
      Mexicans on relief. Business interests countered that the Mexicans
      were the most preferable of all the cheap labor available and were
      more suited than American whites at working at menial tasks.
      Caught in the middle, the Mexicans became the scapegoats for the
      economic conflict between business and labor. It was largely in
      this role of monkey-in-the-middle that the habits and customs of
      the Mexicans began to be attacked as un-American, and at the top
      of the list of un-American-like activities was their use of
      marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The American Hemp Drug Commissions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As the numbers of Mexican immigrants began to increase, especially
      in the border towns of the southwest, they were the object of
      close scrutiny by the townsfolk. Suspicious and often resentful of
      these newcomers, the townspeople humiliated, harassed, and abused
      them to make them feel as unwelcome as possible. When the Mexicans
      lashed back at their tormentors, their actions were often
      attributed to the influence of marihuana, which to many Americans
      symbolized the Mexican presence in America.<br>
      <br>
      A early as 1914, the town of El Paso passed a local ordinance
      outlawing the sale or possession of marihuana. Like the outlawing
      of opium, the ordinance was meant to annoy and harass a class of
      people. The pretext for the law was said to have been a fight
      started by a Mexican who was allegedly under the influence of the
      drug, but the real reason was dislike, if not hatred, of the
      foreigners from across the Rio Grande.<br>
      <br>
      Relations between Americans and Mexicans were not helped very much
      by the antics of the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. Villa
      frequently led his bandits on raids against towns on the American
      side of the Rio Grande and then fled back into Mexico. When
      finally the Americans had had enough, they sent General "Black
      Jack" Pershing in pursuit of the elusive bandit.<br>
      <br>
      When Pershing returned from Mexico, there was some concern that
      marihuana had infiltrated the American ranks, although an official
      inquiry failed to turn up any proof to that effect. However, in
      1921, the commandant of Fort Sam Houston expressly forbade
      marihuana anywhere on the grounds of the military post, ostensibly
      because American soldiers were smoking the drug while on duty.<br>
      <br>
      In 1916, military authorities in the Panama Canal Zone began to
      suspect that army personnel were also smoking marihuana, but
      little attention was given to the issue at that time.<br>
      <br>
      Six years later, in 1922, the provost marshall became concerned
      about reports that American soldiers were smoking marihuana and
      were becoming disobedient as a result. The following year, the
      army prohibited possession of marihuana by American personnel in
      the Canal Zone.<br>
      <br>
      On April 1, 1925, a formal committee was convened to investigate
      the traffic in marihuana in the Canal Zone and to consider steps
      to prevent its usage. The committee invited army officers to
      express their opinions on the use of the drug by American
      soldiers, and at a hospital for the insane the committee watched
      while some soldiers, four physicians, and two policemen smoked
      marihuana in their presence. The committee also examined the
      military records of delinquent soldiers for any evidence that
      marihuana had produced unruliness.<br>
      <br>
      A Colonel Chamberlain spoke for most of the committee's members
      when he concluded: "I think we can safely say, based upon the
      samples we have had smokes here and upon the reports of the
      individuals concerned, that there is nothing to indicate any habit
      forming tendency or any striking ill effects. All of the
      statements to the effect that two or three puffs produce
      remarkable effects are nonsense, judging from our experience."<br>
      <br>
      A Mr. Johannes concurred and added that Dr. Cornell, a physician
      participating in the experiment, "was about the only man who was
      actually affected."<br>
      <br>
      A third member of the committee, a Dr. Hesner, explained, however,
      that Dr. Cornell "had previously seen a marihuana smoker at my
      place and I think he must have had similar symptoms to what he
      would have had if he had smoked any other kind of cigarette."<br>
      <br>
      "In other words," Colonel Chamberlain noted, "the same effects
      might have been produced by any other kind of vapor."<br>
      <br>
      To which Mr. Johannes replied: "I have seen firemen on ship's
      fires overcome by smoke, overcome by peculiar symptoms, run around
      without knowing what they are doing, acting peculiarly, and
      lacking coordination."<br>
      <br>
      Up to this point, the committee seemed admirably objective in
      their assessment of the evidence. They had witnessed an experiment
      which allowed them to observe the effects of marihuana firsthand
      and had found nothing to be alarmed about. But a Colonel Rigby now
      interjected the possibility that marihuana "seems to affect some
      individuals pretty seriously and doesn't seem to affect others."<br>
      <br>
      In response to a suggestion by Dr. Hesner that if the committee
      could get some other men to use it, they might be able to observe
      some "susceptible cases", a Mr. Calhoun proposed what would
      eventually become a clandestine military practice. "It might well
      be," opined Calhoun, "to have some who would not know whether they
      were smoking it or tobacco for the purpose of ascertaining exact
      effects." To his credit, a Dr. Bates recognized the ethical
      implications and denounced such a scheme. "I feel that if the
      matter can be demonstrated scientifically," he replied to Calhoun,
      "it should be so demonstrated rather than by sneaking up on them."<br>
      <br>
      On the basis of the testimony given, their own personal
      observation, and examination of military files, the committee
      finally concluded that marihuana was not habit forming nor did it
      have "any appreciable deleterious influence on the individual
      using it". Previous orders forbidding possession of marihuana were
      subsequently rescinded in 1926.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the thoroughness of the probe, some high-ranking army
      officers refused to accept the committee's findings and ordered
      that a new investigation be conducted. In 1929, the department
      surgeon in charge of the new inquiry reported that "use of the
      drug is not widespread and... its effects upon military efficiency
      and upon discipline are not great. There appears to be no reason
      for renewing the penalties formerly enacted for the possession and
      the use of the drug."<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, in December 1930 the department commander ordered
      that since "the smoking of marihuana impairs the efficiency of the
      soldiers [it] is forbidden. Soldiers smoking marihuana or using it
      in any way will be brought to trial for each and every offence."<br>
      <br>
      In June 1931, a third Canal Zone investigation was begun. Once
      again the committee found no evidence to link marihuana with
      problems of morale or delinquency. "The evidence obtained," the
      committee said, "suggests that organization Commanders in
      estimating the efficiency and soldierly quality of delinquents in
      their commands have unduly emphasized the effects of marihuana,
      disregarding the fact that a large proportion of the delinquents
      are morons or psychopaths, which conditions themselves would serve
      to account for delinquency."<br>
      <br>
      But the army brass would not be deterred. Morale was down and a
      scapegoat had to be found. Orders forbidding possession of
      marihuana on military installations were to be continued in force.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marihuana and Violence</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As the most conspicuous users of marihuana, Mexicans were
      oftentimes accused of being incited to violence by the drug. A
      letter written in 1911 by the American consul at Nogales, Mexico,
      stated that marihuana "causes the smoker to become exceedingly
      pugnacious and to run amuck without discrimination." [7] A Texas
      police captain claimed that under marihuana's baneful influence,
      Mexicans became "very violent, especially when they become angry
      and will attack an officer even if a gun is drawn on him. They
      seem to have no fear, I have also noted that when under the
      influence of this weed they have enormous strength and that it
      will take several men to handle one man while under ordinary
      circumstances one man could handle him with ease." [8]<br>
      <br>
      Prison officials throughout the southwest had no doubt about
      marihuana's capacity to provoke violence. In the words of the
      warden of the state prison in Yuma, Arizona: "Under its baseful
      influence reckless men become bloodthirsty, terribly daring, and
      dangerous to an uncontrollable degree." [9]<br>
      <br>
      The Butte Montana Standard reflected the thinking of the state's
      legislators when they outlawed marihuana in 1927:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When some beet field peon takes a few traces of
      this stuff... he thinks he has just been elected president of
      Mexico, so he starts out to execute all his political enemies."
      [10]<br>
      <br>
      When challenged, these statements were never supported. Dr. M. V.
      Ball, one of America's few authorities on marihuana, visited the
      border towns in 1922 as a representative of the American Medical
      Association to get a firsthand look at the alleged dangers of
      marihuana to the citizenry. Ball had previously noted that
      whenever cannabis drugs were mentioned in the old scientific
      literature, they were invariably mixed with opium, [11] and he was
      sceptical of the reports he had heard about the drug as far as its
      criminogenic properties were concerned.<br>
      <br>
      During a site visit to a Texas jail, the warden gave an inmate a
      marihuana cigarette to smoke so that Ball could see for himself
      what it did to a man. "To the surprise of the American Prison
      Physician and the jailer who assured me three wiffs would drive
      fellows so wild that they become exceptionally difficult to
      subdue," the smoker remained calm and unperturbed. "There is no
      evidence whatever that I can discover," Ball subsequently
      reported, "to warrant the belief that marihuana smoking is on the
      increase among Americans or that it is prevalent or common, there
      is no evidence worthy of belief that marihuana is a habit forming
      weed or drug, or that its use is increasing among Mexicans in
      Mexico or in America." [12]<br>
      <br>
      Four years later, Dr. W. W. Stockberger, a scientist at the US
      Bureau of Plant Industry, issued a similar statement. "We have had
      correspondence with El Paso and other border cities in Texas for a
      good many years about this situation," he said. However, "the
      reported effects of the drug on Mexicans, making them want to
      clean up the town, do not jibe very well with the effects of
      cannabis, which so far as we have reports, simply causes temporary
      elation, followed by depression and heavy sleep..." [13]<br>
      <br>
      Several years later still, Dr. Walter Bromberg clearly
      demonstrated the carelessness of police officers in attributing
      criminal activity to marihuana. Among ten patients whose cases he
      pulled form the files of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Bromberg
      became especially interested in a J. O., a prisoner "described as
      having confessed how he murdered a friend and put his body in a
      trunk while under the influence of marihuana." Bromberg had J. O.
      brought to his clinic for a detailed interview. The interview
      convinced Bromberg that J. O. was no more a user of marihuana than
      was the commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics. "Although he [J.
      O.] was a psychopathic liar and possibly homosexual," Bromberg
      concluded, "there was no indication in the examination or history
      of the use of any drug. The investigation by the probation
      department failed to indicate use of the drug marihuana." [14]<br>
      <br>
      Yet another example of the way facts were deliberately falsified
      or distorted is a case cited by Dr. Lawrence Kolb. [15] As
      reported by the press, a fight which ended in the death of one of
      the combatants was described as a vicious, marihuana-induced
      murder. The facts, as best Kolb could uncover them, were the two
      men who were drinking heavily smoked one marihuana cigarette
      during the night. Sometime later a quarrel ensued. A fight erupted
      and one of the men was killed. Since marihuana had been used, the
      newspapers attributed the death to marihuana although there is
      little doubt that if any drug was responsible for what happened,
      it was alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      During the 1930s the most sensationalistic of all the crimes to be
      attributed to marihuana's baneful influence was that of the death
      of a Florida family. On October 16, 1933, Victor Licata axed his
      mother, father, two brothers, and a sister to death in their Tampa
      home. The following day the Tampa chief of police declared "war on
      the marihuana traffic here," after reading the investigating
      officer's report that "the weed used as a cigarette had been
      indirectly to blame for the wholesale murder of the Michael Licata
      family..." [16] The link between the crime and marihuana was that
      Victor Licata had been a known user of marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      On October 20, a Tampa Times editorial blared: "Stop This
      Murderous Smoke": "...It may or not be wholly true that the
      pernicious marihuana cigarette is responsible for the murderous
      mania of a Tampa young man in exterminating all the members of his
      family within his reach - but whether or not the poisonous
      mind-wrecking weed is mainly accountable for the tragedy its sale
      should not be and never have been permitted here or elsewhere."
      [17]<br>
      <br>
      Victor Licata was subsequently turned over to a psychiatrist for
      evaluation. The examining psychiatrist found that not only was
      Licata criminally insane, but that he had a history of insanity in
      his family and many of his relatives had been committed to mental
      institutions. In fact, the Tampa police had made an attempt to
      have Licata committed to an institution a year earlier (and a half
      year prior to his using marihuana), but his parents argued that
      they could take better care of him in their own home and he was
      remanded to their custody.<br>
      <br>
      Licata was ultimately sentenced to the Florida state mental
      hospital, where he was again examined and diagnosed as suffering
      from a long-lasting psychosis which was probably responsible for
      his crime. In 1950, Licata hanged himself.<br>
      <br>
      Although there was no evidence to show that Licata had killed his
      family while under the influence of marihuana, Harry Anslinger,
      the commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics, cited the case during
      the hearings on the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 as just one example
      of the dangers of marihuana:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Florida, a 21-year old boy, under the
      influence of this drug killed his parents and his brothers and
      sister. The evidence showed that he had smoked marihuana. [18]<br>
      <br>
      In his book The Murderers, Anslinger once again turned to the
      Licata case:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the most irrational juvenile violence
      and killing that has written a new chapter of shame and tragedy is
      traceable directly to this hemp intoxication... A sixteen-year-old
      [sic] kills his entire family of five in Florida... Every one of
      these crimes has been preceded by the smoking of one or more
      marihuana "reefers". [19]<br>
      <br>
      Anslinger's attitude was typical of other police officers in
      regard to the marihuana issue. Without any evidence to back them
      up, more than a few law enforcement officers adamantly denounce
      marihuana as a "killer drug".<br>
      <br>
      The campaign against the drug picked up especially during the
      Depression as marihuana became yet another issue on which to
      harass Mexican immigrants. The Mexicans were accused of spreading
      the marihuana vice throughout the nation:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the plant is a native to the Torrid Zone,
      its cultivation has been taken up through the United States and it
      is, at the present time, to be found in practically every state in
      the Union - in fact wherever Mexicans are located. So far north
      and east of its natural habitat has the weed spread under
      cultivation, that the New York Narcotics Forces have discovered
      patches of it which were grown within city limits. Again the
      Mexican influence is shown, the supply being found near the
      Pennsylvania Railroad Yards, in the Borough of Queens, where the
      Mexicans are employed. [20]<br>
      <br>
      Labor groups and antiforeigner groups like the American Coalition
      badgered California's legislators to kick the Mexicans out of the
      state on grounds that marihuana was undermining American morality.
      Said C. M. Goethe, a spokesman for the coalition:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marihuana, perhaps now the most insidious of
      our narcotics, is a direct by-product of unrestricted Mexican
      immigration. Easily grown, it has been asserted that it has
      recently been planted between rows in a California penitentiary
      garden. Mexican peddlers have been caught distributing sample
      marihuana cigarets to school children. Bills for our quota against
      Mexico have been blocked mysteriously in every Congress since the
      1924 Quota Act. Our nation has more than enough laborers. [21]<br>
      <br>
      A report from the Missionary Educator Movement in California also
      called attention to the widespread use of marihuana among the
      Mexicans and its alleged connection with lack of morality:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of marihuana is not uncommon in the
      colonies of the lower class of Mexican immigrants. This is a
      native drug made from what is sometimes called the "crazy weed".
      The effects are high exhilaration and intoxication, followed by
      extreme depression and broken nerves. [Police] officers and
      Mexicans both ascribe many of the moral irregularities of Mexicans
      to the effects of marihuana. [22]<br>
      <br>
      Los Angeles's chief of detectives, Joseph F. Taylor, likewise
      hammered away at the crime-inducing effects of marihuana on the
      Mexican:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past we have had officers of this
      department shot and killed by marihuana addicts and have traced
      the act of murder directly to the influence of marihuana, with no
      other motive. [23]<br>
      <br>
      Elsewhere throughout the southwest, where there were heavy
      concentrations of Mexicans, newspapers carried on a vigorous
      campaign against marihuana, aimed ostensibly at the evils of the
      drug but the real object of their indictment was crystal clear:
      "Four men, including a deputy sheriff, were seriously injured last
      night by a marihuana-raged Mexican before the bullets of another
      officer killed him, as he charged this officer with a knife." [24]<br>
      <br>
      In 1933, the arrest of a "dope ring" specializing in marihuana, in
      Longmont, Colorado, prompted the remark from one journalist that
      marihuana was "highly intoxicating and constitutes an ever
      recurring problem where there are Mexicans or Spanish-Americans of
      the lower classes." [25]<br>
      <br>
      Readers were likewise informed that while "appalling in its
      effects on the human mind and body as narcotics, the consumption
      of marihuana appears to be proceeding, virtually unchecked in
      Colorado and other Western states with a large Spanish-American
      population." [26] And if this were not dire warning enough,
      readers were also told that marihuana was "kin to loco weed...
      [and] when mixed with hay causes death to horses!" [27]<br>
      <br>
      In 1931, the California State Narcotic Committee reported that
      marihuana usage was "widespread throughout Southern California
      among the Mexican population there," [28] and cited statistics
      from the city of Los Angeles that marihuana was frequently listed
      as being involved in criminal arrests. On the other hand, although
      "widespread" among the Mexicans, no other city in the state could
      produce comparable statistics. In fact, surveys of crime and
      delinquency among the Mexicans clearly demonstrated that they
      exhibited "delinquent tendencies less than their proportion of the
      population would entitle them to show." [29] When the records of
      one officer who had been adamant in his denunciation of the
      Mexican crime wave were examined, it was discovered that he had
      overestimated the proportion of Mexican arrests by 60 percent!
      [30]<br>
      <br>
      It was not their antisocial behavior nor their use of marihuana
      that made the Mexicans persona non grata. As long as the economy
      had been viable, differences between the Mexicans and Anglos were
      rarely belligerent. When the Depression hit, however, jobs in the
      city disappeared. Anglo workers now began looking to farm labor as
      a means of livelihood. It was then that real competition for jobs
      became an issue.<br>
      <br>
      Relief programs for the unemployed were a related issue. During
      the 1920s, the Mexican population in Los Angeles alone increased
      by 226 percent. [31] By 1930, there were over 97,000 Mexicans in
      the city. When these immigrants lost their jobs and went on
      relief, the business sector, which had once regarded them as an
      exploitable asset, now began to view them as an intolerable
      burden.<br>
      <br>
      To reduce the relief burden, labor groups led by the AFL began
      urging that the Mexicans be shipped back across the border.
      Repatriation became law in the 1930s, and beginning in 1931
      thousands of Mexicans were shipped back across the Rio Grande. The
      cost to repatriate one Mexican to Mexico City was $14.70. An
      average family ran about $71.14, including food and
      transportation. Los Angeles County paid out $77,249.49 to
      repatriate one covey of 6024 Mexicans and figured it had got
      itself a bargain compared to the $424,933.70 it estimated
      charitable relief would have cost had these people remained. [32]<br>
      <br>
      Mexicans who did not wish to return voluntarily were subjected to
      varying forms and degrees of harassment. Many were charged with
      vagrancy. Others were arrested for violation of state marihuana
      laws. When they began to resist efforts to jail and deport them,
      their resistance was attributed to the influence of marijuana and
      these charges lent further weight to the accusation that marijuana
      incited violence.<br>

            The Jazz Era</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <br>
      Around the turn of the century, New Orleans became the Marseilles
      of America, a cosmopolitan port filled with sailors, traders,
      gamblers, prostitutes, thieves, con men, and gangsters of every
      nationality. Although every major city in America had its
      red-light district, New Orleans's Storyville was the best known of
      all the nation's bawdy houses for not only were the customers
      entertained by exotic ladies of the night, they were also treated
      to the strains of a new kind of music called jazz, played
      exclusively in these whorehouses by black musicians.<br>
      <br>
      It was in these bordellos, where music provided the background and
      not the primary focus of attention, that marihuana became an
      integral part of the jazz era. Unlike booze, which dulled and
      incapacitated, marihuana enabled musicians whose job required them
      to play long into the night to forget their exhaustion. Moreover,
      the drug seemed to make their music sound more imaginative and
      unique, at least to those who played and listened to it while
      under its sensorial influence.<br>
      <br>
      Jazz musicians in New Orleans's whorehouses were not the only ones
      smoking marihuana. "Moota", as the drug was known in the city, was
      popular throughout the red-light district, and eventually its
      association with this part of town came to the attention of the
      city's moral crusaders who began to warn of its dangers to the
      community as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      The alarm was first sounded in 1920 by Dr. Oscar Dowling,
      president of Lousiana's State Board of Health, after learning of
      the conviction of a musician who had been caught forging a
      doctor's signature on a prescription to obtain some marihuana. [1]
      Marihuana, he warned Louisiana's governor John M. Parker, is "a
      powerful narcotic, causing exhilaration, intoxication, delirious
      hallucinations, and its subsequent action, drowsiness and
      stupor..." [2] and urged that something be done about the threat
      to the city.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, he dashed off a plea to the surgeon general of
      the United States asking that action be taken to control traffic
      in marijuana on a national level. The surgeon general, Dr. Hugh
      Cummings, replied that he fully agreed with Dowling's assessment
      of the dangers associated with marihuana, but no further action
      was taken. [3] Prohibition Commissioner John F. Kramer likewise
      took no action after receiving a letter from Governor Parker late
      in November 1920 informing him that "two people... [had been]
      killed a few days ago by the smoking of this drug, which seems to
      make them go crazy and wild." [4] While sympathetic, federal
      authorities were far too busy enforcing the ban on morphine to
      think about widening the sphere of proscribed drugs they would
      have to deal with.<br>
      <br>
      It was not long before the newspapers began to realize that the
      marihuana issue could boost circulation, and in 1926 the New
      Orleans Morning Tribune ran a series of articles ballyhooing the
      growing menace of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      Mostly sensationalistic in tone, the headlines blared revelations
      to the effect that "SCHOOL CHILDREN FOUND IN GRIP OF MARIJUANA
      HABIT BY INVESTIGATORS", "WORKMEN OF CITY LURED BY MUGGLES",
      "WELFARE WORKERS ARE POWERLESS TO COPE WITH SINISTER TRAFFIC".<br>
      <br>
      One article claimed that schoolchildren were buying marihuana from
      "unscrupulous peddlers [who] openly sell the drugs to boys of
      tender age who appear on streets under its influence." An
      interview with sixty children, all under age fifteen, revealed
      that all of them knew what marihuana was, where it could be
      published, and that all had used it. The reporter failed to
      mention that the children were Mexican or black, and that
      marihuana was something not very new or out of the ordinary to
      them.<br>
      <br>
      When the marihuana peddlers were reported to be working out of
      saloons and pool halls, large-scale raids were carried out. Most
      of the 150 people caught in the roundup were from the poorer,
      lower classes, and the underworld. Satisfied that at last
      something was being done, Dowling repeated his "warning to
      parents, guardians and teachers of children against this menace."
      [5]<br>
      <br>
      Always on the lookout for moral decay in America, the Women's
      Christian Temperance Union began attacking "soft drink" stands and
      "corner drug stores which have taken the place of the saloon as a
      social meeting place. Here is where marihuana and liquors can
      sometimes be bought." [6]<br>
      <br>
      The alleged marihuana menace in New Orleans was subsequently
      forgotten for about five years. Then, as happened in the
      southwest, an antimarihuana campaign followed in the footsteps of
      the Depression.<br>
      <br>
      To carry on where his colleague Dr. Dowling had left off was a
      hellfire-and-brimstone physician, Dr. A. E. Fossier, who
      resurrected all the old myths including that of the Assassins, to
      ensure that his message would not be lost on his listeners:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time of the Crusades, [the
      Assassins] resorted to every kind of violence. Their utter
      disregard for death and the ruthlessness of their atrocities
      presented a formidable obstacle to the arms of the Christians,
      because under the influence of hashish those fanatics would madly
      rush at their enemies, and ruthlessly massacre everyone within
      their grasp. [7]<br>
      <br>
      Having set the proper mood, Fossier then lashed out at the
      contemporary problem as he saw it:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The underworld was quick to realize that
      marihuana was an ideal drug to quickly cut of the inhibition,
      especially in the light of inadequate personality. Under the
      influence of cannabis indica, these human derelicts are quickly
      subjugated by the will of the master mind. The moral principles or
      training initiated in the mind from infancy deter from committing
      willful theft, murder or rape, but his inhibition from crime may
      be destroyed by the addiction to marihuana. [8]<br>
      <br>
      Dr. F. F. Young, who was in the audience when Fossier delivered
      his views on cannabis, urged a note of caution regarding
      marihuana's link with crime. All the marihuana users he had seen,
      he said, "were defective in the brain and nervous structure before
      they began smoking this weed... these smokers are criminals before
      they become addicted to the weed." [9]<br>
      <br>
      Most law officers dismissed opinions such as Young's without a
      second thought. Eugene Stanley, district attorney for New Orleans,
      for example, relied heavily on Fossier's description of the
      dangers of marihuana in an article he wrote for the American
      Journal of Police Science in 1931:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been the experience of Police and
      Prosecuting Officials in the South, that immediately before the
      commission of many crimes the use of marihuana cigarettes has been
      indulged in by criminals, so as to relieve themselves from the
      natural restraint which might deter them from the commission of
      criminal acts, and to give them the fake courage necessary to
      commit the contemplated crimes. [10]<br>
      <br>
      Stanley then called upon the federal government to help eradicate
      the menace:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inasmuch as the harmful effects of the use of
      marihuana are daily becoming more widely known, and since it has
      been classified as a narcotic by the statutory laws of seventeen
      American States... the United States Government, will
      unquestionably be compelled to adopt a consistent attitude towards
      it, and include it in the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Law, so as to
      give Federal aid to the States in their effort to suppress a
      traffic as deadly and as destructive to society as that in the
      other forms of narcotics now prohibited by this act. [11]<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Frank Gomila, New Orleans's public safety commissioner, felt
      that the main difficulty in eliminating the marihuana vice in the
      city was that the drug's effects were too well known, "especially
      among the negro population. Practically every negro in the city
      can give a recognizable description of the drug's effects." [12]
      According to Gomila, tons of marihuana were processed and sold in
      warehouses and storerooms throughout the city.<br>
      <br>
      To what extent the New Orleans campaign against marihuana was
      racially motivated is difficult to judge. From Gomila's remarks,
      it is clear that he, at least, was motivated by racial prejudice.
      Fossier, perhaps the most influential of the marihuana demagogues,
      also revealed his biases:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debasing and baneful influence of hashish
      and opium is not restricted to individuals but has manifested
      itself in nations and races as well. The dominant race and most
      enlightened countries are alcoholic, whilst the races and nations
      addicted to hemp and opium, some of which once attained to heights
      of culture and civilization, have deteriorated both mentally and
      physically. [13]<br>
      <br>
      Which "races" Fossier had in mind he never stated. He could not
      have meant the Mexicans since by 1930 there were only 991 Mexicans
      in all of New Orleans, a mere two-tenths of 1 per cent of all the
      people in the city. [14] Although Gomila indicted the blacks, 25
      percent of the Negro population across the state had moved north
      by this time. [15] Moreover, arrest figures for the city argued
      against his racial theory of drug-inspired deterioration. In 1928,
      for instance, 75 percent of all those arrested for violation of
      Louisiana's 1924 law against sale or possession of marihuana were
      American-born whites. [16] Nevertheless, blacks had the worst
      criminal records in the city, [17] and Fossier was probably of the
      same mind as Gomila in his indictment of "races... addicted to
      hemp".<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, Fossier, Stanley, and Gomila each enjoyed greater
      credibility in other parts of the country than in his own state or
      city. In 1933, Stanley's article was cited in Utah vs. Navaro as
      proof that marihuana provoked crime and insanity, and in 1937 it
      was again cited during the congressional hearings on federal
      prohibition of marihuana, along with Fossier's article.<br>
      <br>
      In New Orleans itself, and throughout Louisiana, the populace
      could not have cared less. Blacks were no economic threat, most
      whites had no idea what all the fuss was about, and no one paid
      any attention to the WCTU.<br>
      <br>
      <b>New York</b><br>
      <br>
      The next major American city in which marihuana was allegedly
      epidemic was New York. While Mexican immigrants had been pouring
      into the south and midwest, New York's Harlem was the scene of a
      vast influx of Negroes from the West Indies and the southern
      United States. By 1930, New York's black population numbered over
      300,000. More blacks lived in New York than in Birmingham,
      Memphis, and St. Louis combined. [18]<br>
      <br>
      Some of these newcomers eventually became prominent business and
      civic leaders in the community; most found opportunities as
      limited as they had been back home. Unable to better their
      condition, they sought ways of making the intolerable tolerable.
      Some resorted to music with its "charms to soothe the savage
      beast". Others resorted to drugs such as heroin and especially
      marihuana, a drug that was no stranger to the West Indian. On July
      30, 1914, the New York Times had commented that "devotees of
      hashish are now hardly numerous enough here to count." By January
      11, 1923, it proclaimed that marihuana had become the city's
      "latest habit forming drug". Even Scientific American noted an
      increase in the use of marijuana in the city. [19] By 1932, the
      Bureau of Narcotics also felt that it was widespread enough in the
      city to warrant at least passing mention in its annual report on
      "Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs for the Year Ended
      December 1931":<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The abuse of the drug is noted among the
      Latin-American or Spanish-speaking population. The sale of
      cannabis cigarettes occurs to a considerable degree in States
      along the Mexican border and in cities of the Southwest and West,
      as well as in New York, and, in fact, wherever there are
      settlements of Latin Americans. [20]<br>
      <br>
      Most of the marihuana users in the city lived around 110th Street
      and Fifth Avenue, with some spillover into the Broadway area above
      42nd Street. Hundreds of marihuana dens were said to be
      flourishing in Harlem. Some estimated that there were more "tea
      pads" than there had been speakeasies at the height of
      Prohibition.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the drug in Harlem was distributed either through
      independent peddlers or in the "tea pad". By the 1940s, three
      different grades were available. The cheapest, known as
      "sass-fras" was made from American-grown plants and was rather
      weak. Connoisseurs would resort to it only if nothing else were
      available since a lot of it had to be smoked before a good "high"
      could be reached. The second, and more potent variety, was called
      "mezzrole" or "messrole". Moderately priced, it was the favorite
      variety of Harlem's marihuana users. Its country of origin was
      usually somewhere in Central or South America, and it was sold by
      the "Baron Munchausen of jazz", Milton "Mezz" Mezzrow.<br>
      <br>
      Mezzrow was a white musician who called himself a "voluntary
      Negro". He moved to New York from Chicago in 1929 and soon began
      selling marihuana on the streets of Harlem. "Overnight I was the
      most popular man in Harlem," he says in his autobiography, Really
      the Blues. [21]<br>
      <br>
      Mezzrow, in fact, became a fixture in Harlem known as the "White
      Mayor of Harlem", the "Link Between the Races", and the "Man that
      Hipped the World". A new word for marihuana was coined after his
      name - "mezz"; a "mezzrole" was a fat, well-packed marihuana
      cigarette. Eventually, "mezz" transcended its literal meaning and
      came to mean anything genuine or superior in Harlamese.<br>
      <br>
      The third and most potent grade of marihuana came from Africa.
      Called "gungeon", it was the most expensive variety of the three
      and only those whose incomes were above average could afford the
      luxury of smoking such a high grade of drug.<br>
      <br>
      The "tea pads" were rooms or apartments located throughout Harlem.
      These were the speakeasies or social clubs of the marihuana
      aficionado, places where one could relax and talk with strangers
      or friends, over a "reefer", sanctuaries wherein one could escape
      the realities of the outside world for a moment. The ambience was
      always one of peace and tranquillity. Any sign of belligerence was
      squelched immediately; the patron either relaxed or he was
      forcibly ejected.<br>
      <br>
      Each "tea pad" was furnished in line with the clientele it served.
      Usually there was a radio, a record player, or a jukebox to
      entertain the customers. The furniture was comfortable and soft,
      the lighting dim. Burning incense mingled and flirted with
      marihuana smoke. The walls were typically covered with lewd
      pictures, but rarely was sex offered on the premises.<br>
      <br>
      For those who preferred to buy their marihuana from independent
      peddlers on the street, the favorite places to smoke the drug were
      dance halls where both musicians and those who listened to their
      music lit up. Theaters were another popular spot to relax in.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1930s, "reefer" songs were the rage of the jazz world.
      Distinctive and characteristic, it was music written and played by
      black musicians for black audiences. The music had a special
      feeling. It was a tangible medium through which minority
      experiences could be shared by large numbers of people dispersed
      throughout the country. It gave musicians and their audiences a
      sense of solidarity.<br>
      <br>
      Among the tunes that topped the black hit list of the era were
      Louis Armstrong's "Muggles", Cab Calloway's "That Funny Reefer
      Man", Fats Waller's "Viper's Drag", and many more by lesser known
      artists, like "Viper's Moan", "Texas Tea Party", "Smokin'
      Reefers", "Mary Jane", and the "Mary Jane Polka", recorded by
      studios like Columbia, Victor and Brunswick. Even Benny Goodman
      got into the act with "Sweet Marihuana Brown".<br>
      <br>
      In 1932, a musical number "Smokin' Reefers" opened in a review on
      Broadway starring Mr. Belvedere, Clifton Webb. Lyrics from the
      song called marihuana "the stuff that dreams are made of", a line
      later used by Humphrey Bogart in reference to the Maltese Falcon.
      Another line from the show acknowledged marihuana as "the thing
      that white folks are afraid of".<br>
      <br>
      It was not an idle statement. White folks were becoming concerned
      over what marihuana might do to blacks. To emphasize the menace to
      white society, American Mercury carried an article by A. Parry
      entitled "The Menace of Marihuana", in which the author cited an
      incident calculated to arouse white readers. As described by
      Parry, a Negro man was arrested and brought to a New York hospital
      after threatening two white women in the street. His actions were
      attributed to a marihuana-induced dream in which he saw "a bunch
      of naken wimmin, some of 'em in bed, black an' white together,
      like dey was expectin' men." [22]<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between marihuana and jazz reached across the
      Atlantic to England, where it began to alarm the white music
      establishment. On February 22, 1936, the English music periodical
      Melody Maker carried a full-page expose on the use of marihuana by
      British musicians. In an ominous tone, the article reported that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time has come for light to be thrown on an
      astonishing situation which is likely to become a serious menace
      to the jazz world on two continents. This concerns the "reefer" or
      dope habit which is spreading rapidly amongst musicians, and has
      been going on comparatively secretly for a number of years. [23]<br>
      <br>
      The magazine traced the spread of the marihuana habit from Mexico
      to New Orleans and from there to Chicago, quoting as its source a
      clarinettist who, it said, "is now in an insane asylum in
      Louisiana."<br>
      <br>
      According to the Melody Maker, the marihuana traffic in New York
      was run by "a celebrated hot clarinettist" who "has sent supplies
      to coloured musicians touring Europe". [24]<br>
      <br>
      Later that year, when the senior surgeon of the US Public Health
      Department visited the Bureau of Narcotics to obtain information
      about the dangers of marihuana, Commissioner Harry Anslinger
      produced this issue of the Meldoy Maker from the bureau's files to
      prove that the dangers of this drug had not been exaggerated. [25]<br>
      <br>
      Although marihuana had found a home in Harlem, the rest of New
      York's boroughs were relatively free of the drug. The police, in
      fact, had had such little contact with it that they had to be
      given special classes to enable them to recognize it if they came
      across it growing in vacant lots. [26]<br>
      <br>
      After these classes New York's finest discovered an estimated
      three million dollars worth of the drug in Brooklyn and set it
      ablaze. Commissioner Valentine, who supervised the conflagration,
      stated that "this is an extremely dangerous weed... it causes
      temporary insanity. It is a great menace to our young people and
      we'll do everything in our power to stamp it out." [27] Later that
      year, "squads of WPA workers specially trained to recognize
      marihuana" were likewise educated to spot the drug and were
      "placed on duty in the boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and
      Richmond to eradicate the weed from vacant lots.<br>
      <br>
      Elsewhere throughout the country, various newspapers and magazines
      also began heralding the spread of marihuana to other cities.
      Gary, Indiana, Kansas City, Kansas, and Chicago were all allegedly
      infested by the weed. Sensationalistic news items became the order
      of the day. Typical was the following from the October 24, 1926,
      issue of the Chicago Herald-Examiner:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Kansas hasheesh eater thinks he is a white
      elephant. Six months ago they found him strolling along the road,
      a few miles out of Topeka. He was naked, his clothes strewn along
      the highway for a mile. He was not violently insane, but crazy -
      said he was an elephant and acted as much like one as his limited
      physique would let him. Marihuana did it.<br>
      <br>
      In 1925, shortly after Mexico, the country from which most of the
      marihuana that entered the United States originated, officially
      outlawed cultivation of marihuana, the correspondent for the
      Associated Press who covered the story reported that "scientists
      say its effects are perhaps more terrible than those of another
      drug." [29]<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Assassins of America</b><br>
      <br>
      For more than a century after its publication, Joseph von
      Hammer-Pugstall's book on the Assassins remained the standard
      reference on the murderous gang of cutthroats who allegedly used
      hashish before going out on their errands of mayhem. During the
      early twentieth century, anyone calling for the prohibition of
      marihuana merely had to cite the connection between hashish and
      the Assassins to get across the point that marihuana - the
      American counterpart of hashish - was capable of inciting
      uncontrollable violence.<br>
      <br>
      One of the earliest American writers to arouse the public
      concerning the perils of marihuana was a physician, Dr. Victor
      Robinson. Robinson's sensationalistic account of the Assassins,
      published in the 1912 Medical Review of Reviews, set the tone for
      all subsequent treatments of the subject in the American press:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a devoted One was selected to commit
      murder, he was first stupefied with hasheesh, and while in this
      state was brought into the magnificent gardens of the sheikh. All
      the sensual and stimulating pleasures of the erotic Orient
      surrounded the excited youth, and exalted by the delicious opiate
      he had taken, the hot-blooded fanatic felt that the gates of
      heaven were already ajar, and heard them swing open on their
      golden hinges. When the effect of the drug disappeared and the
      Devoted One was reduced to his normal condition, he was informed
      that through the generosity of his superior he had been permitted
      to foretaste the delights of paradise. The Devoted One believed
      this readily enough - disciples are always credulous - and
      therefore was eager to die or to kill at a word from his master.
      From these hasheesh-eaters, the Arabian name of which is
      hashashin, was derived the term "assassin". [30]<br>
      <br>
      In this lurid account, Robinson is generally true to Marco Polo's
      original story. The Assassins do not kill while under the
      influence of hashish but only after they have savored the delights
      of paradise revealed to them by the drug. The murders they commit
      are not the acts of frenzied psychotic butchers, but the cool,
      calculating, premeditated deeds of a loyal and devoted gang of
      trained killers.<br>
      <br>
      Fifteen years later, Robert Kingman further developed the theme of
      the hashish-crazed killer for readers of the Medical Journal and
      Record. Although not suggesting that the Assassins killed while
      under the influence of hashish, Kingman wrote that the drug was
      given to assuage any doubts the killer might have concerning the
      morality of his mission. [31]<br>
      <br>
      By the 1930s, however, hashish itself had become the instigator of
      the Assassins' murders:<br>
      <br>
      Dr. A. E. Fossier, New Orleans Medical and Surgical Journal
      (1931): "Under the influence of hashish those fanatics would madly
      rush at their enemies, and ruthlessly massacre every one within
      their grasp." [32]<br>
      <br>
      William Wolf, Popular Science magazine (1936):<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..."assassin" has two explanations, but either
      demonstrates the menace of Indian hemp. According to one version,
      members of a band of Persian terrorists committed their worst
      atrocities while under the influence of hashish. In the other
      version, Saracens who opposed the Crusaders were said to employ
      the services of hashish addicts to secure secret murders of the
      leaders of the Crusades. In both versions, the murderers were
      known as "haschischin". [33]<br>
      <br>
      In 1937, readers of American Magazine were aroused by yet another
      hysteria-rousing version, this time written by the commissioner of
      the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Harry Anslinger:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year 1090, there was founded in Persia
      the religious and military order of the Assassins, whose history
      is one of cruelty, barbarity, and murder, and for good reason. The
      members were confirmed users of hashish, or marihuana, and it is
      from the Arabs, "hashashin" that we have the English word
      "assassin". [34]<br>
      <br>
      The more often the story of the Assassins was told, the more
      ludicrous it became. The image of the demented, knife-wielding,
      half-crazed hashish user running senseless through the streets,
      slashing at anyone unfortunate enough to cross his path, became
      part of the American nightmare of lawlessness. As a nation raised
      on violence, Americans soaked up these tales of mayhem like a
      sponge. Mutation, dismemberment, uncontrollable passion,
      fanaticism - in short, anything that evoked terror, came to be
      associated with hashish through the embellishment of the Assassin
      story.<br>
      <br>
      Although frequently denounced in the Western world as an inciter
      of violence, there is, however, virtually no mention of disorderly
      conduct on the part of hashish users in any Arab writings for the
      past thousand years. Modern scholars have concluded that the
      identification of hashish as the mysterious potion referred to by
      Marco Polo cannot be proven. [35] Nor is there any historical
      basis between the connection between hashish and the murderous
      activities of the Assassins. The Assassins may have used hashish,
      but not before they took anyone's life. To do so would have
      jeapardized their mission.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, hashish, murder, and treachery became inextricably
      interwoven in cannabis folklore. For example, even as late as
      1962, although he clearly acknowledged that "we do not know of any
      objective study showing a direct or causative relationship between
      marihuana and violent crime in a significant number of cases,"
      Victor Vogel, chief medical officer of the Narcotics Treatment
      Center in Lexington, Kentucky, still offered the etymological
      premise that the words "assassin" and "hashish" are connected to
      argue in favor of such a relationship:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any remarks concerning the relationship of
      marihuana to crime should be prefaced with the note that marihuana
      is a form of hashish, a most dangerous drug in its unadulterated
      form. We get the word assassin from the Italian assassina which in
      turn is derived from the Arabic Hashshashin, meaning one who uses
      hashish; this etymology reflects rather accurately the cultural
      pedigree of the drug, which has been known for centuries to
      release impulses toward violence. [36]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marihuana and the Law</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Between 1926 and 1936, eight major cases came before state courts
      in which marihuana was an issue. [37] The decisions rendered in
      these cases are noteworthy for the fact that typically the
      judgments relied on mythology and opinion rather than on any
      scientific evidence of the dangers of marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      In 1931, for example, a Louisiana court quoted the story of the
      Assassins to support its finding that marihuana posed a threat to
      the community (State vs. Bonoa). [38] In a 1933 decision in the
      Utah courts (State vs. Navarro), an article by a Wichita detective
      was cited as evidence for the criminogenic properties of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      "The courts, like the legislatures," two University of Virginia
      law professors have recently concluded in reference to these
      decisions, "assumed marihuana caused crime and insanity, and
      assumed that had popular opinion crystallized on the question it
      would have favored suppression of a drug with such evil effects."
      [39]<br>
      <br>
      What these decisions also show was that the lurid sensationalistic
      copy of the day was read by the nation's lawmakers and the courts,
      and that these carried a certain amount of weight insofar as
      general policy toward marijuana was concerned.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seducing the Young</b><br>
      <br>
      By far the most emotional issue surrounding marihuana was the
      contention that schoolchildren were being seduced into using it by
      drug pushers who, more often than not, were identified as
      foreigners, Mexicans, or blacks.<br>
      <br>
      Nowhere was the seduction issue ballyhooed more loudly than in New
      Orleans where the Item and the Morning Tribune ran a series of
      sensationalistic articles describing marihuana's infiltration into
      the city's schools. According to Dr. Frank Gomilla, commissioner
      of public safety for the city, the marihuana wholesalers in New
      Orleans were "made up mostly of Mexicans, Italians,
      Spanish-Americans and drifters from ships." [40] The inference was
      obviously that American children were being seduced by foreigners.<br>
      <br>
      Other newspapers were soon running similar stories. The September
      10, 1929, issue of the Tulsa Tribune described the arrest of a
      Mexican "hot-tamale salesman" who, the paper claimed, had been
      selling marihuana to girls and boys in school. Two years later, a
      Tulsa attorney got so caught up in the marihuana scare that, in
      his opinion, "the general use of this drug among young people is
      making it imperative that the state or the government of the
      United States take immediate steps to cope with this deadly drug,
      the dope which is used by murderers." [41]<br>
      <br>
      As early as 1928, the Kansas City Star had begun publishing
      reports of boys and girls using marihuana. By 1933, Detective L.
      E. Bowery of the Wichita Police Department claimed that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no denial can be made of the fact that
      marihuana smoking is at present a common practice among the young
      people of the city, and that it is constantly becoming more
      prevalent. Due to its relatively recent introduction into this
      territory, habitual smoking is at present almost exclusively
      confined to young persons among the white people. It is
      interesting to note that the habit has recently spread among the
      negroes and that they are known to be trafficking in it. [42]<br>
      <br>
      In Gary, Indiana, 25 percent of the Mexican population were said
      to be smoking marihuana, and of these, many were said to be
      earning their livings by peddling the drug. [43]<br>
      <br>
      On June 22, 1929, the Chicago Examiner reported on the
      antimarihuana crusade of the local United States attorney, who had
      moved against storehouses in the city from which marihuana was
      being "sold to school pupils and other youthful thrillseekers." Of
      the nine men arrested, "most of them [were] Mexicans."<br>
      <br>
      The Chicago Tribune also took up the issue. The marihuana habit,
      it said on June 3, 1927, had been introduced into the city by
      Mexicans and "has become widespread among American youths... even
      among school children."<br>
      <br>
      In September 1934, a New York Times correspondent described the
      widespread use of marihuana in Colorado and quoted "some
      authorities" to the effect that "it is being peddled to school
      children".<br>
      <br>
      In 1935, the New York Times quoted a Sacramento crusader who
      claimed that "Mexican peddlers have been caught distributing
      sample marihuana cigarettes to school children."<br>
      <br>
      In 1936, in an article on marihuana ominously prefaced: "Public
      Health Enemy No. 7." author C. M. Weber reviewed the alleged
      dangers of the drug to Americans and repeated previous news
      reports that about two hundred New Orleans school children were
      "demand[ing] their reefers". [44]<br>
      <br>
      In Detroit, an "American woman" was said to be peddling marihuana
      for local Mexicans. "She gives the reefers to her own children to
      sell to their schoolmates." [45]<br>
      <br>
      "A few years ago," declared an anonymous writer, "the startling
      discovery was made in St. Louis that scores of youngsters of high
      school age had been victims of the weed." Quoting an unnamed
      marihuana peddler, the writer added, "the worst thing about that
      loco weed is the way these kids go for them. Most of them, boys
      and girls, are just punks and when they get high on the stuff you
      can write your own ticket." The writer added that one of the
      effects of marihuana is that it unleashes uncontrollable passions
      in the young, backing this up with what to him was a horrible turn
      of events. "A boy and a girl who had lost their senses so
      completely after smoking marihuana," he said, actually "eloped and
      were married"! [46]<br>
      <br>
      Feeling that the elopement may not have been shocking enough, the
      writer dropped his final bombshell: "While it cannot be proved,
      the increasing number of suicides by jumping from tall buildings
      may have in fact resulted from the use of the drug. Once started,
      an addict may be led to commit all of the previously mentioned
      crimes and the end may be in the gallows, as has been so often the
      case in recent years. [47]<br>
      <br>
      In Richmond, Virginia, readers of the Times-Dispatch were told
      that "school children were being induced to become addicts of
      marihuana cigarettes and that the weed was being cultivated in and
      near the city on a wide scale... A youth who said he was a former
      addict of the drug testified before the Council that inhalation of
      one of the cigarettes would produce a 'cheap drunk' of several
      days duration." [48]<br>
      <br>
      In Here's to Crime, author Courtney R. Cooper, who collaborated
      with Anslinger on at least one antimarihuana article, charged that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is only one end for the confirmed
      marihuana smoker, and that is insanity. Therefore, it might be of
      interest to know that one of the main selling places of marihuana
      in the United States is in the vicinity of high schools...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of marihuana has spread within the last
      few years so rapidly as to constitute a menace which should
      receive the attention of every thinking parent in America.<br>
      <br>
      After describing the dangers of marihuana, Cooper next indicted
      every apartment building owner in the United States: "Apartments
      are run by ghoul-minded women; in such apartments high school
      students gather on the promise that reefer-smoking will put music
      in their souls and a release from all moral restrain; nothing is
      said about eventual insanity."<br>
      <br>
      Cooper then introduced the sexual promiscuity theme:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then suddenly a girl wanted to dance.
      Immediately everyone wanted to dance... The movements were of
      sensuosity. After a time, girls began to pull off their clothes.
      Men weaved naked over them; soon the entire room was one of the
      wildest sexuality. Ordinary intercourse and several forms of
      perversion were going on at once, girl to girl, man to man, woman
      to woman.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of the great reasons why girls who
      are little more than children are now being placed in whorehouses
      by members of prostitution syndicates, why young boys of otherwise
      straight habits suddenly join up with dangerous gangs, why there
      are constantly more murders committed by youth... [49]<br>
      <br>
      It was gutsy stuff. Although he meant to scare readers away from
      marihuana, Cooper's prose probably pricked the curious to try the
      drug for themselves more than it frightened anyone.<br>
      <br>
      An article by Dr. Arthur La Roe, president of the American
      Narcotic Defense Association, in the American Weekly (1940), is
      deserving of recognition as the most ludicrous of the marihuana
      seduction literature. The article, entitled "Growth of the
      Marihuana Habit Among Our Youth", shows a posed photograph of a
      "slick", as La Roe calls him, loitering outside a school waiting
      for the students to leave. This "slick" is described as "dapper"
      and "suave" and is shown wearing a sport jacket and tie. He is,
      however, only a decoy for the seedy pusher. It is his job to lure
      students to the pusher who is waiting at a table somewhere for his
      naive prey. Once seated at the table, the "slick" and the pusher
      "then smoke the reefers; inhalation of the smoke in the room
      'pre-conditions' the 'guests' so that moral resistance is
      lowered." [50]<br>
      <br>
      Another popular example of the unsuspecting youth and diabolical
      pusher motifs appeared in On the Trail of Marihuana, the Weed of
      Madness, a short, hysterical antimarihuana polemic written by
      Earle Albert Rowell and his son Robert. According to this father
      and son duo, "one of the methods used in making marihuana users is
      for the peddler, with an unlighted marihuana cigarette in his
      hand, to step up to a high-school boy or girl who is smoking a
      tobacco cigarette and say, 'Give me a light, I haven't a match.'"<br>
      <br>
      Having caught the unsuspecting student's attention, the pusher
      then makes his pitch: "Forthwith the peddler extends a hand filled
      with marihuana, and says persuasively; 'Try one of my cigarettes.
      They are new special kind; got a real kick in 'em. You'll like
      'em; take two or three." [51]<br>
      <br>
      In all fairness to the Rowells, they were not racially motivated
      when they spoke out against marihuana. Rowell senior was an active
      campaigner against all vices. He had started out as northwestern
      organizer and lecturer for the White Cross National Anti-Narcotics
      Society and later took up the post of state organizer and lecturer
      for the California branch of the White Cross. While vehemently an
      antinarcotics group, the White Cross differed from most other
      institutions, however, in that it supported local treatment of
      addicts in narcotic clinics rather than sending them to prison The
      group was rather influential during the 1920s and 1930s, but it
      disappeared after World War II.<br>
      <br>
      It was while he worked for the White Cross that Rowell paraded up
      and down the southwest lecturing against marihuana. But although
      he claimed that he had been "on the trail of marihuana" since
      1925, and had given more than 4000 lectures in forty states, and
      had personally uprooted and burned many thriving marihuana fields,
      in an earlier book titled Battling the Wolves of Society, which
      was published in 1929, Rowell included only one paragraph on
      marihuana and most of that was a quote from De Quincey's
      Confessions of an Opium Eater. [52]<br>
      <br>
      While Rowell may have gotten carried away on the extent of his
      evangelistic stumping throughout the southwest, he and those like
      him who crusaded against marihuana were no doubt responsible for
      the mounting pressure to place legal restrictions on the drug.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marihuana as a Plot Device</b><br>
      <br>
      Newspapers and news magazines were not the only media to exploit
      and sensationalize the marihuana issue. Having exhausted the drug
      diaries and confessions of the hashish user genre that had been so
      Popular among the French, inventive novelists and pulp magazine
      writers saw that they could still use marihuana to sell their
      works.<br>
      <br>
      In 1900, James Lane Allen's The Reign of Law dealt with the
      history of the Kentucky hemp fields, but the book had nothing to
      say about marihuana. The first of the modem marihuana horror
      stories appeared in 1915, in what in retrospect is an amusing
      story entitled "The Poison Ship," published in Harper's Magazine.
      The author, Morgan Robertson, had heard that the hemp plant had
      narcotic-like effects when smoked, but he knew little else. To
      him, all hemp was Cannabis sativa and in story he has "burning
      jute (New Zealand hemp)" giving "off the soporific fumes of
      hashish" which "produces drowsiness, then wild dreams and waking
      ecstasy."<br>
      <br>
      In Robertson's imaginative story, a passenger ship carrying jute
      in its hold catches fire and the fumes overwhelm and intoxicate
      the passengers. First, they become excited and talkative, but soon
      they thrown into a stupefying frenzy. The crew is likewise
      rendered senseless and unable to function. Most of those on board
      perish, but a few are rescued.<br>
      <br>
      A 1917 thriller by Carl Moore appeared in Spicy-Adventure Stories
      and is just as ridiculous. Set in London, it has Scotland Yard
      detective surreptitiously getting a murder suspect to take some
      hashish. Overcome by the drug, the suspect loses consciousness,
      convulses, and subsequently reenacts the crime he has been
      arrested for (rape and murder). Convicted by the evidence, he is
      later hanged.<br>
      <br>
      Sax Rohmer, the well-known author of the Fu Manchu mysteries, also
      used hashish to heighten the excitement of Dope (1919), one of
      books in which the Chinese (but not Fu Manchu) are the villains.
      Although about opium and its effects, Rohmer intimates that
      hashish is far more evil. In a scene in which Mrs. Sin is
      entertaining Mollie, Mollie says she just read Hector France's
      Musk Hashish, and Blood (published in 1900):<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hashish!" said Mrs. Sin, and laughed harshly.
      "One night you shall eat the hashish, and then -"<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh really? Is that a promise?" asked Morne
      eagerly.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no," answered Mrs. Sin. "It is a threat!"
      [53]<br>
      <br>
      Other writers also tried to add mystery to their characters by
      having them use hashish. Carl Van Vechten's Peter Whiffle (1925)
      was an avid experimenter with mind-expanding drugs, among which
      was hashish. Whiffle had been told that hashish causes
      uncontrollable laughter but his reaction is only one of melancholy
      and despair. The experience so upsets him that his "nerves
      revolved under the strain" and he is forced to remain in bed for
      four days to recover.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas Burke's Tai Fu and Pansy Greers presents another picture of
      hashish. [54] Capitalizing on the anti-Chinese sentiment in
      Britain so well exploited by Sax Rohmer, Burke's Tai Fu is
      depicted as a repulsive Chinese denizen of London's underworld who
      has many vices, among which is hashish.<br>
      <br>
      Algernon Blackwood's A Psychic Invasion gives hashish black magic
      veneer. In this story, hashish is a drug which "has partially
      opened another world to you by increasing your rate of psychical
      vibration, and thus rendering you abnormally sensitive" to the
      spirit world, [55] the main character informs his client who has
      come to him because he has become disturbed by strange things that
      go bump in the night. He has been sensitized to these poltergeists
      as a result of taking hashish.<br>
      <br>
      The Dope Adventures of David Dare marks the high or low point in
      this genre. [56] Written by Earle Albert Rowell, the novel is set
      in middle America amid a quintessential
      all-American-boy-next-door, apple-pie mom-and-motherhood setting.
      David Dare exposes the marihuana menace in his hometown and is
      rewarded by being made an honorary police officer.<br>
      <br>
      While the impact of these naive stories was less than minimal,
      they show that during the early decades of the nineteenth century
      familiarity with marihuana, even on the part of those who wrote
      about the drug, was negligible and the attitudes toward the drug
      were all negative.<br>
      <br>
      The movies also capitalized on the marihuana-evil sentiment. In
      1927 Notch Number One appeared on the silver screen starring Ben
      Wilson as a ranch foreman intent on keeping his cowhands from
      falling victim to marihuana's heinous spell. As the audience
      watched the drama unfold, Wilson holds a marihuana cigarette out
      for a headstrong cow-puncher to inspect, cautioning him that he is
      holding "a devilish narcotic" in his hand, which if smoked, will
      send him to "the bughouse, loco....... [and will make him] want to
      raise H - - - in general." The ranchhand does not take the
      fatherly advice, however, and tries it out - and sure enough, he
      goes berserk. [57]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Janey Canuck</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Across the Forty-ninth Parallel in the Dominion of Canada,
      marihuana was virtually unknown, although hemp was a fiber crop
      across the country until the days of the Depression. Up until
      1908, in fact, there were no national restrictions against any
      drugs. But an economic crisis and anti-Chinese sentiment in the
      province of British Columbia on the west coast stirred racist
      fires. Stories of white women and children being lured into opium
      dens, rumors of huge profits in opium, and moral indignation over
      drug abuse in general, eventually caused Deputy Minister of Labor
      (who would later become Prime Minister) William Lyon Mackenzie
      King to recommend to the House of Commons suppression of opium
      traffic in Canada. There was little opposition to such a proposal,
      and in 1908 it became illegal in Canada to import, manufacture,
      sell, or possess for sale opiates for nonmedical use. As in the
      United States, however, possession for personal use was not
      outlawed since Canadians were not as yet ready to make criminals
      out of drug users.<br>
      <br>
      In 1908, Canada also passed the Patent and Proprietary Medicine
      Act. Like the American Pure Food and Drug Law of 1906, the
      Canadian law required the labeling of certain ingredients in
      medicines. Although the presence of opiates had to be indicated,
      the amount of alcohol limited, and cocaine banned outright, no
      restrictions were placed on cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      In 1909, Canada participated in the international conference on
      opium in Shanghai. As a result of his previous activities in the
      outlawing of opiate traffic in Canada, Mackenzie King was included
      in the Canadian delegation. The fact that Canada did not support
      the American and Italian initiatives to include cannabis in the
      list of proscribed drugs being considered by the delegates
      likewise indicates how little importance Canada attached to
      marihuana during these early years. In 1911, Canada passed the
      Opium and Drug Act. The new law broadened the ban against opium by
      adding morphine, cocaine, and their derivatives to the list of
      proscribed drugs. Again, cannabis was not mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      Marihuana continued to be ignored in the 1910s and would have
      remained so in the 1920s had it not been for a Canadian crusading
      feminist who wrote under the pen name of "Janey Canuck".<br>
      <br>
      Janey's real name was Mrs. Emily F. Murphy. She was a tough-minded
      woman who had the persistence and aggressiveness to overcome the
      barriers placed against women in her time. As a feminist she
      fought for the right for women to be tried in court by other women
      and before female judges, and for her efforts, in 1916 she was
      appointed the first woman judge in the British Empire.<br>
      <br>
      In 1920, the Canadian government indicated that it was once again
      about to amend its drug laws, and Maclean's magazine asked Judge
      Murphy if she would be willing to write some pieces on the drug
      problem in Canada. Murphy was more than willing.<br>
      <br>
      Although sincerely interested in helping many of those who
      appeared before her, Murphy had no sympathy for drug sellers or
      users. Writing under the name of "Janey Canuck," her indictment of
      these "dregs of humanity," as she called them, was pure racism.
      These people, she told her readers, were mostly nonwhite (Chinese
      and Negroes) and non-Christians, who, next to drugs, craved
      nothing better than the seduction of Canadian women. Behind these
      outcasts, she maintained, was an international conspiracy of
      yellow and black drug pushers whose ultimate goal was the
      domination of the "bright-browed races of the world." Among her
      recommendations for dealing with these drug fiends were long
      prison sentences, whippings, and deportations if the offenders
      were aliens.<br>
      <br>
      In anything, Janey was consistent. She was against all drugs
      associated with minorities, even marihuana, a drug that was
      totally unknown in Canada. Quoting American authorities, she said
      that marihuana drove its users completely insane: "The addict
      loses all sense of moral responsibility. Addicts to this drug,
      while under its influence, are immune to pain.... While in this
      condition they become raving maniacs and are liable to kill or
      indulge in any form of violence to other persons, using the most
      savage methods of cruelty without, as said before, any sense of
      moral responsibility." [58]<br>
      <br>
      So sensational and popular were Janey's writings on the drug evil
      in Canada that they were eventually collected into a book, The
      Black Candle (1922). More significantly, Janey single-handedly
      succeeded in altering Canadian views of drugs and drug users.
      Hitherto, drug users had been merely been regarded as moral
      degenerates. After Janey's expose, they became public enemies,
      bent on the destruction of the White race. And whereas Canadians
      had never heard of marihuana before Murphy, after reading about
      marihuana in Maclean's and The Black Candle, Canadian lawmakers
      were quick to add it to the list of regulated substances in the
      Opium and Narcotics Drug Act of 1929.<br>
      <br>
      According to a 1934 editorial in the Canadian Medical Association
      Journal, the first indication that marihuana had entered the
      country occurred in 1931. By 1932, the drug had worked its way to
      Ottawa, Ontario, the nation's capital. In Windsor, across the
      border from Detroit, "it was learned that some thirty young people
      in that city were addicted to marihuana. These cigarettes," the
      editorial noted, "were peddled in dance halls" and were being
      brought in from across the border in Detroit. By 1933, the drug
      had spread to Montreal, and by 1934 it had even worked its way to
      Toronto "the Good [city]." In assessing marihuana's inroads into
      Canada, the editorial warned that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the menace is a serious one, for the experience
      of all countries is that the hashish habit has a special appeal to
      the young, not, necessarily, that they crave for the drug, at
      least at first, but they use it with the desire to appear "smart"
      Then comes the urge for more, and a dangerous habit is created.
      [59]<br>
      <br>
      There were also reports on the international scene of marihuana's
      inroads into Canada. In 1933, the Advisory Committee on Traffic in
      Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs of the League of Nations noted in
      its annual report that "a smuggling trade in cigarettes containing
      Indian hemp ('marijuana' cigarettes) appears to have sprung up
      between the USA, where it grows as a wild plant freely, and
      Canada." [60]<br>
      <br>
      Despite Janey Canuck's dire warnings and the marihuana "menace"
      uncovered by the Canadian Medical Association, and League of
      Nations, there were only twenty-five convictions in Canada for
      marihuana possession between 1930 and 1946. [61] The Royal
      Canadian Mounted Police (Canada's counterpart to the FBI), note
      that "prior to 1962, isolated cases of cannabis use were
      encountered, but generally in connection with entertainers and
      visitors from the United States. Although marihuana arrests were
      effected sporadically in the middle 40s, its use on a more
      frequent basis appeared in Montreal only in 1962, in Toronto in
      1963 and in Vancouver in 1965." [62]<br>
      <br>
      Although cannabis could no longer be legally grown in Canada
      without a permit after 1938, it was still dispensed in pharmacies
      as an over-the-counter medicinal until 1939 and was used in
      prescriptions until 1954. [63]<br>
      <br>
      In 1961, cannabis was included in the Narcotic Control Act and
      stringent penalties were applied for possession. In 1970, the law
      was amended and sentences were considerably softened. In 1972,
      revisions in the Canadian Criminal Code fixed the penalty for
      simple possession at a minimal fine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The International Debate</b><br>
      <br>
      The United States was not the only country to become overly
      concerned with marihuana during the early decades of the twentieth
      century. The government of South Africa was also concerned lest
      drugs turn its black population into an unruly mob. Dagga was a
      popular intoxicant with natives throughout Africa and the
      government of South Africa felt that it posed a tangible danger to
      the white minority. Accordingly, when the Advisory Committee of
      the League of Nations met in 1923, the South African delegation
      urged that the League classify cannabis as a habit-forming
      narcotic and recommended that international traffic in the drug be
      brought under the control of The Hague convention.<br>
      <br>
      Anxious that such a measure might affect England's cannabis
      revenues in India, the British delegate managed to block adoption
      of such a measure by urging that more information be obtained on
      such a motion and that the issue be taken up again at the next
      meeting of the Second Geneva Opium Conference scheduled for 1925.<br>
      <br>
      Owing to some manoeuvring by England, the matter was not even
      included in the agenda in 1925, but nevertheless the issue was
      introduced by M. E. Guindry, who headed the Egyptian delegation.
      Like the South African government, Egypt was also concerned about
      the social impact of cannabis on its people.<br>
      <br>
      Steven Porter, the head of the American delegation, likewise spoke
      on behalf of a resolution to ban international traffic in
      cannabis, but his support was given mainly in the spirit of
      "reciprocity," as he put it, for the support the other nations had
      given the United States in its crusade against opium. If the
      United States had a cannabis problem, Porter was not aware of it.<br>
      <br>
      Next came the turn of countries opposed to such a policy. The
      delegation from India pointed out that cannabis held a unique
      place in Indian life and emphasized that "there are social and
      religious customs which naturally have to be considered, and there
      is doubt whether the total prohibition of drugs easily prepared
      from a wild-growing plant could in practice be made effective."
      [64]<br>
      <br>
      Sir Malcolm Delevigne took a different tack. He protested that the
      delegates had not been prepared for any discussion regarding
      cannabis and consequently they had not been given any instructions
      on how to vote on such an issue by their governments.<br>
      <br>
      Bourgeois, the French delegate, concurred with Delevigne on the
      inappropriateness of adopting such a measure without first having
      time to consider it in detail. Furthermore, he contended that
      while it might be possible to outlaw the use of cannabis in
      France, it would be impossible to do so in the French Congo where
      there were "several tribes of savages and even cannibals among
      whom the habit is very prevalent. It would therefore be
      hypocritical on my part," he told the gathering, "to sign a
      Convention laying down strict measures in this respect." [65]<br>
      <br>
      The issue was ultimately referred to a subcommittee which later
      reported certain major problems associated with placing sanctions
      on cannabis: "It should ... be remembered that all derivatives of
      hemp are capable of providing, in addition to products injurious
      to public health, fibers which can be used in industry (cloth,
      cordage, matting, etc.) and that the oil seeds may also be
      employed for domestic purposes. That being the case, it would not
      appear to be any easy matter to limit the amount grown." [66]<br>
      <br>
      After due consideration was given to these various problems, a
      recommendation was offered whereby export of cannabis resin would
      be prohibited to any country unless the recipient signed a special
      import certificate stating that such importation was to be used
      exclusively for medical or scientific purposes.<br>
      <br>
      The recommendation was voted on and approved but the proposal was
      not signed by all the delegate nations, thereby making
      international control unworkable. Among the nations not signing
      the proposal were the United States and Egypt, which had brought
      the problem up in the first place.<br>

      <br>
      On August 12, 1930, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics was created as
      an independent unit in the Treasury Department and Harry J.
      Anslinger was appointed the bureau's first commissioner of
      narcotics by President Hoover.<br>
      <br>
      During its earliest years, the bureau's primary concern was
      violation of the Harrison Act. Although mounting attention was
      being directed at the marihuana issue in the southwest, Anslinger
      felt that the problem was relatively negligible. The only people
      using marihuana to any great extent were the Mexicans and it was
      only from local law enforcement officers that the bureau heard any
      complaints. Policing the traffic in narcotics left little time to
      worry about the use of marihuana by some Mexicans. Yet by 1937
      Anslinger was able to persuade Congress to adopt draconian federal
      antimarihuana legislation. There have been many explanations for
      this dramatic turn of events, none of them satisfactory. But one
      thing is certain. Without Harry Anslinger, the marihuana maelstrom
      might have been just a passing breeze.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Harry J. Anslinger</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although Anslinger has been accused of single-handedly
      manufacturing the marihuana problem in the United States, much of
      what he did was the result of a sincere conviction that drugs such
      as marihuana did pose a danger to the country. Few people ever
      doubted his sincerity or his devotion to the office of
      commissioner of narcotics when he spoke out against drugs. He was,
      however, not above exploiting controversial issues to achieve what
      he felt was in the best interest of the American people and the
      bureau which he headed.<br>
      <br>
      When Anslinger assumed the position of Bureau of Narcotics chief,
      he was already a hard-liner on drug abuse. For example, in dealing
      with violation of the Prohibition Act which outlawed only the
      sale, manufacture, and transportation of liquor for sale, but not
      its purchase, Anslinger contended that if it were up to him, the
      law would be changed so that buyers would also be subject to
      punishment. And no small punishment at that. For a first-time
      conviction he thought that a jail term of not less than six months
      and a fine of not less than $1000 was appropriate. A second
      violation, he felt, deserved imprisonment for two to five years
      and a fine of $5000 to $50,000.<br>
      <br>
      Had Anslinger had his way there might have been many more
      Americans in jail. It was Anslinger's opinion, an opinion that he
      later carried over to his new post as commissioner of the Bureau
      of Narcotics, that the only way to force the public to obey the
      liquor and drug laws was to impose stiff penalties on those who
      broke these laws. While his suggestions for heavy fines and
      imprisonment were never endorsed in the case of buyers of
      alcoholic beverages, they were accepted in dealing with violation
      of the narcotics and later the marihuana laws which did make
      consumers liable for their actions.<br>
      <br>
      Anslinger developed this hard-line attitude toward drug users
      during his youth and early career in the Treasury Department. Born
      in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 1892, he spent his early years
      attending school and working summers for the Pennsylvania Railroad
      as an assistant to the railway police. He says that he first
      became alerted to the evils of narcotics when a friend of his, a
      choirboy, "died from smoking opium." [1]<br>
      <br>
      In 1917, after the United States entered World War I, Anslinger
      became an ordinance officer in the War Department supervising
      government contracts. Unhappy with this domestic duty, he applied
      to the State Department for overseas assignment and was sent to
      Holland as attaché in the American legation.<br>
      <br>
      After the war, he remained in the foreign service until 1926,
      serving as consul in Hamburg, Germany; La Guaira, Venezuela; and
      Nassau, Bahamas. It was as consul in this latter post that the
      Treasury Department first took notice of him for it was through
      his efforts that England agreed to keep a fleet of rumrunners from
      heading out to the high seas and eventually carrying their cargoes
      to the United States. For helping to plug this hole in the
      smuggling side of Prohibition, he was appointed to the Treasury
      Department's Prohibition Unit. Three years later, in 1929, he
      became assistant commissioner of Prohibition.<br>
      <br>
      In 1930, Anslinger's career was given a major boost as a result of
      a scandal that toppled many of the bureau's key figures. A number
      of agents attached to the New York office of the Narcotics
      Division of the Prohibition Bureau had been caught padding their
      arrest records to make themselves look better, and all hell broke
      loose. A grand jury investigation found that these agents had been
      falsifying arrest records on orders from Assistant Deputy
      Commissioner William Blanchard. Blanchard in turn incriminated
      Deputy Commissioner L. G. Nutt. It was the grand jury's finding
      that these actions had been carried out to hide a dismal arrest
      record which it attributed to probable collusion between federal
      narcotics agents and drug distributors.<br>
      <br>
      Not long thereafter, Congress stripped control over narcotics from
      the scandal-torn Prohibition Unit and created an entirely new
      department, the Bureau of Narcotics, under the auspices of the
      Treasury Department with Harry Anslinger as its first
      commissioner.<br>
      <br>
      When Anslinger took command of the Bureau of Narcotics, he
      inherited a philosophy of law enforcement regarding narcotics that
      he could willingly endorse, namely that "strong laws, good
      enforcement , [and] stiff sentences" were the bureau's best
      weapons in the fight to eradicate addiction. It was a philosophy
      that would characterize the bureau's attitude toward drug issues
      for years to come.<br>
      <br>
      While Anslinger was undoubtedly a dedicated and conscientious
      public servant who worked hard and long at combating what he felt
      was a national and international menace, he was above all an
      astute and 'calculating bureaucrat. It was because of his
      astuteness that he was initially cool to those who pressured him
      to join the fight against marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      For one thing, past experience enforcing Prohibition and the
      Harrison Act had taught him that the federal courts had limited
      jurisdiction in prosecuting alcohol- and drug-related offenses.
      They could not, for instance, prosecute buyers of alcohol. Such
      prosecution could only be handled at the state level. Similarly,
      although the intention of the Harrison Act had been to curtail the
      unsanctioned use of narcotic drugs, the law was basically a taxing
      measure. The law did not prohibit possession.<br>
      <br>
      A second reason for Anslinger's initial reluctance to join in an
      antimarihuana campaign on a federal level was that there was no
      federal law under which marihuana offenses could be prosecuted.
      The Harrison Act did not apply since it encompased only drugs not
      grown in the United States such as opium.<br>
      <br>
      A third reason may have been Anslinger's realization, even in the
      early 1930s, that it would take far more men than the bureau could
      spare to enforce any laws against marihuana. Until some way could
      be found to get around those administrative problems, Anslinger
      had second thoughts about putting the bureau's weight behind any
      antimarihuana measures:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal of public interest has been
      aroused by newspaper articles appearing from time to time on the
      evils of the abuse of marihuana, or Indian hemp, and more
      attention has been focused upon specific cases reported of the
      abuse of the drug than would otherwise have been the case. This
      publicity tends to magnify the extent of the evil and lends color
      to an influence that there is an alarming spread of the improper
      use of the drug, whereas the actual increase in such use may not
      have been inordinately large. [2]<br>
      <br>
      This communiqué was issued in 1932. Later that same year,
      Anslinger began to reassess his stand on the marihuana issue, not
      because of any change of mind regarding the drug's alleged menace,
      but because the Bureau of Narcotics was in danger of floundering.<br>
      <br>
      The Bureau Joins the Fight<br>
      <br>
      Deep in the throes of the Depression, Congress began to examine
      budgetary requirements from all federal agencies, and the Bureau
      of Narcotics was no exception. Requests for even small amounts of
      money had to be supported with documentation of the need for such
      spending. The bureau's budget was cut by $200,000, the number of
      agents on the payroll was reduced, and Anslinger began to fear
      that the bureau itself was in danger of emasculation. [3] To
      maintain its virility, Anslinger had to prove that there was a new
      drug menace threatening the country, one that required immediate
      federal attention, one that the Bureau of Narcotics could deal
      with if only its hands were not tied. To prove the reality of the
      menace, Anslinger was prepared to spare no effort or guile.<br>
      <br>
      A great believer in the force of public opinion, Anslinger
      reverted to the type of media campaign that had proven so
      successful when the Narcotics Division sought to expand in 1915 -
      he began to supply information to organizations like the WCTU,
      community service clubs, and the popular press concerning alleged
      atrocities committed by people under the influence of marihuana.
      The bureau made no secret of this publicity campaign:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Articles were prepared in the Federal Bureau of
      Narcotics, at the request of a number of organizations dealing
      with this general subject [uniform state drug laws] for
      publication by such organizations in magazines and newspapers. An
      intelligent and sympathetic public interest, helpful to the
      administration of the narcotic laws has been aroused and
      maintained. [4]<br>
      <br>
      Whereas only two such articles appeared in the American popular
      press between 1920 and 1929, after 1930 they began to appear on
      the market in a steady stream. Among the titles appearing on the
      newstands were: "Youth Gone Loco" (Christian Century), "Marihuana:
      Assassin of Youth" (American Magazine), "Uncle Sam Fights a New
      Drug Menace - Marihuana" (Popular Science Monthly), "One More
      Peril for Youth" (Forum), "Sex Crazing Drug Menace" (Physical
      Culture), "The Menace of Marihuana" (American Mercury), "Tea for a
      Viper" (New Yorker), and "Exposing the Marihuana Drug Evil in
      Swing Bands" (Radio Stars). Although most of these articles
      appeared after enactment of federal antimarihuana legislation,
      most of them drew their information from the files of the Bureau
      of Narcotics just before Anslinger prepared his assault on Capitol
      Hill. [5]<br>
      <br>
      Typical of the lurid sensationalistic prose in which Anslinger
      wrapped his message is the following excerpt from an article
      written for American Magazine in 1937 by Anslinger himself:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sprawled body of a young girl lay crushed
      on the sidewalk the other day after a plunge from the fifth story
      of a Chicago apartment house. Everyone called it suicide but
      actually it was murder. The killer was a narcotic known to America
      as marihuana, and history as hashish. It is a narcotic used in the
      form of cigarettes, comparatively new to the United States and as
      dangerous as a coiled rattlesnake. [6]<br>
      <br>
      This was typical of the bureau's "educational campaign describing
      the drug, its identification, and its evil effects...." [7]<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, Anslinger began to urge that marihuana be included in
      the Uniform State Narcotic Act that was making the rounds of
      various state legislatures. This law gave each state the power to
      arrest addicts for possession of outlawed drugs, and in so doing
      effectively closed the loophole that undermined the Harrison Act.
      Had it not been or Anslinger's campaign against marihuana, few of
      the states adopting the act would have included marihuana in its
      provisions. For example, by 1935 only three states out of the
      twelve that had adopted it included marihuana in its list of
      proscribed drugs. This was well before Anslinger's machine was
      operating at maximum efficiency. By 1936, all eighteen of the
      states that adopted the act that year included marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      Yet, far from being whipped into a panic over the "killer drug,"
      most Americans seemed totally unconcerned or aware that there was
      a drug menace threatening the country. Many congressmen likewise
      were ignorant of the bureau's efforts to arouse the nation over
      marihuana, and Anslinger felt that he had to do something else to
      capture their attention.<br>
      <br>
      Looking back over the way in which the Opium and Harrison Acts had
      come into being, Anslinger realized that one way to pressure
      Congress into moving against marihuana was to embarrass the
      nation's lawmakers. By making the United States a party to
      international restrictions on the drug, it would be placed in the
      position of agreeing to international sanctions without having
      domestic sanctions. Once the United States became a signatory to
      an international treaty, Anslinger felt that Congress would have
      to adopt federal antimarihuana legislation despite opposition on
      constitutional grounds to any law restricting cannabis on the
      basis of current federal tax or interstate laws. Once the U.S. was
      party to an international drug agreement, Anslinger suggested that
      the Treasury could overcome constitutional opposition by citing
      the precedent of the Migratory Bird Act, a law that had been
      declared constitutional even though it called for overstepping
      state police powers because it was part of an international treaty
      with Canada and Mexico, as a way of overriding any opposition. [8]<br>
      <br>
      To that end, Anslinger traveled to Geneva in 1936 to attend the
      Conference for the Suppression of Illicit Traffic in Dangerous
      Drugs. As one of the American delegates to the conference, he
      urged the other members to include control of cannabis in any drug
      treaty that they, as representatives of their respective
      governments, might adopt. The other delegates refused to agree to
      such a request since a subcommittee charged with looking into the
      cannabis question indicated that not enough was known about the
      physiological, psychological, or psychopathic effects, addictive
      properties, or cannabis's relation to crime, to warrant any such
      proposal.<br>
      <br>
      Anslinger left Geneva despondent, refusing to sign any of the
      resolutions adopted by the convention because no provisions had
      been adopted for punishment of "illegal cultivation and gathering
      of cannabis" and because the provisions that had been adopted were
      "inadequate as far as cannabis was concerned." [9]<br>
      <br>
      "I Believe It Is A Narcotic Of Some Kind"<br>
      <br>
      Alter consultation with Anslinger, the Treasury Department began
      to prepare its case to Congress for outlawing marihuana. The
      hearings were set for the spring of 1937. In January of that year,
      Anslinger met with the department's legal and medical experts to
      review how the case would be presented.<br>
      <br>
      Typical of the kind of evidence the department was going to depend
      on is a question put to Anslinger by one of the department's
      lawyers: "Have you lots of cases on this? - Horror stories, that's
      what we want." [10]<br>
      <br>
      Horror stories were Anslinger's strong suit. He had files and
      files of them. There would be no problem along those lines, he
      assured the legal staff. Then, as if to belie all that he himself
      had written on the marihuana issue, Anslinger turned to the
      department's drug authority, Dr. Carl Voegtlin, and asked in all
      sincerity whether the doctor thought that marihuana really did
      produce insanity! [11]<br>
      <br>
      The actual hearings took place in late April and early May of that
      year. As presented to Congress, the antimarihuana bill stipulated
      that all handlers of cannabis had to be registered and pay a
      special occupational tax. Written forms had to be submitted and
      filed for every transaction involving cannabis, and payment of a
      transfer tax of one dollar per ounce had to be paid each time the
      drug was delivered to an authorized recipient.<br>
      <br>
      The bill was introduced by Clinton M. Hester, the Treasury
      Department's assistant general counsel. Hester told the House
      Committee on Ways and Means that the Treasury Department had taken
      it upon itself to call for federal laws against marihuana after a
      two-year study by the Bureau of Narcotics revealed that the drug
      was "being used extensively by high school children in
      cigarettes." "Its effect," he told the House committee, "is
      deadly." [12]<br>
      <br>
      No estimates of how many Americans were using marihuana were ever
      discussed. No qualified experts were summoned to support the
      bureau's claim either that children were using marihuana, that
      marihuana was causing Americans to commit crimes, or that
      marihuana "deadly."<br>
      <br>
      What the committee did hear was excerpts from newspapers and
      magazines describing the dangers of the drug: "The leading
      newspapers of the United States have recognized the seriousness of
      this problem and many of them have advocated Federal legislation
      to control the traffic in marihuana." [13] What the committee did
      not know was that the bureau had supplied many of the gruesome
      stories upon which the newspapers based their appeal for something
      to be done.<br>
      <br>
      The other main piece of evidence to be introduced was Eugene
      Stanley's article "Marihuana as a Developer of Criminals." [14] No
      reference was made to any of the studies carried out in the Canal
      Zone which contradicted everything Stanley or Anslinger said about
      marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      The committee heard from Dr. James Munch, a pharmacologist who had
      been giving marihuana to dogs. Asked if the drug altered the
      personality of dogs, the pharmacologist answered with an
      unqualified "yes. So far as I can tell, not being a dog
      psychologist." [15]<br>
      <br>
      The Treasury Department's medical witness was none other than
      Commissioner Harry Anslinger, who offered his own medical opinion
      of the dangers of marihuana, an opinion that was liberally spiked
      with a historically inaccurate rendering of the hoary legend of
      the Assassins. After the Treasury Department presented its case it
      was time to hear from the other side.<br>
      <br>
      According to the provisions of the bill, industrial uses of the
      plant were to be protected from interference by defining the term
      "marihuana" to exclude the mature stalk and its compounds or
      manufactures. This provision had been included to appease the rope
      and cordage industry. Seeds, however, had not been excluded from
      the definition of marihuana, even though there was a recognized
      industrial use for them in producing oil for the paint and varnish
      industries. The reason for not excluding marihuana seeds was that
      they contained minute amounts of the intoxicating substance
      produced by the plant.<br>
      <br>
      The failure to exclude marihuana seeds from the law brought a cry
      of protest not only from the paint and varnish makers but also
      from the birdseed industry, which used millions of pounds of
      cannabis seed a year as bird food. The birdseed representative
      appeared almost too late to present his case, explaining that the
      birdseed industry had only just realized that marihuana was
      another name for the hemp plant! When asked whether the seeds had
      the same effect in pigeons as in humans, the birdseed spokesman
      replied that he had never noticed any special effect. "It has a
      tendency to bring back the feathers, and improve the birds," he
      told the committee. [16]<br>
      <br>
      So as not to ruin the birdseed industry, the provisions of the
      bill were changed. Marihuana seeds would be excluded from the
      definition of marihuana, provided that they were sterilized, a
      process that would ensure that they could not be used to grow new
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      More serious opposition came from the medical profession. Dr.
      William Woodward, the legislative council for the AMA, challenged
      the Treasury Department on all fronts:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are told that the use of marihuana causes
      crime. But as yet no one has been produced from the Bureau of
      Prisons to show the number of persons addicted to marihuana. An
      informal inquiry shows that the Bureau of Prisons has no
      information to this point. You have been told that school children
      are great users of marihuana cigarettes. No one has been summoned
      from the Children's Bureau to show the nature and extent of the
      habit among children. Inquiry into the Office of Education, and
      they certainly should know something of the prevalence of the
      habit among school children of this country, if there is a
      prevalent habit, indicates that they had not occasion to
      investigate it and know nothing of it. [17]<br>
      <br>
      The danger, Woodward insisted, was only in the minds of the Bureau
      of Narcotics. There was no evidence to believe that marihuana
      posed any danger to the country. Although he assumed that there
      must be some basis to all the furor over marihuana in the press,
      Woodward asked why the facts upon which these statements had been
      made had not been introduced as firsthand testimony. Since when,
      he wanted to know, did press coverage constitute anything more
      than hearsay.<br>
      <br>
      The AMA was not even aware that an antimarihuana law was being
      prepared by the bureau. "During the past 2 years," he told the
      committee, "I have visited the Bureau of Narcotics probably 10 or
      more times. Unfortunately, I had no knowledge that such a bill as
      this was proposed until after it had been introduced." [18]<br>
      <br>
      Had he been aware of such an event, no doubt Woodward would have
      been able to call upon expert testimony from witnesses such as
      Drs. Bromberg and Siler whose studies did not support the bureau's
      allegations. "We cannot understand yet, Mr. Chairman," Woodward
      said, "why this bill should have been prepared in secret for 2
      years without any intimation even to the profession, that it was
      being prepared."<br>
      <br>
      The answer, of course, was that the bureau did not want any
      opposition. By bringing it up without any prior warning, it forced
      the opposition to prepare a last-minute case.<br>
      <br>
      The AMA, however, objected to the marihuana law not because of any
      liberal attitude toward the drug or its users (Dr. Morris
      Fishbein, editor of the Journal of the American Medical
      Association, had sanctioned publication of an article in Hygeia
      which claimed that marihuana was an inciter of sex crimes, murder,
      and insanity [19]), but for other reasons. Enforcement of the
      Harrison Act and Prohibition had led to a certain amount of
      annoyance and outright harassment of physicians. Many doctors felt
      that these laws were an infringement of their right to treat their
      patients as they saw fit. Even though the number of prescriptions
      for cannabis was minimal and the tax was only one dollar an ounce,
      the AMA remembered the difficulties doctors had faced in
      connection with other drug laws and therefore it opposed any
      further infringements of like nature on the medical profession.<br>
      <br>
      At the time Woodward appeared before the committee, the AMA was
      not one of Congress's favorite institutions. Many of the
      committee's members were still upset at the AMA's successful fight
      to block health insurance from being included in the Social
      Security Act [20] and they were not in any mood to consider
      further interference from the AMA, regardless of how much merit
      there was to Woodward's statement. "If you want to advise us on
      legislation," Woodward was told, "you ought to come here with some
      constructive proposals, rather than criticism, rather than trying
      to throw obstacles in the way of something that the Federal
      Government is trying to do."<br>
      <br>
      Soon after the hearings were over, the bill came to a vote in the
      House of Representatives. Just before the vote was taken, a short
      exchange took place showing that Congress was not even aware of
      what the drug marihuana was, although they were being asked to
      outlaw its use:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Snell: What is the bill?<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr.Raybur: It has something to do with
      something that is called marihuana. I believe it is a narcotic of
      some kind. [21]<br>
      <br>
      The House passed the bill and sent it on to the Senate. It was
      slightly amended by the Senate and sent back to the House which
      passed it without even a roll call. There was virtually no debate.
      President Roosevelt's signing of the bill into law merited only a
      scant three and a half lines in the New York Times on August 3,
      1937: "President Roosevelt signed today a bill to curb traffic in
      the narcotic, marihuana, through heavy taxes on transactions."<br>

      <br>
      In the years that elapsed between the passage of the Marihuana Tax
      Act and the present, America experienced three major wars, a
      presidential assassination, the resignation of both a president
      and a vice-president in disgrace, a Communist witch-hunt, a flight
      to and landing on the moon, beatniks, hippies, yippies,
      desegregation, major riots in many of the nation's cities and
      campuses, domination of family life by television, the generation
      gap, and a longing to be perpetually young. Keeping pace with all
      these significant social and political events was a change in the
      nation's attitudes and behavior concerning marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      Almost immediately after the Marihuana Tax Act became law, the
      Bureau of Narcotics was forced to reconsider its position on one
      of the main arguments it had used to secure passage of the law.
      First in the trial of Ethel "Bunny" Sohl in Newark, New Jersey, in
      January 1938, and then in the trial of Arthur Friedman in New York
      City in April of the same year, the defense argued that the
      murders committed by their clients were the result of their use of
      marihuana. An expert witness, Dr. James Munch, who had previously
      testified on behalf of the bureau at the congressional hearings on
      marihuana, testified again at both trials that marihuana would
      make people do things they would not otherwise do. The implication
      was that the accused were not responsible for their actions. The
      jury accepted the defense in both cases, and instead of asking for
      the death penalty they recommended life imprisonment.<br>
      <br>
      By contending that marihuana incited its users to violence,
      Anslinger had unwittingly undermined his own efforts to secure
      maximum sentences in any and all drug-related trials. He now had
      no other choice but to revise the bureau's position with regard to
      marihuana's effects on crime. Instead of claiming that marihuana
      invariably incited criminal activity, the bureau's new position
      was that the effects of marihuana were so variable that no general
      statement could be made as to its effects on criminality.<br>
      <br>
      The bureau also had to deal with direct challenges to its
      promulgations concerning marihuana, the most important of which
      was a lengthy scientific study which came to be known as the
      LaGuardia Report.<br>
      <br>
      Reacting to sensationalistic newspaper claims that New York's
      youth was teetering on the brink of an orgy of marihuana-induced
      crime and sex, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia asked the cooperation of
      the New York Academy of Medicine to conduct an investigation of
      the alleged problem in New York. The academy appointed a
      distinguished panel of social and medical scientists to perform
      the first sociological and laboratory studies of marihuana in
      America. The report, published in 1944, contradicted the bureau's
      official position on every one of its conclusions, among which
      were that:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marihuana is used extensively in the Borough of
      Manhattan but the problem is not as acute as it is reported to be
      in other sections of the United States.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The distribution and use of marihuana is
      centered in Harlem.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of marihuana smokers are Negroes
      and Latin Americans.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead
      to addiction in the medical sense of the word.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale and distribution of marihuana is not
      under the control of any single organized group.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of marihuana does not lead to morphine
      or heroin or cocaine addiction and no effort is made to create a
      market for these narcotics by stimulating the practice of
      marihuana smoking.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marihuana is not the determining factor in the
      commission of major crimes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marihuana smoking is not widespread among
      school children.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juvenile delinquency is not associated with the
      practice of smoking marihuana<br>
      <br>
      And finally:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The publicity concerning the catastrophic
      effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. [1]<br>
      <br>
      The second part of the study involved medical and psychological
      tests of individuals under the influence of marihuana.
      Seventy-seven volunteers were studied; seventy-two were prisoners,
      five were paid subjects; forty-eight were previous marihuana
      users, twenty-nine had never used marihuana before. Marihuana was
      administered either in the form of cigarettes or as an extract
      taken by mouth.<br>
      <br>
      A number of minor transient effects were observed such as
      euphoria, anxiety, relaxation, nervousness, hunger, thirst,
      disorientation, loss of motor coordination, impaired learning and
      memory, and in some instances, mild psychotic reactions consisting
      of "mental confusion and excitement of a delirious nature with
      periods of laughter and of anxiety." Contrary to the position of
      the Federal Bureau of Narcotics the committee found that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marihuana does not change the basic personality
      structure of the individual. It lessons inhibition and this brings
      out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it does not
      evoke responses which would otherwise be totally alien to him. It
      induces a feeling of self-confidence, but this is expressed in
      thought rather than in performance. [2]<br>
      <br>
      In essence, the findings of the committee were totally in
      opposition to the statements issued by the Federal Bureau of
      Narcotics and newspaper reports from around the country.<br>
      <br>
      The LaGuardia Report was not the only laboratory study of
      marihuana in the 1940s. The United States Public Health Service
      also conducted experiments on the effects of the drug. Unlike the
      LaGuardia study, however, subjects in this study were allowed to
      smoke as many marihuana cigarettes as they wanted for thirty-nine
      days. The marihuana was supplied by the Bureau of Narcotics. All
      six subjects in the experiment were prisoners, all had been
      previous users of marihuana, and ironically, all had been
      imprisoned for violation of the Marihuana Tax Act.<br>
      <br>
      While the researchers noted a lessening of inhibition and removal
      of restraint resulting from marihuana use, "in the majority of
      cases... aggression and belligerency are not commonly seen." [3]
      The researchers also noted that tolerance to marihuana appeared to
      have developed during the study but in no instances did they
      observe physical dependence.<br>
      <br>
      Several other studies were also reported in the 1940s, but these
      were primarily reports of psychiatric problems allegedly related
      to marihuana use. For the most part, the patients were nearly
      always black. One study involved thirty-four black and one white
      soldiers. In another, the ratio of blacks to whites was twenty to
      one. At Fort McClellan, Alabama, where the ratio of recruits was
      seven whites to one black, fifty-five black and five white
      soldiers were referred for psychiatric service related to
      marihuana use.<br>
      <br>
      Commenting on the large numbers of black soldiers requiring
      treatment, Charen and Perelman, the authors of one of these
      studies stated:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preponderance of Negros is due, we believe,
      to the peculiar need marihuana serves for them. The Negro
      psychopath or neurotic faces not only inner anxiety resulting from
      childhood family relationships, but also suffers from a feeling of
      resentment towards the submission which is required by the white
      stereotypes of Negro behavior. Marihuana, insofar as it removes
      both anxiety and submission and therefore permits a feeling of
      adequacy, enables the Negro addict to feel a sense of mastery
      denied him by his color. The white psychopath or neurotic not
      faced with a dual problem of personality and environmental
      frustration finds alcohol or other forms of satisfaction more
      acceptable. [4]<br>
      <br>
      This view was shared by others as well. Said Drs. E. Marcovitz and
      H. J. Myers:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs to be emphasized that the problem is
      not the drug but the user of the drug - the addict in relation to
      himself and his society. [5]<br>
      <br>
      The LaGuardia Report along with these psychiatric studies, and
      especially medical studies from Mexico, did not go unnoticed on
      the international scene. During the first meeting of the United
      Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs held after World War II in
      1946, the commission decided that there was no necessity for
      appointing a sub-committee to study cannabis. The commission gave
      as its reasons for this decision, "some medical opinion in the
      United States [i.e., the LaGuardia Report] and in Mexico had been
      advanced that marihuana did not offer any real danger, and had
      little influence on criminal behaviour. Indeed, the Mexican
      physicians were of the opinion that its use had no ill effect on
      the health of the user. The representative for Mexico wondered
      whether in these circumstances too strict restrictions on the use
      of this plant, the production of which was in fact prohibited in
      Mexico, would not result in its replacement by alcohol, which
      might have worse results." [6]<br>
      <br>
      Anslinger, the American representative "did not share this point
      of view and quoted a number of concrete examples, proving the
      relationship between the use of marihuana and crime. He considered
      the recent report of certain United States physicians on the
      subject to have been extremely dangerous." [7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Higher Penalties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When the Marihuana Tax Act became law in 1937, it called for
      imprisonment of up to five years and/or a fine of $2000 as
      punishment for breaking each provision of the law. The length of
      the actual term and fine were left to the discretion of the court.
      These penalties and sentencing powers remained in force until 1951
      when the Boggs Act became the new law of the land.<br>
      <br>
      Passage of the Boggs Act (named after its sponsor, Congressman
      Hale Boggs) followed on the heels of an alleged upsurge in
      narcotic usage, especially on the part of the young after 1947.
      According to Anslinger:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the present wave of juvenile addiction struck
      us with hurricane force in 1948 and 1949, and in a short time had
      two Federal hospitals bursting at the seams. [8]<br>
      <br>
      In Congress, Representative Boggs warned his fellow lawmakers
      that:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first 6 months of 1946, the average age
      of addicted persons committed... at Lexington, Ky. was 37 1/2
      years...... During the first 6 months of 1950, only 4 years later,
      the average age dropped to 26.7 years, and 766 patients were under
      the age of 21.... In New York City alone it has been estimated
      that 1 out of every 200 teenagers is now addicted to some type of
      narcotics. [9]<br>
      <br>
      In Boggs's opinion, the reason for the epidemic rise in drug
      addiction among the young was the mild sentences being handed out
      for violation of the country's drug laws, a view solidly endorsed
      by Commissioner Anslinger.<br>
      <br>
      To meet the threat to America, Boggs called for draconian
      penalties for those found guilty of violation of the nation's drug
      laws. At first, Congress was unwilling to adopt such measures. But
      during the hearings before the Special Senate Committee to
      Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce headed by
      Senator Kefauver, Congress got the impression that organized crime
      was behind much of the drug traffic in America, and in 1951 it
      endorsed Boggs's proposals. As a result, conviction for a first
      drug-related offense called for imprisonment of two to five years.
      Conviction for a second offense was punishable by a mandatory
      sentence of not less than five nor more than ten years. Conviction
      for a third offense carried a penalty of ten to twenty years.<br>
      <br>
      While the legislators were primarily concerned with the heroin
      user, they included marihuana in the Boggs Act because of the
      belief that marihuana was a "stepping stone" to heroin use. This
      "stepping stone" theory had become Commissioner Anslinger's new
      weapon in his fight to keep America safe from the evil he saw in
      marihuana. Testifying before a committee headed by Boggs,
      Anslinger explained that<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 50 percent of those young addicts started
      on marihuana smoking. They started there and graduated to heroin;
      they took the needle when the thrill of marihuana was gone. [10]<br>
      <br>
      In 1956, some congressmen were of the opinion that even stiffer
      penalties were needed to meet the challenge of drug abuse. At the
      Daniel Committee hearing which eventually led to the adoption of
      the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, Texas Sen. Price Daniel played
      straight man to Commissioner Anslinger:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel: Now, do I understand it from you that,
      while we are discussing marijuana, the real danger there is that
      the use of marijuana leads many people eventually to the use of
      heroin, and the drugs that do cause them complete addiction, is
      that true?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anslinger: That is the great problem and our
      great concern about the use of marijuana, that eventually if used
      over a long period, it does lead to heroin addiction. [11]<br>
      <br>
      Later on in the question period, Senator Welker resurrected the
      marihuana-mayhem theme Anslinger had previously discarded in light
      of its use as a defense ploy. But he couldn't completely renounce
      the connection:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welker: Mr. Commissioner, my concluding
      question with respect to marijuana: Is it or is it not a fact that
      the marijuana user has been responsible for many of our most
      sadistic, terrible crimes in this Nation, such as sex slayings,
      sadistic slayings, and matters of that kind?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anslinger: There have been instances of that,
      Senator. We have had some rather tragic occurrences by users of
      marijuana. It does not follow that all crimes can be traced to
      marijuana. There have been many brutal crimes traced to marijuana.
      But I would not say that it is the controlling factor in the
      commission of crimes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welker: I will grant you that it is not the
      controlling factor, but is it a fact that your investigation shows
      that many of the most sadistic, terrible crimes, solved or
      unsolved, we can trace directly to the marijuana user?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anslinger: You are correct in many cases,
      Senator Welker.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welker: In other words, it builds up a false
      sort of feeling on the part of the user and he has no inhibitions
      against doing anything; am I correct?<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anslinger: He is completely irresponsible. [12]<br>
      <br>
      The feeling of the committee with respect to marihuana was summed
      up by Senator Daniel as he addressed his fellow lawmakers:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Marihuana] is a drug which starts most addicts
      in the use of drugs. Marihuana, in itself a dangerous drug, can
      lead to some of the worst crimes committed by those who are
      addicted to the habit. Evidently, its use leads to the heroin
      habit and then to the final destruction of the persons addicted.
      [13]<br>
      <br>
      Convinced that marihuana posed a dual threat to domestic
      tranquillity, Congress included it in the Narcotics Act of 1956
      which raised the mandatory minimum sentence for marihuana
      possession and also called for a minimum ten-year prison sentence
      to anyone selling narcotics, including marihuana, to a juvenile.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The International Game</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      By 1948, after his initial setback at the United Nations two years
      earlier, Anslinger began urging the U.N. commission to adopt a
      Single Convention which would encompass all existing international
      agreements on drugs, and at the same time he began lobbying for
      more stringent international measures against cannabis to bring it
      under the guidelines of the proposed Single Convention.<br>
      <br>
      This was Anslinger at his devious best. From past experience, he
      knew how to play off international and domestic politics against
      each other. First, he used the bureau's "gore" file to persuade
      U.N. members of the crimes marihuana was capable of inciting and
      then he turned around and used American ratification of an
      international agreement against cannabis to buttress the bureau's
      domestic campaign against the drug.<br>
      <br>
      By 1954, the U.N. Economic and Social Council was finally
      persuaded that "there is no justification for the medical use of
      cannabis preparations" - a very important victory for Anslinger
      and other U.N. supporters of his anticannabis ideas since in
      essence this pronouncement stripped cannabis of any remaining
      legitimacy.<br>
      <br>
      In 1961, the United Nations finally adopted the Single Convention,
      the terms of which stated that each participating country could
      "adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent misuse of, and
      illicit traffic in, the leaves of the cannabis plant." [14]<br>
      <br>
      Anslinger could not have asked for more. However, Congress waited
      until 1967 to approve American participation in the convention.
      Proof of Anslinger's perspicacity came three years later in the
      form of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act.
      As part of the law, Congress decreed that in the case of drugs
      such as cannabis which had no recognized medical uses, the
      attorney general was invested with authority over reclassification
      since control of such drugs was required by "United States
      obligations under international treaties."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dissent</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the main users of marihuana
      were still blacks and Mexican-Americans. Most Americans were
      either completely unaware of any marihuana problem, or if they
      were aware, they could not have cared less since it involved
      minority groups and fringe elements of white society only. But in
      the middle 1960s, a sudden "epidemic" of marihuana use erupted not
      in the ghettos of America's cities but in its bastions of higher
      learning. The new users were not the poor and the uneducated black
      or Mexican-American, but native-born, middle-class, white college
      students. By 1969, as many as 70 percent of the students at some
      colleges had allegedly tried marihuana at least once, [15] and the
      parents of these students began to worry lest their sons and
      daughters lose their sanity, become involved in sexual orgies,
      become wanton murderers, go on to heroin, or wind up in prison.
      Marihuana seemed to have snuck up on them from behind and crashed
      into them unexpectedly like a rear-end collision.<br>
      <br>
      A New York Times commentator spoke for most Americans when he
      wrote:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody cared when it was a ghetto problem.
      Marijuana - well, it was used by jazz musicians in the lower
      class, so you didn't care if they got 2-to-20 years. But when a
      nice, middle-class girl or boy in college gets busted for the same
      thing, then the whole country sits up and takes notice." [16]<br>
      <br>
      The soaring use of marihuana on college campuses and the
      ever-present danger that a son or daughter might wind up in prison
      brought pressure to bear on the nation's lawmakers to reevaluate
      the marihuana laws, and new fact-finding commissions were
      appointed.<br>
      <br>
      Even before the rising tide of marihuana had begun to engulf the
      college campuses, however, there were rumblings of disagreement
      with the Bureau of Narcotics's position on marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      In 1962, President Kennedy's Ad Hoc Panel on Drug Abuse dismissed
      the alleged link between marihuana and sexual abuse and
      criminality as "limited." The dangers claimed for marihuana, it
      said, were "exaggerated," and it challenged the "long criminal
      sentences imposed on an occasional user or possessor of the drug"
      as being in "poor social perspective." [17]<br>
      <br>
      In 1963, the President's Advisory Commission on Narcotics and Drug
      Abuse was outspoken in its condemnation of contemporary marihuana
      policy:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An offender whose crime is sale of a marijuana
      reefer is subject to the same term of imprisonment as the peddler
      selling heroin. In most cases the marijuana reefer is less harmful
      than any opiate. For one thing, while marijuana may provoke
      lawless behavior, it does not create physical dependence. This
      Commission makes a flat distinction between the two drugs and
      believes that the unlawful sale or possession of marijuana is a
      less serious offense than the unlawful sale or possession of an
      opiate." [18]<br>
      <br>
      The same criticism of the law lumping marihuana with narcotic
      drugs was voiced in 1967 by President Johnson's Commission on Law
      Enforcement and Administration of Justice:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Marijuana is equated in law with the opiates,
      but the abuse characteristic of the two have almost nothing in
      common. The opiate produces physical dependence. Marijuana does
      not. A withdrawal sickness appears when use of the opiates is
      discontinued. No such symptoms are associated with marijuana. The
      desired dose of opiates tends to increase over time, but this is
      not true of marijuana. Both can lead to psychic dependence, but so
      can almost any substance that alters the state of consciousness.
      "[19]<br>
      <br>
      The Johnson commission also challenged the "stepping stone"
      theory:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is evidence that a majority of the
      heroin users who come to the attention of public authorities have,
      in fact, had some prior experience with marijuana. But this does
      not mean that one leads to the other in the sense that marijuana
      has an intrinsic quality that creates a heroin liability. There
      are too many marijuana users who do not graduate to heroin, and
      too many heroin addicts with no known prior marijuana use, to
      support such a theory. Moreover there is no scientific basis for
      such a theory." [20]<br>
      <br>
      In 1970, one of Anslinger's best weapons in his battle to stifle
      criticism of the bureau's marihuana policy was dealt a serious
      blow - Congress demanded an end to ignorance. In its compromise
      with President Nixon over general hospital appropriations,
      Congress demanded that the Secretary of Health, Education and
      Welfare issue annual reports on the health consequences of
      marihuana along with recommendations for reassessing the legal
      status of marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, however, Congress adopted the Comprehensive Drug
      Abuse Prevention and Control Act. Although the law characterized
      marihuana as a drug with high addiction liability, potentially
      dangerous, and having no recognized medical use in the United
      States, it did lower federal penalties for first-time marihuana
      convictions and permitted probation. The act also placed
      discretion over reclassification of marihuana in the hands of the
      Attorney General. Finally, the act also called for yet another
      commission to evaluate marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      Although he had agreed to a fact-finding commission, President
      Nixon said "this about that":<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you know, there is a commission that is
      supposed to make recommendations to me about this subject, and in
      this instance, however, I have such strong views that I will
      express them. I am against legalizing marijuana. Even if this
      commission does recommend that it be legalized, I will not follow
      that recommendation.... I do not believe that legalizing marijuana
      is in the best interests of our young people and I do not think
      it's in the best interests of this country." [21]<br>
      <br>
      For its part, the commission recommended legalization and it did
      not recommend legalization. It suggested that private use and
      distribution of small amounts of marihuana be legalized whereas
      public possession be subject to confiscation and forfeiture.<br>
      <br>
      True to his promise, President Nixon rejected these
      recommendations. But local communities and various states had
      already begun to take the legalization question into their own
      hands. In 1971, the college town community of Ann Arbor, Michigan,
      adopted the unprecedented step of decriminalizing marihuana from a
      felony prison offense to a misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence of
      ninety days in jail and/or a $100 fine.<br>
      <br>
      The new law did not go unchallenged. Opponents appealed to the
      state court that Ann Arbor had no legal authority to enact
      legislation with was contrary to state law, but the courts ruled
      against them. The penalty was subsequently dropped to a
      five-dollar fine which could be paid like a local traffic ticket.<br>
      <br>
      Undeterred, opponents of the law made the marihuana statute an
      issue in the local elections and they were successful in electing
      a majority of antimarihuana councilmen. In 1973, Ann Arbor's
      lenient marihuana laws were rescinded.<br>
      <br>
      Now the pro-marihuana forces went to work. A referendum on the
      marihuana issue was called for. In 1974, a majority of the
      electorate voted for the "decriminalization ordinance" and once
      again marihuana became a five-dollar misdemeanor in Ann Arbor.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, a number of states were enacting new marihuana
      legislation of their own. In 1973, Oregon became the first state
      to decriminalize marihuana by changing the penalty for possession
      from a felony prison sentence to a $100 civil misdemeanor fine.
      Other states to follow Oregon's lead included Alaska, California,
      Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and
      South Dakota.<br>
      <br>
      Although they have not yet decriminalized marihuana, other states,
      like New Mexico, Louisiana, Florida, and Illinois, have passed
      laws making marihuana available for therapeutic purposes such as
      in the treatment of glaucoma for which marihuana has been found
      beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      On the federal level, a speech instructor in Washington, D. C.,
      Robert Randall, became the first American since 1937 to be allowed
      to smoke marihuana legally. Randall suffers from glaucoma. As a
      result of studies showing marihuana's ability to ameliorate the
      effects of the disease, a court battle in which the District of
      Columbia Supreme Court acquitted him for growing marihuana on the
      unique defense of "necessity" to commit a criminal act to
      safeguard his health, and dogged persistence in fighting
      bureaucratic red tape, he was accorded the right to use the drug
      without fear of punishment.<br>
      <br>
      Although a far step from decriminalization, Randall's case
      represents a major push in that direction since official
      recognition that marihuana has therapeutic value undermines one of
      the bulwarks supporting its illegality as put forth by the
      Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.<br>
      <br>
      Another significant event on the national level was the formation
      of the National Organization for the Reform of Marihuana Laws
      (NORML) in 1970. NORML is a national lobbying group dedicated to
      persuading the nation's lawmakers that marihuana is a relatively
      harmless drug and its use should be decriminalized. Its impact on
      the national level is yet to be determined. Its significance is
      that it represents a concerted, devoted, and formally organized
      attempt to change the current marihuana laws.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Marihuana Today</b><br>
      <br>
      Beginning in the late 1960s, there has been a virtual inundation
      of scientific papers published on marihuana. In 1979, I was able
      to locate over 8000 references dealing with cannabis, most of
      which were published after 1965.<br>
      <br>
      Whereas many of the social questions about marihuana are no longer
      being debated - e.g., does marihuana incite criminal behavior? (it
      doesn't); is marihuana a "stepping stone" to heroin? (it isn't);
      does marihuana unleash hitherto inhibited sexual passions? (it
      doesn't) - there is still a considerable controversy about whether
      marihuana is medically safe. Questions about marihuana's botanical
      classification are still at matter of debate and there are still
      many other areas of debate concerning cannabis. In the remaining
      pages of this book, some of the recent developments in cannabis
      research and some of the major controversies associated with
      marihuana use today will be examined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prevalence</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1972, the National Commission on Marihuana estimated that about
      twenty-four million Americans over the age of eleven had tried
      marihuana, at least eight million were still using it, and about
      half a million were using it every day. The commission suggested
      that "marihuana use may be a fad, which if not institutionalized,
      will recede substantially in time." [22]<br>
      <br>
      During the late 1960s and early 1970s, marihuana became a symbol
      of the generation gap, of opposition to the Vietnam War, of
      frustration and anger at efforts to suppress protest. Smoking
      marihuana represented a direct challenge to the establishment -
      "We're smoking marihuana - what are you going to do about it?"<br>
      <br>
      By the mid-1970s, marihuana was no longer a symbol or merely a fad
      - it was commonplace. Current estimates place the number of people
      who have used it at least once in the United States at over fifty
      million. At least twelve million are believed to use it on a
      regular basis and there is no sign that its use is abating. While
      still illegal in the United States, almost as many people smoke
      marihuana as drink alcohol, which is legal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Botanical Classification</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ever since Linnaeus first dubbed the hemp plant Cannabis sativa,
      there has been vigorous debate among botanists as to whether there
      is only one species of the plant with different varieties, or
      whether there are in fact several distinct species among which
      Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica were the two clearest examples
      of the latter argument. In 1924, the Russian botanist Janischewsky
      championed the polytypic argument and claimed that in addition to
      Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica there was a third distinct
      species which he called Cannabis ruderalis.<br>
      <br>
      One of the main problems in deciding between the monotypic and
      polytypic arguments is that the characteristics of the cannabis
      plant change depending on the conditions under which it is grown.
      For example, seeds taken from the United States and planted in
      India will eventually give rise to plants that resemble those that
      have always been grown in India if the seeds are continually
      replanted, and vice versa for those taken from India and replanted
      in the United States. However, despite the genetic plasticity of
      the seeds, there are still enough subtle differences between the
      plants to enable botanists to differentiate between the three
      different species. As stated by R. Schultes, one of the foremost
      authorities on the botany of cannabis: "critical studies of the
      literature; examination of material from many areas preserved in
      several of the world's largest herbaria; preliminary fieldwork in
      Afghanistan; and a survey of the plantings of cannabis in
      Mississippi from seed imported from many localities around the
      world under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health -
      all have combined to convince us that Cannabis is not monotypic
      and that the Russian concept that there are several species may be
      acceptable." [23]<br>
      <br>
      As presently classified, cannabis is included along with the hops
      plant (Humulus) in a distinct family called Cannabaceae, although
      some botanists still prefer to assign it to the Moraceae family
      which also includes the mulberry plant to which cannabis was
      closely tied in ancient China.<br>
      <br>
      The origin of the cannabis plant is generally placed in Central
      Asia, and from there it is believed to have spread to China,
      India, Persia, the Arab countries, Europe, Africa, and the
      Americas.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of being merely a question of academic hair-splitting, the
      issue of a mono- versus a polytypic species has taken on
      far-reaching implications in the law courts. The single-species
      argument was the position taken by the U.S. Congress when it
      adopted the Marihuana Tax Act in 1937. At that time it outlawed
      Cannabis sativa, not marihuana, believing them to be one and the
      same. No mention was made of Cannabis indica or Cannabis
      ruderalis, since it was assumed that these were different
      varieties of Cannabis sativa rather than different species.<br>
      <br>
      In recent court cases, however, defense lawyers have argued that
      their clients were caught in possession of Cannabis indica or
      Cannabis ruderalis, and that these materials are not legally
      outlawed since the Marihuana Tax Act specifies Cannabis sativa
      only. Since there are several distinct species of cannabis, they
      argue, then it must be proved that their clients were in
      possession of Cannabis sativa, and since there is no way of making
      such a judgement once the plant is chopped into pieces, they have
      moved for dismissal of any and all charges. Not surprisingly, the
      prosecution. dismisses the polytypic argument and instead argues
      for the monotypic position.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chemistry</b><br>
      <br>
      The chemical materials in cannabis which give it its peculiar
      characteristics are called cannabinoids. Cannabinol, once
      considered the principal active ingredient in marihuana, was
      isolated as early as the 1890s. Subsequent tests, however, showed
      it to be biologically inactive (although recent studies have shown
      that it may affect the actions of other cannabinoids). In the
      1930s, another important cannabinoid, cannabidiol, was isolated,
      but it too was found devoid of biological activity (although like
      cannabinol, it may affect the actions of other cannabinoids).<br>
      <br>
      The major psychoactive substance in marihuana was finally isolated
      and identified in 1964 by two Israeli chemists, Y. Gaoni and R.
      Mechoulam, as l-delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 -THC).
      Subsequently, a number of other cannabinoids have been identified
      which either exert some biological effects of their own or else
      modify the effects of delta-9-THC, among which are delta-8-THC,
      cannabicyclol, cannabichromene, cannabigerol, cannabivarol,
      cannabidivarol, and a long list of similar compounds.<br>
      <br>
      The proportion of these substances in the plant varies according
      to where it is grown. Cannabis grown in the temperate climates,
      where its fiber is strong, contains little delta-9-THC and a
      relatively high proportion of cannabidiol. On the other hand, in
      hot climates where the plant is grown for its psychoactive
      effects, it contains a high proportion of delta-9-THC and
      relatively little cannabidiol.<br>
      <br>
      Actually, there are two main systems of nomenclature where the
      cannabinoids are concerned. The pyran system is the one which
      refers to the principal psychoactive substance in marihuana as
      delta-9-THC, whereas the monoterpenoid system calls this compound
      delta-1-THC. The differences result from the way in which the
      atoms in the tetrahydrocannabinol molecule are numbered.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of tetrahydrocannabinols present in marihuana depends
      on the particular species (i.e.,<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, Cannabis ruderalis) and the
      conditions under which it is raised. Marihuana extract distillate
      may contain as much as 30 percent delta-9-THC, but this is a
      considerably higher percentage than that usually found in
      marihuana. When marihuana is burned as it is when it is smoked,
      however, about 50 percent of the delta-9-THC content may be
      destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      The identification and quantification of delta-9-THC in marihuana
      was an achievement of enormous importance for cannabis research,
      since it meant that at long last it was possible to compare and
      contrast the effects of marihuana used in different laboratories
      and even in different countries. By specifying the delta-9-THC
      content present in the marihuana being tested, scientists had the
      equivalent of a ruler against which they could evaluate the
      potency of a particular sample of marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the cannabinoids, there are a considerable number
      of noncannabinoid compounds present in cannabis, among which are
      various alkaloids, terpenes, phenols, flavonoids, and sugars.
      Whether these materials affect the actions of the cannabinoids in
      any way is unknown as yet. Whatever their contribution, however,
      the most important ingredient in marihuana is still delta-9-THC.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Analysis</b><br>
      <br>
      A major interest in cannabis research, at least from a forensic
      standpoint, has been the development of test procedures to
      identify whether a substance is or is not cannabis.<br>
      <br>
      The two major tests up until very recently have been the Beam and
      Duquenois tests. In the Beam test, cannabis is mixed with alcohol
      and potassium hydroxide. If a purple color develops, cannabis is
      presumed present. The Beam test, however, is more sensitive to
      some cannabinoids (e.g., cannabidiol and cannabigerol) than
      others, and the mixture will not turn purple if these cannabinoids
      are missing. The Duquenois test involves mixing the unknown
      substance with vanillin, acetaldehyde, alcohol, and hydrochloric
      acid. If a violet color develops, the test substance is presumed
      to be cannabis. Although the Duquenois test is more sensitive than
      the Beam test, it is not as specific - a violet color will also
      develop in the presence of other substances, e.g., coffee.<br>
      <br>
      Up until recently, these two tests, in conjunction with botanical
      examination of plant samples, were the methods relied upon by the
      Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs in identifying
      marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      However, other methods have since been developed which are more
      sensitive and are able to determine not only if a substance is
      cannabis, but also which cannabinoids are present, and how much of
      each cannabinoid is contained in a test substance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pharmacology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The smallest amount of delta-9-THC in a marihuana cigarette that
      will produce a "high" is about 5 mg. However, since about 50
      percent of this amount will be destroyed in the smoking process,
      the threshold dose is about 2.5 mg. For a 70-kg man, this would
      amount to a dose of 0.035 mg/kg. Studies of acute toxicity in
      animals indicates that the LD50, i.e., the doses that would kill
      50 percent of the animals, is 42.5 mg/kg if injected directly into
      the blood stream and about 106 mg/kg when inhaled in smoke. In
      other words, a lethal dose of delta-9-THC is about 5000 times
      higher than that which produces a "high."<br>
      <br>
      When smoked, the effects of marihuana begin to be felt in about
      five to fifteen minutes. Maximum effect occurs in about sixty
      minutes. The parts of the body that receive the highest amount of
      the drug are those which have the richest blood supply, e.g., the
      liver, lung, kidney, and spleen. Surprisingly, the brain attains
      relatively low levels compared with these other organs.<br>
      <br>
      Delta-9-THC is metabolized by the liver to
      11-hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-delta-9-THC) which
      also has psychoactive effects. This metabolite is then itself
      broken down into other metabolites, which are in turn broken down
      further, and eventually these metabolites are eliminated through
      the feces and the kidney. About 50 percent of the delta-9-THC
      content in the body is eliminated in the form of metabolites in
      the first twenty-four hours. However, traces of the drug can still
      be found in the human body as long as eight days later.<br>
      <br>
      Studies in animals have shown that the cannabinoids and/or their
      metabolites may accumulate in the brain following frequent
      exposure. The greater the accumulation, the longer it would take
      for the brain to rid itself of the drug and this could account for
      reports of flashbacks and memory impairment in longtime users of
      marihuana.<br>
      <br>
      Tolerance (the phenomenon whereby greater amounts of drug have to
      be taken to receive the same kind of effect originally
      experienced) occurs to some of the drug's effects, but not all. In
      animals, tolerance has been observed in the suppression of
      aggressiveness in Siamese fighting fish, the loss of the righting
      reflex in frogs, analgesia in rats, ataxia in dogs, hypothermia,
      bradycardia, electroencephalographic activity, and brain tissue
      respiration, just to list a few phenomena. On the other hand,
      tolerance has not been observed for the drug's tachycardia effect
      in man.<br>
      <br>
      To account for the claim by many marihuana users that they do not
      become "high" when they first begin using the drug some
      researchers have postulated the concept of "reverse tolerance"
      whereby sensitivity increases, rather than decreases, following
      repeated drug usage However, there is little scientific basis to
      support such a notion. Instead it appears that new users have to
      learn to identify a "high" so that they can recognize it with
      repeated usage.<br>
      <br>
      Closely related to tolerance is the phenomenon of physical
      dependence. Physical dependence is evident when a characteristic
      withdrawal syndrome occurs when chronic drug use is discontinued
      to certain drugs. Although dependence is always associated with
      tolerance, the reverse is not necessarily the case - tolerance
      need not result in drug dependence. The latter seems to be the
      case for marihuana. Although there are a few reports of
      marihuana-related withdrawal symptoms consisting of anxiety,
      restlessness, headache, nausea, sweating, increased pulse rate,
      and acute abdominal cramps, such experiences are uncommon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Physical Effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1968, the first "double-blind" study (in which neither the
      researcher nor the subject knows if marihuana or some inert
      placebo is being tested at the time) was reported by a group of
      Harvard scientists. Although the study was sanctioned by the
      Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the scientists noted that "we do not
      consider it appropriate to describe here the opposition we
      encountered from governmental agents and agencies and from
      university bureaucracies." [24]<br>
      <br>
      Part of the experiment was aimed at comparing the effects of
      marihuana on previous users with people who had never used the
      drug before. It took over two months to locate nine volunteers
      among the Boston college population who qualified for nonuser
      status!<br>
      <br>
      After a series of experiments comparing users and nonusers, the
      researchers could detect no adverse effects from smoking marihuana
      by either group. Marihuana increased heart rate and dilated blood
      vessels in the eye, but did not affect pupil size, respiratory
      rate, or blood sugar levels.<br>
      <br>
      On the basis of their findings, the scientists concluded that
      marihuana was a mild intoxicant and that previous studies in which
      adverse effects had been found had either used doses of marihuana
      that were much higher than those commonly used, and/or failed to
      incorporate proper control procedures which enabled researchers in
      those studies to confirm any preexisting biases they might have
      originally had.<br>
      <br>
      In general most studies have since corroborated these findings. No
      damaging effects to the body have been found resulting from
      occasional use of marihuana. Although marihuana produces many
      changes in the body, these changes rarely have clinical
      importance. This is not to say, however, that chronic use of
      marihuana, or regular use of more potent forms of marihuana than
      that currently available in the United States, may not prove
      harmful.<br>
      <br>
      Several alarming reports over the last few years have, in fact,
      pointed to serious potential dangers resulting from chronic
      marihuana use. Although most of these reports have been refuted,
      they are worthy of attention for what they say and for the flaws
      that have been noted in connection with such studies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adverse Effects</b><br>
      <br>
      Chromosomal Damage. In 1974, Dr. Morton Stenchever reported that
      he had discovered twenty female and twenty-nine male marihuana
      users who had three times the number of chromosomal breaks more
      than a group of twenty nonmarihuana users. [25] Among the users
      with chromosomal damage, twenty-two had used marihuana only once a
      week or less.<br>
      <br>
      However, Stenchever presented little information about his
      marihuana users. He had no idea if they had had any chromosomal
      damage before they had become marihuana users, nor did he know if
      they were users of any other drugs linked to chromosomal damage.<br>
      <br>
      A subsequent study by other researchers failed to corroborate
      Stenchever's results. [26] The subjects in this latter study had
      no chromosomal aberrations before being recruited for the
      experiment nor were they users of any drugs associated with such
      damage.<br>
      <br>
      Immunity Dr. Gabriel Nahas, an outspoken opponent of marihuana
      usage, reported that T-lymphocytes taken from marihuana smokers
      and grown in laboratory cultures exhibited depressed cellular
      immunity responses. [27] Although Nahas's results have been
      corroborated by other scientists, there have also been failures in
      attempts to support this finding. At UCLA, researchers challenged
      the immune systems of chronic marihuana smokers directly, not in a
      laboratory culture. All reacted with strong immune reactions. [28]
      Moreover, there is no evidence linking marihuana to susceptibility
      to colds, infections, or cancer, all of which might be expected if
      marihuana compromised the body's immune systems.<br>
      <br>
      Lung Damage. Several studies have reported serious lung damage on
      the part of chronic marihuana smokers. [29] Bronchitis, emphysema,
      and lesions of lung tissue have been noted in marihuana users, but
      it is not known if it is the kind of smoke (marihuana) or the
      amount of smoke (any smoke, e.g., cigarettes) that is responsible
      for the damage.<br>
      <br>
      Brain Damage. One of the most persistent claims about chronic use
      of marihuana is that it causes brain damage. In 1971, Dr. A. M. G.
      Campbell published a report purporting to document such damage.
      [30] The report concerned air encephalogram measurements in ten
      marihuana smokers who had been using marihuana daily for three to
      eleven years. According to their report, the brains of these
      marihuana users had enlarged cerebral ventricles, suggestive of
      brain atrophy.<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after its publication, however, the report was criticized
      for its shortcomings. One researcher noted that "in the 10 cases
      reported [by Campbell] all 10 men had used LSD - many of them over
      20 times - as well as cannabis, and 8 of the 10 had used
      amphetamines. One subject had a previous history of convulsions,
      four had significant head injuries, and a number had used
      sedatives, barbiturates, heroin, or morphine. On the basis of
      these facts, speculative connection between cannabis use and brain
      damage is highly suspect." [31]<br>
      <br>
      It might also be suggested that the changes in ventricle size
      preceded marihuana usage and that these men had resorted to
      marihuana as one way of coping with whatever symptoms they were
      experiencing as a result of the changes in their brains.<br>
      <br>
      Psychosis. A venerable claim about marihuana is that it causes
      insanity. During the nineteenth century, Moreau had experimented
      with marihuana as a "model psychosis." The Indian Hemp Drugs
      Commission and several other reports by physicians serving in
      India also seriously considered marihuana's potential for mental
      illness. While many of these reports affirmed the possible link
      between chronic cannabis use and mental illness, the methods and
      data of the time would not stand up to modern criteria for such
      studies.<br>
      <br>
      Previously, and even currently, most of the problems associated
      with cannabis came from non-Western countries where malnutrition,
      disease, and various social conditions undoubtedly combined to
      precipitate psychopathology. The use of cannabis by patients in
      psychiatric institutions does not mean that cannabis precipitates
      psychoses. It is just as likely, for instance, that people with
      psychiatric problems will rely on cannabis to deal with their
      problems when cannabis is readily available, just as alcohol is
      often relied on to deal with personal difficulties in this
      country. And although cannabis may precipitate psychiatric illness
      in certain individuals, it may not be very unique in this respect.<br>
      <br>
      By far the most common adverse response to marihuana in this
      country is acute panic. Disorientation, depersonalization,
      confusion, and dizziness sometimes occur in people not accustomed
      to the drug or in people who absorb larger doses than they have
      previously been accustomed to. In such cases, intense panic and
      anxiety are sometimes experienced as a response to these feelings.
      In general, these feelings can be calmed through the support and
      assurance of more experienced users. In any case, they disappear
      as the drug is eliminated from the body.<br>
      <br>
      Another not uncommon reaction to use of marihuana is acute
      paranoia. This response, however, is often a reaction to fear of
      detection by the police.<br>
      <br>
      Several modern-day studies, especially one conducted on chronic
      ganja users in Jamaica, lend no support to the premise of
      marihuana-induced insanity. [32] A 1971 report by Drs. Harold
      Kolansky and William Moore, which appeared in the Journal of the
      American Medical Association, allegedly documenting psychosis in a
      number of their patients, has been discredited. [33] In one of
      these cases, the researchers cite the example of a young boy who
      was seduced by a homosexual who happened to give the boy a
      marihuana cigarette. According to Kolansky and Moore, the
      marihuana made him psychotic!<br>
      <br>
      Amotivational Syndrome. Up until very recently, marihuana has been
      associated with the poor, especially those in certain minority
      groups like the Chicano and the Negro in America. Since there was
      (and still is) little incentive to work harder at menial tasks in
      which these people are often employed, it is not surprising that
      their work output may have been less than expected. And since a
      lack of motivation is contrary to the Protestant work ethic, it
      had to be accounted for. Unless one adopts a racist attitude
      (which many do) and argues that some races are less capable than
      others because they are born that way, other explanations must be
      sought. In the case of marihuana, the fact that it was often
      associated with the poor and underprivileged in many countries
      throughout the world made it a convenient scapegoat upon which to
      blame an apparent lack of motivation on the part of those who used
      the drug.<br>
      <br>
      Recent studies from Jamaica, however, indicate that where
      marihuana (ganja) is an intrinsic part of everyday life, work
      output at menial jobs does not suffer. In rural Jamaica,
      anthropologists report that "rather than hindering, [ganja]
      permits its users to face, start and carry through the most
      difficult and distasteful manual labor.... workers are motivated
      to carry out difficult tasks with no decrease in heavy physical
      exertion, and their perception of increased output is a
      significant factor in bolstering their motivation to work." [34]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapeutic Uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Over its long history, cannabis has been used to treat a multitude
      of medical problems from toothaches to venereal disease. The many
      problems for which it has been tried have been documented
      throughout this book. Adoption of antimarihuana laws throughout
      the world, however, virtually eliminated any modern efforts to
      investigate possible therapeutic applications of the drug. Only in
      recent years has there been a resurgence of research in this area.<br>
      <br>
      Glaucoma. In 1971, during experiments conducted for an altogether
      different purpose, researchers accidentally discovered that
      marihuana substantially reduced intraocular pressure. [35] This
      discovery generated considerable interest on the part of some
      physicians since they saw a possible use for marihuana in the
      treatment of glaucoma - the third-leading cause of blindness in
      America.<br>
      <br>
      Glaucoma is a disorder in which fluid pressure inside the eye
      increases and ultimately damages the optic nerve, causing
      blindness. Subsequent studies have borne out marihuana's ability
      to reduce intraocular pressure among not only glaucoma sufferers,
      but nonsufferers as well. While marihuana has no curative action
      in the disorder, it is able to delay further loss of sight through
      its ability to reduce intraocular pressure. As already noted,
      marihuana's efficacy in the treatment of glaucoma has been
      recognized at both the federal and state levels, and many glaucoma
      sufferers are able to use marihuana legally to treat their
      disorder.<br>
      <br>
      Cancer Chemotherapy. As if they did not already suffer enough,
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience several
      disconcerting and unpleasant side effects of treatment such as
      vomiting and nausea. By chance, one such patient happened to use
      marihuana after receiving chemotherapy and he found that the
      vomiting he usually experienced was alleviated. He reported this
      effect to his doctors, and subsequent testing at the Harvard
      Medical School proved so satisfactory that marihuana has become a
      routine adjunct to cancer chemotherapy at some hospitals. [36]<br>
      <br>
      Asthma. Asthma is a respiratory disorder in which breathing
      becomes labored due to constriction of the bronchial vessels of
      the lung. Among marihuana's many actions in the body is dilation
      of the bronchial vessels, allowing more air to enter the lung.
      Although there are other drugs which also produce bronchodilation,
      marihuana's actions turned out to be longer lasting. [37] Recent
      interest in this potential application for asthma sufferers has
      seen the development of an aerosol of delta-9-THC, but only for
      experimental purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Epilepsy. During the late 1940s, in one of the few studies to be
      conducted with marihuana, researchers reported a beneficial effect
      of the drug in the treatment of epilepsy. [38] Five epileptic
      children were treated. In three cases, the outcome was the same as
      that seen with traditional drug therapy. In the other two,
      seizures were almost entirely suppressed for one child and were
      totally eliminated in the other, although conventional drug
      therapy had previously proven unsatisfactory. Although this report
      should have generated considerable interest among the medical
      profession, it was totally ignored until the 1970s when the
      anticonvulsant properties of certain cannabinoids (particularly
      cannabidiol) were rediscovered and are currently receiving
      clinical testing for possible formal use in the treatment of
      epilepsy.<br>
      <br>
      Other conditions for which marihuana is currently being evaluated
      include hypertension, analgesia, and insomnia. Conceivably,
      marihuana may one again become a familiar drug in the medical drug
      arsenal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary and Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Cannabis is undoubtedly one of the world's most remarkable plants.
      Virtually every part of it has been used and valued at one time or
      another. Its roots have been boiled to make medicine; its seeds
      have been eaten as food by both animals and men, been crushed to
      make industrial oils, and been thrown onto blazing fires to
      release the minute intoxicating cannabinoids within; the fibers
      along its stem have been prized above all others because of their
      strength and durability; and its resin-laden leaves have been
      chewed, steeped in boiling water, or smoked as a medicine and an
      intoxicant.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis is also remarkable for being able to change its sex -
      under certain conditions, male plants can turn into females and
      vice versa. Its hereditary characteristics are also transmutable -
      plants grown from seeds taken from American plants and grown in
      India will, within a few generations, resemble plants that have
      always grown in India more closely than their American relatives,
      and vice versa for seeds taken from India and grown in America.<br>
      <br>
      It is not without reason that cannabis has been many things to
      many people.<br>
      <br>
      For most of its history, cannabis has led two lives. In countries
      such as India and the Middle East, cannabis has been extolled and
      vilified for its resinous exudation; in Russia, Europe, and
      America, national and private fortunes have been built around its
      fiber.<br>
      <br>
      Around 1850, East conquered West. Cannabis fiber was replaced by
      other materials and cannabis resin began appearing in doctors'
      bags, pharmacies, cafes and private homes. At first, it was simply
      a novelty in the West, something to conjure up the mystery and
      enchantment of far-off countries. Writers and artists, and later
      musicians, intoxicated themselves with it because they felt it
      expanded their consciousness and gave them insights unattainable
      by other means. There was little concern over the use of the drug
      until the middle classes across Europe and America began to notice
      that minority groups, immigrants from certain countries, and the
      unskilled working class (often one and the same) were using the
      drug. Because these people seemed unmotivated, lazy, prone to
      criminality, sexual promiscuity, and mental illness, cannabis came
      to be regarded as a social danger, responsible for these and all
      other ills characteristic of the lower socioeconomic classes.
      Whereas these people used marijuana to help them cope with the
      drudgery of their everyday lives, the middle classes considered
      that marijuana was responsible for their problems. Each class saw
      cause and effect in a different perspective.<br>
      <br>
      The middle-class perception of marijuana as evil has persisted
      over the centuries and has been almost universal until the last
      fifteen years. Only after the sons and daughters of prominent
      middle-class parents had been arrested and branded as criminals,
      and in many cases sentenced to long terms in prison, only after it
      became apparent that marijuana was no longer a minority-group
      problem, only after fear and panic about marijuana's alleged
      dangers began to dissipate in the light of evidence to the
      contrary from their own sons and daughters, only when the
      erstwhile marijuana users became the nation's lawmakers - only
      then did attitudes and laws about marijuana change.<br>
      <br>
      The 12,000-year-long history of cannabis clearly shows that laws
      against its usage - whether it was hashish in the Arab countries,
      dagga in Africa, or marijuana in America - have been adopted in
      response to a perceived threat to society. Since the main users of
      cannabis drugs were typically poor and from minority groups as
      well, cannabis was a feared substance, something capable of
      unleashing the unbridled passions thought to be characteristic of
      these people. Only when marijuana became commonplace were such
      beliefs challenged and disregarded.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, it is fashionable to single out Harry
      Anslinger as the cunning, ruthless mastermind behind the country's
      antimarijuana laws. True enough, Anslinger was not above
      distortion and exploitation of the marijuana issue when it suited
      his purposes. He felt that the ends justified the means, and for
      Anslinger, marijuana posed a danger to the nation that had to be
      suppressed. In Anslinger's mind, drug use, whether narcotics or
      marijuana, was a criminal act, not a disease. As such, it had to
      be fought and overcome by any means available.<br>
      <br>
      Had it not been for Anslinger, the United States might not have
      witnessed as concerted an effort to outlaw marijuana nationally as
      it did, but there still would probably have been some federal
      legislation outlawing the drug. Other countries had such laws and
      did not have any Anslinger-like bureaucrat to muster support for
      these laws. The combination of the man, the office, and the times
      fashioned America's policy towards marijuana - other countries
      adopted antimarijuana laws because they also perceived a threat
      from marijuana or because they felt obliged to do so as a result
      of agreement on the international level, to oppose and restrict
      marijuana usage. One man, whatever the issue, does not
      single-handedly persuade an entire nation to persecute a group of
      people or a drug like marijuana.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever marijuana's past, its future will inevitably be that of
      decriminilization and eventual legalization, subject no doubt to
      the same regulatory measures as those that apply to alcohol.
      Whether the United States and the rest of the world faces a real
      threat to its social and economic stability, to progress, and to
      morality (however they are defined), as a result of the
      liberalization of marijuana (and other drugs) is left to the
      future. If the past is any example, instability, lack of progress,
      and immorality will or will not occur regardless of whatever
      happens where marijuana is concerned.<br>

      54. In his Dictionary of Assyrian Botany (p. 220), Campbell
      identified the Sumerian term a-zal-la and the Akkadian term azulla
      as cannabis on the basis of their similarities to the Syrian azal,
      meaning "to spin". Campbell also took the Assyrian word gurgurangu
      as another reference to cannabis because of its similarity to
      garganinj, the Persian word for cannabis. Building on these
      similarities, Campbell then identified the Sumerian drug
      gan-zi-gun-na as hashish [literally, a robber (gan) who spins away
      (gun-nu) the soul (zi)]. Campbell also felt that the similarity
      between gan-zi and the Hindu word qanjha also supports his
      arguments. However, in a later discussion of this issue (p. 229),
      he acknowledges the possibility that the Sumerian and Akkadian
      words he tentatively identified as hashish could just as likely be
      words denoting narcotics in general and opium specifically.<br>
      A letter written around 680 B.C. by an unknown woman to the mother
      of the Assyrian king, Esarhaddon, mentions a substance called
      qu-nu-bu which also may have been cannabis, but again there is no
      certainty for this identification. Cf. L. Waterman, Royal
      Correspondence of the Assyrian Empire (Ann Arbor: University of
      Michigan Press, 1930), letter 368.<br>

      There is also no reference to cannabis in any of the hieroglyphic
      writings on historical documents during the time of the pharaohs.
      The earliest reference to hashish in Egypt occurs in the twelfth
      century A.D. (Ayyubid dynasty). Not long thereafter, the drug
      became a controversial issue in Egyptian society and laws were
      passed to outlaw its usage (see Chapter 2).<br>
