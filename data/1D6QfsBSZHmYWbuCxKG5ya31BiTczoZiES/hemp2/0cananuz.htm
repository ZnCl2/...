      <p>For&nbsp; the&nbsp; health-conscious&nbsp; pothead&nbsp;
        who&nbsp; can't&nbsp; afford&nbsp; or&nbsp; can't get
        motivated&nbsp; to&nbsp; use a vaporizer, the mother of all
        questions has to be: does&nbsp; smoking&nbsp; cannabis&nbsp;
        lower&nbsp; life expectancy? A recent editorial in the&nbsp;
        British&nbsp; Medical Journal generated ominous headlines,
        attributing&nbsp; some&nbsp; 30,000&nbsp; deaths&nbsp;
        annually&nbsp; in the UK to cannabis smoking. But you can&nbsp;
        relax&nbsp; a&nbsp; little,&nbsp; dear&nbsp; reader:&nbsp; the
        authors simply extrapolated from&nbsp; the&nbsp; number&nbsp; of
        deaths caused by cigarette smoking (120,000) and assumed&nbsp;
        that&nbsp; pot&nbsp; smoking&nbsp; was&nbsp; 1/4 as common and
        equally dangerous. </p>
      <p>In&nbsp; the&nbsp; Sept.&nbsp; 20&nbsp; BMJ, Stephen Sidney, MD
        -the associate director of clinical&nbsp; research&nbsp;
        for&nbsp; Kaiser Permanente, who has conducted the most relevant
        studies-explains how to approach the question scientifically: </p>
      <p>"Firstly,&nbsp; we&nbsp; need&nbsp; to&nbsp; examine&nbsp;
        published&nbsp; data&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; use&nbsp; of
        cannabis&nbsp; and&nbsp; mortality.&nbsp; These data come from
        two large studies. The first&nbsp; study&nbsp; done&nbsp; in a
        cohort of 45,450 male Swedish conscripts, age 18-20&nbsp;
        when&nbsp; interviewed&nbsp; about&nbsp; the&nbsp; use&nbsp;
        of&nbsp; cannabis,&nbsp; reported&nbsp; no increase&nbsp;
        in&nbsp; the&nbsp; 15-year&nbsp; mortality&nbsp;
        associated&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of cannabis
        after social factors were taken into account. </p>

      <p>Men&nbsp; who&nbsp; smoke marijuana frequently damage their
        fertility in several different ways, research suggests.
        Scientists at Buffalo University found regular smokers had
        significantly less seminal fluid, and a lower sperm count.
        Their&nbsp; sperm&nbsp; were&nbsp; also&nbsp; more&nbsp;
        likely&nbsp; to&nbsp; swim&nbsp; too&nbsp; fast too early,
        leading to burn-out before they reach the egg. Dr&nbsp;

        Children born to mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy may
        suffer a host of lasting mental defects, suggests a new study in
        rats. Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug among women
        of reproductive age. </p>
      <p>The offspring of pregnant rats given a low dose of cannabinoid
        were found to perform poorly in learning tests throughout their
        lives, compared to rats that were not exposed. </p>
      <p>The Italian research team found that long-term learning in the
        rats was damaged by the cannabinoids irreversibly disrupting
        chemical and electrical processes in the brain during gestation.
        The exposed rats were also more hyperactive as infants, although
        this effect wore off as the rats reached adulthood. </p>
      <p>Vincenzo Cuomo, at the La Sapienza University in Rome, and
        colleagues suggest that similar brain effects could explain
        learning problems in children born to mothers who use the soft
        drug during pregnancy. </p>
      <p>"This is absolutely relevant," says Peter Fried, a psychologist
        at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who has done similar
        work in humans. "What they have found is very consistent with
        what we have found in humans." </p>
      <p><b>Confounding Factors ~</b> </p>
      <p>The possible effects of maternal marijuana use on the unborn
        child and the child's later behaviour are controversial, say
        Cuomo and colleagues. They argue that rat studies can be very
        useful in assessing human effects, because studies of people can
        be hampered by complex confounding factors. These could include
        cigarette smoking, wealth or urban living. </p>
      <p>In the study, pregnant rats were injected with a low dose of an
        artificial cannabinoid. Offspring exposed to the drug during
        gestation showed hyperactivity during infancy and adolescence,
        as measured by how many times they broke infrared beams
        crisscrossing their cages. </p>
      <p>This stopped when they reached adulthood, but was replaced by
        problems with memory retention. The researchers showed reduced
        levels of a messenger chemical called glutamate in the
        hippocampus, part of the brain associated with learning and
        visual ability. They also found disruption of electrical
        processes associated with learning in this region. </p>
      <p>Fried told <i>New Scientist</i> that as well as affecting
        memory and learning, exposure to marijuana during pregnancy has
        a strong effect on visual mapping and analysis in human
        children. </p>

      <p>Drugs derived from cannabis plants could help to relieve
        symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, according to research
        published today. </p>
      <p>Researchers examined anecdotal evidence that cannabis eases the
        unpleasant symptoms associated with the disease. Their findings,
        published in the journal Gastroenterology, will give hope for
        sufferers of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, forms of
        IBD which affect up to 180,000 people in Britain. </p>
      <p>The disease causes recurrent bouts of severe abdominal pain,
        diarrhoea, fever and weight loss, and puts sufferers at a
        greater risk of bowel cancer. </p>
      <p>Patients are usually treated with steroids to reduce the
        inflammation and surgery is sometimes required to remove damaged
        parts of the intestine, but there is currently no cure for
        Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. </p>
      <p>Dr Karen Wright, of the department of pharmacy and pharmacology
        at the University of Bath, who led the study, said that using
        cannabinoids, a cannabis extract, helped the body recover from
        some effects of the diseases and heal the gut lining. </p>

        Smoking marijuana can affect blood flow in the brain so much
        that it takes over a month to return to normal. And for heavy
        smokers, the effects could last much longer, a new study
        suggests. </p>
      <p>Regular marijuana use can harm memory and the ability to make
        decisions, according to Jean Cadet at the National Institute on
        Drug Abuse in Baltimore, Maryland, US. To find out why, he
        monitored the flow of blood through the brains of 54 marijuana
        smokers, among whom the heaviest user smoked 50 joints every
        day. </p>
      <p>People who smoked cannabis had higher blood flow through their
        brains than non-users. Yet there was also greater resistance to
        the blood flow, suggesting that cannabis changes the blood
        vessels in the brain in a way which hinders oxygen in reaching
        the tissue effectively. In an attempt to compensate, extra blood
        is sent to that part of the brain, increasing resistance but
        probably failing to get enough oxygen through the vessels, Cadet
        suggests. </p>
      <p>Cadet and his colleagues used an extremely sensitive
        non-invasive technique called transcranial Doppler sonography to
        "see" the blood flow through individual arteries from the head's
        surface. </p>
      <p>After a month without cannabis - during which the volunteers
        agreed to remain in a clinic, with no access to marijuana --
        Cadet repeated the sonography. The resistance to blood flow of
        light and moderate users - who usually smoked an average of 11
        and 44 joints per week, respectively --&nbsp; was starting to
        return to normal. </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Neuropsychological problems ~</font></b> </p>
      <p>But there was no improvement observed in the heavy users, who
        smoked an average of 131 joints per week. "We were surprised
        because we'd expected that as marijuana cleared the system
        things would improve," says Cadet. He now wants to see if there
        is a link between the changes in the brain's blood flow and the
        extent of neuropsychological problems. </p>
      <p>To eliminate the effect of tobacco in the joints, Cadet
        compared his results to those obtained from smokers, who showed
        normal blood flow. But, says William Notcutt of James Paget
        Hospital in Norfolk, UK, the longer-term effect on the brain may
        not have been caused by the same substance that produces the
        high. </p>
      <p>"Somebody smoking 50 joints per day is getting a huge number of
        carcinogens from the marijuana plant," he notes. "We know the
        cardiovascular effect [of cannabis] is very complex and
        multi-factorial so it's not as simple as with other drugs. The
        group that needs to be studied now is people that use high
        quality medicinal extracts." </p>
      <p>He adds that the results may also be different for people that
        only smoke marijuana occasionally, and so are exposed to lower
        doses of the toxic substances. </p>

        university-based scientists ( most of whom get funding from the
        U.S.&nbsp; National Institute on Drug Abuse ).&nbsp; Over the
        years, Tashkin's lab at UCLA has produced irrefutable evidence
        of the damage that marijuana smoke wreaks on bronchial
        tissue.&nbsp; With NIDA's support, Tashkin and colleagues have
        identified the potent carcinogens in marijuana smoke, biopsied
        and made photomicrographs of pre-malignant cells, and studied
        the molecular changes occurring within them.&nbsp; It is
        Tashkin's research that the Drug Czar's office cites in ads
        linking marijuana to lung cancer.&nbsp; Tashkin himself has long
        believed in a causal relationship, despite a study in which
        Stephen Sidney examined the files of 64,000 Kaiser patients and
        found that marijuana users didn't develop lung cancer at a
        higher rate or die earlier than non-users.&nbsp; Of five smaller
        studies on the question, only two -involving a total of about
        300 patients- concluded that marijuana smoking causes lung
        cancer.&nbsp; Tashkin decided to settle the question by
        conducting a large, prospectively designed, population-based,
        case-controlled study.&nbsp; "Our major hypothesis," he told the
        ICRS, "was that heavy, longterm use of marijuana will increase
        the risk of lung and upper-airwaves cancers." </p>
      <p>The Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance program provided
        Tashkin's team with the names of 1,209 L.A.&nbsp; residents aged
        59 or younger with cancer ( 611 lung, 403 oral/pharyngeal, 90
        laryngeal, 108 esophageal ).&nbsp; Interviewers collected
        extensive lifetime histories of marijuana, tobacco, alcohol and
        other drug use, and data on diet, occupational exposures, family
        history of cancer, and various "socio-demographic factors."
        Exposure to marijuana was measured in joint years ( joints per
        day x 365 ).&nbsp; Controls were found based on age, gender and
        neighborhood.&nbsp; Among them, 46% had never used marijuana,
        31% had used less than one joint year, 12% had used 10-30 j-yrs,
        2% had used 30-60 j-yrs, and 3% had used for more than 60
        j-yrs.&nbsp; Tashkin controlled for tobacco use and calculated
        the relative risk of marijuana use resulting in lung and upper
        airwaves cancers.&nbsp; All the odds ratios turned out to be
        less than one ( one being equal to the control group's chances
        )! Compared with subjects who had used less than one joint year,
        the estimated odds ratios for lung cancer were .78; for 1-10
        j-yrs, .74; for 10-30 j-yrs, .85 for 30-60 j-yrs; and 0.81 for
        more than 60 j-yrs.&nbsp; The estimated odds ratios for
        oral/pharyngeal cancers were 0.92 for 1-10 j-yrs; 0.89 for 10-30
        j-yrs; 0.81 for 30-60 j-yrs; and 1.0 for more than 60
        j-yrs.&nbsp; "Similar, though less precise results were obtained
        for the other cancer sites," Tashkin reported.&nbsp; "We found
        absolutely no suggestion of a dose response." The data on
        tobacco use, as expected, revealed "a very potent effect and a
        clear dose-response relationship -a 21-fold greater risk of
        developing lung cancer if you smoke more than two packs a day."
        Similarly high odds obtained for oral/pharyngeal cancer,
        laryngeal cancer and esophageal cancer.&nbsp; "So, in summary"
        Tashkin concluded, "we failed to observe a positive association
        of marijuana use and other potential confounders." </p>
      <p>There was time for only one question, said the moderator, and
        San Francisco oncologist Donald Abrams, M.D., was already at the
        microphone: "You don't see any positive correlation, but in at
        least one category [marijuana-only smokers and lung cancer], it
        almost looked like there was a negative correlation, i.e., a
        protective effect.&nbsp; Could you comment on that?" </p>
      <p>"Yes," said Tashkin.&nbsp; "The odds ratios are less than one
        almost consistently, and in one category that relationship was
        significant, but I think that it would be difficult to extract
        from these data the conclusion that marijuana is protective
        against lung cancer.&nbsp; But that is not an unreasonable
        hypothesis." </p>
      <p>Abrams had results of his own to report at the ICRS
        meeting.&nbsp; He and his colleagues at San Francisco General
        Hospital had conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study
        involving 50 patients with HIV-related peripheral
        neuropathy.&nbsp; Over the course of five days, patients
        recorded their pain levels in a diary after smoking either
        NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes or cigarettes from which the
        THC had been extracted.&nbsp; About 25% didn't know or guessed
        wrong as to whether they were smoking the placebos, which
        suggests that the blinding worked.&nbsp; Abrams requested that
        his results not be described in detail prior to publication in a
        peer-reviewed medical journal, but we can generalize: they
        exceeded expectations, and show marijuana providing pain relief
        comparable to Gabapentin, the most widely used treatment for a
        condition that afflicts some 30% of patients with HIV. </p>
      <p>To a questioner who bemoaned the difficulty of "separating the
        high from the clinical benefits," Abrams replied: "I'm an
        oncologist as well as an AIDS doctor and I don't think that a
        drug that creates euphoria in patients with terminal diseases is
        having an adverse effect." His study was funded by the
        University of California's Center for Medicinal Cannabis
        Research. </p>

          Sanofi in the early '90s as a research tool. If a given effect
          is blocked by SR-141716, that effect is said to be mediated by
          CB1 receptors. Rimonabant is SR-141716 redefined as a

          in phase--three clinical trials involving 13,000 patients. The
          trials were conducted at numerous sites in the U.S. Obese
          patients were treated with Rimonabant for 52 weeks. "Over 72%
          of patients at 1 year showed a weight loss of greater than 5
          percent, with over 44% showing a weight loss of greater than
          10%," according to Le Fur. "There was also an increase in
          HDL-cholesterol values, a reduction in triglyceride values and
          reductions in glucose and insulin values... The general
          tolerance of the compound was excellent."</font> </p>

        justify="justify"><font color="#000000">But the advent of
          Rimonabant troubles California doctors who have made a
          specialty of monitoring their patients' cannabis use, as well
          as some scientists who are studying the basic nature of the
          cannabinoid system. Jeffrey Hergenrather, MD, of Sebastopol --
          one of the few clinicians to attend the ICRS meeting, which
          was held in Paestum, Italy, in late June -- says "We are only
          now be becoming aware of the modulating effects the
          cannabinoids have on the body and mind. The consequences of
          interfering with the cannabinoid receptor system have not been
          evaluated in normal human physiology."</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Le Fur and other Sanofi researchers were
          asked how a drug could block the CB1 receptor system without
          adversely affecting mood, sleep, pain relief, and other
          CB1--mediated aspects of well -- being. The answers were vague
          -- other neurotransmitters may play compensatory roles. We
          were told that no pattern of adverse effects had been observed
          during the clinical trials, and that such effects are probably
          so rare that they won't be detectable until Rimonabant has
          been used by millions of people over a period of years.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The developer of another antagonist drug,
          a rival of Sanofi's, claimed that Rimonabant induced "food
          aversion" in five percent of the test subjects. Le Fur
          responded that obesity was such a widespread and serious
          health problem that five percent seems like an acceptable rate
          of anorexia. Other criticisms and misgivings were only
          whispered. A multiple sclerosis specialist told of a case in
          which Rimonabant apparently caused an immediate, extreme
          exacerbation. A physician wondered -- since the body's own
          cannabinoids have neuroprotectant and anti-oxidant functions
          -- if Rimonabant users would be at increased risk for stroke
          and cancer. But the negative remarks were anecdotal or
          speculative; the positive data belonged to Sanofi.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Le Fur and two colleagues accepted the
          ICRS's 2004 achievement award on behalf of their company. It
          was presented by Mechoulam, the grand old man of the field.
          who observed that Sanofi had shown great foresight in
          developing a weight -- loss drug in the late 1990s, because it
          has since swallowed up two much larger drug companies,
          Synthelabo and Aventis.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">From the perspective of the scientists in
          the ICRS -- mainly employees of universities or pharmaceutical
          companies who get funding from the U.S. National Institute on
          Drug Abuse-- it's a win--win--win to honor Sanofi for
          developing CB-receptor antagonists as "new therapeutic drugs."
          NIDA is eager to sponsor research involving cannabinoid
          antagonists. A lot will be learned about the cannabinoid
          system, its mechanism of action, etc. And a therapeutic effect
          is a therapeutic effect, whether it's produced by activating
          or blocking the cannabinoid receptors.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But common sense and a few cautious
          clinicians say DANGER DANGER DANGER. CB1 receptors are
          concentrated in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia
          (responsible for motor control, which may help explain why
          marijuana eases muscle spasticity in disorders like multiple
          sclerosis), the hippocampus (responsible for storage of
          short-term memory), and the limbic system (emotional control).</font>

      <p>Drugs that boost cannabinoids could help people who suffer
        post-traumatic stress disorder, phobias and panic attacks, say
        the researchers. </p>
      <p>Its "a great new idea," says neuroscientist Pankaj Sah of the
        Australian National University in Canberra: "It introduces a
        whole new target," for such therapies, he says. </p>
      <p>Phobics are often treated by gradually exposing them to the
        object of their fear in a safe environment, to erase the bad
        association. Lutz suggests that cannabinoid-enhancing drugs,
        taken at the same time as this exposure, might aid memory
        clearance. </p>
      <p>A joint is unlikely to do the trick: smoking floods the brain
        with cannabis's active ingredient and produces other effects
        such as memory changes and pain relief. More effective would be
        a drug that raised levels of cannabinoids only in the brain's
        fear centre, the amygdala, says Lutz. </p>
      <p><b>Shock Tactics ~</b> </p>
      <p>Lutz's team gave mice mild shocks while playing a loud tone,
        until the animals froze at the noise alone. When the shocks
        stopped, mice normally forgot the ordeal and stopped freezing in
        less than a week. Mice genetically engineered to lack the
        receptors that bind to cannabinoids were unable to forget within
        that time. </p>
      <p>During memory erasure the amygdala is flooded with
        cannabinoids; these dampen the action of nerve cells. </p>
      <p>Lutz is now giving normal mice cannabinoid boosters to see if
        they forget learnt fears more quickly. </p>
      <p>Other brain chemicals are involved in erasing fear. Clinical
        trials are planned for compounds that activate NMDA receptors in
        the amygdala, which are also involved in erasing unpleasant
        memories. </p>

        Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) experience

      <p>The survey is the first ever conducted regarding use of
        medicinal cannabis among patients with ALS. Also known as Lou

                'More Harmful' Than Tobacco"</font></font></b> </p>
        <p>by <br>
          <b>Emma Young</b></p>

      <p><br>
        Smoking pure marijuana is at least as harmful to lungs as
        smoking tobacco, a report from the British Lung Foundation
        concludes. And in some key ways, it may be more dangerous. </p>
      <p>For example, the BLF's review of previous research highlights
        that just three marijuana joints a day causes the same damage to
        the lung's airways as 20 cigarettes, mainly because of the way
        joints are smoked. </p>
      <p>Individually, cannabis and tobacco produce the same
        constituents and quantities of chemicals known to be toxic to
        respiratory tissue, other than nicotine, the report says. But
        when cannabis and tobacco are smoked together, the health
        effects are worse. </p>
      <p>"These statistics will come as a surprise to many people,
        especially those who choose to smoke cannabis rather than
        tobacco in the belief it is safer for them," says Mark Britton,
        chairman of the BLF. A UK survey conducted earlier in 2002 found
        that 79 per cent of children believed cannabis to be 'safe'. </p>
      <p><b>Deep Breath ~</b> </p>
      <p>A key finding highlighted by the review of 90 published papers
        is that the amount of smoke taken into the lungs is two thirds
        larger if cannabis is being smoked. The smoke is also taken one
        third deeper into the lungs -- and that smoke is held an average
        of four times longer before being exhaled. </p>
      <p>"You inhale deeper and hold your breath with the smoke for
        longer before exhaling. This results in more poisonous carbon
        monoxide and tar entering into the lungs," says Helena
        Shovelton, BLF's chief executive. </p>
      <p>Other points in the report include: </p>
      <p>Tar from cannabis cigarettes contains up to 50 per cent higher
        concentrations of carcinogens benzathracenes and benzpyrenes
        than tobacco smoke; </p>
      <p>THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, decreases
        the function of immune system cells that help protect the lungs
        from infection; </p>
      <p>The average cannabis cigarette smoked in the 1960s contained
        about 10 milligrams of tetrahydrocanabinol (THC), the primary
        psychoactive ingredient. Today, it may contain 150 mg. </p>
      <p>"This means that the modern cannabis smoker may be exposed to
        greater doses of THC than in the 1960s or 1970s," says the
        report. "This in turn means that studies investigating the
        long-term effects of smoking cannabis have to be interpreted
        cautiously." </p>
      <p><b>Mouth Spray ~</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis is the most widely consumed illegal drug in the UK. In
        2000, almost 45 per cent of 16 to 29 year olds in the UK said
        they had used cannabis at some point. </p>
      <p>"We are not making any policy recommendations. The aim of this
        report is to try to inform the public that if you do choose to
        smoke cannabis, be aware of the health risks," says a BLF
        spokeswoman. </p>
      <p>Cannabis-based medicines could be prescribed for medical use in
        the UK as early as 2003, following the recent success of
        final-stage trials. But medicinal cannabis is supplied through a
        mouth spray or in tablet form. </p>
      <p>"We have always been keen to find additional ways of
        administering cannabis as a medicine," says Nina Booth-Clibborn
        of the UK's Medicinal Cannabis Research Foundation. "It did seem
        that smoking would not be the best way." </p>
      <p>Lyndon Pugh, editor of pro-cannabis magazine CC Newz, is not
        impressed by the report: "These allegations have been made
        before countless times. Lot of things are dangerous, like
        driving." <br>

              Learning"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
        Children born to mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy may
        suffer a host of lasting mental defects, suggests a new study in
        rats. Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug among women
        of reproductive age. </p>
      <p>The offspring of pregnant rats given a low dose of cannabinoid
        were found to perform poorly in learning tests throughout their
        lives, compared to rats that were not exposed. </p>
      <p>The Italian research team found that long-term learning in the
        rats was damaged by the cannabinoids irreversibly disrupting
        chemical and electrical processes in the brain during gestation.
        The exposed rats were also more hyperactive as infants, although
        this effect wore off as the rats reached adulthood. </p>
      <p>Vincenzo Cuomo, at the La Sapienza University in Rome, and
        colleagues suggest that similar brain effects could explain
        learning problems in children born to mothers who use the soft
        drug during pregnancy. </p>
      <p>"This is absolutely relevant," says Peter Fried, a psychologist
        at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who has done similar
        work in humans. "What they have found is very consistent with
        what we have found in humans." </p>
      <p><b>Confounding Factors ~</b> </p>
      <p>The possible effects of maternal marijuana use on the unborn
        child and the child's later behaviour are controversial, say
        Cuomo and colleagues. They argue that rat studies can be very
        useful in assessing human effects, because studies of people can
        be hampered by complex confounding factors. These could include
        cigarette smoking, wealth or urban living </p>

      <p>Smoking cannabis does not have a long-term effect on
        intelligence, say researchers in Canada who have followed
        volunteers from before birth to early adulthood. </p>
      <p>Heavy pot smokers did experience a dip in their intelligence
        quotient (IQ). But people who had once smoked heavily and then
        given up were right back up to normal, the study found. Light

      <p>What the researchers do not know is if decades of pot-smoking
        could have a more lasting impact. Looking at long-term users in
        their 30s and 40s could show different results, admits Peter

      <p><br>
        The link between regular cannabis use and later depression and
        schizophrenia has been significantly strengthened by three new
        studies. </p>
      <p>The studies provide "little support" for an alternative
        explanation - that people with mental illnesses self-medicate
        with marijuana - according to Joseph Rey and Christopher Tennant
        of the University of Sydney, who have written an editorial on
        the papers in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. </p>
      <p>One of the key conclusions of the research is that people who
        start smoking cannabis as adolescents are at the greatest risk
        of later developing mental health problems. Another team
        calculates that eliminating cannabis use in the UK population
        could reduce cases of schizophrenia by 13 per cent. </p>
      <p>Until now, say Rey and Tennant, there was "a dearth of reliable
        evidence" to support the idea that cannabis use could cause
        schizophrenia or depression. That lack of good evidence "has
        handicapped the development of rational public health policies,"
        according to one of the research groups, led by George Patton at
        the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne,
        Australia. </p>
      <p>The works also highlights potential risks associated with using
        cannabis as a medicine to ease the symptoms of muscular
        sclerosis, for example. </p>
      <p><b>Pharmacological Effect ~</b> </p>
      <p>Patton's team followed over 1600 Australian school pupils aged
        14 to 15 for seven years. Daily cannabis use was associated with
        a five-fold increased risk of depression at the age of 20.
        Weekly use was linked to a two-fold increase. The regular users
        were no more likely to have suffered from depression or anxiety
        at the start of the study. </p>
      <p>The reason for the link is unclear. Social consequences of
        frequent cannabis use include educational failure and
        unemployment, which could increase the risk of depression.
        "However, because the risk seems confined largely to daily
        users, the question about a direct pharmacological effect
        remains," says Patton. </p>
      <p>In separate research, a team led by Stanley Zammit at the
        University of Cardiff, UK, evaluated data on over 50,000 men who
        had been Swedish military conscripts in 1969 and1970. This group
        represents 97 per cent of men aged 18 to 20 in the population at
        that time. </p>
      <p>The new analysis revealed a dose-dependant relationship between
        the frequency of cannabis use and schizophrenia. This held true
        in men with no psychotic symptoms before they started using
        cannabis, suggesting they were not self-medicating. </p>
      <p><b>Genetic Factors ~</b> </p>
      <p>Finally, researchers led by Terrie Moffitt at King's College
        London, UK, analysed comprehensive data on over 1000 people born
        in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972 and 1973. </p>
      <p>They found that people who used cannabis by age 15 were four
        times as likely to have a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder
        (a milder version of schizophrenia) at age 26 than non-users. </p>
      <p>But when the number of psychotic symptoms at age 11 was
        controlled for, this increased risk dropped to become
        non-significant. This suggests that people already at greater
        risk of later developing mental health problems are also more
        likely to smoke cannabis. </p>
      <p>The total number of high quality studies on cannabis use and
        mental health disorders remains small, stress Rey and Tennant.
        And it is still not clear whether cannabis can cause these
        conditions in people not predisposed by genetic factors, for
        example, to develop them. </p>
      <p>"The overall weight of evidence is that occasional use of
        cannabis has few harmful effects overall," Zammit's team writes.
        "Nevertheless, our results indicate a potentially serious risk
        to the mental health of people who use cannabis. Such risks need
        to be considered in the current move to liberalise and possibly
        legalise the use of cannabis in the UK and other countries." </p>

      <dt>Oxford, United Kingdom -- Moderate cannabis use, even
        long-term, is "relatively safe" when compared to the health
        effects of other recreational intoxicants, according to a
        scientific review published in the February issue of the journal
        Current Opinion in Pharmacology.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>"A review of the literature suggests that the majority of
        cannabis users, who use the drug occasionally rather than on a
        daily basis, will not suffer any lasting physical or mental
        harm," writes the study's author, Dr. Leslie Iversen of the
        University of Oxford. "Overall, by comparison with other drugs
        used mainly for 'recreational' purposes, cannabis could be rated
        to be a relatively safe drug."</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>The author concludes that there is little evidence that
        long-term cannabis use causes permanent cognitive impairment or
        has an adverse effect on global intelligence. Iversen does
        acknowledge, however, that smoking marijuana long-term may cause
        "the possibility of damage to the airways," though he admits
        that "little progress has been made in quantifying such risks."
        The author also notes that various longitudinal studies have
        found an association between the long-term, heavy use of
        cannabis and specific adverse psychosocial features, including
        lower educational achievement, though he acknowledges that there
        exists no "clear cause and effect relationship to explain the
        psychosocial associations."</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      NORML Executive Director Allen St. Pierre praised the review,
      stating: "Marijuana is not a harmless substance, though its
      scientifically acknowledged harms are quite minimal compared to
      other legally regulated intoxicants, including alcohol and
      tobacco. By far the greatest danger to health posed by the
      responsible use of cannabis in the United States today stems from
      a criminal arrest or conviction." For more information, please

      <h4>Introduction ~</h4>
      Results from the study of the "Incidence of alcohol and drugs in
      road accident fatalities" have consistently shown a large increase
      in the incidence of drugs in fatal road casualties (drivers,
      riders, passengers and pedestrians) since the last comparable
      study in the mid-1980s. The latest results show that among all
      road users traces of illicit drugs were present in 18% of
      fatalities. These figures represent a six-fold increase in
      presence of illicit drugs when compared with the previous study.
      Cannabis constitutes around two thirds of the illegal drugs found.
      <p>Despite the increase in the incidence of drugs, it is not
        possible to say that drugs caused these deaths. There may be an
        association, but presence cannot be taken as evidence of
        causation - there is no way of telling how much was consumed and
        how long before the fatal accident. So far as cannabis is
        concerned, the prevalence in drivers was not significantly
        different from that of passengers, who can be taken as a (albeit
        imperfect) measure of the prevalence in the population as a
        whole. However, cannabis remains detectable in the body for up
        to four weeks after use - long after any impairment of driving.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, in most surveys reported in Europe cannabis is the
        most frequently detected illicit drug. In a range of accident
        involved populations cannabis is found with an incidence between
        2 and 12% with a mode incidence around 5-8%. This is certainly
        significantly above that of any other illicit drug. </p>
      <p>Previous research studies on cannabis and driving have focussed
        largely on the effects of cannabinoids on driving performance.
        These studies have been almost exclusively experimental,
        involving laboratory tasks, driving simulator and on road 'real
        driving' experiments. A much smaller number of studies have
        attempted to gain broader sociological information about driving
        habits under the influence of cannabis and what factors
        influence the decision to drive. This research attempted to
        combine these two aspects, certainly for the first time in the
        UK, with a view to assessing the degree to which there may be a
        problem with cannabis in relation to driving. The research had
        three primary objectives: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <li>To provide reliable data, under laboratory conditions, on
          the impairing effects of cannabis on driving.</li>
        <li>To determine the duration and extent of any impairment under
          different degrees of intoxication (using different levels of
          cannabis).</li>
        <li>To provide an overview of attitudes and habits of cannabis
          users in relation to driving and explore factors which may
          influence the decision to drive under its influence.</li>
      </blockquote>
      The research attempted to address these objectives using
      experienced cannabis users carrying out a variety of
      laboratory-based tasks and driving in a simulator under four
      cannabis conditions: placebo; low THC; high THC; and cannabis
      resin. The placebo, low and high dose THC conditions used herbal
      cannabis ('grass') cigarettes supplied by the National Institute
      on Drug Abuse (NIDA), while the cannabis resin condition used
      cannabis supplied by Customs and Excise from seized supplies.
      <p>In 1999 the DETR commissioned a review of the latest evidence
        of the impairment effects of cannabis. That report provided an
        overview of the effects of cannabis on driving and accident risk
        and identified key research questions for areas where current
        knowledge was deemed to be insufficient to guide road safety
        policy. These research questions have shaped and informed the
        current research project. In addition to the primary objectives
        outlined above, the research reported here sought to inform four
        key issues identified by the review. </p>
      <p>These were: exposure; biological response; acute psychomotor
        response; and driving response. </p>
      <p><b>Exposure ~</b> </p>
      <p>Prior to this research, few studies have attempted to gain
        broader sociological information about driving under the
        influence of cannabis. A comparison between the participants in
        the current study and a group of regular users in the West
        Midlands showed the trial group to be fairly typical. Both
        groups showed a reluctance to drive after consuming more than 4
        units of alcohol, believing their driving to be significantly
        impaired. The majority of both groups again thought that
        cannabis impaired their driving, but only to a slight degree. </p>
      <p><b>Biological Response ~</b> </p>
      <p>In considering the results of the present study, the biological
        response of the participants to the consumption of cannabis is
        of fundamental importance. Urine was screened on arrival to
        check for and exclude multiple drug use. </p>
      <p>Blood and saliva measurements were taken immediately prior to
        dosing and at 10 and 30 minutes post dosing. The subjective
        reports given by the participants of the effects of smoking the
        various strengths of cannabis cigarettes showed an extremely
        good correlation between what participants thought they had
        smoked and the THC dosage in the cigarettes. The maximum amounts
        of THC administered were around 10mg for the low dose and 20 mg
        for the high and the majority of participants were able to
        distinguish between the effects of these doses and placebo. The
        subjective feelings of the "highs" experienced were also closely
        correlated with the participants "liking" of the smoking effect
        as stated in the mood questionnaire. Making allowance for the
        experimental situation, the majority of participants also found
        the experience of smoking cannabis similar to their normal
        experience. </p>
      <p><b>Acute Psychomotor Response and Tests of Impairment ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is of the utmost importance to try to relate the
        observations derived from this experimental study to the
        situations likely to be encountered in real life drug driving
        cases. Part of the experimental procedures therefore included
        the formal sobriety testing of participants. Two registered
        medical practitioners (experienced Forensic Medical Examiners
        (FMEs)) examined the participants and carried out a
        comprehensive physical examination to see whether the suggested
        standard "impairment" tests currently used were effective in
        detecting impairment due to cannabis. </p>
      <p>The results of the sobriety testing clearly show a strong
        correlation between cannabis dose received and whether
        impairment was judged to be present. In total, 56 assessments
        were performed on the 15 participants at the various dose
        levels. In 7 cases on high dose and 3 cases on low dose
        impairment was judged to be present, but no cases on placebo. In
        assessments where a condition was judged to be due to a drug 30
        had received one of the three cannabis dose levels and only 2
        were placebo conditions. On the basis of these observations, the
        general medical examination and standardised impairment testing
        applied by the FMEs were judged to be effective in determining
        both impairment and establishing condition due to a drug. There
        was also a strong relation between the FME's decision regarding
        the participant's impairment and the participant's subjective
        rating, which formed part of the mood questionnaire. </p>
      <p>These results are important for two reasons. First, they offer
        strong support for the validity of the FME's decisions and for
        the effectiveness of the sobriety tests as detectors of
        impairment. Second, they offer further support for the view
        that, under the influence of cannabis, users are acutely aware
        of their impairment. </p>
      <p>It is also interesting to note that, despite participants
        having smoked some form of cannabis before 42 of these
        examinations, on only 11 occasions did the FME consider the
        participant to be impaired. This finding could have implications
        for the number of cases that will be detected by the Field
        Impairment Testing recently launched in the UK by the police. </p>
      <p>In addition to the general medical examination, pupil size was
        measured using a Pupillometer, supplied by Procyon Ltd. The
        Pupillometer showed a significant increase in pupil sizes 25-30
        minutes after dosing. The difference was statistically
        significant for the placebo v high dose and the placebo v low
        dose. This suggests that this measure may be helpful in
        assessing if a person has recently smoked and may be impaired
        through cannabis, although this would require a baseline and an
        'impaired condition' measure to be useful. </p>
      <p><b>Driving Response ~</b> </p>
      <p>The final key objective of the study was to consider the
        effects of cannabis on driving response. Statistically
        significant results, which have been found for the
        simulator-derived measures, are given in the report. There was a
        reduction of average speed on the motorway when participants had
        the high or low doses of cannabis. This confirms the results
        from many previous studies. It strongly suggests that the
        participants as drivers are aware of their impairment, but
        attempt to compensate by driving more cautiously. Participants
        did not know what strength of cannabis they had received, but
        knew there was a likelihood of having had something 'active' and
        so were perhaps being more careful. A post trial survey of
        participants showed that they were very good at guessing when
        they had taken the placebo dose and most participants even
        managed to correctly guess if they had the low dose or high
        dose. </p>
      <p>In the simulator trials, participants reacted more slowly to a
        pulling-out event when they had taken the low dose of cannabis,
        suggesting a similar compensatory action for the effects of
        cannabis impairment. However, when taking the high dose this
        effect was not significant. This is probably due to the
        variability in the response data. </p>
      <p>Similarly, there was no significant difference between braking
        reaction times. The mean response times increased slightly, but
        there was too much variability in the data for this to be
        statistically significant. This variability in the results when
        considering the impairing effects of cannabis has been observed
        by other researchers. The variability of drug effects on
        individuals is well recognised and this seems to be even more in
        evidence with cannabis than with other drugs. </p>
      <p>When considering the simulator tracking tasks, participants
        tended to drive less accurately on the left and right loops of
        the 'figure of eight' when they had been on the high cannabis
        dose. There was also a significant increase in their Standard
        Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) on the right loop when on
        the high dose as compared to the low dose of cannabis. This
        suggests that they were unable to control their steering as well
        when under the influence of the high cannabis dose. This again
        confirms previous observations that cannabis adversely affects
        drivers' tracking ability. </p>
      <p>The mean time to move from stationary at a traffic light
        controlled junction once the lights had turned to red/amber on
        the driving simulator produced an interesting result. This was
        significantly reduced with high cannabis dose level, the
        reduction was in the order of &frac12; second between the
        placebo condition and high dose condition, and slightly less
        from the low dose to high dose. There are a number of possible
        explanations for this. It may suggest that in the
        "observational" conditions of the driving simulator participants
        were aware of missing the traffic light change and so reacted
        slightly more quickly. Alternatively, the effects on the
        participants' internal clocks might have made them feel that
        they had been at the lights longer than they actually had and
        therefore heightened their attention to the imminent change in
        lights. It has been suggested that cannabis, in a similar way to
        alcohol at low doses, can have a stimulant effect on dopamine
        that may account for more risky behaviour in some circumstances.
        Other explanations are possible, however, and further assessment
        of this observation will be required. </p>
      <p>The hazard perception (HP) task did not produce any
        statistically significant results. Although reaction times were
        found to increase with dose level, there was too much
        variability in the data for statistical significance. An
        increase of 0.08 seconds between the placebo and low dose and an
        increase of 0.14 seconds between the placebo and high dose was
        observed. This suggests that there may be an effect on the
        reaction time of participants responding to hazards, but it is
        quite a small effect which would require a much larger sample to
        determine whether or not it was statistically significant. This
        would also seem to confirm earlier observations of the effects
        of cannabis on the various aspects of driver performance; the
        effect on reaction time being somewhat indeterminate. </p>
      <p>The mean tracking accuracy on the Compensatory Tracking Task
        (CTT) decreased with increasing level of dose. The placebo
        tracking accuracy was higher than either the high dose or resin
        tracking accuracy. Thus tracking accuracy does change with dose.
        The proportion of correct trials also decreased with increasing
        dose level. All participants were still quite accurate, but the
        difference from 99.5% accuracy when on placebo was statistically
        significantly different from the 97.0% accuracy when on the high
        dose. The HP and CTT results are of particular interest because
        the HP test was taken at least 75 minutes post smoking the
        cannabis, and the CTT test at least 85 minutes post dosing. Some
        of the acute impairment effects may well have diminished by
        then. </p>
      <p>In summary, the results of this study show a broad consistency
        with the effects of cannabis on driver performance observed by
        previous researchers. In addition, the habits and attitudes of
        cannabis users in relation to driving have been explored for the
        first time in the UK. </p>
      <h4>Conclusions ~</h4>
      The research has demonstrated the practicability of assessing the
      influence of cannabis on driving performance in a controlled
      clinical trials experimental situation. Participants were
      recruited, medically screened and tested under conditions of a
      strict protocol that had local ethics committee approval.
      <p>The maximum amounts of THC administered in the cannabis
        cigarettes were shown to be typical of that available with
        'street' cannabis. Participants were generally able to
        distinguish between the effects of cannabis with active THC and
        placebo conditions. The subjective reports of smokers on the
        effects of smoking the various strengths of cannabis cigarettes
        showed an extremely good correlation between what participants
        thought they had smoked and the THC dosage in the cigarettes. </p>
      <p>The feelings of the "highs" experienced were also closely
        correlated with participants' positive reactions as measured by
        a mood questionnaire. Given the controlled conditions of the
        experimental situation, the majority of participants also found
        the experience of smoking cannabis similar to their normal
        experience. </p>
      <p>Previous studies have shown that simulated and actual driving
        and divided attention tasks which all require integrative mental
        processes are severely affected by alcohol. Simple attention /
        vigilance tasks are not so much affected and psychomotor skills,
        especially tracking, and simple reaction time tasks are only
        affected at relatively high blood alcohol levels. Alcohol may,
        therefore, be seen as first disturbing higher cognitive
        processes, especially those that require integrative
        performances. Compared to those effects, the losses in
        psychomotor skills and simple attentional processes are much
        smaller. In contrast, previous studies with cannabis show that
        it first seems to affect all tasks requiring psychomotor skills
        and continuous attention. Thus, tracking tasks, which are very
        sensitive to short term changes in attention, are very sensitive
        to cannabis impairment. On the other hand, integration processes
        and higher cognitive functions are not as time critical. A short
        attention lapse can be compensated for by increased activity
        later. </p>
      <p>In the case of the overall driving task, it seems that the
        negative effects of these short-term distortions can be reduced
        by lowering the difficulty, and hence the time critical aspects,
        of the task. This would explain the frequently reported
        observation that drivers under the influence of cannabis drive
        at notably reduced speeds. </p>
      <p>Results from the current study using the TRL driving simulator
        confirm the results from these previous studies. There was a
        reduction of average speed on simulated motorway driving when
        participants had the high or low doses of cannabis. This
        strongly suggests that the participants as drivers are aware of
        their impairment, but attempt to compensate by driving more
        cautiously. </p>
      <p>When considering the simulator tracking tasks, participants
        tended to drive less accurately on the left and right loops of
        the 'figure of eight' when they had been on the high cannabis
        dose. This suggests that they were unable to control their
        steering as well when under the influence of the high cannabis
        dose. This again confirms previous observations that cannabis
        adversely affects drivers' tracking ability. </p>
      <p>There is variability in the results when considering the
        impairing effects of cannabis that has been observed by other
        researchers. The variability of drug effects on individuals is
        well recognised and this seems to be even more in evidence with
        cannabis than with other drugs. The failure to produce
        significant results on various driving performance measurements
        when compared to alcohol may be explained by the more variable
        effects of cannabis on participants. </p>
      <p>The results of the driving related laboratory tests conducted
        in general did not produce statistically significant results.
        Although reaction times were found to increase with dose level,
        there was too much variability in the data for statistical
        significance. This suggests that there may be an effect on the
        reaction time of participants responding to hazards, but it is
        quite a small effect which would require a much larger sample to
        determine whether or not it was statistically significant. This
        again confirms earlier observations of the effects of cannabis
        on the various aspects of driver performance; the effect on
        reaction time being somewhat difficult to predict. </p>
      <p>The general medical examination and standardised impairment
        testing applied by the FMEs were judged to be effective in
        determining both impairment and establishing condition due to a
        drug. Preliminary conclusions were drawn by the FMEs on the
        number and combination of impairment test failures which would
        allow a conclusion that the driver was "impaired". Further
        refinement and calibration of these techniques in the field, for
        use by both police officers and FMEs, is however desirable and
        is planned. </p>
      <p>Overall, it is possible to conclude that cannabis has a
        measurable effect on psychomotor performance, particularly
        tracking ability. Its effect on higher cognitive functions, for
        example divided attention tasks associated with driving, appear
        not to be as critical. Drivers under the influence of cannabis
        seem aware that they are impaired, and attempt to compensate by
        reducing the difficulty of the driving task, for example by
        driving more slowly. </p>
      <p>In terms of road safety, it cannot be concluded that driving
        under the influence of cannabis is not a hazard, as the effects
        on various aspects of driver performance are unpredictable.
        However, in comparison with alcohol, the severe effects of
        alcohol on the higher cognitive processes of driving are likely
        to make this more of a hazard, particularly at higher blood
        alcohol levels. </p>

      <dt>In the stoner stereotype, pot smokers and dying brain cells go
        hand in hand. However, new research suggests the situation may
        be more uplifting than that. A drug that functions as
        concentrated marijuana does may spur neurogenesis, the process
        by which the brain gives birth to new nerve cells.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Previous research had suggested that neurogenesis happens only
        in select locations in the brain, such as the hippocampus, a
        region involved in learning and memory. Some studies have shown
        that this process is inhibited by most illicit drugs, such as
        cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. However, says Xia Zhang of
        the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, marijuanas effect
        on neurogenesis has not been clear.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>He and his colleagues started investigating this mystery by
        searching cell surfaces in live, cultured slices of rat
        hippocampus for receptors that respond to marijuana and a few
        other similar drugs, called cannabinoids. They reasoned that if
        marijuana affected neurogenesis in the hippocampus, then cells
        in that area must have a way to recognize the drug. Sure enough,
        95 percent of hippocampus cells responsible for neurogenesis
        showed evidence of cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors, one of two
        receptors that respond to cannabinoid drugs.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Next, Zhangs team incubated samples of rat hippocampus with a
        solution containing HU210, a drug that stimulates CB1 receptors
        with a strength 100 times greater than that of pot. Other
        rat-hippocampus cells were incubated with the same solution
        minus the drug or with AM281, a drug that blocks CB1 receptors.
        After 2 days, the researchers found a significant increase in
        the number of new brain cells in the samples incubated with
        HU210, but no significant increase of such cells in the other
        samples.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Finally, the researchers injected adult rats with various
        doses of HU210. A single high-dose injection seemed to make no
        significant difference in the number of new nerve cells.
        However, animals injected with high daily doses of the drug over
        the course of 2 weeks had about 30 percent more newborn nerve
        cells than did rats given AM281 or a solution without either
        drug.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Animals given the 2-week course of HU210 also showed less
        anxiety and depressionlike behavior than did rats not given the
        drug. When the researchers irradiated the rats hippocampi with X
        rays, which kill off new neurons, animals given HU210 responded
        to these tests much as did animals that didnt receive the drug.
        These results suggest that, while these new neurons probably
        dont increase intelligence, they could be responsible for
        antianxiety and antidepressive effects, says Zhang.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>He and his team report their findings in the November <i>Journal



          of Clinical Investigation</i>.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      While data suggesting that cannabinoid drugs can accelerate
      neurogenesis are "interesting and potentially promising," its too
      early to tell whether high doses of marijuana over long periods
      have a similar effect on depression and anxiety in people, says
      Ron Duman, a neuroscientist at Yale University. "There is very
      little clinical evidence demonstrating that cannabinoid
      administration produces an antidepressant response," he says.

            Mice"</font></b>
        <p><b>by Patricia Reaney</b></p>

        LONDON (Reuters) - An active ingredient in cannabis can ease
        inflammation and slow the progression of coronary artery disease
        in mice, and possibly humans, researchers said on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Daily low doses of the ingredient, THC, prevented
        atherosclerosis, a primary cause of heart disease and stroke in
        western countries, without producing the associated high. </p>
      <p>"We have proven that very low doses of cannabis therapy will
        have an anti-inflammatory effect that will slow the progression
        of atherosclerosis in mice," said Dr Francois Mach, of Geneva
        University Hospital in Switzerland. </p>
      <p>He and his team do not know whether TCH, or
        delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, will have the same effect in
        humans. But they believe the discovery will help find compounds
        that produce the same effect in humans without side effects such
        as raised blood pressure or euphoria. </p>
      <p>"The goal now is to find new molecules, new compounds, that
        will act only on this anti-inflammatory effect," Mach told
        Reuters. Atherosclerosis is a common disorder of the arteries.
        Fatty materials build up and eventually block the arteries and
        interfere with blood flow. </p>
      <p>THC and similar molecules are known as cannabinoids. Cannabis,
        which contains more than 60 different cannabinoids, and hashish
        have been used for centuries for medicinal purposes. </p>
      <p>Mach and his team gave mice which were genetically engineered
        to be prone to atherosclerosis very low oral doses of THC with
        food each day. The dose was about 10 times less than that from
        smoking cannabis. </p>
      <p>"It is the first study showing any beneficial effect of
        cannabis therapy on atherosclerosis," said Mach. </p>
      <p>Cannabis creates a high when it binds to receptors called CB1
        on the surface of cells in the brain. In the mouse study,
        another receptor, CB2, which is found on immune system cells and
        has nothing to do with euphoria, was affected. The dose given to
        the mice was too low to create a sense of euphoria. </p>
      <p>Mice given THC had a slower progression of the disease than
        other mice not given the compound. The scientists are now
        studying whether THC can prevent the illness in the rodents. </p>
      <p>"We are planning to look in more detail into how cannabis
        interferes with inflammation," said Mach.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
