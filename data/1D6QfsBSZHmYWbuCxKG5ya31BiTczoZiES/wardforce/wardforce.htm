      <br>
      My Fellow American,<br>
      <br>
      Everything is verifiable! Energy (torque and electricity) from
      Magnets!&nbsp; Who else needs to see a demonstration? <br>
      <br>
      These reactions cannot be caused using only what is taught to
      exists. I am using part of a magnetic field, which is not a pole,
      and manipulating it to generate torque, while current is being
      generated from the poles and the current is used.&nbsp; I can
      cause these reactions with magnets only after knowing wardforce
      exists and can be manipulated.&nbsp; As today, without this part
      of a magnetic field being used, torque and current is generated
      from different devices.&nbsp; With wardforce being manipulated,
      usable torque and current can be generated from a single device.<br>
      <br>
      I have discovered a part of the magnetic field, “Wardforce”, which
      is not a North or South Pole. Using magnetic fields, I am causing
      reactions which have been taught for over 200 years as
      impossible.&nbsp; Some of the over 10,000 (hits 2009) people, who
      are from the US and other countries, have been emailing me, asking
      questions and I know they understand how I am manipulating
      wardforce. Some, from other countries, have indicated that they
      are teaching their children (future work force) about
      wardforce.&nbsp; Defining wardforce, gives a better understanding
      of cause and effect. NOW, is the time for science communities and
      educational facilities, here in the USA, to be involved with
      developing a curriculum for our future work force...<br>
      <br>
      With this method regarding US patent 7531930 being used, I can
      demonstrate that torque and current can be generated from magnetic
      fields. It is not as simple as it sounds and yes, that is right,
      energy from Magnets...<br>
      <br>
      [ &amp;c... ]<br>
      <br>
      Steven Ward<br>
      <br>
      P.S. On my blog www.energy-ingenuitycom.blogspot.com you can see
      the videos I have posted. In a demonstration, I show more detail,
      demonstrate devices which prove the existence of "wardforce" and
      that it can be manipulated to produce torque.&nbsp; It is not as
      simple as it sounds, or looks.<br>

      Backward (pull) motion is demonstrated when shaft decreases in
      speed.<br>
      <br>
      Forward (push) motion is demonstrated when shaft increases in
      speed.<br>
      <br>
      Definition: "Wardforce" - (Push-pull) Forward-backward motion part
      of a magnetic field, a force not poles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This method for producing usable mechanical and electrical energy
      uses waves generated from north and south poles, not an AC
      current.&nbsp; Counter electro-magnetic force is the force I was
      taught, which resists motion when using current with present day
      generators.&nbsp; CEMF is the same as a radio wave, only it is not
      "transmitted".&nbsp; I am "mechanically" transmitting the wave
      (wardforce), which is converted into usable torque.&nbsp; As more
      current is used, wardforce increases, producing torque from this
      part of the magnetic field.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to say, when
      current is used, torque will be generated from the wardforce as
      described in U.S. patent #7531930.&nbsp; A magnet has 2 poles,
      wardforce, and what else which cannot be seen?&nbsp; One force, is
      manipulated for producing current, and the other, wardforce is
      manipulated for producing torque.<br>
      <br>
      No matter how wardforce can be manipulated, it is a part of the
      magnetic field!&nbsp; This other part of the magnetic field is
      what I have been demonstrating and until now, I have not pushed
      the point of another part existing.&nbsp; The main points at the
      demonstrations were, that torque and current can be generated from
      magnetic fields(Magnets).&nbsp; Let's educate others regarding
      this other part of a magnetic field.&nbsp; I offer physical proof
      of my claims. Energy from magnets (torque and
      electricity)!&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone was causing these reactions
      and understand how the reactions are caused, they would also claim
      another part of the magnetic field exists and can be
      manipulated.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      I cannot cause these reactions, using only what is known to
      exists.&nbsp; Something else has to exists for these reactions to
      be caused or the cause of these reactions would be taught and we
      would not be buying fuel for producing energy.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An energy
      producing magnetic converter is provided that outputs both
      electrical and mechanical energy. The converter includes a
      controller assembly rotatably secured between a plurality of field
      coil assemblies and a plurality of magnets. During a rotation of
      the controller assembly between the plurality of field coil
      assemblies and the plurality of magnets, electric current is
      generated in wire coils of the field coil assemblies, and
      counter-magnetic fields are induced around the wire coils. A pole
      of each counter-magnetic field is formed on the controller
      assembly, and counterforce present between magnetic fields of the
      plurality of magnets and the counter-magnetic fields cause and
      maintain forward rotational motion in the energy producing
      magnetic converter.; Accordingly, because the forward rotational
      motion is maintained in the presence of sufficient counterforce,
      the magnetic converter outputs torque in addition to the electric
      current, thereby increasing an efficiency of the magnetic
      converter. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Technical Field</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates generally to the subject of
      converters and power supplies, and, in particular, to devices that
      generate usable electrical and/or mechanical energy through the
      use of magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Background Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] Magnetic converters, or, devices that produce usable
      electrical and/or mechanical energy through the use of magnetic
      fields, or flux, are well known in the art. Some examples of
      magnetic converters include electric motors, electric generators,
      transformers, etc. A typical magnetic converter includes at least
      a pair of permanent magnets and a wire coil free to rotate between
      the magnets. The magnets are generally connected by a steel former
      and the wire coil is connected to lead wires using brushes. In a
      magnetic converter that is used to generate usable mechanical
      energy, the wire coil may be further connected to a drive shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In a magnetic converter that is used to generate mechanical
      energy, e.g., an electric motor, a voltage potential is applied
      across the lead wires, thereby causing an electric current to flow
      through the coil. The flow of the electric current induces a
      magnetic field, or flux, around the coil. The coil's magnetic
      field repels and attracts the magnetic field generated by the
      permanent magnets, which, in turn, causes the wire coil to rotate.
      Accordingly, usable rotational mechanical energy, or torque, may
      be drawn from the drive shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In a magnetic converter that is used to generate electrical
      energy, e.g., an electric generator, the wire coil is rotated in a
      magnetic field generated by the permanent magnets, thereby
      inducing a voltage in the wire coil. Accordingly, when the lead
      wires are connected to a load, e.g., a light bulb, electric
      current may be drawn from the coil. Consequently, once current
      begins to flow through the rotating wire coil, a force opposing
      the motion of the wire coil is also induced, thereby making the
      wire coil harder to turn. Thus, as is explained by the
      conservation of energy law, the more work that the converter does,
      the more work that must be put into its operation. In physical
      practice, the work put into the operation of the converter is
      produced by applying a greater mechanical driving force, or
      increased input torque, to the rotating wire coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a magnetic
      converter for generating electrical energy in which the input
      torque applied to the magnetic converter need not be increased to
      maintain operation of the converter. Further, it would be
      desirable to provide a magnetic converter for generating
      electrical energy in which an input torque is not required to
      maintain operation of the converter, and, hence, usable output
      torque may be drawn from the converter. Advantageously, in such a
      scheme, the magnetic converter may be used to generate usable
      electrical and mechanical energy, thereby increasing an efficiency
      of the magnetic converter.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0008] According to one aspect, an energy producing magnetic
      converter includes a housing; a plurality of field coil assemblies
      disposed on a first surface of the housing; a plurality of magnets
      disposed on a second surface of the housing opposite of and
      aligned with the plurality of field coil assemblies; and a
      controller assembly rotatably secured to the housing and
      positioned between the plurality of field coil assemblies and the
      plurality of magnets, wherein, upon application of an electric
      load to the plurality of field coil assemblies, a rotation of the
      controller assembly relative to the plurality of field coil
      assemblies and the plurality of magnets induces at least one
      counter-magnetic field for generating an electric current.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to another aspect, a magnetic converter system
      includes a plurality of field coil assemblies; a plurality of
      magnets, each magnet of the plurality of magnets being positioned
      opposite of and separated from a corresponding field coil assembly
      of the plurality of field coil assemblies by a spacing interval; a
      controller assembly having a plurality of controllers, each
      controller of the plurality of controllers being arranged to pass
      through the spacing interval between each magnet and the
      corresponding field coil assembly; and wherein, during a rotation
      of the controller assembly, a plurality of counter-magnetic fields
      generated substantially on the plurality of controllers as the
      plurality of controllers pass through the spacing interval between
      each magnet and the corresponding field coil assembly generates
      sufficient counterforce to provide and maintain forward rotational
      motion to the controller assembly, and wherein the maintaining of
      the forward rotational motion generates an output torque of the
      magnetic converter system.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to another aspect, a method for generating usable
      electrical energy and usable mechanical energy of a magnetic
      converter includes rotating a plurality of controllers secured to
      a controller plate of the magnetic converter between a field coil
      assembly and an opposing magnet of the magnetic converter;
      utilizing a counter-magnetic field generated on each controller of
      the plurality of controllers to produce sufficient counterforce to
      maintain forward rotational motion of the controller plate and the
      plurality of controllers; wherein maintaining forward rotational
      motion of the controller plate and the plurality of controllers
      generates usable mechanical energy of the magnetic converter, and
      wherein application of an electric load to the field coil assembly
      generates usable electrical energy of the magnetic converter.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be
      apparent from the following description and the appended claims.<br>

      <br>
      [0016] Embodiments of the present invention will now be described
      with reference to the above drawings. Like references are used in
      the figures to represent like elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and
      apparatus for generating electrical and mechanical energy.
      Embodiments of the present invention further relate to an energy
      producing magnetic converter, referred to herein as a converter,
      that generates usable electric current and output torque. The
      converter is provided with a controller assembly rotatably secured
      between a plurality of field coil assemblies and a plurality of
      magnets. During a rotation of the controller assembly between the
      plurality of field coil assemblies and the plurality of magnets,
      electric current is generated in wire coils of the field coil
      assemblies, and counter-magnetic fields are induced around the
      wire coils. A pole of each counter-magnetic field is formed on the
      controller assembly, and counterforce present between magnetic
      fields of the plurality of magnets and the counter-magnetic fields
      cause and maintain forward rotational motion in the energy
      producing magnetic converter. Accordingly, because the forward
      rotational motion is maintained in the presence of sufficient
      counterforce, the magnetic converter outputs torque in addition to
      the electric current, thereby increasing an efficiency of the
      magnetic converter.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] FIGS. 1a and 1b show exemplary views of an energy producing
      magnetic converter (100), herein referred to as converter (100).
      In FIG. 1a, an overview of the converter (100) is shown. In FIG.
      1b, a side perspective view of the converter (100) is shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Referring to FIG. 1a, the converter (100) includes a
      housing (102) having a first plate (104), or surface, and a second
      plate (106), or surface. The first plate (104) and the second
      plate (106) are connected and supported using a plurality of
      housing brackets (108). Those skilled in the art will appreciate
      that, although the first plate (104), the second plate (106), and
      the plurality of housing brackets (108) are shown as separate
      elements, alternatively, they may be formed as a single element
      with at least first and second opposing surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Disposed along a lower surface of the first plate (104) are
      a plurality of field coil assemblies (110). Each of the plurality
      of field coil assemblies (110) is operatively connected to a set
      of lead wires (not shown) that may be connected to an electric
      load (not shown). Further, disposed along an upper surface of the
      second plate (106) are a plurality of magnets (112). As shown,
      each of the plurality of magnets (112) is positioned opposite of
      and aligned with a corresponding field coil assembly of the
      plurality of field coil assemblies (110). In some embodiments,
      each of the plurality of magnets (112) is a substantially
      horse-shoe shaped permanent magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Positioned between the plurality of field coil assemblies
      (110) and the plurality of magnets (112) is a controller assembly
      (114). The controller assembly (114) is rotatably secured to the
      housing (102) using a drive shaft (116). The drive shaft (116) is
      positioned along centrally defined axes of the first plate (104)
      and the second plate (106) of the housing (102). Further, the
      drive shaft (116) is operatively coupled to the housing (102) in a
      manner that allows the drive shaft (116) to rotate without
      transmitting such rotation to the housing (102), the plurality of
      field coil assemblies (110), or the plurality of permanent magnets
      (112). Thus, the controller assembly (114) is free to rotate
      relative to the plurality of field coil assemblies (110) and the
      plurality of magnets (112) when the electric load is applied to
      the plurality of field coils (110).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In addition, secured around the drive shaft (116) and
      outboard of the housing is a pulley (118). In some embodiments,
      the pulley (118) may be connected to a torque-supplying device,
      e.g., a starter or a motor (not shown), in order to initiate a
      rotation of the drive shaft (116), and, hence, of the controller
      assembly (114). Note that, as will be described below with respect
      to the operation of the converter (100), torque need not be
      continually supplied to maintain operation of the converter (100).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Referring to FIG. 1b, a side perspective view of the
      converter (100) is shown. Note that, in this view, the plurality
      of housing brackets (108) are not shown in order to aid in the
      understanding of the invention. In particular, a cross-sectional
      character of the converter (100) is visible. Further, as is also
      more easily visible, a small separation space exists between the
      controller assembly (114) and each of the plurality of field coil
      assemblies (110), thereby ensuring that the rotation of the
      controller assembly (114) is not transmitted to the plurality of
      field coil assemblies (110). In addition, a similar separation
      space exists between the controller assembly (114) and each of the
      plurality of magnets (112) to ensure that the rotation of the
      controller assembly (114) is not transmitted to the plurality of
      magnets (112).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIGS. 2a and 2b show exemplary views of the controller
      assembly (114) of the converter (100). FIG. 2a shows a top view of
      the controller assembly (114), and FIG. 2b shows a sectional view
      of the controller assembly (114).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring to FIG. 2a, the controller assembly (114)
      includes a controller plate (120) and controllers (122). The
      controllers (122) are arranged around a perimeter of the
      controller plate (122) and are positioned in substantially equally
      spaced intervals. In some embodiments, a set of thirteen
      controllers (122) is used in the controller assembly (114). Those
      skilled in the art, however, will appreciate that a number of
      controllers (122) used in the invention may be altered without
      departing from the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the
      art will also appreciate that a spacing of the controllers (122)
      may be altered without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Referring to FIG. 2b, a sectional view of the controller
      assembly (114) is shown. In order to aid in the understanding of
      the invention, only a portion of the controller plate (120) and a
      single controller (122) are shown in this view. The controller
      (122) includes the following: first and second spacers (124,128),
      and first and second magnetic sections (126,130). A first surface
      of the first spacer (124) is secured to the controller plate
      (120), and a second surface of the first spacer (124) is secured
      to a first surface of the first magnetic section (126). A second
      surface of the first magnetic section (126) is secured to a first
      surface of the second spacer (128), and a second surface of the
      second spacer (128) is secured to a surface of the second magnetic
      section (130). In some embodiments, the first and second spacers
      (124, 128) are formed from a non-magnetic material such as
      aluminum, brass, or hard plastic. Also, in some embodiments, the
      first and second magnetic sections (126,130) are formed from a
      magnetic field transmitting material such as steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 3 shows a top view of a portion of the converter
      (100). Only the controller assembly (114), the plurality of
      permanent magnets (112), and the second plate (106) are shown in
      order to aid in the understanding of the layout of the converter
      (100). In particular, a layout of the plurality of magnets (112),
      and, hence, their corresponding plurality of field coil assemblies
      (110, not shown), can be determined. Further, an alignment of the
      controllers (122) of the controller assembly (114) with the
      plurality of magnets (112) is illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring to FIG. 3, each of the plurality of magnets (112)
      is disposed along the second plate (106) in substantially equally
      spaced intervals. In some embodiments, seven magnets are used as
      the plurality of magnets (112). Further, because each of the
      magnets (112) is disposed opposite of and aligned with a
      corresponding field coil assembly, an equal number of field coil
      assemblies (110) is utilized. Thus, in some embodiments, seven
      field coil assemblies are used as the plurality of field coil
      assemblies (110).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Further, note that each of the controllers (122) is
      disposed such that, during the rotation of the controller assembly
      (114), the first and second magnetic sections (126, 130) of at
      least one controller (122) passes over at least one of the
      plurality of magnets (112). In particular, in embodiments where
      the at least one of the plurality of magnets (112) is a horse-shoe
      shaped permanent magnet, the first magnetic section (126) will
      pass over a first leg of the magnet (112), and the second magnetic
      section (130) will pass over a second leg of the magnet. In
      addition, although not shown, both the first and second magnetic
      sections (126, 130) pass beneath the magnet's corresponding field
      coil assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a number of
      permanent magnets, and, hence, a number of corresponding field
      coil assemblies used in the invention may be altered without
      departing from the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the
      art will also appreciate that a spacing of the plurality of
      magnets (112) and the plurality of field coil assemblies (110) may
      be altered without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] FIGS. 4a and 4b show exemplary views of a section of the
      converter (100). FIG. 4a shows a perspective view of said section,
      and FIG. 4b shows a side view of said section. Only a portion of
      the first and second plates (104,106), a portion of the controller
      assembly (114), one of the plurality of magnets (112), and a
      single field coil assembly (132) are shown in order to aid in the
      understanding of the layout of the converter (100). Referring to
      FIG. 4a, the controller plate (120) of the controller assembly
      (114) has been rotated such that one of the controllers (122) has
      come into alignment with one of the plurality of magnets (112) and
      the corresponding field coil assembly (132). As can be seen, the
      controller (122) passes across the magnet (112) and the field coil
      assembly (132) and through a spacing interval separating the
      magnet (112) from the field coil assembly (132).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Referring to FIG. 4b, a side view of the layout illustrated
      in FIG. 4a is shown. As can be seen and as is described for FIG.
      1b, a separation space exists between the controller (122) and the
      field coil assembly (132), as well as a separation space between
      the controller (122) and the magnet (112). Thus, the controller
      (122) is able to freely rotate through the spacing interval
      between the field coil assembly (132) and the magnet (112) without
      transmitting that rotation or friction to the field coil assembly
      (132) and/or the magnet (112). Accordingly, the field coil
      assembly (132) and the magnet (112) remain stationary with respect
      to each other and the controller (122) during an operation of the
      converter (100).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring again to FIG. 4b, the field coil assembly
      includes a wire coil (134) supported and secured to the first
      plate (104) of the housing (102) using support brackets (136)
      disposed on opposing faces of the wire coil (136). Those skilled
      in the art will appreciate that although a pair of support
      brackets (136) are shown, a number and/or configuration of the
      support brackets may be altered without departing from the scope
      of the invention. Further, as described above for FIG. 1a, the
      wire coil (134) is connected to the set of lead wires (not shown)
      which, in turn, are connected to the electric load (not shown)
      during the operation of the converter (100)<br>
      <br>
      [0034] While the controller (122) is in alignment with the
      field&nbsp; coil assembly (132), the first and second magnetic
      sections (126,130) are positioned beneath the support brackets
      (136), and, thus, outboard a perimeter of the wire coil (134). At
      the same time, as mentioned above, the first and second magnetic
      sections (126, 130) are aligned with the first and second legs of
      the magnet (112). Further, the first spacer (124) is positioned
      outboard of field coil assembly (132) and the magnet (112), while
      the second spacer (128) is positioned beneath and is aligned with
      the wire coil (134).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0035] An operation of the converter (100) will now be described
      with reference to the figures and the above description.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] With reference to FIGS. 1a and 4b, upon application of the
      electric load (not shown) to the wire coil (134), the required
      input torque to the converter (100) decreases from idle. Idle on
      the converter (100) is defined as an amount of torque required to
      turn the converter (100) with no electric load applied.
      Accordingly, a rotation of the drive shaft (116), and, hence, the
      controller assembly (114) is initiated by an application of torque
      to the pulley (118). The torque is applied to the pulley (118) by
      the torque-supplying device, e.g., the starter or the motor (not
      shown). In some embodiments, the torque-supplying device is a
      manually activated starter, such as a winding shaft attached to a
      spring, or a combination of said starter and a motor. In alternate
      embodiments, the torque-supplying device is an electrically
      activated starter or a combination of said starter and a motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] With reference to FIGS. 3, 4a, and 4b, as the controller
      assembly (114) rotates, the controllers (122) pass through the
      spacing intervals separating the plurality of field coils (110)
      and the plurality of magnets (112). During the time that each
      particular controller (122) passes through a particular spacing
      interval, a magnetic field, or flux, is generated between the
      field coil assembly (132), that controller (122), and the magnet
      (112). As the controller (122) is rotated through the spacing
      interval, the first and second magnetic sections (126, 130) of the
      controller (122) sweep past the perimeter of the wire coil (134).
      Accordingly, the location and intensity of the magnetic flux
      changes, and a voltage is induced in the wire coil (134). Further,
      because an electric load is applied to the wire coil (134),
      electric current is generated and is drawn from the wire coil
      (134) through the set of lead wires (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As electric current flows through the wire coil (134), a
      magnetic field having a first pole and a second pole is induced
      around the wire coil (134). The first pole is located on a side of
      the wire coil (134) nearest the spacing interval, and the second
      pole is located on a side of the wire coil substantially opposite
      of the first pole. Further, during the time that each particular
      controller passes through the spacing interval, the first pole is
      formed on the controller (122). Note that a direction of a
      polarity of the wire coil's (134) magnetic field is counter to a
      direction of a polarity of the magnetic field existent between the
      magnets (112), and, hence, the magnetic field induced around the
      wire coil (134) is referred to herein as a counter-magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Attractive and repulsive forces between the poles of
      counter-magnetic field and poles of the magnets' (112) magnetic
      field causes the controller (120) to be pushed sideways away from
      the wire coil (134). Herein, these attractive and repulsive forces
      are referred to as counterforce. The counterforce causes forward
      rotational motion in the controller assembly (114), thereby
      transmitting torque to the drive shaft (116). Advantageously, an
      input torque required to maintain operation of the converter (100)
      is decreased. Further, said counter-magnetic field is absorbed by
      the controller (122) and transformed back into its original state.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Further, magnetic flux of the counter-magnetic field is
      discharged through the controller (122) as well as absorbed
      through the controller (122) in accordance with an amount of
      electric current generated, and, hence, with an amount of electric
      load applied to the wire coil (134). Accordingly, as the amount of
      electric load is increased, the forward rotational motion of the
      controller assembly increases, further decreasing the required
      input torque. Advantageously, in an embodiment where sufficient
      counterforce is generated and/or sufficient electric load is
      applied, the input torque is not required to maintain a momentum
      of the controller assembly (114), and output torque may be
      supplied from the converter (100) to a motor (not shown)
      operatively connected to the pulley (118). Accordingly, in said
      embodiment, the converter (100) outputs both electric current and
      torque, and, thus, provides usable electrical and mechanical
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Referring to FIGS. 2b and 4a, upper and lower surfaces of
      the first and second magnetic sections (126, 130) are formed in a
      substantially trapezoidal shape, with a shorter substantially
      parallel side of each surface facing toward the controller plate
      (120) and a longer substantially parallel side of the surfaces
      facing away from the controller plate (120). Further, upper and
      lower surfaces of the second magnetic section (130) are larger
      than upper and lower surfaces of the first magnetic section (126).
      Advantageously, such an arrangement ensures that as the controller
      (122) is rotated through a particular spacing interval, the first
      magnetic section (126) and the second magnetic section (130) both
      remain between the field coil assembly (110) and the magnet (112)
      for substantially equal amounts of time. Thus, the magnetic field,
      and, hence, the counter-magnetic field, may be generated for a
      long enough period of time to produce sufficient counterforce on
      the controller (122).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Referring to FIG. 3, note that a number of controllers
      (122) provided in the controller assembly (114) is greater than a
      number of magnets (112), and, hence, a number of field coil
      assemblies (132) provided in the converter (100). Accordingly,
      sufficient counter-magnetization is produced in the controller
      assembly (114) to maintain the forward rotational motion of the
      converter (100). Advantageously, an input torque required to
      maintain operation of the converter (100) is decreased.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] While the invention has been described with respect to a
      limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having
      benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments
      can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention
      as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention
      should be limited only by the attached claims.<br>
