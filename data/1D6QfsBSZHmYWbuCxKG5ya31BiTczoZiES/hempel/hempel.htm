        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The disclosed embodiments relate to a device for producing
      electrical energy, as well as to a novel charging current signal
      and a device for producing electrical energy charged by the
      charging current signal.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Brief Description of
        Related Developments</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] It is known to use ion cells in electrochemical current
      sources. An ion cell or several ion cells (also called galvanic
      cells) connected in series are referred to as a battery. Ion cells
      convert the chemical energy stored in them directly into
      electrical energy. The reaction supplying the energy, the
      discharge, is composed of two partial reactions (electrode
      reactions) which are spatially separated but coupled to each
      other. The electrode in which the corresponding partial reaction
      takes place at a lower redox potential in comparison to the other
      electrode is the negative electrode (-), the other one is the
      positive electrode (+). During the discharge of the ion cell an
      oxidation process occurs at the negative electrode by which
      electrodes are released; in parallel thereto a corresponding
      amount of electrodes is collected at the positive electrode via a
      reduction process. The electrode current flows from (-) to (+)
      through an external consumer load circuit. Inside the ion cell,
      the current is carried by ions between the electrodes in an
      ionically conducting electrolyte (ion current), with ion and
      electron reactions being coupled to each other in/at the
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A difference is made between primary cells that use
      themselves up during their discharge, and rechargeable cells,
      which are also called accumulators, in which the electrochemical
      discharge reactions can be reversed to a large extent so that a
      multiple conversion from chemical into electrical energy and back
      may take place. During these discharging/charging cycles alternate
      oxidation and reduction processes are performed at each electrode
      so that one must be careful when using the designation anode or
      cathode, which are defined by the terms of oxidation or reduction.
      This problem can be avoided by using the terms of negative
      electrode or positive electrode because the respective electrode
      potential in a normal charging/discharging operation always
      remains more negative or positive than that of the other
      electrode. In parallel thereto, however, there is the convention
      that the electrodes are named in accordance with their function
      during the discharge, that is, the negative electrode is referred
      to as the anode and the positive electrode is referred to as the
      cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Generally, an ion cell in a battery or an accumulator
      consists of one electrolyte, two electrodes arranged together in a
      battery casing, which may include a plurality of ion cells, and
      separators that are permeable to ions but impermeable to electrons
      and with which it is possible to avoid a short circuit due to
      internal electrode contact. The so-called active materials are the
      actual storages of the chemical energy in the battery or the
      accumulator. The electrical energy is released during the
      discharge due to its electrochemical turnover at the electrodes.
      The number of electrodes released or collected in this process per
      unit of mass or volume determines the storage capacity of the
      active electrode material and is indicated as the specific load
      (in Ah kg&lt;-1&gt;) and charge density (in Ah cm&lt;-3&gt;),
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Widely used accumulators of this kind are lithium ion
      accumulators which are particularly used in portable devices of
      high energy demand, such as, for example, in mobile phones,
      digital cameras, camcorders, laptops or the like, as well as in
      electric and hybrid vehicles. At present, they are also
      increasingly used in electric tools, such as cordless
      screwdrivers, for example, due to their high charge density.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In an accumulator electrical energy is converted into
      chemical energy during the charging. If a consumer load is
      connected, the chemical energy is converted back into electrical
      energy. Furthermore, when accumulators are charged and discharged,
      heat is released by which a part of the energy used for charging
      is lost. In conventional accumulators, the charging efficiency,
      that is, the ratio of the withdrawable energy to the energy to be
      used for charging, is normally about 60 to 95 percent.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Usually, optimal charging of different types of
      accumulators is effected with not-too-high charging currents over
      a comparatively long period of time. A 20-hour charging of a lead
      accumulator used as a car battery, for example, is to be given
      preference over a fast charging within a few hours with higher
      charging currents because the latter may reduce the efficiency and
      the service life of the lead accumulator.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0010] It is the object of the disclosed embodiments to improve
      the efficiency of devices for producing electrical energy with ion
      cells as well as to provide a novel charging current signal and a
      device for producing electrical energy with which the charging
      efficiency of galvanic cells and electrolyte capacitors is
      considerably enhanced and the charging time may be substantially
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This object is achieved by means of devices for producing
      electrical energy according to claims 1, 20, 21, 24, and 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Features of preferred aspects of the disclosed embodiments
      are characterized in the subclaims.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] According to one aspect of the disclosed embodiments, the
      device comprises: at least one ion cell, means for producing a
      magnetic field at the location of the at least one ion cell and at
      least one capacitance or an interconnection of at least two
      capacitances, of which two contacts of counter pole electrodes are
      connected to the counter pole electrodes of the at least one ion
      cell, and a consumer load may be connected in parallel to the
      capacitance or the interconnection of capacitances.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a first series of experiments with aspects of the
      disclosed embodiments an energy output of the device which cannot
      be explained by the state of knowledge of current research
      regarding the duration as well as the performance was observed and
      measured.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Furthermore, the aspects of the disclosed embodiments are
      based on the observation that the application of a magnetic field
      to an ion cell, in particular a lithium ion cell, leads to the
      fact that the current withdrawn from this cell has properties
      which cannot merely be characterized by the current intensity.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It was found that the current produced in this manner is
      particularly suitable for charge separation in galvanic cells,
      that is, in other words, for charging galvanic cells or for
      charging electrolytic capacitors. As the current thus produced
      effects a charge separation in a galvanic cell or an electrolytic
      capacitor, as will be explained below in more detail by means of a
      description of an experiment, which charge separation is not
      correlated to the amount of the supply of electrical energy
      following current physical findings, this charging current will be
      referred to in the following as charging current signal. A
      galvanic cell upon which such a charging current signal acts shows
      a charging behavior which is optimized as to charging time and
      charging current to be provided.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0023] FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of a device for producing
      electrical energy. In this embodiment six ion cells 1 are
      connected in series. A permanent magnet 2 is mounted as closely as
      possible, for example, to the casing walls of the ion cells 1 so
      that all ion cells 1 are permeated by the magnetic field produced
      by the permanent magnet 2. An embodiment of the attachment of
      permanent magnets is shown in FIG. 3, as described further below.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] A capacitor bank consisting of four capacitors 3a to 3d
      connected in parallel and a load 4 are connected to the series
      connection of the ion cells 1. As has been found, the four
      capacitors connected in parallel together can be charged faster
      than a corresponding capacitor of the same capacity as the sum of
      the capacities of the capacitors connected in parallel.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In the following, a first experiment will be described
      which was carried out with the following means:<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The accumulators were each liberated of associated
      electronics by which a deep-discharge is to be avoided. These were
      commercially available lithium ion accumulators having a nominal
      capacity of 750 mAh as are used, for example, in mobile phones or
      laptops. Six lithium ion accumulators were connected in series and
      deep-discharged. The deep-discharge was at first made by coupling
      a consumer load in order to achieve a slow discharge and at the
      end the series connection was short-circuited. A measurement of
      the voltage showed that no voltage could be measured at the
      accumulator series connection. The capacitors used during the
      experiment were electrolyte capacitors connected in parallel to
      form a capacitor bank. In this case the capacitor bank was also at
      first short-circuited to ensure that there is no charge in the
      capacitors. Subsequently, the ion cell battery was provided with
      permanent magnets, as shown in FIG. 3. Here, they are commercially
      available magnetic strips of a width of about 1 cm, on the outer
      edges of which a magnetized substance had been attached in
      parallel to the longitudinal extension of the strips. The
      polarities of the magnets running parallel to each other were
      opposed.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The battery unit combined into a block of accumulators
      arranged in parallel to each other was surrounded by the magnetic
      strips.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Next, the deep-discharged lithium ion accumulator series
      connection was connected to the corresponding poles of the
      capacitor bank.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Completely surprisingly and unexpectedly, a voltage of 23.8
      V built up between the poles of the accumulator series connection
      after about 10 s. After separating the capacitor bank from the
      accumulator array and short-circuiting until the voltage level
      dropped to zero, a voltage of 33 V built up again contrary to
      expectations between the poles of the capacitor bank after about
      90 s.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This is all the more astonishing since electrolytic
      capacitors usually have no charge remanence.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Finally, the accumulator series connection was connected to
      the capacitor bank 3a-3d and in turn a load 4 was connected
      thereto. In the experiment as carried out the load 4 consisted of
      a DC motor having a nominal voltage of 40 V and a no-load current
      of 0.8 A as well as an Imax of 6.3 A. In the experiment as carried
      out, the motor was supplied with a voltage of 12 V. The permanent
      current consumption resulting therefrom was 80 mA. The motor
      started and soon achieved a constant speed at which it ran for 144
      hours in a long-time test. According to expectations, using a
      conventional, fully charged accumulator the motor would have had
      to stop after a few hours at the latest due to a lack of
      sufficient applied voltage; in this case, however, a
      deep-discharged accumulator array was used in which a voltage rise
      was observed and measured during the current consumption in the
      course of time instead of a voltage drop.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] During the power consumption neither the capacitors nor the
      accumulator series connection heated up noticeably.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Furthermore, the following phenomena were observed in this
      array. The accumulator array was separated from the capacitor bank
      and discharged for a few seconds by short-circuiting. After
      connecting the capacitor bank to the accumulator array the
      capacitors were charged within a very short time (on the order of
      0.5 s).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The capacitor bank was discharged by means of a filler wire
      having a cross-sectional area of 1 mm&lt;2&gt;. The discharge
      process was very rapid, i.e. within a few milliseconds, with a
      high current that melted the filler wire, and a formation of
      sparks.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIG. 2a shows another embodiment in which the permanent
      magnet 2 was replaced by a wire-wound coil. The coil 5 is wound
      around the accumulator series connection and connected in series
      to the capacitance. Thus, an electromagnet is formed and the
      accumulators are aligned in parallel to the axis of the
      electromagnet in the axial direction thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 2b shows a detail of another embodiment in which the
      electromagnet coil 5 is fed by an external current source.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Furthermore, the embodiment shown in FIG. 2a has a
      change-over switch 6 by which the accumulator series connection is
      alternately connected to the capacitor bank 3a-3c or to the load
      4. By switching the change-over switch 6 either the capacitor bank
      is charged by the accumulator series connection or the load 4 is
      fed by the capacitor bank.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The switching frequency of the change-over switch is
      suitably selected so that the capacitors 3a-3c are discharged by a
      maximum of 20 to 30%, i.e., after the discharge they still have a
      residual charge of 70 to 80% of their maximally storable charge.
      The charging of the capacitors takes place faster in this charging
      range than in the case when the capacitors would be discharged to
      a lower level per cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 4 shows another embodiment in which, in the case as
      shown, two capacitor banks 3a, 3b, . . . and 7a, 7b . . . are
      alternatively connected in a clocked manner to the accumulator
      array by the change-over switches 8a, 8b. Moreover, a capacitor
      bank 10 is connected in parallel to the accumulator array.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Likewise, it is conceivable to connect more than two
      capacitor banks in sequence to the accumulator array.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Furthermore, it should be noted that it is also possible to
      use non-discharged accumulators instead of deep-discharged
      accumulators.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Due to the device for producing electrical energy according
      to the aspects of the disclosed embodiments, it is possible to
      implement applications which open up previously unreached
      dimensions as regards the power output as well as the ambition to
      make energy sources more compact and lighter.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In the following, a second experiment will be described
      which was carried out with the following means:<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A motorbike battery, in this case a lead accumulator having
      a rated voltage of 12 V and a capacitance of 12 Ah, was slowly
      discharged via a consumer load until the terminal voltage was only
      about 3 V. The discharge was made with a small discharging current
      so that the motorbike battery did not noticeably heat up.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Then the motorbike battery was connected for recharging to
      four series-connected lithium ion accumulators prepared with
      magnetic strips. The device for producing electrical energy using
      lithium ion accumulators described in the present patent
      application comprises an array of one or more electrolytic
      capacitor(s) connected in parallel to the series connection of
      lithium ion accumulators. Such electrolytic capacitors may be used
      as intermediate storages of electrical energy in the experiment
      described here, however, they are not compulsory.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In the experiment described here, a series connection
      comprising permanent magnet strips of prepared lithium ion
      accumulators without electrolytic capacitors connected in parallel
      was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In order to charge the motorbike battery, the
      above-described lithium ion accumulator array was connected to the
      battery. After about 20 minutes the motorbike battery was fully
      charged and showed a voltage of about 14 V, that is, 2 V above its
      rated voltage, at its terminals. The surprisingly short time until
      the full charge of the motorbike battery allows the conclusion
      that a very high charging current has flown during this time. It
      turned out to be difficult to measure the current directly by
      inserting a digital multimeter measurement apparatus into the
      circuit because the charging time strongly increased for unknown
      reasons until the motorbike battery was fully charged.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Nevertheless, in order to get an idea of the dimension of
      the charging current, the charging cable was cut through at one
      spot and the gap in the circuit was bridged by cable portions of
      different cross-sectional areas. The discharging and charging
      process, as described above, was repeated several times and the
      very short charging time of between 2 and 20 minutes respectively
      appeared again. The most astonishing fact, however, was that even
      when the circuit gap was bridged by a "telephone wire" having a
      cross-sectional area of about 0.75 mm&lt;2 &gt;and a length of
      about 20 cm, the wire did not heat up beyond room temperature.
      Thus, it is certain that during the charging of the lead
      accumulator no current corresponding to the amount of energy which
      the lead accumulator regained after the recharging process flew
      within the short charging time. The charging current required for
      this purpose would have had to be so large within the short
      charging time that it would have made the "telephone wire" melt
      without fail. The wire, however, did not even heat up.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] This allows the conclusion that in case of the
      above-described charging process electrical energy is not
      transferred from an electrical energy source to a galvanic storage
      for electrical energy, as usual, which can then be withdrawn again
      after subtraction of the energy converted into reaction heat, but
      that the charging current, referred to as charging current signal
      below, merely "triggers" the galvanic cell, that is, the chemical
      reaction which occurs in the galvanic cell is merely initiated by
      the charging current signal and not maintained by a corresponding
      addition of electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] It is a fact that the described technical effect, namely
      the fast chargeability of a galvanic cell with the charging
      current signal produced as described above and the inexplicably
      high charging efficiency may be reproducibly imitated in the
      manner as described above, as proven by the multitude of
      successfully performed experiments.<br>

      The present invention concerns a method to the reforming of
      electrolytic capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolytic capacitors become used, if very large capacitance
      values are required. This is for example the case with power
      supplies, NF-final stages and such a thing. In automotive
      electronics engine management systems for the fuel injection,
      drives of Kühlerund windshield wiper motors, electronic steering
      systems, airbags or Multimediageräte and such a thing rank among
      the applications.<br>
      <br>
      With an electrolytic capacitor (also Elko mentioned) a non
      conductive insulating layer becomes generated on the metal of the
      anode electrode by electrolysis (anodic oxidation, formation),
      which forms the dielectric of the capacitor. The electrolyte forms
      the cathode (counter electrode) of the electrolytic capacitor. It
      can consist of liquid or pasty electrolytes (ion leaders) or solid
      electrolytes (electron conductor). The power supply to
      electrolytes of made over films same metal as that the anode or
      over a suitable contact electrolytes.<br>
      <br>
      At present common types from electrolytic capacitors are: Aluminum
      electrolytic capacitors with alumina as dielectric, tantalum
      electrolytic capacitors with Tantalp entoxid as dielectric,
      niobium<br>
      669-68567PCT/CM electrolytic capacitors with Niobpentoxid as
      dielectric as well as so called gold Caps or Super Caps.<br>
      <br>
      The anode of the electrolytic capacitor becomes the magnification
      of the surface structured, with aluminum Elkos is it a aufgeraute
      anode foil, with tantalum Elkos a sintered metal sponge. Due to
      the large surface area and the extremely thin dielectric relative
      high electric capacitances of the order of magnitude of 1 F can
      become achieved with electrolytic capacitors with small
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      With gold Caps and Super Caps reach the capacities the order
      of magnitude of 2OF, however with relative small rated voltages of
      some few volts.<br>
      <br>
      For example a aufgerauten aluminium foil as anode material one
      calls electrolytic oxidizing forming. This happens for the first
      time with the preparation of electrolytic capacitors on the end of
      the manufacturing process in the factory.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolytic capacitors have the disadvantage of high leakage
      current losses by the remainder conductivity of the dielectric. If
      an electrolytic capacitor does not become longer time used, it
      unloads itself by the leakage current complete. This state is
      harmful for the insulation resistance of the dielectric, to the
      maintenance and/or. for the reproviding of an high insulation
      resistance of the dielectric forms new and/or. to be after-formed
      must.<br>
      <br>
      Reforming for electrolytic capacitors have always had the object
      to regenerate the dielectric in order to thus show the
      electrolytic capacitor its original qualities such as capacity and
      copy voltage level.<br>
      <br>
      From US 4.974, 118 A is an apparatus known, with which reforming
      of the type performed here standing in speech to become to be
      able.<br>
      <br>
      2007/025057 a2 describe the reforming for capacitors incorporated
      in medical implants. Afterwards will empirical determined
      condenser load data of the used capacitors used, in order to
      determine the Nachformierungszeit which can be used, in which the
      capacitors are loaded on a voltage, which corresponds to 20% to
      90% of the rated voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The DE 19 50 967 has a method to the reforming from electrolytic
      capacitors to the subject-matter, with which during the reforming
      of these at least once, preferably several times by shutdown of a
      direct current source interrupted will and a simultaneous
      electrical discharging resistor becomes parallel the capacitor
      connected, over which the capacitor wenigsgtens partly unloads
      itself, so that a polarization of the anode arising with the
      preceding charge of the capacitor becomes sufficient destroyed
      made by the mentioned discharge.<br>
      <br>
      DE 23 60 688 A is a method to the reforming of electrolytic
      capacitors known, with which in steps to the capacitor the applied
      voltage increased will and a constant current held becomes for
      each step so selected that the maximum voltage preferably becomes
      for each step in less than 20 seconds achieved.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is the basis the object to indicate a method
      to the reforming of electrolytic capacitors as that the leakage
      current after-formed electrolyte condensates on a negligible
      measure of the reduced and the disruptive strength and/or the
      rated voltage increased to become to be able, whereby higher
      charge quantities in the electrolytic capacitor stored to become
      to be able.<br>
      <br>
      This object becomes 1 dissolved with the features of the claim.<br>
      <br>
      Features of preferred embodiments of the present invention are in
      the characterized in the description.<br>
      <br>
      With the invention process after-formed electrolytic capacitors
      shown no self discharge considerable in the test series also after
      several days and the breakdown voltage effected that the rated
      voltage and thus the storable charge quantity did not after-form
      opposite, otherwise identically constructed electrolytic
      capacitors increased increased by the reforming will could. In
      addition according to invention after-formed the electrolytic
      capacitors could be loaded in remarkably shorter time opposite not
      after-formed, otherwise identically constructed electrolytic
      capacitors on their (new) rated voltage.<br>
      <br>
      In the following becomes the invention on the basis the
      description of embodiments with reference to the drawing more near
      explained, where the single fig points the schematic diagram of an
      apparatus to the execution of the invention process to the
      reforming of electrolytic capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      In the following first an embodiment of an apparatus becomes the
      reforming of electrolytic capacitors described and subsequent test
      series at an aluminum electrolytic capacitor as well as a gold
      Cap - electrolytic capacitor, which became performed with this
      apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      A lab power supply unit 1, with which the output voltage separate
      of the output current is more adjustable and is limitable with
      that the output current, serves 4 as current source for controlled
      loading of the here used aluminum electrolytic capacitor. In
      addition that becomes positive pole of the lab power supply unit 1
      interposition of an ammeter 2 and first and a second breaker point
      3, 10 connected bottom with the positive pole of the electrolytic
      capacitor 4. The negative terminal of the lab power supply unit 1
      is 4 connected with the negative pole of the electrolytic
      capacitor. Furthermore the voltage over the electrolytic capacitor
      becomes 4 measured with a voltmeter 5. A parallel circuit from a
      second voltmeter 6, a third breaker point 7 and a load resistor 8
      is on the one hand 2 connected with the negative terminal of the
      lab power supply unit 1 and on the other hand with the output of
      the ammeter. More immediate before that load resistor 8 is a
      fourth breaker point 9 in series to this arranged.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">First embodiment of the invention
        process</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Four gold Cap become - electrolytic capacitors in series
      connected and into the experimental setup shown in the fig in
      place of the electrolytic capacitor 4 introduced shown there. With
      the used gold Cap - it concerned electrolytic capacitors
      capacitors with a rated voltage of 2,2 V and a capacity of 20 F +
      - 20%. In an initial step 10 tested become with opened second
      breaker point whether is present on the series circuit of the
      capacitors still another (remainder) charge and whether the
      voltmeter indicates accordingly a voltage to 5. If this is the
      case, then the capacitors become 8 discharged slow over the load
      by latches of the breaker points 3 and 9. The load resistor 8 can
      have a resistance value between 20 and 50 ohms. This discharge
      process can take some minutes in claim. If the voltmeter 5 shows
      no or only a low voltage in the millivolt range, can, over safe to
      go through latches second and the fourth breaker point 3 and/or. 7
      condenser series connection shorted becomes.<br>
      <br>
      Afterwards the third and fourth breaker points become 7 and 9
      opened and at the lab power supply unit a discharge voltage of 1 V
      set. Then the second breaker point becomes 10 closed and loadings
      of condenser series connection begins. When closing the second
      breaker point 10 the charging current snaps on one value of 1,6
      amperes high and drops subsequent slow, until for instance an half
      minute no more charging current at milliampere dissolving
      Ampermeter displayed becomes.<br>
      <br>
      Then the second breaker point becomes 10 opened and the discharge
      voltage at the lab power supply unit 1 around 1 V to 2 V
      increased. Then the second breaker point becomes 10 closed and the
      charging current essentially behaves as with the first load level.<br>
      <br>
      As a favourable variant the charging current on 100 or 200 mA
      limited can become at the lab power supply unit 1, if one wants to
      avoid the initial charging current points within the ampere range.
      This is in as much from advantage as it depends with the invention
      process on it that the charging operation relatively slow of goes
      to give in order to after-form the capacitors sufficient time to
      be formed. It is likewise possible to reduce the initial high
      charging currents thereby that one selects the tension increase
      steps lower, for the example 0.5 V instead of 1 V, or still
      smaller.<br>
      <br>
      The stepwise Spannungserhöhung is so long continued using, until
      one states that the charging current no more on 0, and/or. some
      few milliamperes drops, but einpegelt itself a value of large 0,
      with the measurements accomplished here about 40 mA. On this step
      the electrolytic capacitor to the power consumer and it will be
      able to destroy to find reactions inside the electrolytic
      capacitor instead of, those the capacitor and/or. its capacity to
      impair know. If this step is achieved, the condenser chain of the
      lab power supply unit becomes 1 separated by opening the breaker
      point 10 and over the load 8 by latches of the fourth breaker
      point 9 slow discharged.<br>
      <br>
      If condenser series connection exhibits no more charge, i.e. the
      voltmeter 5 no more voltage indicates, becomes the stepwise charge
      to condenser series connection like described above repeated. With
      the fact one places solid that the time interval [delta] ti
      between the start of the charging operation and the termination of
      the charging operation on the tension stage, with that the
      charging current against a current value &gt; 0 converged, already
      smaller is, as the time interval with the first load passage.<br>
      <br>
      Simultaneous places one solid that the voltage value, becomes
      found with which a charging current not decreasing/going back on 0
      is higher as with the previous load run.<br>
      <br>
      In order to come to an optimum result, the steps become: stepwise
      loading of the capacitor, to the charging current no more on 0
      drops and subsequent slow discharged ones over a suitable load so
      often repeated, until the required time interval [delta] does not
      remove ti no more. Then the series circuit of the electrolytic
      capacitors complete is after-formed.<br>
      <br>
      In such a way after-formed gold Cap - electrolytic capacitors
      exhibit a new rated voltage, which lies around approximately 50%
      higher as the by the factory indicated rated voltage. Furthermore
      found that the after-formed electrolytic capacitors could be
      loaded significant more rapid as not after-formed, otherwise
      identically constructed became electrolytic capacitors.
      Furthermore found became that after loading a after-formed
      electrolytic capacitor on the new, i.e. higher rated voltage, an
      initial leakage current adjusted itself, however with a voltage
      value, which can be various depending upon capacitor, and for
      about 10 to 20% below the new rated voltage is appropriate, to
      zero dropped, i.e. no considerable leakage current more found will
      could and the capacitor on it the stored charge without
      significant charge losses over days held.<br>
      According to invention the gold Cap treated with this embodiment
      of the reforming - electrolytic capacitor has opposite commercial,
      otherwise identically constructed electrolytic capacitors a higher
      rated voltage, and thus a higher copy voltage level, can
      accordingly more charge store and the charging operation takes
      place in shorter time than this at not after-formed capacitors
      according to invention the case is.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Second embodiment of the
        invention process</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The electrolytic capacitor 4 which can be treated becomes 8 slow
      discharged in an initial step over the load resistor. In addition
      the lab power supply unit is clamped by opening the second breaker
      point 10 and the second and fourth breaker points 3 and 9 closed.
      With the here used electrolytic capacitor 4 it concerns with this
      test series an aluminum electrolytic capacitor of the company
      Rescap (registered trademark) with the model number:
      36DA105F016DJ2D with a nominal capacity of 1 F (+ - 20%) and a
      rated voltage of 16 V. The load resistor 8 can have a resistance
      value between 20 and 50 ohms.<br>
      <br>
      After the voltage indicated at the voltmeters 5 or 6 dropped into
      the millivolt range, the third breaker point becomes 7 closed,
      whereby the electrolytic capacitor is 4 shorted. If the
      Spannungsmessgeräte indicate no more voltage to 5 and 6, the
      electrolytic capacitor 4 is over-discharged.<br>
      <br>
      In the next step the lab power supply unit becomes 1 again
      connected with the circuit and is first by the closed third
      breaker point 7 shorted. The fourth breaker point 9 is opened.
      Then the lab power supply unit becomes on an output voltage of 10
      V set and the delivery stream on a value between 16 and 25 mA
      limited. Then the third circuit breaker switch 7 opened and the
      electrolytic capacitor 4 charged become. It becomes the time
      measured, which becomes required, until the capacitor is loaded by
      10 V on a voltage. The set voltage value of 10 V corresponds to
      about 2/3 of the rated voltage of the electrolytic capacitor 4. <br>
      <br>
      With reaching the charging voltage of 10 V, set at the lab power
      supply unit, the charging current measured at the ammeter sinks on
      0.<br>
      <br>
      The steps:<br>
      <br>
      a) slow discharged ones over a suitable dimensioned load with
      subsequent short circuit; and<br>
      <br>
      b) Loadings by application of a voltage VLI, which corresponds to
      about 2/3 of the rated voltage Vo, with one on 25 mA limited DC
      Iu, until the voltage at the capacitor corresponds to VLI and sank
      the charging current on 0, with simultaneous fairs of the time
      interval [delta] tl between application of the charging voltage
      and reaching the charging current ILI = 0 become in this order so
      often repeated (step C)), to no shortening of the time intervals
      [delta], required in addition, t is more more detectable.<br>
      <br>
      With the employees series of measurements this state became with
      several identically constructed electrolytic capacitors in each
      case after four to five repetitions of the process steps A) and b)
      achieved. The charging times behaved with the first pass of the
      process steps A) and b) order-of-magnitude-wise about 20 minutes,
      with a second pass reduced this time interval on 15 minutes, in
      order in each case to need with a fourth and fifth pass a same
      time interval from in each case 5 minutes to.<br>
      <br>
      It became thus found that the required time has to load around the
      electrolytic capacitor on a voltage of 10 V itself in relation to
      first loading after several repetitions substantial shortened (on
      approximately &lt;1&gt; A), whereby after some repetitions for the
      required time interval [delta] t a constant value adjusts itself.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore found became that after several continuous forming
      cycles after short circuit the slow discharged of electrolytic
      capacitor with clamped lab power supply unit at the electrolytic
      capacitor 4 a slow rising voltage develops itself, those after 3
      to 4 hours a value of 5 V achieved. Slow developing of a voltage
      at a before rapid discharged capacitor becomes explained by
      dielectric absorption. Charges in the charged state of the
      electrolytic capacitor move partially in the dielectric and have
      with rapid discharge not the possibility to leave this again and
      move therefore only gradually the electrodes. It develops itself
      thus again a voltage. The effect is more comparable with the
      magnetic remanence and becomes sometimes therefore also tension
      remanence of capacitors mentioned. The size of the absorption
      becomes indicated in the ratio to the original applied voltage and
      depends on the used dielectric. With aluminum electrolytic
      capacitors so far values for the dielectric absorption from
      approximately 10 to 15% of the original applied voltage became
      measured.<br>
      <br>
      Again the constructed voltage determined here with the
      accomplished test series had about 50% of the original applied
      voltage achieved with 5 V. This cannot be explained thus alone by
      the known dielectric absorption with electrolytic capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      Becomes an aluminum electrolytic capacitor to maximum 10 V,
      after-formed on those above described manner, i.e. with the used
      aluminum electrolytic capacitor up to approximately 2/3 of its
      rated voltage loaded, so shown this already no self discharge
      considerable over several days.<br>
      <br>
      In the following becomes in accordance with a prefered embodiment
      of the present invention an other Nachformieren of the aluminum
      electrolytic capacitor described, with which the aluminum
      electrolytic capacitor up to its rated voltage is loaded.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly becomes after the step C), i.e. the repeating step A)

      e) Loadings by application of a voltage VL2, which is the same

      charging voltage VL2 = Vo and the charging current IL2 sank to 0
      mA, whereby the time interval [delta] becomes t2 between
      application of the loading voltage VL2 and reaching the charging
      current IL2 = 0 mA measured, and<br>
      <br>
      f) the steps D) and e) repeated become, to no shortening of the

      steps D usually met) and e), until a shortening of the time
      interval [delta] was more detectable t2 no longer.<br>
      <br>
      In such a way after-formed aluminum electrolytic capacitor could
      be loaded on its rated voltage and kept these over several days
      without considerable losses.<br>
      <br>
      With an other prefered embodiment of the present invention up to
      then with the forming steps the A) to f) after-formed other-formed
      electrolytic capacitor with the object to increase its maximum
      tension strain in order to thus increase its rated voltage.<br>

      In addition becomes after conclusion of the step f)<br>
      <br>
      g) a charging voltage VL3 to the electrolytic capacitor applied,
      which is higher between 3 to 6% as the rated voltage Vo, whereby
      the charging current is IL3 on maximum 170 mA limited, until the
      charging current IL3 measured at the ammeter drops to 0 mA.<br>
      <br>
      h) Subsequent ones take place other load steps analogue to step
      e), whereby the charging voltage becomes increased around 3 to 6%
      of the rated voltage in each case, until the charging current IL3
      no more does not decrease/go back on 0 mA.<br>
      <br>
      That the charging current IL3 no more does not decrease/go back on
      0, will as characters for it considered that an irreversible
      damage of the electrolytic capacitor initiates itself, with which
      the chemistry at the interface between the dielectric and that
      electrolytes irreversible changed becomes. To avoid over this
      and/or. this harmful effect, that those capacity of the
      electrolytic capacitor to decrease can hold as small as possible,
      becomes in a last forming step<br>
      <br>
      i) the charging current disabled and the electrolytic capacitor up
      to the voltage discharged, with which the charging current IL3
      decreased/went back last to 0 mA.<br>
      <br>
      With the reforming accomplished in this way at aluminum
      electrolytic capacitors the aluminum electrolytic capacitors up to
      voltages could be loaded from 20 to 22 V, so that itself the
      original rated voltage of 16 V had around 4 to 6 V increased,
      which corresponds to an increase from approximately 25 to 30%.<br>
      <br>
      By the increase of the rated voltage in such a way after-formed
      electrolytic capacitor 25 to 30% can store more charge.<br>
      <br>
      Differently around considered means this that one can dimension
      the electrolytic capacitor corresponding with a predetermined
      capacity which can be obtained smaller.<br>
      <br>
      With the first described embodiment of the reforming according to
      invention the charging voltage becomes stepwise increased. It can
      be convenient to limit the simultaneous charging current. This is
      however, like explained above, bottom certain circumstances, as
      for example very small tension stages not required.<br>
      <br>
      With the second reforming presented above becomes at the current
      source, i.e. the lab power supply unit an high charging voltage
      set and from the beginning the charging current on one very much
      low value (25 mA) limited.<br>
      <br>
      Both reforming is common that value becomes placed on the fact
      that the charging operation relatively slow of goes. It can be
      assumed this procedure, a migration of ions and/or. Electrons into
      the dielectric and in the electrolytes favored and the dielectric
      positive affected becomes.<br>
      <br>
      With the first presented reforming the Spannungssteigerung also
      continuous can take place, whereby the criterion for the speed of
      the Spannungssteigerung is the observed charging current. The
      Spannungssteigerung should take place in such a way that the
      charging current precipitates very small, i.e. depending upon to
      after-form capacitor in an order of magnitude from some ten mA to
      some hundred mA.<br>
      <br>
      Beyond that it remains noting that for the execution of the
      presented methods automated reforming designed to become to be
      able, which is merged into the manufacturing process of the
      capacitors. The implementation of such automated reforming is for
      the person skilled in the art a visible object.<br>
      <br>
      To hold it remains that with the invention processes the reforming
      of electrolytic capacitors achieved becomes that the time
      interval, which becomes required, around an electrolytic capacitor
      on a certain voltage to load significant shortened becomes; lower
      loading stream to loadings of the electrolytic capacitor required
      become; the after-formed electrolytic capacitor considerable
      leakage currents and dielectric losses does not exhibit, which are
      otherwise typical for conventional electrolytic capacitors, and
      which can become maximum tension strain of the after-formed
      Elektrolytkondehsators increased, so that likewise the rated
      voltage becomes around 25 to 30% raised, whereby with according to
      invention after-formed the electrolytic capacitor 25 to 30% more
      charge stored can become, and/or. with predetermined capacity the
      electrolytic capacitor small constructed will can.<br>
      <br>
      The standing above description prefered embodiments of the present
      invention serves only illustrative purposes and is not limitative
      to be understood. There is various variations of single features
      in the frame of the accompanying claims possible. So it can itself

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHOD FOR CONDITIONING ION
          CELLS AND ION CELLS CONDITIONED ACCORDING TO SAID METHOD IN A
          DEVICE FOR GENERATING ELECTRIC ENERGY</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- The invention
      relates to a method for conditioning ion cells comprising the
      following steps: (a) generation of a magnetic field in the
      vicinity of at least one ion cell; (b) charging of the ion cell or
      cells to a nominal capacity; and (c) short-circuiting of the ion
      cell or cells over a period in which no discernible heating
      occurs. The invention also relates to a device for generating
      electric energy comprising at least one ion cell (1) and means for
      generating a magnetic field in the vicinity of the ion cell or
      cells (1).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention concerns a method for conditioning ion cells
      as well as with this method conditioned ion cells, in particular
      lithium ion accumulators in an apparatus to the generation of
      electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      Lately in particular lithium ion accumulators moved bottom all at
      present known ion cells into the center of the interest. Lithium
      ion accumulators, or short lithium ionAkkus, also Lilon Akkus
      mentioned, are characterised by their high energy density, which
      is higher with several 1000 Wh/kg as with all other accumulators.
      Beyond that the lithium ionAkku is not thermal stable, has a
      constant output voltage during the entire unloading period, a long
      life and knows (disputed) MEMORY effect.<br>
      <br>
      A lithium ion Akku a generated electromotive force by the
      displacement of lithium ions.<br>
      <br>
      During the charging operation positive loaded lithium ions move by
      electrolytes through of the cathode between the Grafitebenen
      (numerical control) of the anode (Interkalation), while the
      charging current supplies the electrons over the outside electric
      circuit. The ions form a Interkalationsverbindung (LixnC) with the
      carbon. With the discharged one the lithium ions move back in the
      metal oxide and the electrons can over the outside electric
      circuit to the cathode flow.<br>
      <br>
      Substantial one for functioning the Interkalation is the formation
      of a protective overcoat on the negative electrode, which is for
      the small lithium plus ions permeable, however impermeable for
      solvent molecules. If the cover layer is insufficiently formed, it
      comes to the Interkalation of Lithium+ - ions with the solvent
      molecules, whereby the graphite electrode becomes irreversible
      destroyed. The protective overcoat consists with common lithium
      ion Akkus of graphite, whatever active material of the negative
      electrode (anode) becomes mentioned. (See in addition also:
      http://www.ac.unikiel.
      de/bensch/forschungsgebiete/interkalationschemie)<br>
      By over-discharging the protective overcoat can become deactivated
      from active material (entformiert). Also by overloading the active
      material can become likewise reduced by destruction (e.g.
      Corrosion), poisoning (e.g. Sulfation), passivation (e.g. MEMORY
      effect), shortcircuit (e.g. Dendrite formation), electrolyte
      decomposition (e.g. Drainage) and such a thing.<br>
      <br>
      With the common lithium ion Akkus therefore careful is to be made
      certain that no operating states, as over-discharging or
      overloading, overheating and such a thing arise, which can have a
      negative influence on the capacity of the lithium ion Akkus. The
      capacity of a lithium ion Akkus is individual dependent of
      prerequisites, for each single Akku, such as ages, temperature and
      such a thing as well as its conditioning.<br>
      Bottom conditioning understands one in this connection a certain
      procedure with original loadings and discharged ones of the
      lithium ionAkkus, whereby its achievable capacity can be affected
      into significant measures positive.<br>
      <br>
      Thus for example lithium ion Akkus become charged after their
      preparation for the first time with a small current intensity up
      to reaching the Mindestspannung, which corresponds to the
      over-discharging tension. Then they become charged starting from
      the over-discharging tension with a constant current up to
      reaching the rated voltage. Afterwards will it with a constant
      voltage other charged to the charging current a certain threshold
      falls below, for example 3% of the initial current or loadings
      does not become terminated if the charging current any longer
      continues to drop.<br>
      <br>
      With the discharged one of a lithium ion Akkus a discharge is not
      to take place a bottom unloading conclusion tension, which is
      appropriate for about 20% to 25% the bottom rated voltage, over
      the life of the lithium ionAkkus not to shorten and/or after most
      manufacturer data. to reduce its capacity not unnecessary.<br>
      <br>
      The described above conditioning of lithium ion Akkus serves for
      thus to obtaining and obtained one of an high loading capacity as
      well as care of the lithium ion Akkus, in order to increase its
      life.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is the basis the object, a method for
      conditioning ion cells as well as an apparatus to the generation
      of electrical energy, which exhibits conditioned ion cells with
      this method, to indicate those to a considerable increase of the
      efficiency of the ion cells and/or. the apparatus lead. This
      object we with the features of the claims 1 and 14 dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      In the described features preferred embodiments of the present
      invention are characterized.<br>
      <br>
      The intercalations reaction arising in a lithium ion Akku, i.e.
      the reversible Einlagung of lithium ions in a solid landlord
      matrix the modified electronic and magnetic properties of the
      overall system.<br>
      <br>
      So for example distinct antiferromagnetic interactions can within
      the landlord connection, i.e. e.g. within the graphite by
      increased lithium content attenuated to in that full interpotash
      ores exchange reciprocal effects finally ferromagnetic will
      dominate material.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the finding that the attachment
      of a magnetic field leads to a such ion cell to interactions,
      which leads with corresponding conditioning of the so modified ion
      cells to a significant efficiency increase of the ion cells.<br>

      The figs Ia to IC show an exploded view (Fig. Ia), a cross section
      (Fig. Ib) of the ion cell array according to invention as well as
      a plan view on the used Manetstreifen 1.<br>
      <br>
      A commercial lithium ion Akku 2, here of the type SAMSUNG SF US
      18650 GR with a rated voltage of 3,7 V becomes equipped with two
      magnetic stripes 1. The magnetic stripes of the type 3M 300LSE,
      permanent magnet volume MGO 1317 Piastinorm are on the length of
      the Akkus 2 cut and itself diametric opposite parallel to
      longitudinal axis of the Akkus on the Akkumantel mounted. Like
      Fig. IC shows, exhibits themselves the magnetic stripes 1 an
      alternate polarity, itself parallel in each case to the
      longitudinal extension of the magnetic stripe extended. The used
      Akku does not exhibit protection circuit.<br>
      <br>
      As in Fig. Ib shown cross section shows becomes the Akku 2
      together with the magnetic stripes 1 from a dielectric film 3
      coated, is mounted on which in accordance with an embodiment of
      the present invention an aluminium foil, which wraps the barrel of
      the Akkus complete.<br>
      <br>
      The lithium ionAkku shown here is wound, a similar Elko capacitor.
      There it when rolling up to varying thickness of the electrolyte
      layer which is between the electrodes to possibly come can do is
      more conceivable it that each attachment place does not show the
      same effect on the barrel for the magnetic stripes. It became
      observed that the attachment of a magnetic stripe on the Akku
      leads to a slight voltage increase at the lithium ionAkku. This
      voltage increase was however somewhat different with the
      accomplished experiments with some lithium IonenAkkus depending
      upon attachment place of the magnetic stripe.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. an experimental setup with that the optimum attachment place
      of the magnetic stripe found shows 2 became. In addition a lab
      power supply unit with variable internal resistance and separate
      adjustable voltage became as well as limitable current to the
      poles of the LithiumIonen Akkus connected and so set that an
      additional ammeter no current flow shown integrated into the
      circle. That is, the voltage provided of the lab power supply unit
      corresponded to the accurate output voltage of the lithium ion
      Akkus. Subsequent one became magnetic stripe on the hydraulic
      cylinder barrel-flat of the Akkus arranged and on this circular
      shifted. With the fact shown itself that by the approach of the
      magnetic stripe already at the Akku a somewhat higher output
      voltage has set and over the Ampermeter 6 a small current from a
      Milliamper into the power supply unit back-flowed itself. When
      circular shifting the magnetic stripe shown itself that each
      radial position of the magnetic stripe does not lead to the same
      return flow stream. The magnetic stripe was finally left at the
      location on the barrel of the Akkus, at which the current flowing
      back into the power supply unit was largest. Subsequent one became
      a second magnetic stripe on the diametric opposite side of the
      barrel of the Akkus mounted. By this measure, as in the following
      will be still closer to discuss, the efficiency knew erf [iota]
      ndungsgemässen apparatus the generation of electrical energy other
      increased to become.<br>
      <br>
      In the following an experiment described, with which a series
      circuit by six like standing above described prepared lithium ion
      Akkus first were subjected to a conditioning, in the following the
      more near explained was employed and subsequent Ladeund of
      unloading attempts with this structure and with a series circuit
      of six identical, commercial lithium ionAkkus compared.<br>
      <br>
      The conditioning of an apparatus according to invention to the
      generation of electrical energy the ion cells equipped contained
      in it with magnetic stripes become and/or. the single ion cell in
      an initial step on their nominal capacity loaded. This can take
      place after a conventional method, like initially described.
      Subsequent ones become the ion cells and/or. becomes the ion cell
      shorted over a short period, in which still no noticeable heating
      of the cell arises. It turned out that this period should not
      exceed five seconds, the preferably made shortcircuit over two
      seconds. A strong heating of the ion cell, i.e. over more than few
      degrees C&lt; 0&gt;, is to be avoided absolutely, since this
      points on irreversible destruction processes within the cell.<br>
      <br>
      A in this way conditioned ion cell, in particular a lithium ion
      accumulator shows already a higher efficiency, i.e. Ladungsund
      energy output increased opposite a conventional not conditioned
      ion cell. This effect can become other increased, if the
      subsequent conditioning steps follow after short circuit. An other
      charge with a charging current between 10 mA upto max. follows. to
      400 mA to at the poles of the cell a voltage lies close, which is
      appropriate for about 10% over the rated voltage of the cell and
      which charging current sank on bottom 10 mA. Subsequent one
      becomes the ion cell with a current of 80 mA upto max. 600 mA
      controlled discharged, until abrupt Spannungsund becomes discharge
      current waste observed. Subsequent one becomes the charging
      operation repeated and the ion cell again controlled discharged
      described above, until an accelerated voltage drop becomes
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      Such a conditioning became at lithium ionAkkus made of the type
      SAMSUNG SF US 18650 GR, whereby the charge with a charging current
      of 80 mA made, until against the poles a voltage of 4 V rested to
      the cell (rated voltage of the cell 3.7 V) and the charging
      current on 10 mA had sunk. Then the lithium ion cell with a
      current of 160 mA discharged to the voltage at the poles of the
      cell had dropped to 2,5 V. After renewed loading, like described
      above, the lithium ion cell up to a voltage of 2,95 V became
      discharged.<br>
      <br>
      Six such lithium ion Akkus, after the described above method
      conditioned, became connected in series. Each Akku was here with
      reference to Fig. and bottom interposing of an insulative film
      with an aluminium foil coated provide 1 described with two
      magnetic stripes.<br>
      <br>
      Comparison purposes a series circuit became from six commercial
      lithium ion Akkus of same type of building created. This set
      lithium ion Akkus is designated in the following LITH 1, whereas
      the modified and conditioned set LITH 2 is designated.<br>

      results in thus a rated voltage of the arrangement of 22,2 V. Like
      Fig. 5 had the Akkusatz LITH 1 at the beginning of the discharge
      process a voltage of 22,58 V shows whereas the Akkusatz LITH 2 a
      significant higher initial tension of 24,03 V exhibited. The
      removed charge quantity, with the discharged one up to a
      relaxation of 20 V results in each case and the corresponding
      energy is for the two Akkusätze in the table in Fig. 3 shown. One
      recognizes already that the modified Akkusatz LITH 2 a substantial
      higher charge quantity removed became, i.e. 464 mAh opposite 264
      mAh with LITH 1.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent ones were again loaded the Akkusätze LITH 1 and LITH 2
      in the tests 3 and 4. The output voltage before that loadings of
      LITH 1 was about 20,46 V, which adjust themselves after the
      removal of the load after the discharged one automatically. LITH 1
      as well as LITH 2 became over one time interval of approximately
      39 min. continuous with a current of 400 mA charged, whereby at
      the end of the charging operation with LITH 1 a conclusion tension
      of 22,8 V adjusted itself. Within this period the Akkusatz LITH 1
      electrical energy in height of 5,69 Wh became supplied. With LITH
      2 output the voltage, which adjusts itself automatically, lay
      already with 22,8 V. During about 39 min. continuous continuous
      shop became LITH 2 electrical energy in the height of 4,24 Wh
      supplied, whereby the conclusion tension was with 23,68 V.<br>
      Subsequent ones became the Akkusätze LITH 1 and LITH 2 in the
      tests No. 5 and 6 again up to an unloading conclusion tension of
      20 V discharged. The output voltage of LITH 1 was about 22, 27 V
      and the corresponding output voltage of LITH 2 with 22, 18 V. Up
      to the unloading conclusion tension of 20 V LITH became 1
      electrical energy in height of 5,24 Wh and LITH 2 electrical
      energy in height of 4,64 Wh removed.<br>
      <br>
      At these measurements it is remarkable that removed with the
      modified Akkusatz LITH 2 a significant higher charge quantity
      (438.6 mAh) became than with the Akkusatz LITH 1 (245.3 mAh). Also
      the removed electrical energy is larger in height of 4,67 Wh with
      the discharged one of LITH 2 around more as 10% than with loadings
      supplied electrical energy in height of 4,24 Wh.<br>
      <br>
      In the tests 7 and 8 became in a renewed charging operation on the
      basis of an output voltage of 21,47 V with LITH 1 and 22.49 V with
      LITH 2 again electric charge and thus electrical energy supplied.
      The power supply amounted to 4.05 Wh with LITH 1 and 4, 26 Wh with
      LITH 2.<br>
      <br>
      With renewed discharged one (test 9 and 10) tapping energy was
      with the Akkusatz LITH 1 with 3,84 Wh and with the Akkusatz LITH 2
      with 4,44 Wh.<br>
      <br>
      Also with this test a positive energy balance (charged 4.26 Wh,
      discharged 4.44 Wh) results for LITH 2, whereas the Akkusatz LITH
      1 normal behaved (charged 4.05 Wh, discharged 3.84 Wh).<br>
      <br>
      It can recapitulatory be stated that with repeated made Ladeund
      discharge processes with modified the according to invention
      lithium ionAkkusätzen, which were equipped with magnetic stripes
      and became on the type conditioned described above a significant
      better tapping energy balance adjusts itself that, than this
      adjusted same type, as they became used with the modified
      Akkusätzen, with conventional lithium ionAkkus.<br>
      On which the efficiency increase of the modified lithium ionAkkus
      in the long run is not based is at present complete clarified. It
      stands to assume that the magnetic fields set on the lithium
      ionAkkus have an influence on the Interkalationsprozess within
      electrolytes of the Akkus. With increased incorporation of lithium
      ions into the host lattice electrolytes shows this system
      increased ferromagnetic interactions, which by the magnetic field
      affected put on from the outside to become to be able.<br>
      <br>
      It becomes suspected that the particular conditioning with
      permanent magnets can lead provided lithium ionAkkus to an
      increase of the mobility of the lithium ions, so that the effects
      arising by the magnetic interactions become amplified.<br>

      inductively measurable current intensity greater than Joule's heat
      in a conductor of a current component, where the current intensity
      is measured by a gripper ammeter. The Joule's heat in the
      conductor is measured by a hot wire measuring element, where the
      signal is generated by ion cells i.e. lithium-ion-accumulators,
      that are provided in a static magnetic field. Permanent magnets or
      electromagnets generate the magnetic field at location of the ion
      cells. An independent claim is also included for a device for
      generating a charging current signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention concerns a charging current signal
      for loading galvanic elements and electrolytic capacitors as well
      as an apparatus to the generation of such a charging current
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Galvanic elements are energy converters, which produce a
      voltage on electrochemical path. If this process is reversible,
      one speaks of accumulators (secondary batteries). An electrolytic
      capacitor is a poled capacitor, whose anode electrode consists of
      a metal, on which by electrolysis (anodic oxidation, formation) a
      non conductive insulating layer generated becomes, which forms the
      dielectric of the capacitor. The electrolyte (z. B. an electrical
      conductive liquid) is the cathode of the electrolytic capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Accumulators and capacitors is common that they can be
      loaded with an electric charge, whereby between its electrodes a
      voltage develops itself, and a current removed can become, until
      the potential difference between the electrodes falls below a
      specific threshold value.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Loadings of a galvanic element, for example a lithium ion
      accumulator and to loadings of an electrolytic capacitor
      relatively much time takes in claim. Thus for example the utility
      is limited of lithium ion accumulators as current source in
      electric road vehicles strong, since these after reaching its
      unloading condition over several hours, for example over night,
      with a charger again to be loaded to have. Also the prolonged
      loading time of electrolytic capacitors limits their use, for
      example as rapid accessible charge packed memory, which should be
      more removable in short time intervals charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The present invention is the basis the object to indicate a
      charging current signal with which galvanic elements and
      electrolytic capacitors are more chargeable within very much short
      time with very much high efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Furthermore the present invention the object is the basis
      to indicate an apparatus to the generation of such a charging
      current signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] This object becomes 7 dissolved with the features of the
      claims 1 and. In the Unteransprüchen features prefered embodiments
      of the present invention are characterized.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The German patent application 10 2008 53 407,2-45 of 27.
      October 2008 describes among other things an apparatus to the
      generation of electrical energy, which exhibits at least a lithium
      ion accumulator as well as means to the generation of a static
      magnetic field to locations at least of the lithium ion
      accumulator.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The inventor of the present invention has the observation
      made with the use of the apparatus described in the patent
      application specified above that also from such an apparatus
      generated current of galvanic elements, like lead nickel
      accumulators or such a thing, and electrolytic capacitors in very
      much short time and with one much high efficiency to be loaded to
      be able. On the search for the cause for this significant more
      favourable load behavior found became that the so prepared
      charging current has other properties than for example a
      comparable charging current generated by a normal lab power supply
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In particular found became that with the observed very
      short charging times from the apparatus specified above to the
      generation of electrical energy into the galvanic element or into
      the electrolytic capacitor a current with a so large current
      intensity (approximately calculated between 30 and 50 A) would
      have had to flow, which would have let melt the used lead wires or
      to warm up at least noticeably have. This was even not however the
      case, not if as connecting cable a stripped telephone wire with a
      cross-section area of less than 1 mm&lt; of 2&gt; used became.
      This could be touched during the charging operation without more
      worth, which for a minimum heating on a temperature below 30
      [deg.]C speaks.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] While a current flows by an electrical conductor, the
      electrons drifting by the electrical conductor experience an inner
      frictional force, which is the same electrical force and is this
      opposite. The electrical energy becomes by those the electrical
      force opposite same large inner frictional force in warm one
      converted. This warm one one calls the Joule warm one or
      currentwarm. It is it, those the conductor with high current
      heated. The heating of an electrical conductor accompanies with
      its thermal expansion, which one makes oneself with hot wire
      instrument movements the measurement of current intensities. A
      correlation becomes prepared between the linear extension of an
      hot wire with the current flow and the current intensity by the
      hot wire of the flowing stream. A simple constructed hot wire
      instrument movement consists of a wire biased with a tension
      spring, which is partial wound around a movable stored shaft, at
      which a pointer mounted is. If the hot wire expands due to its
      heating by by it the flowing stream, then the tension spring
      catches this prolonged enlargement and the shaft with the pointer
      turns. Such Hitz one can calibrate wire work, by one the z. B.
      additional current with various currents, measured with a digital
      measuring instrument, and various pointer positions on a scale
      labeled.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Such an hot wire instrument movement can do thus calibrated
      will and can by an electrical conductor the flowing stream precise
      indicate. Another type to measure by an electrical conductor the
      flowing stream evaluates arising magnetic field to the measurement
      stromata its around the conductor. DC can become with clip current
      ammeters, which exhibit a current sensor, measured. These clip
      current ammeters exhibit a opening by hinges ferrite or iron
      bundle of laminations handle and the current sensors work after
      the compensation principle (backing-off current transducer) or the
      Hall effect (Hall sensor) or with magnetic field-dependent
      resistors as well as an electrical transducer.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] With a measurement of the current intensity from the
      described above apparatus to the generation of electrical energy
      to a galvanic element or an electrolytic capacitor of the flowing
      stream the subsequent observation became made: If the current with
      a hot wire instrument movement becomes measured, then this
      indicates a significant smaller current intensity than a
      simultaneous used current pliers measuring instrument.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] As counter proof a commercial lab power supply unit with
      limitable Stromabgabe became used the charge of a galvanic element
      or a Elktrolytkondensators. Here measured by the connecting
      conductor between lab power supply unit and galvanic element or
      electrolytic capacitor the flowing stream became likewise on the
      one hand with the hot wire instrument movement and on the other
      hand with the clip current ammeter.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Here shown both metres always in the frame of the
      measurement accuracy of same values on.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The current delivered from the described above apparatus to
      the generation of electrical energy in the following charging
      current signal mentioned becomes. This charging current signal a
      generated magnetic field around the electrical conductor, by which
      it flows, which corresponds to a current intensity, which is
      larger as the current intensity measured with the hot wire
      instrument movement.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The current intensity measured with the hot wire instrument
      movement stands in conformity with the observation that itself
      also a thin lead wire with loadings of the galvanic element or the
      electrolytic capacitor not substantial heated. If one adjusts the
      lab power supply unit to a delivery stream, which corresponds to
      the current intensity, which became displayed with the use of the
      described above apparatus the generation of electrical energy of
      the hot wire instrument movement, and used one the lab power
      supply unit as current source, then no substantial heating of the
      thin lead wire shows up also here.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] If one adjusts on the other hand the lab power supply unit
      to a Stromabgabe, which corresponds to the current intensity,
      which became displayed with the use of the described above
      apparatus the generation of electrical energy by the clip current
      ammeter, then this leads inevitably to a glowing and subsequent
      melts of the thin lead wire.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] One proceeds from the assumption that the hot wire
      instrument movement actual by the connecting line between the
      described above apparatus to the generation electrical energy and
      the galvanic element and/or. indicates to the electrolytic
      capacitor, what in accordance with the observation stands that
      also thin lead wires warm up only insignificantly, then means this
      the fact that this so generated, charging current signal according
      to invention leads to it that around the electrical conductor, by
      which the charging current signal flows a magnetic field generated
      becomes, which corresponds to a significant higher current
      intensity. The causes for this effect are so far unerklärt.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It means on the other hand that introduced during a
      charging operation with the charging current signal according to
      invention into the galvanic element which can be loaded or the
      electrolytic capacitor a certain charge quantity of an external
      power source does not become into the galvanic element or into the
      electrolytic capacitor, which can become this then after trigger
      of warm losses again removed. Rather the effected charging current
      signal according to invention in the galvanic element or the
      electrolytic capacitor there a separation of load, which is not
      correlated with that Joule warm ones in a conductor producing
      current portion of the charging current signal, but with the field
      strength of the magnetic field generated of the charging current
      signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] It concerns here thus obviously not around a ledigliche
      transmission of a charge quantity in a certain time of an external
      power source on a galvanic element or an electrolytic capacitor,
      but the initiation of a separation of load within a galvanic
      element or an electrolytic capacitor by the charging current
      signal according to invention. If one refers the charge state
      achieved in the galvanic element or the electrolytic capacitor
      after a predetermined time on, the Joule warm ones producing
      current portion of the charging current signal measured with the
      hot wire instrument movement, then this results in one much high
      efficiency, which does not pour from a simple charge transfer of
      external current into the galvanic element or the electrolytic
      capacitor understood can become. The charging current signal
      according to invention activates rather within a galvanic element
      or an electrolytic capacitor a separation of load.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Test series, according to invention became charged with
      which galvanic elements and electrolytic capacitors with the
      charging current signal, to have result in that beyond that the
      charging current signal according to invention the charging
      operation opposite a charge with conventional chargers and/or.

      indicates a significant smaller current intensity than a
      simultaneous used current pliers measuring instrument.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] As counter proof a commercial lab power supply unit with
      limitable Stromabgabe became used the charge of a galvanic element
      or an electrolytic capacitor. Here measured by the connecting
      conductor between lab power supply unit and galvanic element or
      electrolytic capacitor the flowing stream became likewise on the
      one hand with the hot wire instrument movement and on the other
      hand with the clip current ammeter.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Here shown both metres always in the frame of the
      measurement accuracy of same values on.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The current delivered from the described above apparatus to
      the generation of electrical energy in the following charging
      current signal mentioned becomes. This charging current signal a
      generated magnetic field around the electrical conductor, by which
      it flows, which corresponds to a current intensity, which is
      larger as the current intensity measured with the hot wire
      instrument movement.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The current intensity measured with the hot wire instrument
      movement stands in conformity with the observation that itself
      also a thin lead wire with loadings of the galvanic element or the
      electrolytic capacitor not substantial heated. If one adjusts the
      lab power supply unit to a delivery stream, which corresponds to
      the current intensity, which became displayed with the use of the
      described above apparatus the generation of electrical energy of
      the hot wire instrument movement, and used one the lab power
      supply unit as current source, then no substantial heating of the
      thin lead wire shows up also here.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] If one adjusts on the other hand the lab power supply unit
      to a Stromabgabe, which corresponds to the current intensity,
      which became displayed with the use of the described above
      apparatus the generation of electrical energy by the clip current
      ammeter, then this leads inevitably to a glowing and subsequent
      melts of the thin lead wire.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] One proceeds from the assumption that the hot wire
      instrument movement actual by the connecting line between the
      described above apparatus to the generation electrical energy and
      the galvanic element and/or. indicates to the electrolytic
      capacitor, what in accordance with the observation stands that
      also thin lead wires warm up only insignificantly, then means this
      the fact that this so generated, charging current signal according
      to invention leads to it that around the electrical conductor, by
      which the charging current signal flows a magnetic field generated
      becomes, which corresponds to a significant higher current
      intensity. The causes for this effect are so far unerklärt.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It means on the other hand that introduced during a
      charging operation with the charging current signal according to
      invention into the galvanic element which can be loaded or the
      electrolytic capacitor a certain charge quantity of an external
      power source does not become into the galvanic element or into the
      electrolytic capacitor, which can become this then after trigger
      of warm losses again removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Rather the effected charging current signal according to
      invention in the galvanic element or the electrolytic capacitor
      there a separation of load, which is not correlated with that
      Joule warm ones in a conductor producing current portion of the
      charging current signal, but with the field strength of the
      magnetic field generated of the charging current signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It concerns here thus obviously not around a ledigliche
      transmission of a charge quantity in a certain time of an external
      power source on a galvanic element or an electrolytic capacitor,
      but the initiation of a separation of load within a galvanic
      element or an electrolytic capacitor by the charging current
      signal according to invention. If one refers the charge state
      achieved in the galvanic element or the electrolytic capacitor
      after a predetermined time on, the Joule warm ones producing
      current portion of the charging current signal measured with the
      hot wire instrument movement, then this results in one much high
      efficiency, which cannot become from a simple charge transfer of
      an external power source understood into the galvanic element or
      the electrolytic capacitor. The charging current signal according
      to invention activates rather within a galvanic element or an
      electrolytic capacitor a separation of load.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Test series, according to invention became charged with
      which galvanic elements and electrolytic capacitors with the
      charging current signal, to have result in that beyond that the
      charging current signal according to invention the charging
      operation opposite a charge with conventional chargers and/or.
      Current sources significant shortened.<br>

      ...The main thing is, that he uses a magnet field around flat
      Li-accumulators (extracted from cell phone batteries, without the
      charging security circuit in them) to "polarize" them somehow. If
      you then draw current from them, this current charges up
      electrolytic caps and lead acid batteries very fast.<br>
      <br>
      He made another test, where a few&nbsp; Li-accumulators in series
      this way charged up a discharged 12 Volts lead acid battery up to
      a full charge up to 14 Volts in very fast 20 minutes or so. The
      lead acid battery then had full capacity.<br>
      <br>
      The Li-accumulators were not much discharged afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      So if anybody want to try this, just take 4 Li-accumulators from a
      cell phone and put them in series and put a few magnets around
      them and charge them up when the magnets still stick to them. This
      seems to polarize them. Then when the Li-accumulators are fully
      charged, put them all in series and charge a discharged 12 Volts
      lead acid battery with it, but don´t put any ampmeter between it,
      as this prevents the fast charging. <br>
      <br>
      Or just repeat the test that is shown in the german video.<br>
      <br>
      There he also has 2 discharged lead acid batteries in parallel
      with the Li-accumulators inside the magnet array. the 2 batteries
      at the top wrapped in the alufoil probably don´t have any effect,
      maybe he just only made it this way to not give too much away from
      the basic effect. They also seem not to be connected, as he only
      has one copper band there and not 2 contacts... But when you read
      the patents it gets clearer.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There are also other patents out there that use magnets wrapped
      around Li-accumulators to enhance their charging capacity.<br>
      <br>
      But the main effect is the the fast charging without Joule heating
      of the electrolyte capacitor. This way, if supercaps can be used,
      an electric could be recharged very fast and economical !<br>
      <br>
      Maybe the Tesla Roadster then won´t&nbsp; need anymore any
      expensive battery pack, but just a stack of 2700 Farad supercaps
      will do, which also will be recharged in just a few minutes
      instead of hours ! And it does not need much energy from your grid
      outlet also !<br>

      Coler converter of sorts.. very interesting.<br>
      <br>
      No, just some kind of polarisation stuff for Li-Ion or Li-Polymer
      batteries that changes the behaviour of the charging current...
      Maybe it freezes just one axis of the electron movement or changes
      the electron or Ion spins, so the charging current does not have
      any real ohmic losses when it is applied to the capacitor ? Maybe
      then massive currents can flow without the Joule heating in small
      diameter wires ? Maybe some kind of room temperature
      supra-conductor effect through magnetic polarisation ? Who knows,
      must be researched..<br>
      <br>
      Regards, Stefan.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe not but I see a relation between the magnets and current
      flow through the magnetic field as seen in the patent papers. Its
      very coler-ish. regardless of whatever magic mechanism is going on
      with the batteries.<br>

      It would appear you have to strip out the IC regulator from the
      lithium pack. Most cellphone batteries and laptop lithium have on
      board charge control.<br>
      <br>
      Be VERY careful if you puncture a lithium battery bag it will
      explode violentlywith a gush of FIRE!!<br>
      <br>
      Now i tried one today it was a 3.7v nokia battery it was very
      dead. It measured 0v.<br>
      <br>
      So i cut open the pack and inside is the lithium bag. Don't
      puncture it or melt it with a soldering iron or you will be in a
      world of shit!<br>
      <br>
      Coming from the edge is two foil strips one i managed to solder a
      wire on it which is hard not to get any heat near the battery bag.
      The other one was broken short so close i dare not risk an iron
      close to it so i just managed to hook a croc clip on it. It
      measure 2.9v wo the regulator IC was disconnecting it as they are
      supposed to below 3 volts. I spent about 15 mins swiping a few neo
      magnets all over it, front back etc and connected up 2 off
      100,000Uf caps so 200,000uf in total. The voltage went up to 3
      volts on the caps and shorting it made a good crack on the
      screwdriver.<br>
      <br>
      I can not reproduce the results in the patent with what i have
      here i also wound 250 turns of magnet wire around it and zapped it
      several times with a 12v battery. Again i did not notice any
      effect of extra volts or anything unusual on the caps. I don't
      have any magnetic strip stuff. If you are going to do this i
      strongly suggest you buy Radio Control LiPO packs as they do not
      have any battery electronics and its safer easier to get to the
      raw lipo cells. The RC lipo helicopter cells cost only about $1.50
      each.<br>
      <br>
      Most of the magnet strip you can find on Ebay have a north pole
      strip and south pole strip. They name them A and B strips which
      attract to each other for door closers etc. Now i do not know if
      these strips are the same polarity as discussed in the patent but
      there are hundreds of suppliers of all the same A and B magnet
      strips on Ebay.<br>
      <br>
      BTW most bare lithium ion cells are charged to 4.2 volts (never
      more than that for safety and longevity of the battery) and will
      run at 3.6 volts or so under load.&nbsp; Try to never let them go
      below 2.8 volts or they will suffer damage and shortened life.
      bolt,&nbsp; hope you didn't breathe any burning lithium cell fumes
      as that stuff is really bad.&nbsp; I'm on another forum where
      lithium batteries are discussed all the time and they've got some
      real battery experts there.&nbsp; They have occasional explosions
      with these as they are largely used in sealed devices.&nbsp; Most
      problems happen from cell reverse charging when you have multiple
      cells in series or from overcharging and too fast discharging. <br>

      One thing I find of concern.&nbsp; He says he completely discarged
      the Li-ion cells to zero.&nbsp; For one you should never do that
      both because it's dangerous and because it's damaging to the
      cells.&nbsp; Li-ion cells are nothing like NiMH or NiCd
      cells.&nbsp; From reading the info it almost sounds like he thinks
      they are the same or similar in use as NiMH.&nbsp; Running a
      Li-ion completely to zero is very hard on the cells but they will
      self recover quite a bit of voltage if it only is done a couple
      times.&nbsp; Just mentioning this but that is not to say it is a
      hole in his idea - just a concern as I was reading this. <br>

      Sir you are absolutely correct,This is a humungous no no with
      lithium batteries!<br>
      <br>
      Surely he knows this! perhaps a prerequisite conditioning of sorts
      ,to attain the "Effect"?<br>

      Chet,&nbsp; Yes I hope if anyone is trying this that they realize
      how explosive these cells can be under a dead short.&nbsp; It
      doesn't always happen but I've seen enough pictures of the damage
      from them to know people here need to be aware of it.&nbsp; I'll
      try first without that step of shorting but might sacrifice a
      couple if it doesn't work without that.&nbsp; For anyone trying
      this I'd suggest heavy fireproof box outside with protective gear
      like face shield and heavy gloves etc.&nbsp; Preferable to short
      and then stand back a distance.<br>
      <br>
      One thing I haven't figured out yet is whether it makes a
      difference whether the N or S is near the positive of the
      battery.&nbsp; It looks like the drawing shows the North pole by
      the positive battery pole if he is using standard battery
      schematic convention. <br>
