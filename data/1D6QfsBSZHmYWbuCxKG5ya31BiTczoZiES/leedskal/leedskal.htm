          <b>E. Leedskalnin, </b><b><br>
          </b>Rock Gate, Homestead, Florida USA <br>
          1945</p>
      </center>
      <p>This writing is lined up so that when you read it you look
        East, and all the description you will read about magnetic
        current, it will be just as good as your electricity. </p>
      <p>Following is the result of my two years experiment with magnets
        at Rock Gate, 17 miles Southwest from Miami, Florida, between
        25th and 26th Latitude and 80th and 81st Longitude West. </p>
      <p>First I will describe what a magnet is. You have seen straight
        bar magnets, U-shape magnets, sphere or ball magnets and Alnico
        magnets in many shapes, and usually a hole in the middle. In all
        magnets one end of the metal is North Pole and the other South
        Pole, and those which have no end one side is North Pole and the
        other South Pole. </p>
      <p>Now about the sphere magnet. If you have a strong magnet you
        can change the poles in the sphere in any side you want or take
        the poles out so the sphere will not be a magnet anymore. From
        this you can see that the metal is not the real magnet. The real
        magnet is the substance that is circulating in the metal. Each
        particle in the substance is an individual magnet by itself, and
        both North and South Pole individual magnets. They are so small
        that they can pass through everything. In fact they can pass
        through easier than through the air. They are in constant
        motion, they are running one kind of magnets against the other
        kind, and if guided in the right channels they possess perpetual
        power. The North and South Pole magnets they are cosmic force,
        they hold together this earth and everything on it. Each North
        and South Pole magnet is equal in strength, but the strength of
        each individual magnet doesn’t amount to anything. To be of
        practical use they will have to be in great numbers. </p>
      <p>In permanent magnets they are circulating in the metal in great
        numbers, and they circulate in the following way: Each kind of
        the magnets are coming out of their own end of the pole and are
        running around, and are running in the other end of the pole and
        back to its own end, and then over and over again. All the
        individual magnets do not run around. Some run away are never
        come back, but new ones take their place. </p>
      <p>The earth itself is a great big magnet. In general these North
        and South Pole individual magnets are circulating in the same
        way as in the permanent magnet metal. The North Pole individual
        magnets are coming out of the earth’s South Pole and are running
        around in the earth’s North Pole and back to its own pole, and
        South Pole individual magnets are coming out of the earth’s
        North Pole and are running around, and in earth South Pole and
        back to its own end, The both North and South Pole individual
        magnets start to run over and over again. </p>
      <p>In a permanent magnet bar between the poles there is a
        semi-neutral part where there is not much going in or out, but
        on the earth there is no place where the magnets are not going
        in or out, but the magnets are tuning in and out at pole ends
        more than at the Equator. Now you get the equipment and I will
        tell you so you can see for yourself that it is in the way I
        have told. Get a permanent magnet bar four inches long. A
        U-shape magnet that is strong enough to lift from 10 to 20
        pounds. An Alnico magnet about 3 inches long, 2 and a half
        inches wide, one inch thick. Hole in the middle and poles in
        each end, several feet in length of hard steel fishing line.
        Line when it is not in coil it stays straight and a soft steel
        welding rod one-eighth of an inch thick and 3 feet long. From
        the fishing wire and the welding rod you will make magnets or
        compasses, and if you hang them up by fine threads by at the
        middle and keep them there they will be permanent magnets. </p>
      <p>When you are making a magnet pole in the welding rod use
        U-shape magnet. A South Pole magnet to make North Pole magnet in
        the rod. You can drag the magnet over the rod from end to end,
        but never stop in the middle. If you stop in middle there will
        be an extra pole so it will disturb the magnet’s circulation.
        Use iron filings to test the rod if there are any magnets in the
        middle, and if there is the filings will cling to it. Then drag
        the permanent magnet over the rod and it will take it out. To
        take the magnet out from rod ends approach or touch the rod end
        with the same kind of magnet that is in the rod, by dipping the
        rod ends in iron filings, you will see how it works. </p>
      <p>Break 3 pieces of the steel fishing line just long enough to go
        in between the two poles of the U-shape permanent magnet. Put
        them endwise between the two poles, and take them out. Hand one
        by the middle with fine thread, and hang it up in East side of
        the room where there is no other magnet or metal around. Now you
        will have a permanent magnet or compass to test the polarity in
        other magnets. For more delicate use hand the magnet in spider
        web. To test the strength of a magnet use iron filings. </p>
      <p>Put the U-shape permanent magnet 2 feet West from the hanging
        magnet. Hold the North Pole magnet level with the hanging
        magnet, then you will see that the South Pole of the hanging
        magnet is turning to you and the North Pole magnet away from
        you. Now put the South Pole permanent magnet pole at the same
        level; this time the North Pole magnet will turn to you and
        South Pole magnet away from you. This experiment shows two
        things, one that the magnets can be sent out in straight
        streams, and other whatever kind of magnets you are sending out
        the other kind of magnets are coming back to you. </p>
      <p>Take two pieces of steel fishing line wire, put them in U-shape
        magnet, hold a little while, take them out, bend a little back
        on one end and hand them up, and make it so that one magnet’s
        lower end is North Pole magnet and the other South Pole magnet.
        Make it so that they hang 3 inches apart. Put North Pole North
        side, and South Pole South side. Now take the 4-inch long
        permanent magnet bar, hold North Pole in North side and South
        Pole in South side. Raise slowly up to the two hanging magnets,
        then you will see that the hanging magnets are closing up. Now
        reverse, put North Pole of bar magnet South side and South Pole
        North side. This time when bar magnet approaches the hanging
        magnets will spread out. This experiment shows that North and
        South Pole magnets are equal in strength and that the streams of
        individual magnets are running one kind of magnets against the
        other kind. </p>
      <p>Cut a strip of a tin can about 2 inches wide and a foot long.
        Put the North Pole of the U shape magnet on top of the strip,
        and dip the lower end in iron filings, and see how much it
        lifts. Now put the South Pole on top and see how much it lifts.
        Change several times, then you will see that the North Pole
        lifts more than the South Pole. Now put the North Pole magnet
        under the iron filing box, and see how much it pushes up. Now
        change, put South Pole magnet under the box and see how much it
        pushes up. Do this several times, then you will see that the
        South Pole magnet pushes up more than North Pole magnet. This
        experiment shows again that on level ground the magnets are in
        equal strength. </p>
      <p>Now take the 3-foot long soft steel welding rod. It is already
        magnetized as a permanent magnet, hang it with a fine thread so
        it is level. Now measure each and you will see that the South
        end is longer. In my location at Rock Gate, between 25 and 26
        Latitude and 80 and 81 Longitude West, in 3-foot long magnet
        South Pole end is about a sixteenth of an inch longer. Farther
        North it should be longer yet, but at Equator both ends of the
        magnet should be equal in length. In earth’s South hemisphere
        the North Pole end of a magnet should be longer. </p>
      <p>All my hanging magnets or compasses never point to the earth’s
        magnetic pole, neither to the geographical pole. They point a
        little Northeast. The only reason I can figure out why they
        point in that way is, looking from the same geographical
        meridian the North magnetic pole is on, the South magnetic pole
        is 115 longitudes West from it. In rough estimation the earth’s
        South magnetic pole is 260 miles West from the same meridian the
        earth’s North magnetic pole is on. That causes the North and
        South Pole magnets to run in Northeast and Southwest direction.
        My location is too far away from the magnetic poles so all my
        magnets are guided by the general stream of individual North and
        South pole magnets that are passing by. </p>
      <p>Now I will tell you what magnetic current is. Magnetic current
        is the same as electric current is a wrong expression. Really it
        is not one current; they are two currents, one current is
        composed of North Pole magnets and the other is composed of
        South Pole individual magnets in concentrated streams, and they
        are running one stream against the other stream in swirling,
        screw-like fashion, and with high speed. One current alone if it
        be North Pole magnet current or South Pole magnet current cannot
        run alone. To run one current will have to run against the
        other. </p>
      <p>Now I will tell you how the currents are running when they come
        out of a car battery, and what they can do. Now get the
        equipment. First put a wooden box on the floor, open side up,
        cut two notches in middle so you can put a one-eighth of an inch
        thick and 18-inch long copper wire across the box. Put the wire
        one end East, the other West. Stay yourself West, put car
        battery South side of the box positive terminal East, negative
        terminal West, get two flexible leads and four clips to fit the
        battery and the bare copper wire, connect the East end of the
        copper wire with positive terminal, clip the West end of the
        copper wire with the West end of the copper wire with the West
        end flexible lead, leave the connection with negative terminal
        open. </p>
      <p>Break two pieces of the steel fishing line one inch long, put
        each piece by middle across the copper wire, one on top of the
        copper wire and the other under, hold with your fingers, now
        touch the negative terminal with the loose clip, hold until the
        copper wire gets hot. Take them off; now you have two magnets,
        hand them up by the middle with fine thread. The upper magnet
        will hang the way it is now, but the one below will turn around.
        Break 5 inches long piece of the fishing line, put the middle of
        the wire across and on top of the copper wire, touch the
        battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot, dip the middle of
        the wire in iron filings, then you will see how long a magnet
        can be made with this equipment. </p>
      <p>Break or cut several pieces of the hard steel fishing as long
        as to go between the poles of the U-shape magnet, now hold two
        pieces of the steel wire ends up and down, one wire South side
        of the copper wire, and the other North side, the lower ends
        just below the copper wire. Hold tight and touch the battery,
        hold until the copper wire gets hot, now hand them up by upper
        end just above the copper wire, touch battery, the South side
        magnet will swing South, and the North side magnet will swing
        North. Put two pieces on top of the copper wire, the ends just a
        little over the copper wire. Those ends lying on copper wire,
        one pointing South and the other North, hold tight, touch
        battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot, take off the one
        pointing South is South Pole magnet and the one pointing North
        is North pole magnet. Put one wire on top of the copper wire
        pointing South, other below pointing North. Magnetize, hang up
        by tail ends on the copper wire, touch battery, they both will
        swing South. Put one wire on tip of the copper wire pointing
        North, the other below pointing South, magnetize, hand up by
        tail end above the copper wire, touch the battery, both magnets
        will swing North. </p>
      <p>Cut 6 pieces of fishing wire one inch long, put them by middle
        on top and across the copper wire. Hold tight, touch battery,
        hold until copper wire gets hot. Take off, now put glass over
        the copper wire, put those 6 pieces of magnets on glass, on top
        of the copper wire lengthwise just so the ends don’t touch each
        other, touch the battery, they all will turn across the copper
        wire; now pull three to South side and three to North side in
        the same way, they lie now but about one-half of an inch away
        from the copper wire. Now roll all six together, let loose, and
        you will see that they won’t stay together. Magnetize one piece
        in U-shape magnet, put North pole end East on the copper wire,
        and South pole West, touch the battery, the magnet will swing
        left. Now put South pole East side and North pole West side,
        this time the magnet will turn right, take glass off. </p>
      <p>Take one piece of hard steel fishing wire, dip in iron filings
        and see there is no magnet in it. This time hold the wire up and
        down, the lower end on middle of the copper wire, hold tight.
        Touch the battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot. Take it
        off. Dip the wire in iron filings and you will see that it is no
        magnet. Why? To make magnets with currents from batteries and
        dynamos with a single wire the metal will have to be put on the
        wire in such a way so that the magnets which are coming out of
        the wire will be running in the metal starting from the middle
        of the metal and run to the end and not from end to middle and
        across as they did this last time, You have read that to make a
        Sought Pole in a coil end that is pointing to you, you will have
        to run positive electricity in the coil in a clockwise
        direction. I can tell you that the positive electricity has
        nothing to do with making a South magnet pole in the coil. Each
        pole South or North is made by their own magnets in the way they
        are running in the wire. This magnet-making with a single wire,
        illustrates how all magnets are made. </p>
      <p>In a car battery the North Pole magnets run out of positive
        terminal and South Pole magnets run out of negative terminal.
        Bit kinds of magnets are running, one kind of magnets against
        the other kind, and are running in the same right-hand screw
        fashion. By using the same whirling motion and running one kind
        of magnets against the other kind, they throw their own magnets
        from the wire in opposite directions. That is why if you put a
        magnet metal across the copper wire the one end is North Pole
        and the other end South Pole. </p>
      <p>Get four pieces of wire size 16, 6 inches long, 2 copper and 2
        soft iron, bend one end of each wire back so the clips can hold
        it better. Use copper wire first. Put both wires in clips,
        connect with battery, have the wire ends square, now put the
        loose ends together, and pull them away. Then you will notice
        that something is holding you back. What is it? They are
        magnets. When you put the ends together, the North and South
        Pole magnets are passing from one wire to the other, the North
        and South Pole magnets are passing from one wire to the other,
        and in doing it they pull the wire ends together. Now put the
        soft iron wire in the clips, put the loose ends together, and
        pull them away. This time the passing magnets hold the wire ends
        together stronger. Put the ends together many times, then you
        will see which wire end gets red first, and which will make the
        bigger bubble in the end, and watch the little sparks coming out
        from the bubbles. Stretch the bubbles out while they are in
        liquid form, then you will see in the bubble that something is
        whirling around. Those little sparks you see coming out of the
        bubble, they are not the magnets,, but the magnets are the ones
        which throw the sparks out of the bubbles. When all the magnets
        that are in the wire, if they cannot pass over to the other
        wire, they are expanding the bubble and running out of it and
        carrying the metal sparks with them. When the bubble is cool,
        break it up, then you will see the space left where the magnets
        were in. </p>
      <p>Get two pieces of lumber, one by six inches, a foot long, nail
        them together so that one lies flat on floor and the other on
        top the edges up and down. Cut a notch in end in upper piece, 4
        inches deep and as high as to hold a piece of wood or brass that
        would hold needle points in ends and have a hole in middle to
        hold the 3-ffot magnet. Balance the magnet well so it would stop
        on its right magnetic position. Now put the car battery South
        side positive terminal East and negative terminal West. Connect
        the East end of the copper wire with positive terminal and
        connect the West end of the copper wire with the West end lead,
        hold the copper wire just above the magnet a quarter of an inch
        North of magnet’s end, hold in level and square. Touch the
        battery, then you will see the magnet swinging East. Now put the
        battery North side, positive terminal East, negative terminal
        West, connect West end of the copper wire with negative
        terminal, connect East end of copper wire with East side lead,
        put the copper wire on top of the magnet a quarter of an inch
        South of magnet’s end, hold the copper wire just above in square
        and level, touch the positive terminal, ten you will see the
        magnet swinging West. If the battery is right, magnet strong
        enough, and the magnet rod balanced well, it will repeat the
        same thing every time. </p>
      <p>I think the batteries are not made right. Sometimes there is
        more of North Pole magnets than there are South Pole magnets.
        They should be equal, the same as from generators which do not
        run the South Pole magnets in frame or base, but run directly
        away the same as they run the North Pole magnets. </p>
      <p>From the following experiment you will see that the battery is
        not balanced right. Put the copper wire across the box, one end
        East, the other West, connect one lead a foot West from the East
        end and the other lead with West end, hand a magnet in spider
        web, put the magnet in same level with the copper wire. Keep the
        copper wire end a little away from magnet’s North Pole, connect
        East lead with positive terminal, tap the negative terminal
        several times with the loose clip, and see that the magnet is
        doing. Change the terminal, change the tapping, move the box and
        copper wire to the South Pole end, repeat the same thing. Then
        you will notice sometimes the copper wire end pushes away the
        North Pole magnet, and sometimes it pulls it in and the same
        thing happens with South Pole magnet, and sometimes it does
        nothing. So it shows the battery is irregular. </p>
      <p>Connect the leads with battery’s terminals to make a loop, keep
        the leads on the same level with battery, drag a hanging magnet
        over the loop and the connections between the battery’s
        terminals. You will see that one end of the magnet keeps inside
        the loop, and the other outside, and the same thing happens when
        the magnet crosses the connection between the terminals. This
        experiment indicates that the North and South Pole magnet
        currents are not only running from one terminal to the other,
        but are running around in an orbit and are not only running one
        time around, but are running many times around until the North
        and South Pole individual magnets get thrown out of the wire by
        centrifugal force, and by crowding. While the North and South
        Pole magnets were in their own terminals they only possessed
        pushing power, the pulling power they acquire only if the other
        kind of magnets are in front of them, like the permanent magnets
        if you put the opposite magnet in front of it, then they will
        hold together. The same way you have done with the 6-inches long
        pieces of copper and soft iron wire. </p>
      <p>From the experiment with the car battery you can see the
        principle how permanent magnets are made by North and South Pole
        individual magnet currents running in a single wire from
        battery. How did the magnets get in there? As I said in the
        beginning, the North and South Pole magnets they are the cosmic
        force, they hold together this earth and everything on it. Some
        metals and non-metals have more of the magnets than others. The
        North and South Pole magnets have the power to build up and take
        down, for instance in welding, in electroplating they put one
        metals on the other, and if you burn a metal too much in an
        electric furnace the metal will disappear in air. </p>
      <p>The North and South Pole magnets were put in the car battery by
        a generator. When the North and South Pole magnets went in the
        battery they built up a matter that held the magnets themselves,
        and later on the acid takes the matter in parts and separates
        the magnets and sends them to their own terminals, and from
        there they come out. In other batteries the acid takes the zinc
        in parts and sends the North Pole magnets to positive terminal
        and holds the South Pole magnets by itself for negative
        terminal. When the connections are made the magnets will come
        out of the battery and will come out until the zinc will last.
        When the zinc is gone the magnets are gone, too. This should be
        sufficient to see that the North and South Pole magnets are
        holding everything together. You saw how magnetic currents are
        made in battery from metal by acid. Next I will tell you how
        magnetic currents are made by permanent and electric magnets,
        and then without either. </p>
      <p>This time you will make an equipment that can be used for four
        purposes. Electric magnet, transformer, generator and holder of
        perpetual motion. Bend iron or soft steel bar one and one-half
        inch in diameter, bend in a U-shape each prong a foot long, and
        3 inches between the prongs, make two spools from brass or
        aluminum 6 inches long and bid enough for the bar to go in. Wind
        1500 turns of insulated copper wire, size 16, on each spool. Put
        on as close to the bend as it will go. Connect the battery wit
        the coils so that each current is running in both coils at the
        same time, and so that one end of the bar is North Pole and the
        other South Pole. Now you have an electric magnet. </p>
      <p>This time the same thing will be a transformer. It will not be
        economical, it is only to show how a transformer works. Wind a
        coil of 1500 turns with insulated copper wire, size 18, on a
        spool less than 3 inches long, so that one inch and a half
        square iron rod can go in easy, get 2 rods, one 3 inches, the
        other 6 inches long. If possible have them from laminated iron.
        Get two radio blue bead, 6 to 8 volt light bulbs. Now connect
        one light bulb with the 3-inch coil, put the coil without a core
        between the loose ends of the iron prongs, connect the 6-inch
        coils with battery, leave negative terminal open. Tap the
        negative terminal, then you will see the wire inside the light
        bulb turn red. Put the iron core in the coil’s hole, tap the
        battery, this time it will make light. Why did it not make just
        as much light. Why did it not make just as much light the first
        time? The battery put just as much magnet in those iron prongs
        the first time as it did the last time, but as you see the coil
        did not get the magnets. Now you see the soft iron has a lot to
        do to make magnetic currents. </p>
      <p>Magnetic currents, or if you want to call it electric current,
        make no light. We only get light if we put obstructions in the
        light bulbs. In the light bulbs the wire is so small that all
        magnets cannot pass through easily, so they heat the wire up and
        burn and make light. If the wire in the light bulb had been as
        large inside as it is outside then there would be no light. Hen
        those individual magnets which are in the coil would dissipate
        in air. </p>
      <p>Both North and South individual magnet currents which came out
        of the car battery and went in the transformer were direct
        currents, but the light in the bulb was caused by alternating
        currents. (Have in mind that always there are two currents, one
        current alone cannot run. To run they have to run one against
        the other). You transformed currents in kind.Now I will tell you
        how to transform currents in strength. To make higher voltage
        you wind the coil with smaller wire and more turns and to have
        less voltage wind the coil with bigger wire and less turns. The
        difference now is that this transformer makes alternating
        currents from direct currents and the power line transformers
        use alternating currents to make alternating currents in this
        transformer, the iron prong ends remain the same magnet pole,
        but in power line transformers the magnet poles alternate. In
        power line transformers the currents only are in motion and in
        this transformer the currents are in motion and you are, too. </p>
      <p>Now about the generator. In the first place all currents are
        alternating. To get direct currents we have to use a commutator.
        Transformers and generators of any description are making the
        currents in the same way by filling the coil’s iron core with
        magnets and letting the iron core push them in and out into the
        coil. Connect the battery with the electric magnet, it will be a
        field magnet now. Put the 3-inch coil between the iron prongs,
        and take it out, do it fast, repeat it, then you will have a
        steady light in the light bulb. Now you and the field magnet are
        a generator. Suppose you had a wheel and many coils around the
        wheel turning, then you would be making all kinds of light. Do
        not make the machine; I already have the application for patent
        in the Patent Office. I made ten different machines to make
        magnetic currents, but I found this combination between field
        magnets and coils the most efficient. Put the coil in slowly and
        take it out slowly, ten you will have no light. That will show,
        to make magnetic currents, the time is important. </p>
      <p>Put the 6-inch long square rod on top of the two iron prongs,
        fit well so it lies even. Connect the battery with electric
        magnet for a little while, now disconnect the battery, connect
        the light bulb with the electric magnet the same way it was
        connected with the battery, now pull off the 6-inch long bar, do
        it quickly, then you will see light in the bulb, connect the
        battery up again with the electric magnet, put the bar across
        the iron prongs, hold a while, disconnect the battery. Now the
        electric magnet holds perpetual motion. If not disturbed it will
        last indefinitely. I held it in this position for 6 months, and
        when I pulled off the 6-inch bar I got just as much light out of
        it as I got the first time, This experiment shows that if you
        start the North and South Pole individual magnets in an orbit,
        ten they will never stop. The hanging magnets that hand up and
        down, they show that there is motion inside the bar. Hold the
        perpetual motion holder North Pole magnet or pole end East and
        South Pole magnet terminal or pole end West, now raise it up
        slowly to the South Pole hanging magnet, then you will see the
        South Pole hanging magnet swinging South. Now put the perpetual
        motion holder under the North Pole hanging magnet, raise up
        slowly, then you will see the North Pole hanging magnet swinging
        North. This experiment shows without any doubt that the North
        and South Pole individual magnets are running in the same
        direction as those in the copper wire, which came out of the car
        battery, and in both instances while the magnets are running
        ahead in whirling motion they used the right-hand twist. </p>
      <p>Get that Alnico magnet, and make it so you can turn it around
        if possible more than 2000 revolutions per minute. Connect the
        light bulb with the perpetual motion holder, put it on the
        spinning Alnico magnet in the hole between the prongs and the
        square iron bar, now spin the Alnico magnet around and see how
        much of the light you get. Now take the iron bar off, then you
        will get more of the light. It shows that if it is closed, some
        of the magnets which are in the iron prongs will run around in
        an orbit, and will not come out, but when the orbit is broken
        then they will run in the coil, and the result will be more
        light. </p>
      <p>Put a paper box with plenty of iron filings in it on the
        horizontally spinning Alnico magnet, then you will see how the
        spinning magnet build up ridges and ditches. Now put the magnet
        so that it can be turned vertically. Spin the magnet, then you
        will see the filings running against the motion and building up
        ridges and ditches. Out on finer filings, then there will be
        finer ridges and ditches. Spin one way and then the other way,
        then you will have some rough idea how magnets build up the
        matter. </p>
      <p>You made magnetic currents in three different ways, but in
        principle they all were made exactly in the same way. Magnetic
        currents are made by concentrating, then dividing and then
        shifting the existing North and South Pole individual magnets
        from one place to another. Now I will illustrate how my best
        machine for doing it. I will use only one coil, and one U-shape
        permanent magnet without using the winding that the machine uses
        to increase the permanent magnet strength. If you had a
        permanent magnet that the coil you use in the electric magnet
        would go in between the prongs of it, then that would be good to
        demonstrate, but if you have not, then use the same one you
        have. Get an iron core the same dimensions as in the 3-ich coil,
        but long enough to go between the permanent magnet prongs. Wind
        the same number of turns and connect with the light bulb. Fasten
        the U-shape permanent magnet very well, bend up, prongs down,
        North Pole North, South Pole South. Now push the coil through
        the prongs from West to East. Do it fast, then there will be
        light in the bulb, now push the coil and stop in the middle, and
        then push again, this time you will have two lights while the
        coil went through the magnet prongs only once. You had two
        lights the first time also, but you did not notice they came in
        quick succession. When you pushed the coil’s middle up to field
        magnet’s middle the currents ran in one direction, and when you
        pushed the coil away from the field magnet’s middle, then the
        currents reversed, then ran in the other direction. That is why
        you got two light flashes while the coil passed through the
        field magnet only one time. </p>
      <p>Here is the way in which the North and South Pole individual
        magnet currents ran while you pushed the coil from West to East
        through the field magnet. Take the core out of the coil, wind
        one layer of wire on the core and make it so that the North side
        of the winding’s wire’s end points East and South side of the
        winding wire’s end points West. When you pushed the coil to the
        middle of the field magnet, the North Pole magnet current came
        out of the wire end that is pointing East, and the South Pole
        magnet current came out of the wire end that is pointing West,
        but when you pushed the coil away from the middle of the field
        magnet the currents reversed, then North Pole magnet current
        came out of the coil’s wire end that is pointing West and South
        Pole magnet current came out of the coil’s wire end that is
        pointing East. With the same winding if the North Pole field
        magnet had been south side, and South Pole field magnet North
        side, then the running of the currents would be reversed. </p>
      <p>When currents reverse they reverse the magnet poles in the
        coil. Every time when the coil is approaching the field magnets,
        the currents which are made in the coil during that time are
        making magnet poles in the coil’s core ends, the same as those
        field magnet poles they are approaching, but during the time the
        coil is receding those currents are making the coil’s magnet
        poles opposite to the field magnets they are receding from.
        While you have the small coil handy I will tell more about
        magnets. Run South Pole magnet current in the wire end that
        points West, and North Pole magnet current in the wire end that
        points East. Now North end of the coil is South Pole and South
        end of the coil is North Pole. Now run North Pole magnet current
        in West end of the wire, and South Pole magnet in East end of
        the wire. This time the North end of the coil will be North
        Pole, and South end of the coil the South Pole. </p>
      <p>You made the one-inch long magnets with a single wire, but if
        you had the same size of wire in a coil you now have and would
        put a bigger steel bar in the coil then you would have a bigger
        and stronger magnet, but to make a stronger magnet yet, you
        would have to wind more layers on top of the coil that you have
        now. When you were making the small magnets with a single copper
        wire you wasted too many North and South Pole individual
        magnets. You only got in the steel wire a very small part of the
        magnets that came out of the copper wire. You are still wasting
        the North and South Pole magnets. You do not get one-half of the
        magnets in the steel or iron bar from those which are in the
        coil. </p>
      <p>To get more magnet out of a coil, put the coil in steel or iron
        tube, then the tube outside the coil will be a magnet the same
        as the coil’s core, but the magnet poles will be opposite, it
        means at the same coil end if the core end is North Pole the
        tube end will be South Pole. In this way you will get almost
        again as much magnet out of the coil and in the core and tube.
        You can do better yet, join one end of the coil’s core end with
        the same metal, joining core with tube, make two holes in end of
        metal for the coil wire ends to go out, fasten a ring on top,
        now you have the most efficient electric magnet for lifting
        purposes. It wastes no magnets that come from your battery or
        dynamo. </p>
      <p>Take the coil out of the electric magnet, run the currents in
        the coil, put a hard steel bar one end to the coil’s North Pole,
        hold awhile, take away, now the bar is a permanent magnet. That
        end at coil’s side is South Pole magnet, and the other North
        Pole magnet. Now this permanent magnet can make other hard steel
        bars in permanent magnets but every magnet that it makes will be
        a weaker magnet than itself. The coil made this permanent magnet
        in the same way that the permanent magnet in the coil’s hole,
        reverse it, put bar’s North Pole end in coil’s South Pole end,
        run current in the coil for awhile, take the bar out, now you
        have a stronger permanent magnet, but the poles are reversed.
        This shows that the stronger magnet can change the weaker
        magnet. </p>
      <p>When you were pushing the coil through the U-shape magnet you
        got two flashes in the light bulb with one passage through the
        U-shape magnet, and I showed you from which ends of coil’s wire
        the currents came out while they made the flashes. Now I will
        make so you can actually see that it is the way I told you. Take
        the light bulb off the coil, put the core in it, connect the
        coil with a loop that would reach 6 feet East from the U-shape
        magnet. Keep the loop end a foot apart, stretch South side wire
        straight, make it so it cannot move. Get those little hanging
        magnets which hag one end up, the other down, hand the South
        Pole magnet on the loop wire, now push the coil through the
        U-shape magnet and watch the hanging magnet. First it will swing
        South, then North. Now hang North Pole magnet o the wire, watch
        again while you are pushing the coil through the U-shape magnet,
        this time first it will swing North, then South. Hand both
        magnets, watch again and you will see that both magnets at the
        same time first they swing to their own side and then to the
        other side. If the hanging magnets do not swing while you are
        pushing the coil through the U-shape magnet, then the U-shape
        magnet is not strong enough. The U-shape magnet should be strong
        enough to lift 20 pounds. You can put two magnets together or
        use electric magnet, and still better you can put the oil in
        electric magnet, then you won’t to push it. Then you can sit
        down and tap the battery and see the hanging magnets swinging.
        All currents are made in the same way by filling the coil and
        iron core with North and South Pole individual magnets and then
        giving enough time for the magnets to get out and then start
        over again. If you want to use the electric magnet be sure that
        the North Pole is in North side, and the South Pole in South
        side, and put the coil in the prongs in the same way as it is
        now. </p>
      <p>Now I will tell you what happened to the U-shape magnet while
        you pushed the coil through it from West to East. Set up the
        3-foot magnet so it can turn, put the coil with core in it in
        the U-shape magnet, now approach the 3-foot magnet’s South Pole
        with the U-shape magnet’s South Pole. As soon as the 3-foot
        magnet begins to move you stop and mark the distance. Take the
        coil away, approach again as soon as the 3-foot magnet begins to
        move away, then stop and mark the distance, then you will see
        how much strength the U-shape magnet lost while you were pushing
        the coil in and halfway ut of the U-shape magnet. The U-shape
        magnet was losing its strength up to the time it began to break
        away from the iron core, but during the time the U-shape magnet
        broke away it regained its strength. The breaking away from the
        iron core recharged the U-shape magnet, then it became normal
        again and ready for the next start. During the recharging the
        new supply of magnets came from the air or the earth’s magnetic
        field. </p>
      <p>Now we see how the magnetic currents are made by the U-shape
        magnet. You already know that before the coil go in between the
        U-shape magnet prongs those little individual magnets were
        running out of the U-shape magnet prongs in all directions, but
        as soon as the coil’s ore came in effective distance from the
        U-shape magnet’s prongs then these little individual magnets
        began to run in the core and coil and kept running until the
        core broke away fro the U-shape magnet prongs. Now you see those
        little individual magnets ran out of the U-shape magnet and ran
        in the soft iron core, but the soft iron core never held the
        magnets, it pushed them out. To prove it you put 5 or 6 thin
        iron strips on edge, slant just so they will not flop over, now
        approach to the ends of those strips with a magnet and you will
        see they flop over, hold the strips a little loose by the ends,
        then they will spread out. I think this is enough to show that
        the soft iron never held those magnets. It pushed them out. As
        soon as those little individual magnets get pushed out of the
        soft iron core then they run in the coil. When they run in the
        coil they are in bulk form. The coil’s part is to divide those
        little individual magnets from bulk form in small paths.
        Currents can be made with a single wire. The coil is necessary
        to increase the amount and strength of the currents. The coil is
        similar to any cell battery. One cell alone does not amount to
        anything. To be good, many cells have to be in a battery. The
        same in a coil to be good many turns have to be in a coil. </p>
      <p>When the magnets that are in bulk form enter the coil then the
        coil divides them in small paths. When the bulk magnets enter
        the coil they fill the coil’s wire with North and South Pole
        individual magnets. North Pole magnets pointing toward South
        Pole U-shape magnet and South Pole pointing toward North Pole
        U-shape magnet. Now the wire in the coil is one continuous
        magnet. One side of the wire is South Pole and the other North
        Pole. Now we have those little North and South Pole individual
        magnets in the wire, but they are not running in the way we
        want. They are running across the wire. We want magnets to run
        through the wire lengthwise, but there is only one way to do it,
        we have to increase the number of those North and South Pole
        individual magnets. To do it the coil will have to approach and
        enter the U-shape magnet, but when the coil reaches the middle
        of the U-shape magnet the limit is there so the running of the
        currents stops. In the core and the coil there is plenty of
        those little magnets, but they stopped to run through the wire
        lengthwise, now they un only across the coil’s wire, to make the
        magnets run in the wire lengthwise again the coil will have to
        get away form the U-shape magnet. As soon as the coil begins to
        move away from the U-shape magnet, then those little North and
        South Pole individual magnets begin to run again through the
        wire lengthwise, but in opposite direction until the magnet sin
        the iron core are gone. </p>
      <p>I told you that the coil is a magnet during the time the
        currents are made, now I will show you. Get a small paper box to
        go in between the prongs of the U-shape magnet, put iron filings
        in it. Wrap 6-inch long soft iron wire with paper, put the wire
        in box in iron filings, now put the box between the U-shape
        magnet prongs. Raise the wire up, then you will see filing
        strands clinging to the insulated iron wire. Raise the wire up
        slowly, then the filing strands will sag and fall, take the box
        out, put the wire in the filings again, raise up and you will
        see that the wire is no magnet, but during the time it was
        between the U-shape magnet prongs it was a magnet. This shows
        that during the time the coil moves through the U-shape magnet
        the coil becomes a magnet, but its function is double. Some
        individual North and South Pole magnets run through the coil’s
        wire crosswise, and some run through the coil’s wire lengthwise.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe you think that it is not fair to use iron wire to
        demonstrate how magnetic currents are made, but I can tell you
        that if I do not use iron core in the coil I can make more of
        the magnetic currents with soft iron wire coil than I can with
        copper wire coil, so you see it is perfectly good t use iron
        wire to demonstrate how magnetic currents are made. You can do
        the same thing with the copper wire in using iron filings, but
        only on a smaller scale. </p>
      <p>You saw how the magnets are running through a wire crosswise.
        Now I will tell you how they are running through the wire
        lengthwise. Before the magnets start to run through the wire
        lengthwise they are lined up in a square across the wire, one
        side of the wire is North Pole magnet wire and the other side is
        South Pole magnet side. When the coil begins to approach the
        middle of the U-shape magnet and the currents begin to run then
        the magnets which are in the wire begin to slant. North Pole
        magnets pointing East the same as the coil’s wire end, where the
        North Pole magnet current came out and South Pole magnets
        pointing West the same as the coil’s wire end where the South
        Pole magnet current came out. When the coil reaches the middle
        of the U-shape magnet then the currents stop to run. Now the
        North and South Pole magnets are pointing across the wire again.
        When the coil begins to move away from the middle of the U-shape
        magnet and the currents begin to run then the magnets which are
        in the wire begin to slant, but this time the North Pole magnets
        are pointing West the same as the coil’s wire end where the
        North Pole magnet current comes out and South Pole magnets
        pointing East the same as the coil’s wire end where the South
        Pole magnet current came out. When the coil moves out of the
        U-shape magnet’s effective distance the currents stop running.
        This is the way alternating currents are made. </p>
      <p>When the individual North and South Pole magnets are running
        through a wire lengthwise they are running in slant and whirling
        around while running ahead. You can see the slant by watching
        the sparks when you are putting together and pulling away soft
        iron wire ends which are connected to the battery by their other
        ends. To see how the currents are running out of the coil’s wire
        watch those 6 one-inch long magnets which lie on the glass. Put
        those magnets together with ends even, then let them loose, then
        you will see that they will roll away and if the magnets be
        stronger then they will roll away farther. This is the way the
        North and South Pole individual magnets are running out of the
        coil’s wire lengthwise. The reason the North and South Pole
        individual magnets do not run across through the coil is between
        the U-shape magnet, the coil’s wire is insulated, there is an
        air space around every wire and as it is known that the dry air
        is the best obstruction for the magnets to go through and as you
        know the coil is well insulated so the damp air does not get in.
        It is well known that it is many times easier for the magnets to
        run in metal than in air, now you see when the magnets run in
        the wire they hesitate to run out of the wire across the same
        way as they came in, so more of the new magnets are coming in
        the wire crosswise, then they can get out crosswise, so they get
        pushed out through the wire lengthwise. Now you know how the
        alternating magnetic currents are made. </p>
      <p>You have been wandering why alternating currents can run so far
        away from their generators. One reason is between every time the
        currents start and stop there is no pressure in the wire so the
        magnets from the air run in the wire and when the run starts
        there already are magnets in the wire which do not have to come
        from the generator, so the power line itself is a small
        generator which assists the big generator to furnish the magnets
        for the currents to run with. I have a generator that generates
        currents on a small scale from the air without using any magnets
        around it. </p>
      <p>Another thing, you have been wondering how a U-shape permanent
        magnet can keep its normal strength indefinitely. You know the
        soft iron does not hold magnets, but you already have one that
        holds it. It is the perpetual motion holder. It illustrated the
        principle how permanent magnets are made. All that has to be
        done is to start the magnets are made. All that has to be done
        is to start the magnets to run in an orbit, then they will never
        stop. Hard steel U-shape magnets have a broken orbit, but under
        proper conditions it is permanent. I think the structure of the
        metal is the answer. I have two U-shape magnets. They look
        alike, but one is a little harder than the other. The harder one
        can lift three pounds more than the softer one. I have been
        tempering the other steel magnets, and have noticed that the
        harder the steel gets the smaller it becomes. That shows that
        the metal is more packed and has less holes in it so the magnets
        cannot pass through it at full speed, so they dam up in the
        prong ends. They come in faster then they can get out. I think
        the ability for the soft steel welding rod to hold magnets is in
        the metal’s fine structure. </p>
      <p>The reason I call the results of North and South Pole magnet is
        because functions magnetic currents and not electric currents or
        electricity is the electricity is connected too much with those
        non-exiting electrons. If it had been called magneticity then I
        would accept it. Magneticity would indicate that it has a
        magnetic base and so it would be all right. </p>
      <p>As I said in the beginning, the North and South Pole magnets
        they are the cosmic force. They hold together this earth and
        everything on it, and they hold the moon together too. The
        moon’s North end holds South Pole magnets the same as the
        earth’s North end. The moon’s South end holds North Pole the
        same as the earth’s South end. Those people who have been
        wondering why the moon does not come down all they have to do is
        to give the moon one-half of a turn so that the North end would
        be in South side, and the South end in the North side, and then
        the moon would come down. At present the earth and moon have
        like magnet poles in the same sides so their own magnet poles
        keep them apart, but when the poles are reversed, then they will
        pull together. Here is a good tip to the rocket people. Make the
        rocket’s head strong North Pole magnet, and the tail end strong
        South Pole magnet, and then lock on the moon’s North end, then
        you will have better success. </p>
      <p>North and South Pole magnets are not only holding together the
        earth and moon, but they are turning the earth around on its
        axis. Those magnets which are coming form the sun are hitting
        their own kind of magnets which are circulating around the earth
        and they hit more on the East side than on the West side, and
        that is what makes the earth turn around. North and South Pole
        magnets make the lightning, in earth’s North hemisphere the
        South Pole magnets are going up and the North Pole magnets are
        coming down in the same flash. The North lights are caused by
        the North and South Pole magnets passing in concentrated
        streams, but the streams are not as much concentrated as they
        are in the lightning. The radio waves are made by the North and
        South Pole magnets. Now about the magnet size. You know sunlight
        can go through glass, paper and leaves, but it cannot go through
        wood, rock and iron, but the magnets can go through everything.
        This shows that each magnet is smaller than each particle of
        light. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>by</b> <br>
          <b>Edward Leedskalnin</b> </p>
        <p><b>October 1945</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>What is life? Mineral life is to hold the mineral matter
        together. Vegetable life is to hold the vegetable matter
        together, increase the volume and give motion to muscles. The
        base of life is the North and South Pole magnets. The magnets
        are indestructible. </p>
      <p>Every period of material life goes through two periods,
        construction and destruction period, but the life itself is
        indestructible, life has no beginning and no end. The sun is
        living in a destruction period and the earth in a construction
        period. In the sun only mineral life exists but on earth
        mineral, vegetable and animal life exist. When one form of life
        goes through the destruction period the life leaves the matter
        and goes somewhere else. For instance when zinc in a battery is
        taken in parts by acid, the North and South Pole magnets that
        held the zinc together, they leave the zinc and if right
        connections are made they will come out of the battery, then
        they can be used for other purposes. I can run those North and
        South Pole magnets in my perpetual motion holder, then they will
        produce perpetual motion and when I want to use the same magnets
        for other purposes, I can make a flash of light from them. Now
        you can see when the zinc went dead those North and South Pole
        magnets that held the zinc together did not die but escaped and
        went somewhere else. </p>
      <p>The drawing on the front cover is like the perpetual motion
        holder I made. If I run North and South Pole magnets from a car
        battery (which is stronger than a zinc battery) in those two
        coils while the laminated iron cross bar is across the iron bar
        prong, and fill the iron bar orbit with magnets, then those
        North and South Pole magnets will never stop running around,
        they will run around until the cross bar is pulled off. The
        North Pole magnets come out of the battery’s positive terminal
        and South Pole magnets come out of car battery’s negative
        terminal. To be sure it is so, you get two pieces of soft steel
        welding rod 4 inches long, put them in clips and connect them
        with the car battery. Put those two loose rod ends together
        until the rod gets hot. Now test each of those rod ends you were
        putting together with a small needle-like horizontally hanging
        magnet. Then you will see the one which is connected with
        positive terminal is North Pole magnet, and the one which is
        connected with negative terminal is South Pole magnet (like
        poles repulse, and unlike poles attract). You can change the rod
        pieces, but every time the one is connected with positive
        terminal will be North Pole magnet, and the one connected with
        negative terminal will be South Pole magnet. </p>
      <p>If perpetual motion holder’s North Pole prong is put East,
        South Pole prong West, and then elevate the cross-bar’s center
        up to the South Pole vertically hanging magnet, then the magnet
        will swing South and when the cross bar’s center is elevated up
        to North Pole vertically hanging magnet, then the magnet will
        swing North. The crossbar’s ability to swing the North and South
        Pole magnets off its center will remain as long as the cross bar
        is not disturbed. It has little power but it could be made
        stronger by making bigger dimensions. From the above experiment
        you can see the perpetual motion holder can act as a living
        thing. It knows which way to swing each magnet. This shows if
        more magnets are added to a living thing then it can perform
        things I could not do before. The same is true concerning our
        body and everything else. Those surplus magnets are the real
        life. Magnets in general are indestructible. For instance you
        can burn wood or flesh. You can destroy the body, but you cannot
        destroy the magnets that hold the body together. They go
        somewhere else. Iron has more of the magnets than wood, and
        every different substance has a different number of magnets that
        hold the substance together. If I make a battery with copper for
        positive terminal and bee for negative terminal I get more of
        the magnets out of it than when I used copper for the positive
        terminal and sweet potato for negative terminal. From this you
        can see that no two things are alike. </p>
      <p>Several years ago I read in the paper that the scientists
        cannot find out how the green chlorophyll converts the sunlight
        in plant food. They are looking in the wrong direction. It is
        not the green chlorophyll that converts the sunlight in plant
        food, it is the water that does it. That green chlorophyll was
        not so green in the first place. In fact it was not green at
        all. It became green by evaporation. The water in plants catches
        the running sunlight that is coming from the sun and the North
        and South Pole magnets wrap themselves around the caught
        particles of sunlight and as soon as they are caught then they
        join the plant and become part of it. The North and South Pole
        magnets are going in and out of the earth all the time,
        everywhere and their numbers are limitless. </p>
      <p>I have several lily pools where I keep water in. I have watched
        the lily pools for 16 years. When I put clear water in the pools
        where the sunlight can shine in, then in two months time I can
        see the moss is beginning to grow, but when I poured the water
        the water in the pools where there was no green chlorophyll in
        the water. This shows that the plants can grow without green
        chlorophyll. The sunlight was running in the water every day and
        the North and South Pole magnets were running through the water
        all the time. The North and South Pole magnets were running
        through the water all the time. The North and South Pole magnets
        are passing through every tree, the bigger the tree the more
        magnets will be passing through it. You have noticed that
        lightning hits the biggest tree and the tallest building. In the
        North hemisphere the South Pole magnets are going up, and the
        North Pole magnets coming down in the same flash. Lightning only
        strikes if the North and South magnets are concentrated too much
        in a small space. If not concentrated then they pass through
        everything without much notice. I believe that water, sunlight,
        and North and South Pole magnets are making the pants to grow. </p>
      <p>You have heard that if somebody happens to hold a power line in
        their bare hands it becomes impossible for him to let loose from
        the power line. The power line is full of North and South Pole
        magnets, so they overpower the body’s weaker system, and make it
        impossible for it to open the hands. This shows that the magnets
        can contract and release the muscles. </p>
      <p>I can see tiny lightning in my eyes if I close the eyelids and
        give a side push to the eyeball from the nose outward, but I
        cannot do it every day. When I keep eating more for some time
        then I can see the tiny lightning while my eyes are open. All
        that I have to do is to turn my head from one side to the other
        side. This shows that we have in our body the same kind of
        magnets that are making the big lightning in the sky. When I
        connect my tongue and feet with a microampere meter, the meter
        shows that I have magnets in my body. Some times I have more of
        the magnets in my body than at other times. The presence of
        magnets in my body would indicate that the magnets are operating
        our muscles. </p>
      <p>Where do our bodies get the magnets from? You know that to get
        the magnets from zinc we have to put the zinc we have to put the
        zinc in acid in the battery where it can be dissolved. Our
        digestive system is like a battery but more complicated. We get
        magnets from the food we eat. The acid and other digestive
        juices dissolve the food and liberate the magnets to be used for
        other purposes. </p>
      <p>I have never studies human anatomy, but I know there are many
        little cords that the magnets can pass through. All that has to
        be done is to make the right connections. All our body functions
        are physical, there is no mental function in us, for instance
        thinking the same as talking is physical process. We all would
        think aloud of we were not suppressed while we were small. When
        we think we contract the muscles that are for that purpose, but
        the contraction is so delicate we cannot notice it. This is all
        that I can tell about our body functions. If I had studied
        chemistry and human anatomy I could tell you more about our body
        functions. </p>

        <p><b><i><font size="+2">Magnetic Current</font></i></b> </p>
        <p>[ Advertisement in the <i>Miami Daily News</i>, February 3,
          1946 ]</p>
      </center>
      <p>Researchers: Read about magnetic current, what it is, how it is
        made, what makes it, and the way it runs in the wire. Then you
        will know what the north and south pole individual magnets can
        do, and then you will know what electricity is… </p>
      <p>Before my research work I knew nothing about electricity. The
        only thing I knew was that nobody knows what electricity is. So
        I thought I am going to find out why they do not know. I thought
        that if electricity could be made and managed for over a hundred
        years, then the makers do not what it is, there is something
        wrong about it. I found out that the researchers were misled by
        wrong instruction books, and by one-sided instruments. Volt
        meters and ampere meters are one-sided. They only show what is
        called by instruction books, positive electricity, but never
        show negative electricity. Now you can see that one-half of the
        electricity escaped their notice. If the researchers had used
        the same kind of equipment I use to demonstrate what magnetic
        current is, they would have found out a long time ago what
        electricity is. The positive electricity is composed of streams
        of north pole individual magnets, and negative electricity is
        composed of streams of south pole individual magnets. They are
        running one stream of magnets against the other stream in
        whirling right hand twist, and with high speed. </p>
      <p><b><i>Protons and Electrons</i></b> --- Are you sure they are
        not the north and south pole individual magnets? If we have
        anything we have to show that we have it. Show the base where it
        came from, and show how the thing functions. We can find
        concentrated north and south pole individual magnets in the
        earth, in a metal. With the metal we can demonstrate that the
        free north and south pole individual magnets are circulating in
        the earth. In the North Hemisphere the south pole individual
        magnets are going up, and the north pole individual magnets are
        coming down. Those free circulating north and south individual
        magnets are the building material for the magnet metal we find
        in the earth. This should show that the north and south pole
        individual magnets are the real atom builders, and not the
        protons and electrons. I think the north and south pole
        individual magnets are running in an orbit around a common core
        in an atom the same way as they run in an orbit around a common
        core in the perpetual motion holder that I made. The only
        difference is that an atom has a small orbit, but the perpetual
        motion holder has a big orbit. </p>
      <p>I have never seen an atom, but I think the atom drawings are
        wrong. They should be drawn to fit the earth o account of the
        fact that the atom is a part of the earth. The earth has two
        magnet poles. This means that each pole has an equal pull and
        push to hold the earth together, and so each atom should be
        built as it could have two poles. In that case both forces that
        make magnet poles should run around a common core (the core
        could be a particle of sunlight). If one-half of the force that
        makes up the atom is in the core, and the other half of the
        force run around the core, then in that case the atom could not
        join the other atoms to make a metal that could hold two magnet
        poles. I believe that if some enterprising man would analyze the
        magnet metal which comes straight from the earth he would find
        that the metal is not built up by protons and electrons, but by
        north and south pole individual magnets. I think anyone who
        excludes magnets and calculations about things that this earth
        contains, he is wrong. Those who want to know how North and
        South pole individual magnets contract the muscles. Connect each
        end of a fresh terrapin muscle with each terminal of a battery,
        then you will see how the muscles are contracted. </p>
      <p>This is for biologists. I can see chromosomes without a
        microscope. To see I close my eyes and then I open one eye just
        a little to look at the blue sky. Then I can see chains of beads
        floating in the liquid in my eye. Some chains of beads are
        longer than others. Most of the chains are folded over in
        irregular shapes and between several beads in a chain there is a
        bigger bead and sometimes there is one, two, or more beads
        floating separately. Each bead’s center is light, and the
        outside rim dark. </p>
      <p>If I open my eye a little more and look sharper, then I can see
        round shining things running in every direction in jumpy paths.
        Each shiny thing is many times smaller than each smallest bead.
        They are not crowded, they all use the same speed, but the speed
        is a little too fast for good observation. </p>
      <p>To see finer things yet I look in a gray cloud with the eye
        open until I see a darker spot. When the spot begins to boil in
        the middle, then I can see tiny multi-colored streaks running
        out of the middle. The scene lasts about a minute and when it is
        gone then nobody can know when the next scene will come around.
      </p>
      <p><i><b>Matter</b> ---</i> Every form of existence, whether it be
        rock, tree or animal, has a beginning and an end, but the three
        things that all matter is constructed from has no beginning and
        no end. They are the North and South pole individual magnets,
        and the neutral particles of matter. These three different
        things are the construction blocks of everything. To begin, a
        meteor rock falls in the sun, the sun dissolves the rock to the
        final division of matter, the North and South pole individual
        magnets, and the sunlight then sends them out here. The
        vegetation absorbs some of the magnets and the sunlight then
        sends them out here. The vegetation absorbs some of the magnets
        and the sunlight, and then grows. We eat the vegetation products
        and build up our body, and then we die and our body is cremated,
        the ashes can be made into a rock, and the rock can be sent to
        the sun to be dissolved again. The North and South pole magnets
        can be detected while they are coming down from the sun by
        radio. The radio waves are made by the North and South pole
        magnets. They spread around the earth, and the North and South
        pole magnets that are coming down from the sun are hitting the
        radio waves across, and so are disturbing their paths. That is
        the reason why we cannot hear the radio as well in the day time
        as we do at night. At night time we get only those magnets that
        are coming down from other suns or stars, but in the day time we
        get them all. Today, yesterday’s sunlight is neutral particles
        of matter. If you had been high up above the earth yesterday
        there would not have been as much light as there was on the
        ground. There you would not have been as much light there as
        there was on the ground. There you would have see stars the same
        as at night time down here. In the empty space between the stars
        there is not much light, so the stars can be seen. Sunlight is
        light when it passes through some obstruction like the air, by
        going through an empty space it is not much of a light. </p>
      <p><b><i>Electrons</i></b> --- Millions of people all over the
        world are being fooled by the non-existing electrons. Here is
        how the electrons came into existence. Thomson invented an
        imaginary baby and called it an electron. Rutherford adopted it
        and now the men with the long hair are nursing it. The electron
        has a brother and its name is proton, but it is heavy and lazy.
        It remains stationary in the middle, but the electron has to run
        around it. </p>
      <p>To the electrical engineers the positive electricity is
        everything, the negative electricity is nothing, but to the
        physicists the negative electricity is everything, and the
        positive electricity is nothing. Looking from a neutral
        standpoint they cancel each other, so we have no electricity,
        but we have something. If we do not know how to handle the thing
        that comes through a wire from a generator or a battery, we will
        get badly shocked. Read the booklet <i>Magnetic Current</i>;
        then you will know what the thing is, and the way it runs
        through a wire. </p>
      <p>The invention of an electron came by a tricky method in using
        electricity in a vacuum tube. Normally whether it be a generator
        or a battery, the positive terminal will have to be connected to
        the negative terminal, but in the vacuum tube two batteries with
        different strength were used, the smaller battery was connected
        normally, but the larger battery’s negative terminal was
        connected to the smaller battery’s negative terminal, and the
        positive terminal was left alone. That connection gave the
        negative terminal a double dose of strength, and so it became
        hotter and could push more. It was called cathode and the
        positive terminal anode. And the electricity that passed from
        the cathode to the anode was called electrons. </p>
      <p>In case the inventor had used normally direct methods to find
        out what the electricity was he would have found out that the
        positive and negative electricity is in equal strength, and are
        running positive electricity against the negative electricity.
        That can be seen by connecting each of two pieces of soft iron
        wire with each terminal of a car battery and then by putting
        together and pulling away each loose end of the soft iron wire.
        More sparks can be seen coming out of the positive terminal than
        from the negative terminal. This direct method is more reliable
        than the tricky method in the vacuum tube. The trouble with the
        physicists is they use indirect and ultra-indirect methods to
        come to their conclusions. </p>
      <p>If the inventor of electrons had a vacuum tube in which his
        electrons could run close to the top of the vacuum tube from the
        west side of the cathode to the east side of the anode and then
        would hang a vertically hanging magnet that is made from 3-inch
        long hard steel fishing wire, and then hand one magnet pole at
        one time right on top in the middle of his stream of electrons,
        then he would have seen the north pole magnet swinging north and
        the south pole magnet swinging south. The same thing will happen
        if the magnets are held above any wire where the electricity is
        running through. Those two vertically hanging magnets prove that
        the electricity is composed of two different and equal forces.
        Another way to prove this is to connect a flexible wire loop
        east end of the wire with positive battery’s terminal, west end
        with negative terminal, raise the loop one inch above the floor.
        Put U-shape magnet one inch from loop, north pole south side of
        the loop. The north pole magnet will pull in the loop. Put the
        south pole magnet north side of the loop, this time it will pull
        the loop in. Put the north pole magnet in the same place, it
        will push the loop away. This indicates that electricity the
        same as a magnet bar is composed of two equal forces, and each
        force is running one against the other in whirling right hand
        twist, but those forces in the wire have higher speed, and both
        forces are coming out across from the same wire. One of the
        forces is north pole magnets and the other is south pole
        magnets. They are the cosmic forces. Your electric motor is
        turned around on its axis by north and south pole magnets. Even
        you could not start your car without the north and south pole
        magnets. </p>
      <p>If electricity is made with north and south pole magnets and
        the electric motor is turned around on its axis by the north and
        south pole magnets as is the fact, then this will bring up a
        question, where then are those Thomson electrons. They are not
        around the electric motor. The plain answer is they are
        non-existing. </p>
      <p><i><b>Rays</b> ---</i> When I reduce the material from which
        comes out the alpha, beta and gamma rays, so small when it is
        magnified one hundred times and appearing the same size as an
        average salt crystal, then there are no more rays, but has
        flashes the same as when a connected wire end is tapped on the
        battery’s terminal, but without the red sparks. Depending on the
        size sometimes, I have to wait 5 minutes before I can see a
        flash. I think the flashes are caused by North and South pole
        magnets which are hitting and breaking the atom orbit, while the
        magnets are circulating in and around the earth. In the Northern
        Hemisphere, the North Pole magnets are coming down, and the
        South Pole magnets are going up. Wherever each kind of magnets
        are running in their way, they are hitting their own kind of
        magnets and are pushing them in the same direction. This can be
        demonstrated by a foot long magnetized hard steel fishing line
        which hangs on a fine thread horizontally and level. All that
        will have to be done is to remagnetize the wire by changing the
        magnet poles. Then the wire will lie in a slanting position, the
        South magnet pole will stay higher. By using a coil and
        microampere meter it can be seen in which direction the magnets
        are running the most. </p>
      <p>When I break the orbit of the perpetual motion holder, which I
        made, then I get a flash of light from it, but that flash of
        light is made up by the North and South pole magnets, and so I
        think the atom is built up by the North and South pole magnets,
        and when the orbit is broken, then the flash is made and the
        magnets are liberated to go somewhere else. The natural path of
        the North pole magnets in the Northern Hemisphere is to go down
        and the South pole magnets to go up. I think it would be a good
        idea if the physicists testing radium on photographic plates for
        alpha rays, would put the radium on top of the film, and then
        watch the results, or go to the Southern Hemisphere and
        experiment in the same way as they are doing now, and then see
        if there is any difference. The gamma rays must be the same as
        the sun light, but stronger because they are used very close to
        their source. </p>
      <p>We have North and South pole magnets, positive and negative
        electricity, protons, and electrons, positrons and mesons and
        alpha, positrons and mesons and alpha, beta and gamma rays. Now
        why such things, on building up the matter and again taking it
        into parts? I think all that nature needs is three things, the
        North and South pole magnets and the neutral particles. Each of
        those three things can act differently with different speed and
        different combinations, and so they can accomplish different
        results. I believe the prospective physicists first should learn
        what magnets and electricity are, then they will have a sound
        base for their experiments and their calculations. </p>

        <p><b><i><font size="+2">Cosmic Force</font></i></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Here is additional information for those who read my
        advertisement in the <i>Miami Daily News</i>, February 3, 1946.
        The North and South pole individual magnets are the cosmic
        force. They are the building blocks of nature’s perpetual
        transformation of matter, and they are so small that they can
        pass through everything. They pass through the earth from pole
        to pole, and around the earth. If the North and South pole
        individual magnets could not pass through a vacuum tube the same
        as the Thomson electrons cannot, then they could not be the
        building blocks. The Thomson electrons are very small parts of
        matter which come out of the cathode while the cathode is burned
        up or consumed in the vacuum tube. Without the general
        circulation of the building blocks there would be no change.
        Everything would remain the same as it is now. The building
        blocks from a matter that does to pieces could not get in the
        general circulation for the new construction. </p>
      <p>I think the Radium and Uranium were built up inside the earth
        with high pressure, and heat, while the North and South pole
        individual magnets were circulating through the earth. During
        the time the Radium and Uranium were inside the earth they
        absorbed more of the individual North and South pole magnets
        than they normally could hold, and so now while they are on top
        of the earth they let the magnets go so they can become normal
        again. </p>
      <p>Gravitation must be caused by the matter in the middle of the
        earth, and more concentrated than Uranium. When Uranium atoms
        burst they release the North and South pole individual magnets
        that held the atom together, then the magnets scatter all
        around, but when the atoms burst in the middle of the earth, and
        many burst at the same time, they can only un from the middle to
        the outside. When the North and South pole magnets are running
        alongside each other and in the same direction, they have no
        attraction for the other kind. They only attract if they are
        running one kind against the other kind. When the magnets are
        running out of the middle of the earth, as soon as they meet an
        object they attract it, on account of the fact that in any
        object there are both kinds of magnets in it. It can be seen by
        rubbing hard rubber or glass until they get hot, then they will
        attract sand, iron filings, salt, and other things. To see how
        it functions, move a salt crystal a little, if it happens to get
        on a different magnet pole, then it will jump away. Another way
        is to rub hard rubber until it gets hot, then it will be a
        temporary magnet. The difference between the rubber magnet and
        the steel magnet is that the magnet in the rubber comes from the
        magnets that hold together the rubber, and both North and South
        poles are in the same side of the rubber and the magnet poles
        are small and there are many of them close together, but in the
        steel bar the attracting magnet is not the magnet that holds
        together the steel, but the surplus magnets the circulating
        magnet that was put in it. Attract the iron filings with the
        rubber magnet, then approach with the steel magnet. Change the
        poles, then you will see some of the filings jump away. This
        means the steel magnet changed the magnet poles in the iron
        filings, and so they jumped away. </p>
