      Good News!<br>
      <br>
      Ordinarily, an article like this might not appeal to someone with
      a minimal interest in biology. But this article is about cancer.
      That's something that we will all experience, either personally or
      with someone close to us.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not going to bore you with statistics or preach about
      unhealthy lifestyles or genetics. The fact is that we all get
      cancer in our lifetime -- probably many times. Our bodies usually
      defend against the cancerous cells and they are destroyed before
      they can do any damage. Unfortunately, for some people, the battle
      isn't so easy and the outcome unclear.<br>
      <br>
      But wait... there is good news. It's a medicine that seems too
      good to be true, yet it is. And get this -- it costs just a couple
      of dollars and its in most every local pharmacy. It's anti-cancer
      success has been well documented in journals (which I will show
      you) -- even with cancers that are unresponsive to other
      chemotherapy. While it kills cancer cells it poses no harm to the
      normal cells and has little or no side effects. It's called
      mebendazole and "Big Pharma" hopes you will never hear about it.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mebendazole (MBZ)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If you have ever cared for young children then you are probably
      familiar with this medicine under the name of Vermox, Ovex,
      Antiox, and Pripsen. It is usually prescribed to treat pinworms,
      roundworms, whip worms and hookworms -- organisms that find an
      unwelcome home in our intestines. For some time now, scientists
      have known how it works, but the method of death meted out to the
      targeted parasites was of little interest to them. But that has
      since changed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">How it works...</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This next part gets a little technical. I'll try to explain things
      in a general way. I'm by no means a scientist or biologists but
      I'll share with you what I have learned.<br>
      <br>
      One of the misconceptions that people have about a cell is that it
      contains a nucleus, a cell wall and everything inside (cytoplasm)
      kind of sloshes around in a liquid or gel. In fact, the inside of
      a cell contains a kind of scaffold made of micro-tubules, also
      called spindles, that have the ability to assemble and disassemble
      quicky. This network of rigid micro-tubules inside the cell gives
      it shape, structure and also has the ability to transfer
      organelles and various molecules to different parts within the
      cell, functioning like a railway system. But its most vital
      function is cell division.<br>
      <br>
      You will easily understand the role of spindles by viewing this
      short animation.<br>
      <br>
      Here is a video of the micro-tubules, showing how they assemble
      and dis-assemble. This is quite an amazing design and reminds us
      of the complexity of life.<br>
      <br>
      Mebendazole is known to interfere and inhibit the assembly of the
      spindles, thus preventing the ability of the cells to divide. The
      cell eventually dies of old age or aptosis. Mebendazole is highly
      selective and somehow targets only cancerous cells (as well as a
      host of intestinal parasites). At the end of this article I will
      post a few of the many scientific papers acknowledging these
      facts.<br>
      <br>
      You will also see why there is virtually no pharmaceutical
      interest in mebendazole. The big pharmaceutical companies are
      promoting more toxic chemotherapy drugs because there is no profit
      margin in mebendazole. It's yet another example of corporate
      profit outweighing human benefits.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is Cancer?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      When a cell divides, the common notion is that the two resulting
      cells are exactly identical. This is not correct. The process of
      copying DNA is not perfect and there are usually errors, although
      these are typically not serious. In fact, if a cell has too many
      errors in its DNA code it will not be able to reproduce and the
      errors die with that cell.<br>
      <br>
      Human cells have a maximum number of times that they can reproduce
      themselves before the accumulated errors finally prevent
      reproduction -- it's called the Hayflick Limit. Most scientists
      agree that this number is around 60 times.<br>
      <br>
      This "programmed" lifespan of a cell is determined by the length
      of a benign string of molecules attached to the ends of the DNA
      coils. Like leaders on a movie film, these break off or become
      misaligned during the replication process and provide a buffer
      zone, protecting the real DNA code. The longer a cell's leader,
      called a telomere, the more it can reproduce and the longer an
      organism can live.<br>
      <br>
      Biologists have found that cancer cells are cells in which the
      damaged DNA code results in the activation of the telomere,
      causing it to regrow. The hayflick limit becomes infinite. The
      mutation makes the cell essentially immortal! Cancer does its
      damage by outliving and outnumbering the normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      The fight against cancer has been one of isolation and selectively
      poisoning the cells. When cancer cells have integrated themselves
      in vital tissues, this becomes a major problem. Often, surgical
      attacks of cancerous tissue seems to stimulate their growth even
      more, resulting in a temporary relapse with regrowth. Likewise,
      chemotherapy and radiation are not selective enough to protect
      healthy cells and their method of death is toxic.<br>
      <br>
      Mebendazole is different. It doesn't kill the cells with poison.
      It specifically prevents the cell from reproducing.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What has Big Pharma done?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Mebendazole was first synthesized by Janssen Pharmaceutical (later
      bought by Johnson &amp; Johnson) in 1968. Its value as an
      anti-worm medicine was recognized and by 1972 mebendazole was
      being marketed under the name Vermox. Because the prescribed use
      was eliminating parasites it was inexpensive and widely used. The
      selective toxicity of mebendazole to cancerous cells had not yet
      been discovered.<br>
      <br>
      Back in 1960 the US Goverment declared war on cancer and funded
      the Cancer Chemotherapy National Science Center. This agency
      received over 1000 samples of chemicals -- mostly synthetic --
      that were exposed to a variety of animal and human cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      It must have been like a scene from the movie, Andromeda Strain,
      where thousands of substances were tested to kill the alien virus
      brought back in an interstellar probe. With such large sample
      numbers it was expected that some would prove effective in killing
      tumors. And that's exactly what happened.<br>
      <br>
      In 1964 a worker at a contractor for the Center thought to include
      some natural chemistry in the study. He submitted a resin from the
      bark of the Pacific Yew tree (Taxus brevifolia), an endangered
      species endemic to the Washington State. It killed tumor cells
      while not harming healthy cells. They called it Taxol.<br>
      <br>
      The down side to this discovery was that it took 12,000 pounds of
      fresh Yew bark to make just 10 grams of Taxol! At first, no
      pharmaceutical company was interested in developing the drug and
      trials with human subjects were put off. Only in 1979, when Taxol
      was shown to interfere with micro-tubules, did it receive revived
      interest as a profitable anti-cancer medicine.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Same, Same, but Different</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Researchers were discovering the value of microtubule inhibitors
      in 1978. The safest one, mebendazole, was already on the market as
      a treatment for worms, and it was cheap. For a pharmaceutical
      company to invest in a cancer cure, it had to make a profit. So
      the next best candidate was the resin in the Pacific Yew -- Taxol.<br>
      <br>
      Taxol is a microtubule inhibitor... sort of. Rather than prevent
      the tubules from forming, like mebendazole, Taxol acts like a glue
      and prevents the tubules from disassembly. It's a process called
      polymerization. This damages the internal structure of the cell in
      ways not related only to cell division. The side-effects of Taxol
      are many, while mebendazole has a reputation for being harmless
      and well tolerated.<br>
      <br>
      But there's another big difference between Taxol and mebendazole
      -- the price. Taxol costs more than $200 a dose compared with the
      $2 for some chewable Vermox pills.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A prophylaxis agent?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Before I list the studies, I could not help but wonder why a
      person wouldn't take mebendazole periodically in one's life to
      purge the body of cancerous cells. It is known to be well
      tolerated with little toxicity. In some of the studies I will
      quote, mebendazole was taken with Tagamet(TM) to reduce the
      metabolizing effects of the liver and increase blood levels. This
      would appear to be an idea that ought to be explored.<br>
      <br>
      Mebendazole is not currently recognized as an anti-cancer drug.
      The lack of investment by Big Pharma in conducting the many trials
      and protocols will likely not change this status. But physicians
      are capable of prescribing the medicine at their own discretion.
      And ordinary people should be able to secure this medicine
      themselves.<br>

      mebendazole:<br>

      arrested cells at the G2-M phase before the onset of apoptosis, as
      detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. MZ
      treatment also resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release,
      followed by apoptotic cell death. Additionally, MZ appeared to be
      a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth with little toxicity to
      normal WI38 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When
      administered p.o. to nu/nu mice, MZ strongly inhibited the growth
      of human tumor xenografts and significantly reduced the number and
      size of tumors in an experimental model of lung metastasis. In

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Mebendazole hydrochloride
      [(5-benzoyl-1H-benzimidazole-2-yl)-carbamic acid methyl ester
      hydrochloride, MBZ.HCl], a new stable salt of mebendazole (MBZ),
      has been synthesized and characterized. It can easily be obtained
      from recrystallization of forms A, B, or C of MBZ in diverse
      solvents with the addition of hydrochloric acid solution.
      Crystallographic data reveals that the particular conformation
      adopted by the carbamic group contributes to the stability of the
      network. The crystal packing is stabilized by the presence of
      three N-H...Cl intermolecular interactions that form chains along
      the b axis. The XRD analyses of the three crystalline habits found
      in the crystallization process (square-based pyramids,
      pseudohexagonal plates, and prismatic) show equivalent diffraction
      patterns. The vibrational behavior is consistent with crystal
      structure. The most important functional groups show shifts to
      lower or higher frequencies in relation to the MBZ polymorphs. The
      thermal study on MBZ.HCl indicates that the compound is stable up
      to 160 degrees C approximately. Decomposition occurs in four
      steps. In the first step the HCl group is eliminated, and after
      that the remaining MBZ polymorph A decomposes in three steps, as
      happens with polymorphs B and C.<br>
