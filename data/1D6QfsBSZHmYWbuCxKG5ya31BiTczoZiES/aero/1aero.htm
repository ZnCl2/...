          During the 1920s, 30s, &amp; 40s, several excellent aerotech
          inventions appeared that somehow got lost in the meanwhile
          since then. Here they are, 60+ years later, waiting to be
          rediscovered by you:</font> </center>

                Plane Able To Fly Itself"</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Successfully demonstrating
          in test flights that it practically can fly itself, land or
          take off without the aid of a pilot and cannot stall, spin,
          sideslip or stunt, a new "free-wings" airplane is scheduled to
          be produced on a large scale by its Los Angeles designer, G.
          Wilbur Cornelius.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The monoplane differs from
          orthodox aircraft in that its wings are not rigidly fixed to
          the fuselage by are free moving, automatically adjusting
          themselves to air bumps, acting as elevators and ailerons
          combined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attached to the trailing
          edge of each wing is a paddle-like trigger assembly ---
          "stabilators" that can be adjusted so the ship will maintain
          any desired gliding or climbing angle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All the pilot has to do in
          landing is to cut of the plane's motor and set the stabilators
          for the correct gliding angle. The craft is steered by a
          conventional rudder at the tail, but its free moving wings
          automatically put the plane into a bank while turning.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tests showed that the craft
          cannot stall because the center of gravity is located so as to
          cause the wings and stabilators automatically to keep the
          craft in a position that will not allow it to lose flying
          speed. The plane can be force into off-center maneuvers, but
          rights itself to an even flying keel when the pilot takes his
          hands off the controls.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An airplane designed by G.W.
          Cornelius, California aviator and inventor, has wings hinged
          at the front so that the trailing edges can move up and down
          in response to variations in wind pressure and "bumps" in the
          air. He claims that a tailspin is impossible with this
          construction, and that the plane will fly virtually without
          manual control.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This remarkable plane ha no
          ailerons as used on conventional types of ships, the 13-degree
          movement of the wings making them unnecessary. Not in the
          picture below the dropped position of the wings with relation
          to the fixed center, and the special supports to the trailing
          edges of the wings as pointed out by Cornelius.</font> </p>

          particularly to airplanes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An object to the invention
          is to provide an airplane assembly including fuselage, wings,
          tail, and propeller, arranged so that the propeller, wings and
          tail, individually or collectively, may be moved out of a
          normal position relative to the fuselage to control
          directional movement of the airplane.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further object of the
          invention is to provide an airplane fuselage having wings
          projected from opposite sides of said fuselage, each wing on
          each side of the fuselage being independent of the other and
          being rotatably secured to the said fuselage to be moved above
          or below a predetermined normal position.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A still further object of
          the invention is to provide an airplane fuselage having wings
          on opposite sides thereof, in a substantially horizontal
          position, adapted to be rotated above or below a horizontal
          plane, said wings being connected to a mounting supporting the
          propulsion medium, and to a mounting supporting the tail,
          whereby the said propulsion medium, wings and tail may be
          moved in synchronism to steer the airplane into any selected
          line of flight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other objects of the
          invention are to provide a device of the character described
          that will be superior in point of simplicity, inexpensiveness
          of construction, positiveness of operation, and facility and
          convenience in use and general efficiency.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In detail, the construction
          illustrated in the drawings comprises an airplane fuselage
          generally designated b numeral 1. As in conventional airplane
          construction, the fuselage is provided with wings 2 and 3 on
          opposite sides of the forward end of the fuselage, forming a
          monoplane, and shown in Figure 9 with a pair of wings 4 and 5
          on each of the opposite sides of the fuselage to form a
          biplane. The forward end of the fuselage 1 has a motor 6
          universally mounted therein, to which a propeller 7 is
          secured. The rear end of the fuselage had a tail 8 flexibly
          mounted thereon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a conventional type of
          airplane, either of the monoplane or biplane type, the wings
          are fixedly secured to opposite sides of the fuselage, and an
          aileron A is mounted on the trailing edge thereof, to control
          the balance of the airplane in flight, and to maintain a
          relatively stable equilibrium of the said airplane during
          flight. Likewise, airplane engines are ordinarily mounted in
          fixed position within the forward end of the fuselage, and the
          rear end of the said fuselage is provided with a rudder and a
          tail controlled by the operator for steering the plane either
          to the right or left and upwardly or downwardly. From my
          experiments, I have discovered that the wings 2 and 3 of an
          airplane may be pivotally mounted on opposite sides of the
          fuselage 1 so as to have a limited movement above or below a
          horizontal level to effect a stable equilibrium of the
          airplane while in the air, with the same effect that the
          balance of the airplane is accomplished through the medium of
          the ailerons. Obviously, the movement of the wings above or
          below a predetermined horizontal flying position will either
          hasten the ascent or descent of the airplane, or hasten the
          turning of the plane either to the right or to the left, this
          to increase the efficiency of the plane in moving in any
          direction in the air beyond what the directional movement of
          the airplane would be when controlled by the conventional
          aileron and tail and rudder system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wings 2 and 3 are each
          provided with a tapered tubular support 9 therein, each
          support in turn having laterally disposed tubular supporting
          webs 10 extending therefrom along its entire length, to form a
          foundation for the wing covering, to be mounted around and to
          enclose the entire tubular assembly. Each of the main supports
          9 are closed at 11 at the meeting ends, so that the interiors
          of said supports may be used as fluid supply tanks. The ends
          11 of the wing supports 9 meet centrally within the fuselage,
          secured adjacent the upper part of the fuselage. Each support
          9 is provided with a bolt 13 thereon that projects through a
          slot 14 in the bearing, and nut 15 is secured to each bolt to
          hold the wing supports 9 from becoming axially displaced. The
          slot in the bearing 12 permits the supports 9 to have a
          limited rotative movement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the fact that the
          construction of each wing is identical, the following
          description will be confined to one wing only, and it is to be
          understood that a similar construction and operation applies
          to the other wing structure assembly. I do no intend to rely
          wholly upon the wing supports 9, mounted in the fuselage
          bearing, to carry the entire stress of the wing in flight, as
          I have discovered that it is better to reinforce the wing
          structure by means apart from the main bearing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Adjacent the trailing edge
          of the wing, next to where same abuts the fuselage 1, I have
          provided a bracket 16 having a roller 17 rotatively mounted
          thereon and with an end thrust roller 18 journaled across the
          end of said bracket. Both of the rollers 17 and 18 are movably
          confined within an arcuate and channel shaped guideway 19 that
          is secured to the outside of the fuselage 1. The length of the
          arcuate guide is determined, to regulate the length of the
          swinging movement which it is desired that the wings shall
          have. The channel shaped guideway 19 holds the wing rollers 17
          and 18 therein, allowing said rollers to move freely in the
          guideway, as the wing is turned relative to the fuselage. The
          rollers in the guide way 19 prevent the edge of the wing 2
          from getting out of abutting contact with the fuselage 1.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Each of the wings 2 and 3
          are also provided with struts 21 secured to a mediate portion
          of the wing, and said struts extend downwardly through an
          arcuate guide 22 provided along the bottom of the fuselage.
          The end 23 of each strut 21 within the arcuate slot 22 is
          provided with rollers 24 rotatably mounted thereon, to permit
          the lower end of said strut to move relatively free from one
          end of the guide way to the other. An end 25 of the strut 21
          extends through the fuselage into the interior thereof, and is
          provided with an eyelet 26 thereon to which a control wire 27
          may be fastened that connects to the operator's control stick
          28, for tilting the wing above or below its normal horizontal
          pane, according to the desires of the airplane operator.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The control stick 28 for
          moving the wings upwardly or downwardly, consists of a pair of
          spaced members 29 and 30 having a bearing block 31 rotatably
          mounted therebetween. The bearing block is rotatably mounted
          on a fixed shaft 32 that extends transversely across and is
          secured to the airplane fuselage. The fixed shaft 32 permits
          the control stick 28 to be moved fore and aft or rotated
          therearound within a limited degree, and at the same time the
          control stick may be rotated sideways in either direction. A
          shaft 33 is journaled across the upper end of the control
          stick 28, and has a steering wheel 34 mounted on an end
          thereof. The shaft 34 is also equipped with a pair of teethed
          sprockets 35 and 36 thereon, confined between the opposite
          sides 29 and 30 of the control stick. An idler pulley 37 is
          rotatively mounted adjacent the lower end of the control
          stick. A chain 38 passes around the sprocket 35 on the upper
          end of the control stick, and one end of said chain is
          fastened to a wire 39 that passes around the lower pulley 37
          in the control stick, and then passes around a pulley 40 on
          the side of the fuselage 1 and thence is connected to the end
          26 of the strut support of the wing 2 that extends within the
          fuselage. The opposite end of the chain has a wire 41
          connected thereto that extends around the lower pulley 37 in
          the control stick and continues to the opposite side of the
          fuselage, passing around a pulley thereon, 42, and thence to
          connection with the lower end 26 of the strut 1 of the wing 3
          that extends within the fuselage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A chain 43 extends around
          the other sprocket 36 on the steering wheel shaft, and thence
          around a pulley 44 that is journaled on the control stick 28
          directly beneath the sprockets on the upper end of said stick.
          One end of the chain 43 has a wire 45 secured thereto that
          passes around a pulley 46 on one side of the fuselage 1 and
          thence around a pulley 47 positioned to the rear of the
          arcuate guideway 22 and thence to connection with the strut
          end 26 of wing 3. Rotative movement of the steering wheel 34
          will cause the wing 2 on one side of the fuselage to be
          elevated while the wing 3 on the opposite side of the fuselage
          will be lowered. This selective movement of the wings in
          opposite directions will control the turning movement of the
          airplane in exactly the same manner as a conventional airplane
          may be turned through the medium of the ailerons. It should be
          noticed the wire connections from the control stick 28 to the
          wings extend from opposite ends of the pivotal center of the
          control stick. Thus by swinging the control stick 28 about its
          pivotal axis 32, both of the wings 2 and 3 on the opposite
          sides of the fuselage 1 may be moved simultaneously in either
          an upward or downward direction. My method of mounting the
          airplane wings 2 and 3 on the fuselage, permits said wings to
          be simultaneously moved in opposite directions, and also
          permits both of the wings to be raised or lowered in unison.
          Although I have described particularly the method of operating
          the wings of an airplane of the monoplane type, exactly the
          same operation takes place with an airplane of the biplane
          type, as shown in Figure 9. The wings 4 and 5 shown in Figure
          9 being raised or lowered through the same type of mechanism
          as that heretofore described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 7 of the drawings,
          I have shown an engine 6 that is universally mounted in the
          fore end of the fuselage 1. The engine 6 is provided with a
          propeller 7 thereon, and the universal mounting of the engine
          is such that the propeller and engine may be moved out of a
          normal position in axial alignment with the fuselage into any
          selected angular position of any desired line of flight. The
          universal mounting of the engine in the airplane fuselage is
          more particularly illustrated and described in the pending
          application that I have filed. The engine mounting 6 is
          provided with four wires, 50, 51, 52, and 53 thereon that lead
          to opposite ends and opposite sides of the pilot's control
          stick 28 so that the engine and propeller may be moved in any
          desired direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airplane tail 8 mounted
          at the rear end of the fuselage, is universally secured to the
          said fuselage 1 in a ball mounting, whereby said tail may be
          moved up or down and to the right or left, through control
          means connected to the operator's stick 28. This ball mounting
          for the tail is more particularly illustrated and described in
          a separate pending application. The tail 8 is provided with an
          arm 55 that extends into the interior of the fuselage of the
          airplane, and said arm has two bars 56 and 57 arranged at
          right angles to each other, secured at the end of said arm 55.
          Control wires 58, 59, 60 and 61 are suitably connected to the
          ends of the cross bars 56 and 57, and said wires are passed
          around pulleys 62 and are joined to the ends of cross bars 63
          and 64 that extend out from the stick 28 at the point of its
          pivotal connection to the fuselage. Thus, as the operator
          turns the control stick 28 forward or backward or turns it to
          the right or left, the wires connecting the stick 28 to the
          tail 8 cause the tail 8 to be moved either to the right or
          left or up or down. The tail of any airplane is used to
          control the up and down movement of the said vehicle, and to
          balance the said vehicle while in flight. In a case where the
          airplane would be out of balance, or the weight carried by the
          plane would be improperly stowed, and the said airplane would
          be in a more or less unstable condition, this condition would
          be rectified by forcing the tail out of the normal operating
          position to compensate for the unstableness of the plane. In
          the event that the tail 8 would have to continuously be
          maintained above or below its normal horizontal position, it
          would require the aviator pilot to hold the control stick 28
          either forward or backward of its normal vertical position, to
          maintain the tail in the proper balanced operating position.
          Obviously, this would have the effect of placing the wings 2
          and 3 or the propeller mounting 6 slightly out of the normal
          position. Therefore, in order to maintain the propeller
          mounting and the wings in a normal position of flight, and to
          allow the tail 8 to remain out of normal position, I provide a
          pair of wires 65 and 66 that are connected to the top and
          bottom of the arm 55 that extends into the fuselage from the
          tail 8. these wires 65 and 66, at their forward ed are
          provided with a sprocket chain 67 that passes around a
          sprocket 68 journaled on the control stick supporting shaft
          31. The sprocket 68 is provided with a casing 69 thereon in
          which a latch member 70 is reciprocatingly mounted. The latch
          member 70 registers with the toothed rack 71 that is fixedly
          mounted in the stick 28. Thus, where the control stick 28 is
          out of its normal vertical position to hold the tail up or
          down to keep the airplane in proper flying position, the latch
          70 permits the sprocket wheel 68 to be turned to maintain the
          tail 8 in its out-of-the-normal position but to allow the
          control stick 28 to be moved into its true vertical position.
          The disalignment of the tail control 8 relative to the
          propeller 7 and wings 2 and 3 can be corrected by moving the
          sprocket wheel 68 relative to the control stick 28 after the
          cause of the unstable condition of the airplane has been
          removed.<br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring more particularly
          to the drawing, the numeral 10 designates the front part of
          the fuselage of the airplane. On the front of the fuselage is
          mounted a bladed propeller 11. This propeller is on a
          horizontal shaft 12, as in the usual airplane construction,
          and this shaft is driven by the internal combustion engine of
          the airplane to rotate the propeller.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention in its
          entirety involves means for lowering the resistance offered to
          the passage of the airplane through the air. In the present
          best practice of the invention, the lowering of resistance is
          accomplished by evacuating the air in front of the fuselage
          and the center of the propeller. Although capable of various
          constructions, in the present embodiment, the air evacuating
          means comprises blades 13 which rotate with the propeller. As
          shown here, the blades are affixed to the front of a rotary
          body such as a disk 14 which is suitably fastened to the shaft
          12 in front of the propeller and rotates with the shaft and
          propeller. Each blade is arranged at an angle to the radius
          with the inner end in advance, considered in respect of the
          direction of rotation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the propeller disk and
          blades rotate, the air in front f the propeller blade is
          sucked in at the axis of rotation, passing outwardly in said
          pockets and thrown into the rotating propeller blades. There
          is thus created a suction in front of the disk which lowers
          the air resistance (both frontal and skin resistance) offered
          to the passage of the airplane, facilitates its travel and
          provides increased speed. The density of the air acted upon by
          the propeller blades is increased by the added quantity
          delivered by the rotating blades with the result that the
          propeller develops a greater propelling thrust. This increased
          air density acts on the wings to augment the lifting power and
          makes it possible to reach higher elevation and is also felt
          on back on the tail surfaces to provide better control.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present embodiment
          includes an advantageous form of blade. As here shown, the
          blade is of sheet metal, bent to form a front or under face or
          side and a slightly larger rear or outer face whereby the
          blade seats angularly against the face of the disk, forming
          the packet therewith, and is progressively thicker in
          cross-section toward the disk for the purpose of strength. The
          particular blank shown in Figure 3 is adapted to be bent along
          lines 21, 22 to form the inner face 23, the larger outer face
          24 and an end 25. The bent edge 2 forms the advance or cutting
          edge of the blade. The blade is seated against the body or
          disk 14 and welded or otherwise attached to it. Unattached
          adjoining edges of the blade are also preferably welded.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any number of blades
          sufficient to evacuate the air immediately in front of the
          propeller may be applied to the disk but each blade should
          advantageously be arranged at the same angle to the radius.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A certain amount of power is
          needed to rotate the disk and its blades but the advantages
          resulting from their employment more than offset the power
          thus used<br>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Were it not for the stern
          theories regulating the design of air screws, we would not be
          using propellers today which differ but little from those of
          the pioneer panes. Indeed, while airplanes and engines have
          been constantly improved during the past 10 years, the air
          screw --- the most important member of any aircraft --- has
          remained practically at&nbsp; a standstill, due to the
          adherences of propeller makers to those orthodox theories
          which no one dared violate.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has, therefore, remained
          for James A. Irving of New York City to disregard most air
          screw theories and strike forth along new lines. As a result,
          he has invented a new propeller or tractor screw of radical
          design which, according to the testimony of several well-known
          aviators who have tried it on their machines, presents a
          definite advance in air screws.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Essentially, Mr Irving's
          device is two propellers in one, as will be noted in the
          accompanying illustrations. In the working model shown, one
          set of blades is 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, while the other
          is about 20% shorter. The longer blades may be termed the
          leading blades, while the shorter ones may be termed the
          auxiliary blades.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The blades are built up of
          3-ply ash and mahogany, the latter being laminated crosswise
          of the grain of the two outside strips of ash; this
          arrangement, the inventor holds, is positive insurance against
          splitting. The blades are mounted upon Monel metal arms the
          shanks of which are taper-fitted to a two part hub of the same
          metal, provided with sockets for the purpose. The tapered
          shanks are drawn home and securely held by means of specially
          designed llock-nuts, to any desired pitch which may be
          graduated upon the shanks and hub sockets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the side view of the new
          propeller it will be noted that the arms and blades have a
          dihedral arrangement, which calls for an explanation. There
          are four reasons for this design, according to the inventor:
          First, in effecting centripetal action, drawing and forcing
          air to the center, thus eliminating radial slip; second,
          applied to the auxiliary blades for the purpose of gripping
          and concentrating the air, effecting a powerful center thrust
          at the pint where the conventional propeller is absolutely
          void of impelling force; third, the effect upon the long,
          leading blades where centrifugal force against great air
          pressure, is to relieve the blades of practically all except
          lateral and torque strains; fourth, owing to the fact that the
          tips of the blades are kept under a rigid, constant tension
          between centrifugal force and air pressure, vibration or
          fluttering is reduced to a minimum or entirely eliminated, and
          this leads to a considerable correction of the very
          objectionable whir or hum of the conventional type of
          propeller. In fact, the proof of the latter is indisputably
          brought out in an electric-fan blade of similar design
          invented by Mr Irving, which is now being offered as the
          regular equipment of a well-known electric desk-type fan, and
          which is practically silent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Structurally, the new
          propeller has distinct advantages. The hub of the new air
          screw becomes part of the engine, and any changes in blades
          for any reason can be easily made. Extra leading blades can be
          carried in the airplane for emergency use. In cases of
          ordinary propeller breakage were but one or even both of the
          leading blades would be damaged, the cost of repairs would not
          exceed one-third of the net cost of the complete propeller; in
          short, fully 50% of the new propeller would be practically
          indestructible, outliving several motors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An ingenious arrangement is
          provided for the ready balancing of the companion blades.
          Small lead washers are placed in holes in both blades, and by
          transferring washers from one hole to another balance is soon
          established. The washers are held in place by a screw in each
          hole.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of his objects in making
          the auxiliary blades shorter than the leaders, explains Mr
          Irving, is for the purpose of obtaining an advanced,
          differential pitch with which to create impelling force from
          the inner, slow-speed circle or "dead" space; and results from
          numerous practical flying tests quite justify the claim that
          the propeller is fully one-third more efficient than the usual
          design, and at no extra cost of power. When used as a tractor,
          the concentrating action of the auxiliary blades results in
          enveloping the fuselage for its entire length within a
          cylinder of air wash of somewhat less diameter than the short
          blades. It is also apparent that these auxiliary blades serve
          still another and valuable purpose, namely, that of forcing or
          assisting the leading blades into undisturbed air. But Mr
          Irving is not given to theories: he merely states that he has
          a propeller that does the work, and that it is more or less
          inconsequential to the practical aviator just how it does the
          work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Considerable success has
          attended the use of Mr Irving's marine propeller, designed
          along the same general lines as his present air screw. Some
          years ago captain Baldwin, a well-known figure in American
          aviation, tested one of Irving's propellers on his "Red Devil"
          biplane. Crude as that propeller was, the results were most
          gratifying. Captain Baldwin was astonished with the climbing
          power and speed of his machine so equipped. Other aviators
          have also been impressed in the same way, after a trial of the
          propeller which ridicules propeller theories.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My invention relates to
          propellers, and more particularly to aeroplane propellers.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments have shown that
          there is distortion when cutting a thread in a solid substance
          of great resistability. When a thread is cut in such an
          elastic medium as air, which has little normal resistibility,
          this distortion is greatly increased. This distortion is
          analogous to the disturbing of the air by a rotating
          propeller. Investigators of aerial propellers arrive at the
          conclusion that the less a propeller disturbs the air the
          greater its efficiency, and that a theoretical propeller of
          infinitely minute thickness and weight would travel through
          the air without disturbing it its exact pitch distance when
          rotated one revolution, if we disregard the frictional
          surfaces of the blades; but as it is impossible to construct
          such a propeller or avoid frictional surfaces, the problem
          must be resolves with a propeller constructed for practical
          work, which must necessarily have thickness, weight, area and
          frictional surfaces. Such a propeller will set up disturbances
          in the air which practically preclude its being considered as
          a screw, because these disturbances influence or distort the
          air, and it does not offer the necessary resistibility for
          cutting a screw thread. In constructing propellers for
          aeroplanes, great care must be taken to see that the design is
          such that the propeller will not throw the air laterally. This
          is so for the efficiency of a propeller is due to its ability
          to grip the air, form it into a cone and give to it volume,
          weight and velocity, the sum of these being a mechanically
          created cyclonic force which, projected against substantially
          inert air, propels the aeroplane at the necessary speed to
          exert elevating and sustaining power. Smoke and vapor
          experiments tend to prove that a propeller draws or absorbs
          air from the space around it. This air is condensed and takes
          the form of a truncated cone, with a slightly rotating
          movement, and is really a modified cyclone as the action and
          effect are almost identical.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My propeller has been so
          designed not only to disturb the air as little as possible,
          but the blades are adjustable relatively to each other and to
          the hub, to permit of a ready adjustment of the blades with
          reference to the weight, the resisting surface, and the
          frictional surfaces of the aeroplane, and the normal speed of
          the engine.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By referring to the
          drawings, it will be seen that a hub is provided, consisting
          of members 10 an 11, there being two roughened concave bearing
          surfaces 12 on the inner face of each of the hub members 10
          and 11. As shown in Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings, I prefer
          to cut channels 13 in the hub and insert in these channels 13
          bearing members 14, having the roughened concave bearing
          surfaces 12 referred to. The bearing members 14 are held in
          place by means of screws 27, and I prefer to have them project
          beyond the sides of the hub members. The bearing members 14 on
          one of the hub members co-act with the bearing members 14 on
          the other hub members, to grip the shanks 15 on which the
          propeller blades 16 and 17 are mounted. As will be understood
          by referring to the drawings, the bearing members are so
          disposed relatively to the axis of the hub, that the shanks 15
          will be disposed at an angle to each other, and obliquely
          relatively to the hub axis. With this construction two of the
          propeller blades are normally disposed in advance of the hub,
          the other two propeller blades extending rearwardly of the
          hub. There are threaded orifices 18 in the hub members, which
          register with each other, and in these threaded orifices mesh
          screw members 19, having angular heads 20. Nuts 21 are
          provided for locking the screw members in place, and a face
          plate 22 with angular openings 23 is provided, the angular
          heads 20 being normally disposed in the angular openings 23,
          the face plate 22 being secured to the hub member 11 by means
          of screws 24. Two of the propeller blades are constructed by
          providing side members 25, which are bolted to opposite sides
          of the shank 15, as shown in Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings,
          the peripheries of these side members 25 being secured
          together at 26 by any preferred means.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As will be seen in referring
          to Figures 2 and 7 of the drawings, the propeller blades 16
          are considerably larger than the propeller blades 17, and
          these blades 16 are preferably the leading blades; that is, I
          prefer to have them extend in a direction in advance of the
          hub, the shorter blades 17 extending rearwardly of the hub. It
          will readily be understood that by removing the face plate 22,
          and unscrewing the screw members 19, the shanks 15 may be
          rotated as my be desired to secure the desired pitch for the
          propeller blades, and that the shanks 15 may also be shifted
          longitudinally to position the propeller blades at
          predetermined distances from the hub. Each of the shanks 15 is
          divided by marks 15a, which may be referred to in obtaining
          the desired adjustment. The arrangement of one forwardly
          extending set of propeller blades in combination with one
          rearwardly extending set of similar blades tends to prevent a
          vacuum forming around the hub of the propeller, and thereby
          removes undesirable suction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figures 8 and 9 I have
          shown a divided shank consisting of a tubular member 15b
          having longitudinal slots 15c, the shank member 15d being
          disposed in the tubular member 15b. When the tubular member
          15b is gripped by the bearing member 14 it will press against
          the shank member 15d and hold the tubular member 15b
          relatively to the shank member 15d. With this construction the
          blades 17 may be disposed at any predetermined angle with
          relation to the blades 16.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be understood that
          the smaller or inner blades 17 may be set to a much greater
          pitch than the larger leading blades 17 and that the diameter
          of the larger blades 16 may be expanded as desired. When the
          positions of the blades 16 are not changed relatively to the
          positions of the blades 17, any increase in the pitch of one
          set of blades will reduce the pitch of the other set of
          blades. The adjustability of the propeller permits of the
          balancing and the setting of the blades of the propeller at
          the desired pitch forced to produce the best results.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For combining safety
          features of unusual variety, in designing a light monoplane
          for private flyers, Emil Doehler of Buffalo, NY, has won
          expert commendation. Vertical flaps of his own inventions,
          flanking the rudder, supplement standard wing flaps as "air
          brakes". Turned inward, they help to reduce landing speed ---
          eliminating side-slipping or "fishtailing" into a small field
          --- and also concentrate air flow upon the rudder, so as to
          retain effective control. Wing slots, at leading and trailing
          edges, assure needed lift by providing an even stream of air
          over the surface. Ailerons mounted on "floating" wing tips,
          which line up with the wind like weathervanes, give full
          response at angle of attack large enough to make ordinary
          ailerons ineffective. After a 3-point landing, using a tail
          wheel, the craft settles forward upon a tricycle landing gear
          and wheel brakes bring it to a quick stop. Hinged wings will
          swing hack against the fuselage, to reduce the cost of rented
          hanger space. In bad weather, a pilot could make an emergency
          landing on a highway, fold the wings, and drive away. Because
          of the roadability of the machine., the designer has added a
          propeller guard.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Popular Science</i>
            (1924)</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A novel model of a
          helicopter airplane, which the inventor claims will carry four
          times the weight of present types with one quarter of the
          power, has been patterned on some of the mechanical principles
          used by birds in flight. The upper and lower wings slope
          forward until they meet in a horizontal edge that cleaves the
          air.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By opening the V-shaped
          wings and slowing down the motor, the inventor, Dr H. T.
          Randle, of Lawrence, KS, says the machine can land on any
          flat-roofed building.</font> </p>
