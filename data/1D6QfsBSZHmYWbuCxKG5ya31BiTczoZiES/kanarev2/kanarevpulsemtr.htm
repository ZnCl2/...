        Dear Mr. Sterling D. Allan,<br>

        I made the experiments only to check my theory of a microcosm.
        The new theory of a microcosm has prompted me to see if could
        make a self-rotating generator. It is made and works. Prospects
        and areas of its application have no borders. It will be the
        basic source of future ecologically pure power. Under the theory
        of a microcosm, I spend the first scientific seminar in a month
        [in Krasnodar on 25-27 November 2010]. It will be broadcast on
        the Internet in Russian and English languages. All information
        on the seminar can be found at http://www.akademik.su.<br>
        <br>
        I have sent you video about the first motor-generator. I have
        asked one of academicians of the Russian Academy of Sciences to
        head the commission on test of our generator. Such tests have
        already passed. In the report results of tests are written down.
        The first-ever motor - the generator makes energy more than
        consumes from a network. By the end of the year the second
        generator will be tested. The accumulator [capacitor] will be a
        source of its input. The second generator will feed an
        electrolyzer and simultaneously charge the accumulator. Term of
        its service will be equal to accumulator service life, that is
        it will work about five years and will use only energy of the
        accumulator.<br>

        saying: "It seems to me this VIDEO will be interesting to you
        and to the readers of your site."<br>
        <br>
        Being preoccupied with other matters that day, I overlooked that
        email and did not see it again until yesterday, when I received
        another email from Kanarev regarding his analysis and critique
        of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded jointly to Andre Geim
        and Konstantin Novoselov "for groundbreaking experiments
        regarding the two-dimensional material&nbsp; graphene".
        Apparently, Kanarev has been working in this field as well, and
        may even be further along in his work than these two who
        received the Nobel Prize.<br>
        <br>
        Last night I posted his analysis, along with a brief preface. I
        also mentioned that I had sent an email to Kanarev asking for
        more information about the motor-generator. Was it his design?
        What does it do? How much energy does it generate? How did he
        measure it?<br>
        <br>
        He responded at 4:48 AM Mountain saying: (slightly edited)<br>

        Generators of electricity - a long-standing invention of
        mankind. They are the main source of electrical energy. To
        ensure that they generate electricity, need her primary source,
        whose role is most often carries water or water vapor. There are
        generators that are driven by electric motors, energy
        consumption from the mains. In this case, as usual, the electric
        motor rotates the generator rotor and stator produces electrical
        energy. The old laws of electrodynamics prohibit the existence
        of a generator rotor that would include the power grid, and drew
        up to the stator electrical energy or vice versa, the stator
        would include the power grid, and drew up the rotor to
        electrical energy. New laws of electrodynamics, by contrast,
        show how to do such a generator, and it was made (Photo). Terms
        of Reference for its production, we developed proved to be
        surprisingly simple, and it was successfully implemented
        talented Russian engineer <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sergei



          Zatsarininym</span>.<br>
        <br>
        A two-month test the world's first self-rotating generator of
        electric pulses showed that such a generator is the future. In
        this case, energy consumption for idle self-rotating generator
        of electrical pulses are reduced to almost zero, and increased
        moment of inertia of the rotor can easily overcome the
        mechanical resistance and a small short-term magnetic
        resistance. As a result of energy generated in the stator, is
        determined not by the energy supplied from an external power
        source, and the kinetic energy of the rotor, which he receives
        in the process of starting to work. Subsequently, its value is
        supported by short pulses of the primary power source, which
        leads to the fact that amount of energy output is greater than
        the amount of energy consumed! In addition, first used the
        principle of energy recovery pulse inhibit rotation of the
        rotor, to power the generator. While stable fixed 5-fold
        increase at 2000 rpm. At high speeds recorded a 10-fold excess,
        but a small moment of inertia of the rotor does not allow us
        long-term (more than 10 minutes) to keep such a regime. The
        first sample of self-rotating generator generates pulses of
        current to 120 A and the second, which is already under
        construction, will generate pulses of up to 200 A with a pulse,
        close to zero and the rotor speed from 3000 to 5000 rpm. This
        will be a generator to power the electrolysis.<br>
        <br>
        Another feature of the self-rotating generator of electrical
        pulses, which is now called "motor-generator(MG) - complexity of
        multi-use. For example, a motor-generator designed to power the
        electrolyzer, will not be able to exercise their functions on
        the drive the car instead of gasoline engine. As a result, the
        problem of developing generators for specific purposes. But, as
        the experience gained, it is solvable and has an open road for
        domestic power units (5-10kW), to supply which is enough battery
        power. In this case, the generator will automatically recharge
        the battery. Battery power would also be sufficient for the
        power block, propelling the car.<br>

        He has been testing his theory of microcosm and has developed a
        generator that is self running and generates free electricity.
        Fascinating and a much welcome proof of concept for this type of
        technology.<br>

        Here is a new fractal-based "spin-glass" model of the Cosmos
        which incorporates the attributes of a fifth primary field and
        the Langrange points described in superstring theory with the
        harmonic resonances contained in the ancient Hindu text known as
        the Rig Veda. It is taken as given that at the baseline,
        everything in the known universe can be viewed as, and indeed is
        comprised of, information.<br>
        <br>
        Information is conveyed in the Torsion Field at a rate which is
        at least 109 times the speed of light. This revelation, which is
        largely due to the ground breaking work of Russian scientist <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">V.A. Dubrovsky</span> up to 1985,
        has now been confirmed by at least six other laboratories in the
        former Soviet States. Based on the ground breaking work of <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">V.A. Ablekov, David Bohm and Karl
          Pribram</span> it has been determined that the Torsion Field
        is holographic.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Since all known substances possess a non-zero collective spin
        state, then all substances must also create and exist within
        their own localized Torsion Fields. We now know that the expanse
        and frequency structure of any substance is determined by its
        chemical composition and the expanse structure of its molecules
        or crystalline lattice.<br>
        <br>
        "Unlike electromagnetism, where analogous charges repel and
        opposite charges attract, in torsion fields similar charges
        attract and opposite charges repulse. As the Torsion Field is
        generated by a classical spin, Torsion Field emissions are
        non-dissipative and are not attenuated by the interposition of
        mass or the effects of distance. Torsion Fields cannot be
        screened by any known materials or combination of materials or
        fields.<br>
        <br>
        At the Institute for Problems of Materials Science in Kiev,
        scientists have for more than 25 years used torsion field
        generators as an essential part of the manufacture of
        exceedingly exotic materials for which we have no comparable
        products in the West. In addition to providing a fascinating
        insight into the way consciousness may operate at the level of
        vicinal water in the human brain, a clear understanding of these
        mechanics could enable us to create energy storage devices which
        demonstrate energy conversion characteristics well in excess of
        gasoline [650 watt hours/kilo]41. At the Institute for Problems
        of Materials Science, Trefilov, Tovschuk and Kovalyuk have
        created a solid state energy cell [energy accumulator] which
        produces 850-1040 watt hours/kilo, in laboratory models. The
        reliability of their claims regarding this technology have been
        verified by INEL, DARPA and the ATML. A key element of their
        construction method relies on the effects of a torsion field
        beam which operates during the process of crystalline lattice
        deposition42. IPMS has also perfected the use of a torsion field
        device which enables them to manufacture mono-molecular powders
        of strategic metals which can be stored in conventional glass
        containers without voluntarily generating static electricity.<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        There is an American scientist among the laureates of the first
        Russian prize “Global Energy” of the year of 2003. He was
        awarded the prize, because (as it was informed) he managed in
        his laboratory to form an electric pulse, which power is equal
        to power of all power stations of the world. Let us show that a
        mistake during the pulse power calculation is a result of this
        experiment. For this purpose, let us analyze energetics of
        pulses of voltage, current and power being obtained by us while
        determining electric energy consumed by the cell of water
        electric generator of heat [1]. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">ANALYSIS</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The oscillograms of pulses of voltage, current and power being
        obtained with the help of PCS500A oscilloscope are given in Figs
        1, 2 and 3. Horizontal scale is 50 &#956;s per division. [1].<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 1. Voltage pulse</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig 2. Current pulse</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 3. Power pulse</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        It is clearly seen (Figs 1, 2 and 3) that a form of pulses of
        voltage, current and power can be reduced to a rectangular form.
        Pulse duration will be equal to 0.00007 s, pulse repetition
        period is 0.00725 s, pulse frequency is =1000/7.25=137.9. Duty
        ratio is equal to S=0.00725/0.00007 =103.6. If the pulse form is
        considered to be a rectangular one, duty factor will be equal to
        Z=1/103.6=0.0096. Voltage pulse amplitude is =300 V, current
        pulse amplitude is =50 A and power pulse amplitude is =300&#1093;50=
        15 kW. Taking it into consideration, average voltage value will
        be = 300&#1093;0.0096=2.88 V, average current value will be =<br>
        50&#1093;0.0096=0.48 A, average power value will be =15000&#1093;0.0096=144
        W.<br>
        <br>
        Let us put a question: has power pulse (Fig. 3) 15 kW actually,
        and is average value of pulse power equal to 144 W? Is the
        calculation carried out correctly? [1]<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with Si-system, if one voltage pulse with
        amplitude of&nbsp;&nbsp; and with assigned duration&nbsp; is
        supplied per second and one current pulse with amplitude
        of&nbsp;&nbsp; and with duration, the above-mentioned values of
        voltage and current can be used for power calculation only in
        the case when their duration corresponds to one second. Such
        requirement originates from the power unit definition by Watt.
        Watt is work done per second by current and voltage
        continuously.<br>
        <br>
        Consequently, pulse action of voltage and current should be
        prolonged till one second. Naturally, an oblong rectangle is
        obtained instead of a pulse in this case. Height of this
        rectangle multiplied by a pulse form factor&nbsp; (=1 if the
        pulse form is reduced to a rectangular form and =0.5 if the
        pulse form is reduced to a triangular form), and it will be an
        average value of voltage&nbsp;&nbsp; if voltage pulse is spread,
        an average value of current&nbsp;&nbsp; if current
        pulse&nbsp;&nbsp; is spread, and an average value of power&nbsp;
        if power pulse&nbsp; is spread.<br>
        <br>
        If not one, but several pulses are generated during one second,
        the above-mentioned average values of pulses of voltage, current
        and power, as it is considered now, should be multiplied by
        frequency of pulse. This operation is equivalent to a division
        of amplitude values of voltage , current&nbsp; and power&nbsp;
        by duty ratio . If we take into account that , average values of
        voltage and current will be equal to:<br>
        <br>
        (1)<br>
        (2)<br>
        <br>
        If we pay attention to the formulas (1) and (2), we’ll see that
        the amplitude values of voltage&nbsp; and current&nbsp; are
        reduced to a duration of one second; that’s why their values are
        in strict correspondence with Si-system. It is a vivid example
        of the fact that average power of the pulse should be determined
        according to the formulas:<br>
        <br>
        (3)<br>
        (4)<br>
        <br>
        But this result is considered to be erroneous, because voltage
        and current are changed simultaneously and synchronously, and
        their duty ratios are united in one duty ratio in power pulse;
        that’s why, as it is considered now, average pulse power should
        be determined according to the formula [3], [4]<br>
        <br>
        (5)<br>
        <br>
        This value of average power will be obtained if we use the
        formula<br>
        <br>
        (6)<br>
        <br>
        Later on, we’ll prove experimentally that power pulse (Fig. 3)
        has not 15000 W and 144.80 W, but only 1.40 W. That’s why a
        question emerges: where does the essence of the mistake lie?<br>
        <br>
        A single division by duty ratio of a product of the amplitude
        values of voltage&nbsp; and current&nbsp; (formula 5) is
        equivalent to stretching till duration of one second of power
        pulse. It appears from this that either voltage pulse, or
        current pulse (i.e. one of two pulses) is stretched to duration
        of one second in the formula (5). This process can be shown
        graphically (Fig. 4) if it is supposed that the experiment has
        lasted 300 s.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 4. Diagram of duration of
          maximal (300 V, 50A) and average (3.0 V, 0.5A) values of
          voltage and current</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Average values of voltage of 2.88&#8776;3.0&nbsp; V and current 0,48
        &#8776;0.50 A have been obtained in consequence of division of their
        maximal values of 300 V and 50 A by duty ratio of 103.6 &#8776;100. If
        we divide only voltage V by duty ratio, and we’ll not divide
        current&nbsp; A, it will mean that current value during 300 s
        with average voltage value of 3.0 V will be equal to 50 A (Fig.
        4, b). It is a vivid contradiction, which results in the mistake
        in the formulas (5 and 6). <br>
        <br>
        As two values (voltage and current) are changed, it is necessary
        to determine average power during pulse consumption of energy
        according to the formulas (3 and 4). The formulas (5 and 6) take
        into account a change of one value, which forms power, voltage
        or current. That’s why they should give an incorrect result. How
        can it be checked?<br>
        <br>
        It is necessary to carry out such an experiment where not the
        electronic pulse generator connected with the whole grid
        galvanically has been used, but a rotating magnetic generator,
        like a magnetic inductor. Power pulses being generated by the
        magnetic inductor and sent to the consumer will be on the same
        shaft of the magnetic inductor and the electric motor, which
        rotates the magnetic inductor. Galvanic coupling between the
        general grid and the grid of the magnetic inductor is absent in
        this case. Electric energy of pulses of the magnetic inductor is
        converted into mechanical energy of the jointly rotating shafts
        of the magnetic inductor and the electric motor. <br>
        <br>
        As the electric motor is connected in the general grid, an
        electric motor will show in general the energy being consumed by
        the electric motor, the magnetic inductor and the consumer
        connected to the grid of the magnetic inductor. If we write
        energy consumption by the electric motor, the magnetic inductor
        and the consumer and subtract electric energy consumption of the
        electric motor and the magnetic inductor from the obtained
        value, we’ll get energy being generated by the magnetic inductor
        and consumed by the consumer [5], [6]. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, as we have the readings of the electric energy meter and
        the pulses of voltage and current being written with the help of
        the oscilloscope, we can see, which formula (3 and 4) or (5 and
        6) is correct and which one is erroneous. A diagram of such
        experiment is shown in Fig. 5. An oscillogram of pulses of
        voltage and current is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
        <br>
        The cell of the water electric generator of heat has been used
        as a consumer of electric energy generated by the magnetic
        inductor (Fig. 7). <br>

        Voltage pulses were rectified and corrected; the magnetic
        inductor was driven with the help of a single-phase electric
        motor from the grid (Fig. 5). In order to determine energy
        consumed by the electric motor, a domestic electric meter was
        used. The readings of the electric meter 5 were duplicated by
        the readings of voltmeter&nbsp; and ammeter&nbsp; being arranged
        before the cell 1 as well as by the readings of the oscilloscope
        6 (Fig. 5). Heated solution energy was determined in a standard
        way.<br>
        <br>
        The experimental results are given in Table 1. Here is power
        consumed by the cell from the mains. It is equal to a difference
        between the readings of the electric power meter when the load

        We managed to adjust the magnetic inductor in such a way that it
        generated voltage pulses; its average amplitude was equal to .
        Average amplitude of current pulse&nbsp; was equal to. Pulse
        duration was . Pulse frequency was= 255.8 Hz. Pulse duty ratio
        was . It is natural that such pulse form is easily reduced to a
        triangular form; then, . As a result, the formulas (1) and (2)
        give such average values of voltage and current. <br>
        <br>
        (7)<br>
        (8)<br>
        <br>
        A calculation according to the formulas (3 and 4) gives a result
        , which is close (9 and 10) to the readings of the meter&nbsp;
        (Table 1, experience 2) and the readings&nbsp; of
        voltmeter&nbsp; and ammeter&nbsp; (Fig. 5).<br>
        <br>
        (9)<br>
        (10)<br>
        <br>
        Then according to formula (5), average power will be equal to
        (Table 1, experiment 2)<br>
        <br>
        (11)<br>
        <br>
        It is an explicitly wrong result, because the electric power
        meter has shown that in this case the cell has consumed =3.53 W
        (Table 1, experience 2).<br>
        <br>
        When we compare the calculation results according to the
        formulas (10 and 11) with the experimental results (Table 1,
        experiment 2), we see that when determining average power
        according to the oscillogram the amplitude values of voltage and
        current should be divided by duty ratio not once (11) as it is
        stipulated in the manuals [3], [4], but twice (10) as it is
        shown in the formulas (4 and 10). Only this power value will
        agree with the reality. It appears from this that the formulas
        (3, 4, 9 and 10) are correct and the formulas (5, 6 and 11) are
        erroneous. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, the power pulse shown in Fig. 3 has not 15 kW and not
        144.8 W, but only.<br>
        <br>
        Let us see what the results are when motor 2 and magnetic
        inductor 3 (Fig. 5) are replaced by the electronic pulse
        generator (Figs 8, 9). The oscillograms of the experiment are
        shown in Figs 1, 2 and 3. <br>
        <br>
        As it is shown in Fig. 1, an average amplitude of voltage pulses
        is 300 V when an average value of voltage is 3.0 V (Fig. 9); an
        average amplitude of current pulses (Fig. 2) was 50 A when an
        average value current is 0.5 A (Fig. 9). Pulse duration is
        =0,00007&nbsp; when duty ratio is =100 and duty factor is =
        0.01.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 8. Electrical diagram of
          the system:</span> 1 - cell: 2- electronic pulse generator; 5

          electric value measurement:</span> 1 - cell; 2 – PCS500A&nbsp;
        electronic oscilloscope; 3 - pulse generator<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the readings of voltmeter , ammeter&nbsp; and
        oscilloscope (Figs 8, 9), power at the input into the cell of
        water electric generator of heat is =3.0&#1093;0.5=1.50 W on average.
        A calculation according to the formulas (3 and 4) gives a near
        result of 1.40 W.<br>
        <br>
        A question arises: what power will be indicated by the
        instruments: voltmeter&nbsp; and ammeter&nbsp; arranged before
        the pulse generator (Figs 8 and 9)? It is quite natural that the
        voltmeter will indicate mains voltage = 220 V, current value is
        increased as well, because there are two loads before ammeter :
        cell 1 and electronic pulse generator 3. =0.65 A is in our
        experiment (Fig. 9). As a result, power implemented by pulse
        generator 3 and cell 1 is =220&#1093;0.65=143 W; it is at variance
        with the result (=1.4 W) being obtained according to the
        formulas (3 and 4). Their correctness has been proved by us
        experimentally. <br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the fact that the obtained result is
        =143 W. It is near to the result =144.8 being obtained during
        the calculation according to the incorrect formulas (5 and 6). <br>
        <br>
        Now we know that actual energy consumed by the cell is indicated
        by the instruments (voltmeter , ammeter) arranged before it. The
        oscilloscope readings will correspond to actual consumption of
        energy by the cell if the formulas (3 and 4) are used. The
        formulas (5 and 6) distort a result in proportion to pulse duty
        ratio. When pulse duty ratio is equal 100, the formulas (5 and
        6) increase an actual power consumption by the cell nearly
        100fold. Such are the properties of electric circuits with the
        electronic pulse generator. It does not implement evident energy
        efficiency of the cell. Energy efficiency of the cell is
        implemented only in the case when energy source, which is
        similar to magnetic inductor, is used (Table 1) [5], [6]. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, we have eliminated the contradictions between the
        instrument readings&nbsp; and the calculations during&nbsp;
        pulse consumption of electric power. Now let us put such a
        question: according to what formula has the laureate of the
        prize “Global Energy” calculated pulse power? An answer is
        clear: according to the formula<br>
        <br>
        (12)<br>
        <br>
        which (as it is supposed in modern physics) determines
        instantaneous power of a pulse and which (as we have already
        shown) is a fictitious value.<br>
        <br>
        As power of one pulse is given in the formula (12), it is quite
        natural that&nbsp; and&nbsp; can have very large values. But in
        any case, their product gives the fictitious value, not the
        actual value. If we take pulse duty ratio, which has been used
        in our experiments () and keep in mind that in order to get
        actual pulse power the right part of the formula (12) should be
        divided by a square of duty ratio (in the case being considered
        by ), actual power of pulse&nbsp;&nbsp; is 10000fold less than
        the value, for which the prize was awarded. If we take into
        account the fact that pulse duration being obtained by the
        laureate was considerably less than the one being obtained
        during our experiment and duty ratio was considerably greater
        than 100, the actual value of the power pulse will be
        millionfold less than the value, for which the prize was
        awarded. <br>
        <br>

          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Let us put the representatives of the committee “Global energy”
        at their ease. Their mistake is nothing as compared with the
        mistakes made by the Nobel prize [7].<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        In modern electrical engineering and pulse engineering, the
        following rules of power determination in the electrical
        circuits of continuous and pulse energy consumption have been
        established [2-4]: <br>
        <br>
        1- during continuous consumption of electric energy its
        power&nbsp; is determined by the dependence:<br>
        <br>
        (1)<br>
        <br>
        where&nbsp; is average voltage magnitude,&nbsp; is average
        current magnitude.<br>
        <br>
        2 - during pulse consumption of electric energy its power&nbsp;
        is determined by other dependence<br>
        <br>
        (2)<br>
        <br>
        Here&nbsp; is average amplitude voltage magnitude (Fig.
        1);&nbsp;&nbsp; is average amplitude current&nbsp; magnitude
        (Fig. 1);&nbsp; is pulse duty ratio.<br>
        <br>
        It is known that an electromagnetic voltmeter and an ammeter
        average the regular pulses of voltage and current
        satisfactorily. Average magnitudes of voltage&nbsp; and
        current&nbsp; being indicated by these instruments appear to be
        equal to the readings of an oscilloscope if they are calculated
        according to the formulas:<br>
        <br>
        (3)<br>
        (4)<br>
        <br>
        It appears from this that power should be determined according
        to the formula [1]<br>
        <br>
        (5)<br>
        <br>
        But the calculation according to this formula results to the
        violation of the law of conservation of energy. In some cases
        while heating, for example, of alkali liquor more thermal energy
        is released than electric energy, which is calculated according
        to the formula, is consumed (5). In order to do away with this
        contradiction, they decided to take duty ratio&nbsp; into
        account once (2). They explained it by the fact that voltage and
        current are changed simultaneously and synchronously (Fig. 1). A
        situation took place when the formula (2) was considered to be
        correct, and the formula (5) was considered to be erroneous. The
        contradictions in the instrument readings were ignored. For
        example, if a voltage pulse amplitude is equal to =1000 V, a
        current pulse amplitude is =50 A and a pulse duty ratio
        magnitude is =100, the formulas (3) and (4) give the following
        results: =10 V and =0.5 A. These magnitudes are indicated by the
        moving-coil instruments. If we take formula (2) as a basic one,
        we’ll get<br>
        <br>
        (6)<br>
        (7)<br>
        <br>
        The moving coil instruments indicate nothing of the sort.
        Besides, it appears from the formula (2) that in case of a
        single division by pulse ratio only one magnitude out of two
        values is changed. For example, when voltage is changed, it
        becomes equal to =1000/100=10 V. Current magnitude&nbsp; remains
        unchanged, and it should be registered by the instruments. But
        none of them indicates such value. <br>
        <br>
        In order to eliminate these contradictions, it was necessary to
        carry out an experiment, in which a source, which had no
        galvanic coupling with the whole circuit, would generate such
        voltage pulses. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experimental part</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The cell of the water electric generator of heat was used in
        order to carry out this experiment. The magnetic inductor
        1302.3728 (GOST 3940-84) with the changed coil was used as a
        voltage pulse source (Fig. 1). <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig.1. Sample of an oscillogram
          of voltage and current generated by the magnetic inductor</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Voltage pulses were rectified and corrected. The magnetic
        inductor was rotated with the help of on-phase electric motor
        energized from mains (Fig. 2). A domestic electric power meter
        was used in order to determine power consumed by the electric
        motor. The readings of the electric power meter 5 were doubled
        by the readings of the voltmeter&nbsp;&nbsp; and the
        ammeter&nbsp;&nbsp; arranged before the cell 1 as well as the
        readings of the oscilloscope 6 (Tektronix TDS 2014, Fig. 2).
        Energy of the heated solution was determined in a standard way.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2. Electric diagram of the
          system: </span>1- cell: 2- electric motor; 3 – generator
        (magnetic inductor); 4 – coupling connecting the motor shaft
        with the generator shaft; 5 – electric power meter; 6 –
        oscilloscope<br>
        <br>
        The electric motor shaft 2 (Fig. 2) is connected with the
        magnetic inductor shaft 3 with the help of coupling 4. Total
        power consumption is registered by electric power meter 5. Power
        consumed by the cell is registered with the help of voltmeter ,
        ammeter&nbsp; and oscilloscope 6.<br>
        <br>
        Certainly, the magnetic inductor does not generate such voltage
        pulses, which provide significant energy effect. The magnetic
        inductor was adjusted in such a way that it generated voltage
        pulses, which average amplitude was equal to instead of 900…1000
        V. Average amplitude of current pulse was equal to&nbsp; instead
        of 80…100 A. Pulse duration&nbsp; was instead of 100 &#61549;s. Pulse
        duty ratio was instead of 80…100. Besides, a pulse form differed
        from the necessary on. Nevertheless, energy effect was
        registered.<br>
        <br>
        The experimental method is simple. Solution consumption by the
        cell is determined. The electric motor, which makes the magnetic
        inductor rotate, is connected to the mains; it registers power
        consumed by the electric motor – magnetic inductor – cell system
        as well as the readings of the test instruments being arranged
        before the cell. Then the cell, which plays the role of a load,
        is de-energized. Energy consumption is registered during idle
        run of the electric motor- magnetic inductor system. A
        difference between these readings is equal to energy being
        consumed by the cell. Simultaneously, solution consumption and a
        change of its temperature are registered. In order to facilitate
        the analysis, consumed energy has been converted into power. <br>
        <br>
        The experimental results are given in Table 1. Here is power
        consumed by the cell from the mains. It is equal to a difference
        between the readings of the electric power meter when the load
        (the cell)&nbsp; is energized and de-energized.&nbsp;&nbsp; is
        heat power of the heated solution.&nbsp; is power being
        indicated by the voltmeter&nbsp; and the ammeter&nbsp; arranged
        before the cell.&nbsp; is power being indicated by the
        oscilloscope and determined manually.&nbsp; is an index of
        efficiency of the solution heating process.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 1. Indices of the direct
          experiment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

        <br>
        As it is clear, average power of&nbsp; = (4.3 …5.1) W being
        determined in accordance with the average values of current and
        voltage is close to power value of = (3.1….4.8) W on the
        electric motor shaft when the cell is energized (without taking
        power for idle run into consideration) and power of&nbsp; =
        (3.8….5.3)W being obtained while oscillogram processing. If we
        multiply power value&nbsp; being indicated by the voltmeter and
        the ammeter by duty ratio , it will correspond to a single
        registration of duty ratio, which is described in all textbook
        on power engineering and pulse engineering. In this case, the
        readings of the voltmeter, the ammeter and the oscilloscope will
        exceed the readings of the electric power meter 4.7 fold. It
        does not correspond to reality. It appears from this that when
        average power is determined according to an oscillogram, the
        amplitude values of voltage and current should be divided by
        duty ratio not once as it is mentioned in the textbooks, but
        twice as it is shown in the formula (5). Only such power value
        will correspond to reality. <br>
        <br>
        Now let us see what results can be obtained if electron pulse
        generator 2 (Fig. 3) is used instead of motor 2 and magneto 3
        (Fig. 2). The readings of voltmeter&nbsp;&nbsp; and
        ammeter&nbsp;&nbsp; as well as the readings of oscilloscope 6
        are not changed if the pulse parameters are the same. Meter 5
        will indicate a different value, and we cannot predict it. An
        average value of current indicated by ammeter&nbsp; is nearly
        0.4 A. Ammeter&nbsp;&nbsp; will indicate a value of nearly 0.6
        A. Naturally, voltmeter&nbsp;&nbsp; will indicate mains voltage
        of&nbsp; 220V. Power, which is registered by ammeter&nbsp;&nbsp;
        and voltmeter , is as follows:. . Meter 5 will indicate the same
        value.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 3. Electrical diagram of
          the system:</span> 1- cell; 2 – electron pulse generator; 5 –
        electric power meter; 6 – oscilloscope<br>
        <br>
        Thus, if the electron pulse generator is used instead of the
        motor and the magneto, power consumed by the cell from mains is
        changed by fold. It appears from it that power of 132 W is
        fictitious power, which is not consumed by the cell. The cell
        consumes 4.0W; it is proved by the measurement&nbsp; results
        given in Table 1. That’s why we have every reason to call the
        difference of powers&nbsp; a fictitious power.<br>
        <br>
        It appears from the analysis that average power in each section
        of the electric circuit is equal to a product of average
        voltage, which is applied across this section, by average value
        of current. It is the law of electric circuit.<br>
        <br>
        For example, average voltage of 10 V is applied in the section
        of the electric circuit before the cell (Fig. 3); average value
        of current existing in this section is equal to 0.4 A. If we
        consider it, we’ll see that the value of power in this section
        of the electric circuit will be 10 x 0.4= 4 W. Let us make a
        vertical section on the diagram (Fig. 3) before meter 5. Average
        value of voltage in this section is equal to mains voltage of
        220 V. If average value of current in this part of mains is
        equal to 0.6 A, average power in this section of the electric
        circuit will be 220 x 0.6= 132 W. It is the law of electric
        circuit, which has been checked with the help of many
        experiments being carried out by us. <br>
        <br>
        We do not know if there is an enunciation of this law in modern
        electrical engineering, but without this law it is impossible to
        make a correct analysis of power engineering of&nbsp; mixed
        systems where energy is transferred and consumed continuously
        and by pulses.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, in order to determine average power consumed by the cell,
        it is necessary to multiply average values of voltage and
        current indicated by voltmeter&nbsp;&nbsp; and
        ammeter&nbsp;&nbsp; or to take a product of average amplitude
        values of pulses of voltage and current indicated by the
        oscilloscope and to divide them by duty ration do not to once
        (as it is mentioned in the textbooks), but twice. Only in this
        case the results will correspond to average power actually
        consumed by the cell. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The law of electric circuit: average power in each section of
        electric circuit is equal to a product of average voltage, which
        is applied across this section, by average value of current.<br>
        <br>
        The law of electric circuit sent the law of conservation of
        energy in its modern enunciation to the science history section.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> The direct
        experiment results are presented. They show falseness of a
        determination of average power consumed in the form of regular
        pulses by means of a single record of duty ratio of pulses of
        voltage and current. Average power of regular pulses of voltage
        and current is determined by means of multiplication of
        amplitude values of voltage and current and division of the
        result by square of duty ratio.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        It is stipulated in modern electrical engineering, in the
        textbook on pulse engineering as well as in numerous scientific
        articles that if electric energy is consumed as regular pulses
        of voltage and current, average power is determined by means of
        division of amplitude multiplications of voltage and current by
        their duty ratio. In this case, processing results of
        oscillograms of&nbsp; voltage and current coincide with the
        readings of the devices being installed before the pulse
        generator and prove the energy conservation law when energy is
        consumed by pulses. It is considered that it is enough to ignore
        contradictions in the readings of the measuring devices as well
        as a number of vivid physical contradictions. <br>
        <br>
        Now we’ll show that it is impossible to leave this problem as it
        is, because it restrains development of other tasks of pulse
        power engineering. As an example in order to analyse the
        problem, let us consider the experimental results being obtained
        with the participation of the independent experts.<br>

        The representatives of the company SITIS (the city of Sarov)
        have expressed their wish to carry out the joint tests of&nbsp;
        the cell of the water electric generator of heat (Fig.1).<br>
        <br>
        The test was carried out on 27 February, 2004, at the Kuban
        State Agrarian University (KSAU), city of Krasnodar. The
        independent experts observed the experiments, registered the
        measurement results of all values; after these results were
        processed, they made their conclusion, which is given below.<br>

        The special experimental cell of the water electric generator of
        heat (Fig. 1). The electronic scales with scale division value
        of 2.0 g. A stop watch with scale division value of 0.1 s.
        Thermometers with the scale division of 1 degree. Voltage and
        current at the input of&nbsp; the cell of the water electric
        generator of heat&nbsp; were determined wit the help of four
        sets of devices: M2004 voltmeter of accuracy class of 0.2 (GOST
        8711-78); M20015 ammeter of accuracy class of 0.2 (GOST
        8711-60); ACK-2022 and PCS-500A oscilloscopes as well as PX120
        electronic multimeter, which measured voltage, current and cell
        input power at the same time. It is not shown in the diagram
        (Fig. 3). This instrument measures effective value of
        alternating voltage of 500 mV to 600 V, alternating current of
        10 mA to 10 A, direct current of 10 mA to 10 A, direct voltage
        power of 6 kW, alternating voltage power of 6 kW, reactive power
        of alternating voltage of 6 kW and gross power of alternating
        voltage of 6 kW.<br>
        <br>
        For the sake of clarity, we should note that the voltage
        measurement range switch of M2004 voltmeter corresponded to
        maximal voltage value of 30 V: the switch of M20015 ammeter
        corresponded to maximal current value of 1.5 A (Fig. 3). The
        amplitudes of pulses of these values were 300 V and 50 A,
        respectively. It appears from this that it has been correct to
        PX120 multimeter, which is not shown in the diagram (Fig. 3). <br>
        <br>
        In order to reduce heat losses, which were not taken into
        account in the experiment, temperature difference of the
        solution was kept small prior to its heating in the cell and
        after heating . <br>

        Pulse scale is equal to 10. Average amplitude of voltage (Figs
        4, 5 and 6): Uacp = (29 + 31 + 8 + 33+ 32+40+40)x10/7 = 304.3 V.
        Current value was determined as voltage drop across the resistor
        with resistance of 0.1 Ohm. Taking this into account, average
        current amplitude (Figs 7, 8 and 9) is equal to I&#1072;&#1089;&#1088; = <br>
        (1.7+0.8+1.7+2.1+3.2+0.7+2.1+1.3+2.4+1.4+1.4) x 0.2x10/(11x0.1)
        = 34.18 &#1040;. Pulse repetition period is &#1058; = 7.25 ms. <br>
        <br>
        Pulse duration was determined according to an oscillogram in the
        microsecond range (Fig. 6). The pulse form was reduced to a
        triangular form in such a way that the area of the triangle was
        equal nearly to the area circumscribed by a complex form of the
        pulse curve. In this case, pulse duration is equal nearly to
        tp=0.14 ms. Pulse frequency&nbsp; f = 1000/7.25 = 137.9 Hz.
        Pulse duration S = 7.25/0.14 = 51.78. <br>
        <br>
        If we accept a triangular form of the pulse (0.5), we’ll get a
        value of duty ratio Z = 0.5/51.78 = 0.01. Average value of pulse
        voltage Uc&#1088; = 304.3 x 0.01 = 3.04 V. Average value of current in
        pulses I&#1089;&#1088; = 0.01 x 34.18 = 0.34 A.<br>
        <br>
        Average values of voltage and current can be determined as
        values of voltage and current corresponding to one second.
        Taking into account the triangular form of pulses (0.5),
        duration of one pulse (0.00014 s) and pulse frequency (137.9),
        we’ll have&nbsp; Uc&#1088; = 304.3 x 0.5 x 0.00014 x 137.9=2.94 V, I&#1089;&#1088;
        = 34.0 x 0.5 x 0.00014 x 137.9 = 0.33 A. Let us pay attention to
        the fact that the values of average voltage and current being
        determined with the help of ACK-2022 oscilloscope are less than
        the values being determined with the help of the voltmeter and
        the ammeter.&nbsp; The experimental results being obtained with
        the help of the voltmeter, the ammeter and ACK-2022 oscilloscope
        are given in Table 1.<br>

        with the help of PCS500A oscilloscope are given in Figs 10, 11

        <br>
        It can be seen (Figs 10, 11 and 12) that the form of the pulses
        of voltage, current and power can be reduced to a rectangular
        form. Pulse duration will be equal to 0.00007 s,&nbsp; pulse
        repetition period will be 0.00725 s, pulse frequency&nbsp; will
        be 1000/7.25=137.9, pulse voltage amplitude will 300 V, current
        pulse amplitude will be 50 A and power pulse amplitude will 15
        kW. <br>
        <br>
        Duty ratio will be equal to S=0.00725/0.00007=103.6. If the
        pulse form is considered to be a rectangular one, duty factor
        will be equal to Z=1/103.6=0.01. Taking it into consideration,
        average voltage value will be 300x0.01=3 V, and average current
        value will be 50x0.01=0.5 A.<br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the fact that average values of voltage
        and current being determined with the help of the voltmeter and
        the ammeter as well as with the help of both oscilloscopes have
        close values. The experimental results being obtained with the
        help of the voltmeter and the ammeter and ACK-2022 and PCS500A
        oscilloscopes are given in Table 1.<br>

        Notes:&nbsp; PX120 multimeter, which is not given in the diagram
        (Fig. 3), according to the client’s demand,&nbsp; indicated the
        figures of the changing values of voltage in the interval of 1
        to 5 V, the values of current in the interval of 0.1 to 0.6 A
        and the values of power in the interval of 0.1-3.0 W. They were
        approximately the same values that originated from the readings
        of the voltmeter, the ammeter and two oscilloscopes.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion of the Results</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        According to the representatives of the joint-stock company
        SITIS, power consumed by the cells should be determined in the
        following way. According to them, power of one pulse is equal to
        300x50x0.00007=1.05 J. They have processed the oscillograms of
        several pulses with the help of a computer program, and they
        have got, as they think, more exact result of 0.87 J. Then
        quantity of pulses per experiment is determined:
        300x139.7&#61566;41400. Taking this into consideration, power consumed
        by the cell during 300 s is 0.87x41400=35.98 kJ (p. 10’’’ of
        Table 1). According to them, pulse duty ratio should not be
        taken into consideration. It is natural that in this case energy
        effectiveness of the cell will be less than unit: 0.87 (p. 11’’’
        of Table 1). <br>
        <br>
        Besides the analysed cell efficiency calculation version, SITIS
        specialists have suggested one more. According to this version,
        pulse duty ratio should be taken into account only once. Then
        energy consumed by the cells will be 300x50x300/100=45.0 kJ. In
        this case, energy efficiency of the cell will be less than unit
        as well. <br>
        <br>
        Let us consider physical sense of this method. Time period,
        within which energy is supplied into the cell, is equal to
        0.00007x41400=3.0 s; the total time of its operation is 300 s.
        Thus, the cell received energy during 3 s, and it operated
        within 297 s receiving no energy. Taking it into account, it is
        possible to present the diagrams of the maximal and average
        values of current and voltage (Fig. 13). As it is clear, total
        time, within which the maximal values of voltage of 300 V and
        current of 50 A operated, is equal to 3 s. Their average values
        of 3 V and 0.5 A operated within 300 s. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 13. Operation time diagram
          of the maximal (300 V, 50A) and average (3.0 V, 0.5 A) values
          of voltage and current</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The average values of voltage of 3.0 V and current of 0.5 A have
        been obtained as a result of division of their maximal values of
        300 V and 50 A on pulse duty ratio 100. If we divide only
        voltage by duty ratio, and current is not divided, it means that
        when the average value of voltage is 3 V, the value of current
        will be 50 A within 300 s (Fig. 13, b). The instruments register
        nothing of the sort. This is the first apparent contradiction,
        which cannot be ignored. <br>
        <br>
        The change intervals of voltage (1-5 V), current (0.1-0.6 A) and
        power (0.1-3.0 W) being indicated by the multimeter confirm the
        fact that this instrument registers pulse duty ratio, voltage
        and current. It is the second contradiction.<br>
        <br>
        It is suggested in the textbook on pulse power engineering to
        determine power, which is consumed by the consumer in the form
        of pulses, according to the formula.<br>
        <br>
        (1)<br>
        <br>
        It appears from this that average values of voltage and current
        should be determined according to the formulas:<br>
        <br>
        (2)<br>
        (3)<br>
        <br>
        But the voltmeter being arranged before the cell indicated and
        the ammeter indicated . It is the third apparent contradiction
        that cannot be ignored. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, maybe we are the first to come to an indefiniteness, which
        has been evaded by the investigators. The fact that power is a
        function of two variables (voltage and current) was ignored in
        order to get a result, which would match the law of conservation
        of energy. The readings of all instruments, which have been used
        by us in this experiment, are at variance with an unfounded
        requirement to take into account a change of one parameter
        (current or voltage) when determining electric energy consumed
        in the form of pulses.<br>
        <br>
        In order to facilitate the process of analysis of the causes of
        different readings of the instruments installed before the pulse
        generator and after it, let us consider the diagram (Fig. 14)
        where there are the pulse forms 4 of rectified voltage and the
        pulse forms 5 sent by the pulse generator to the cell supply
        circuit. Voltage&nbsp; and current&nbsp; before the pulse
        generator 3 were registered during the experiment in addition to
        the data specified in Table 1. Voltage before the pulse
        generator was equal to circuit voltage. i.e. 220 V. The
        alternating current value was =0.60 A. <br>
        <br>
        As it is shown in Fig. 10, average amplitude of voltage pulses
        was 300 V with the average value of voltage of 3.0 V, and the
        average amplitude of current pulses (Fig. 11) was 50 A by the
        average value of current of 0.5 A. Pulse duration was =0.00007 s
        with pulse ratio of&nbsp; =100 and duty ratio =0.01.<br>
        <br>
        In accordance with the readings of the voltmeter, ammeter and
        both oscilloscopes, power at the input of the cell of the water
        electric generator of heat is =3x0.5=1.50 W on the average.
        Power consumption for solution heating is&nbsp; . Taking it into
        account, effectiveness is as follows: 31.0/0.45=68.9 (Table 1).
        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 14. Block diagram of
          measurement of electrical quantities:</span> 1- cell; 2 –
        electronic oscilloscope; 3 – pulse generator<br>
        <br>
        A question comes on: can the existing instruments installed
        before the pulse generator confirm this effectiveness?<br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the fact that ammeter installed before
        the pulse generator indicates =0.6 A, and voltmeter indicates
        =220 V (Fig. 13). As a result, power realized by the pulse
        generator (3) and the cell (1) will be =220x0.60=132 W. In this
        case, energy effectiveness of the cell of the water electric
        generator of heat will be less than a unit
        (31000/300=103.3)/132=0.78 taking into account energy of the
        heated solution (Table 1, p.11’’’).<br>
        <br>
        Thus, even if coefficient of performance of the pulse generator
        (3) is equal to a unit, the readings of the instruments
        installed before the pulse generator and after it vary nearly
        132/1.5&#61566;90fold. A question comes on: what instruments give a
        result that corresponds to an actual energy consumption of the
        cell of the water electric generator of heat? The instruments
        installed before the pulse generator (3) or the instruments
        installed after it? Where is the essence of physics in the
        difference of these readings?<br>
        <br>
        In order to give an answer to this question, let us examine
        physical processes that take place when voltage and current are
        measured before the pulse generator (3). <br>
        <br>
        The readings of voltmeter&nbsp; installed before the pulse
        generator (3) are considerably greater than the readings of
        oscilloscope 2 and voltmeter&nbsp; installed before the cell
        (1). It takes place, because voltage before the pulse generator
        is always equal to circuit voltage of 220 V. <br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the fact that the pulses (4) of
        rectified voltage with total duration of 0.01 s are shown before
        the pulse generator (3) in Fig. 14. Here, the pulse (5) of
        voltage with duration of 0.00007 s is shown. The pulse generator
        separates it from the whole pulse and sends it to the cell.
        Strictly speaking, the remaining area under the curve of
        rectified pulse with voltage of 220 V should be decreased by a
        value corresponding to the area of the pulse being sent to the
        cell (1) and should become equal to voltage of 220-3=217 V. But
        this difference is compensated immediately by mains, and the
        above-mentioned area of the pulse with duration of 0.01 s is
        kept corresponding to voltage of 220 V.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, any measuring instruments installed before the pulse
        generator (3) will register power nearly 90fold greater than the
        instruments installed before the cell (1). Now we know why. It
        is so, because the instruments before the pulse generator (3)
        refer current of 0.60 A not to average value of pulse voltage (3
        V), but to the total voltage of the mains (220 V). This
        phenomenon can be observed in other experiments. <br>
        <br>
        3. The Second Experiment<br>
        <br>
        In order to simplify the experiment and its interpretation, let
        us take a diode as a pulse generator. It generates half-wave
        pulses of rectified current with frequency of 50 Hz and duration
        of 0.01 s. An incandescent lamp of 100 W was used as an energy
        consumer. <br>
        <br>
        In order to facilitate the process of analysis, let us show
        voltage pulses before the diode and after it in the diagram
        (Fig. 15). Let us call the diagram a block diagram. <br>
        <br>
        Voltage and current before the lamp (1) were determined with the
        help of two sets of instruments. Permanent-magnet instruments:
        M2004 voltmeter&nbsp; (), accuracy class 0.2 (GOST 8711-78), and
        M20015 ammeter (), accuracy class 0.2 (GOST 8711-60), and
        ACK-2022 electronic oscilloscope (2). Voltage () before the
        diode was measures with the help of the multimeter. Current ()
        was measured with the help of ACT-No. 88866 electromagnetic
        ammeter, accuracy class 0.5 (GOST 1845-52). Energy consumption
        was determined with the help of &#1057;&#1054;-&#1048;446 electric meter (GOST
        6570-75). The measurement results are given in Table 2. <br>

        (3) will indicated 100 V, and ammeter&nbsp; will indicate
        current 0.23 A. At the same time, voltmeter&nbsp; installed
        before the diode will indicate mains voltage of 220 V, and
        ammeter&nbsp; will indicate current 0.23 A. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, according to the readings of the instruments installed
        before the lamp power realized by it is =100x0.23=23.0 W. At the
        same time, the instruments installed before the diode will
        register power realized by the lamp and the diode =220x0.23=50.6
        W. What is the actual consumption of energy by the lamp?<br>
        <br>
        It is possible to dispute the competence of the use of the
        permanent-magnet instruments: M2004 voltmeter&nbsp; (), accuracy
        grade 0.2 (GOST 8711-78), and M20015 ammeter (), accuracy grade
        0.2 (GOST 8711-60). That’s why let us replicate the readings of
        the above-mentioned instruments with the help of the readings of
        ACK-2022 electronic oscilloscope. In Figs 16 and 17, the
        oscillograms of voltage and current, which have been registered
        collaterally to the readings of the pointer instruments&nbsp;
        and , are given (Fig. 15). <br>
        <br>
        Let us see what oscilligram processing methods (Figs 16 and 17)
        are closer to the readings of the voltmeter and the ammeter
        installed before the lamp. For this purpose, first of all let us
        determine parameters of one pulse gradually. <br>
        Pulse scale is 10. Average amplitude of voltage pulses (Fig. 16)
        is =7x5x10=350 V. Current magnitude was determined as voltage
        drop across the resistor with resistance of 0.3 Ohm. Taking it
        into consideration, average current amplitude (Fig. 17) is&nbsp;
        =6.6x0.005x10/0.3=1.1 A. Pulse repetition period is T=20 ms.
        Pulse duration is = 10 ms. Pulse frequency is =1000/20=50 Hz.
        Pulse ratio determined as a rate of pulse repetition period T to
        pulse duration is S=20/10=2.0.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 16. Voltage</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 17. Current</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        If we allow some error, we accept a triangular form of pulses
        (). Duty factor will be Z=0.5/2.0=0.25. Average value of pulse
        voltage is =350x0.25=87.50 V. Average value of current in pulses
        is =1.1x0.25=0.275 A. <br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the fact that&nbsp; is pulse ratio
        corresponding to the triangular form of pulses. In this case,
        duty ratio of triangular pulses is&nbsp; (4). Taking it into
        account, average value of voltage will be , and average value of
        current will be . Power consumed by the lamp will be <br>
        <br>
        (4)<br>
        <br>
        Thus, voltage and current of the lamp arranged after the diode
        became twice as little, illumination was decreased (2200/600) =
        3.7fold. That's why power consumed by the lamp should be
        decreased fourfold, it is confirmed by the formula (4). Double
        reduction of voltage and current with duty ratio equal to 2
        means that when we determine average value of power, we should
        divide the product of the amplitude values of voltage and
        current twice by duty ratio as it is done in the formula (4). It
        will be actual power consumed by the lamp. The instruments being
        installed before the diode but will indicate twice greater power
        not because it is consumed by the lamp, but because in this part
        of network voltage (of network) is twice as much than voltage
        being supplied to the lamp; they have almost the same current. <br>
        <br>
        Let us pay attention to the divergence between the readings of
        the voltmeter =100 V and the readings of the oscilloscope =87.50
        V and the readings of the ammeter =0.23 A and =0.275 A according
        to the readings of the oscilloscope. These divergences are
        stipulated by the deviation of the voltage pulse form from the
        triangular form. The computer program based on the ordinate
        method would give more exact result. Nevertheless, power
        realized by the lamp will be =87.50x0.275=24.0 W according to
        the oscilloscope readings. This value will be =23.0 W according
        to the readings of the ammeter and the voltmeter installed
        before the lamp.<br>
        <br>
        Not we can start searching a reply to the question: is it
        possible to realize the obtained efficiency of the cell of the
        water electric generator of heat or the lamp under the
        industrial and domestic conditions in order to save power?<br>
        <br>
        As power grid is a closed system, current of 0.5 A of the cell
        (Fig. 14) or current of 0.23 A of the lamp (Fig. 15) will flow
        in this system (with voltage of 220 V) via all electric meters
        to a turbine of the generator of the power station. As a result,
        all meters register power consumed by the pulse generator (3)
        and the cell (1) jointly, i.e. 220x0.6=132 W (Fig. 14) or the
        lamp and the diode 220x0.23=50.6 W (Fig. 15). These are the
        properties of electric circuits. We’ll get no power saving. <br>
        <br>
        Thus, there are two contradictory results: indisputable power
        efficiency of the cell of the water electric generator of heat
        or the lamp and inability of power grid to accept this
        efficiency in order to save power. The main cause of this
        contradiction is in the fact that the cell or the lamp consume
        power in the form of the short-term pulses of voltage and
        current. There are no such pulses in power grid. <br>
        <br>
        What will happen if we reject the electron generator of pulses
        and work out an electric power generator, which will generate
        voltage in the form of pulses similar to those that are consumed
        by the cell (Fig. 4-9) or the lamp (Fig. 16, 17)? Certainly,
        such generator should have no electrical connection with the
        whole power grid. In this case, the powers being realized by the
        cell of 1.50 W or the lamp of 23.0 W will be on a shaft of such
        generator. If we connect this shaft with the shaft of an
        electric motor, which energizes the generator, the common shaft
        of the electric motor and the generator will give 1.50 W to the
        cell or 23 W to the lamp. Power consumed by the electric motor
        from the common grid, will be approximately the same (without
        taking the losses into consideration). <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. The Third (Direct)
          Experiment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The cell of the water electric generator of heat (Fig. 1) was
        used in order to carry out this experiment. The magnetic
        inductor 1302.3728 (GOST 3940-84) with the changed coil was used
        as a voltage pulse source. Voltage pulses were rectified and
        corrected. The magnetic inductor was rotated with the help of
        on-phase electric motor energized from mains. A domestic
        electric power meter was used in order to determine power
        consumed by the electric motor. Energy of the heated solution
        was determined in a standard way. The readings of the electric
        power meter 5 were doubled by the readings of the voltmeter and
        the ammeter&nbsp; arranged before the cell 1 as well as the
        readings of the oscilloscope 6 (Fig. 18).<br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
          Fig. 18. Electric diagram of the system:</span> 1- cell: 2-
        electric motor; 3 – generator (magnetic inductor); 4 – coupling
        connecting the motor shaft with the generator shaft; 5 –
        electric power meter; 6 – oscilloscope<br>
        <br>
        The electric motor shaft 2 is connected with the magnetic
        inductor shaft 3 with the help of coupling 4. Total power
        consumption is registered by electric power meter 5. Power
        consumed by the cell is registered with the help of voltmeter V,
        ammeter A and oscilloscope 6 (Fig. 18).<br>
        <br>
        Certainly, the magnetic inductor does not generate such voltage
        pulses (Fig. 19), which provide significant energy effect (Figs
        4…9). The magnetic inductor was adjusted in such a way that it
        generated voltage pulses, which average amplitude was equal to
        instead of 900…1000 V. Average amplitude of current pulse was
        equal to&nbsp; instead of 80…100 A. Pulse duration&nbsp; was
        instead of 100 &#61549;s. Pulse duty ratio was instead of 80…100.
        Besides, a pulse form differed from the necessary on (Fig. 19).
        Nevertheless, energy effect was registered.<br>
        <br>
        The experimental method is simple. Solution consumption by the
        cell is determined. The electric motor, which makes the magnetic
        inductor rotate, is connected to the mains; it registers power
        consumed by the electric motor – magnetic inductor – cell system
        as well as the readings of the test instruments being arranged
        before the cell. Then the cell, which plays the role of a load,
        is de-energized. Energy consumption is registered during idle
        run of the electric motor- magnetic inductor system. A
        difference between these readings is equal to energy being
        consumed by the cell. Simultaneously, solution consumption and a
        change of its temperature are registered. In order to facilitate
        the analysis, consumed energy has been converted into power. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 19. Sample of an
          oscillogram of voltage and current generated by the magnetic
          inductor</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        The experimental results are given in Table 3. Here is power
        consumed by the cell from the mains. It is equal to a difference
        between the readings of the electric power meter when the load
        (the cell)&nbsp; is energized and de-energized.&nbsp;&nbsp; is
        heat power of the heated solution.&nbsp; is power being
        indicated by the voltmeter and the ammeter arranged before the
        cell.&nbsp; is power being indicated by the oscilloscope and
        determined manually.&nbsp; is an index of efficiency of the
        solution heating process.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 3. Indices of the direct
          experiment</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        Experiment No., W, W, W,
W12456719.403.104.323.803.1029.803.534.45-2.77310.203.104.404.303.34411.304.805.104.802.35513.284.005.005.303.32<br>
        <br>
        As it is clear, average power of&nbsp; = (4.3 …5.1) W being
        determined in accordance with the average values of current and
        voltage is close to power value of = (3.1….4.8) W on the
        electric motor shaft when the cell is energized (without taking
        power for idle run into consideration) and power of&nbsp; =
        (3.8….5.3)W being obtained while oscillogram processing. If we
        multiply power value&nbsp; being indicated by the voltmeter and
        the ammeter by duty ratio , it will correspond to a single
        registration of duty ratio, which is described in all textbook
        on power engineering and pulse engineering. In this case, the
        readings of the voltmeter, the ammeter and the oscilloscope will
        exceed the readings of the electric power meter 4.7 fold. It
        does not correspond to reality. It appears from this that when
        average power is determined according to an oscillogram, the
        amplitude values of voltage and current should be divided by
        duty ratio not once as it is mentioned in the textbooks, but
        twice as it is shown in the formula (4). Only such power value
        will correspond to reality. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSION</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        We dare say that it is the first time when the such results
        (Table 3) are published. They will lay a foundation to carrying
        out similar experiments that will result in new pulse
        engineering. Vital parts of all living organisms consume
        electric power by pulses. It is the most saving way of the use
        of electric power. <br>
