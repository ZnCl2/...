          <p style="text-align: left;">A new method is described to
            produce useful electrical energy from DC electrostatic
            fields using a pyramid-shaped capacitor. The system uses no
            moving parts and no mechanical energy is introduced. Also,
            when a pyramid-shaped electrode is charged with DC high
            voltage, a propulsive force is generated. This will allow
            the manufacture of vehicles capable of levitation and

          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </b></p>
          <b> </b>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This invention relates to the
            generation of electrical power by drawing energy from an
            electrostatic potential field. The conversion of DC
            electrostatic energy into useable electrical energy by
            electrostatic generators is already described in the prior
            art as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,013,201, 4,127,804,
            4,151,409 and 4,595,852. Generally, such prior art
            electrostatic generators utilize mechanical energy to
            separate charges and thus contain complex mechanics that is
            difficult to scale up for a high output system. Therefore,
            the present invention aims to provide an electrostatic
            generator in which electrical power is derived exclusively
            from the energy of DC electrostatic fields without the input
            of mechanical power. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b></p>
          <b> </b>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Pursuant to this invention a
            simple technique is described to convert the energy of a DC
            electrostatic field into an alternating current by wrapping
            a coil around the pyramid. The resulting AC current can be
            rectified and used for practical purposes. A pyramid-shaped
            capacitor can also be used in an inverse mode of operation
            for the generation of propulsive force. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Accordingly, one embodiment of
            the present invention is a method for converting DC
            electrostatic energy into usable electrical energy, the
            method comprising the steps of: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(1) providing a capacitor of
            pyramidal shape; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(2) placing an insulated coil on
            the surface of the capacitor, the coil having leads; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(3) attaching a rectifier to the
            leads of the coil, the rectifier having leads; and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(4) attaching a capacitor or a
            battery to the leads of the rectifier so that DC
            electrostatic energy is converted into usable electrical
            energy. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Another embodiment of the present
            invention comprises a method for converting DC electrostatic
            energy into propulsive force comprising the steps of: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(1) providing a first capacitor
            of pyramidal shape; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(2) placing an insulated
            conductive tip on the point of the capacitor; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(3) providing a static generator
            for charging the capacitor, and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(4) attaching 3 ball-shaped
            smaller capacitors to the bottom of the pyramidal-shaped
            capacitor; and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(5) providing means to extend or
            retract the ball-shaped capacitors from the pyramidal-shaped
            capacitor, so DC electrostatic energy is converted into
            propulsive force by the action of the first capacitor and
            the 3 ball-shaped smaller capacitors provide directional
            control. </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
              EMBODIMENT </b></p>
          <b> </b>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Pursuant to this invention, a
            novel method is described to convert DC electrostatic energy
            into an AC current that can be rectified and used for
            practical purposes. The shape of the capacitor and the body
            of such device is designed to convert the DC electrostatic
            energy into the AC current for maximal effect. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A pyramidal or conical shape is
            preferred for one of the capacitor electrodes (FIG. 1). In
            FIG. 1, a detector coil 102 is provided that is in turn
            connected to an oscilloscope 104. The coil surrounds the
            metallic pyramid 100. In the experimental setup shown, the
            field is established between a top plate 106 and the pyramid
            100 by using a ground 108 connected to a source of DC
            electrical energy 110. When a high voltage DC field (30 kV)
            is established on such capacitor, a regularly repeating,
            clocklike signal is detected in the coil placed on the
            pyramid's surface (FIG. 2). This is an unexpected
            observation as corona discharges are irregular by nature. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The alternating current from the
            coil can be rectified and used for practical purposes. If a
            suitable DC electrostatic field could be found in nature,
            this principle would be useful in tapping the energy of such
            field. To test for this possibility, I have measured the
            rectified signal from the coil without an external power
            source. The rectified coil output was collected in a
            capacitor and voltage measured in 1 h intervals. The voltage
            measured is significantly higher if the capacitor electrode
            is pyramid-shaped as opposed to a box-shaped electrode of
            the same height and volume. When the pyramid is placed into
            a Faraday cage, the signal is abolished (see details in the
            Example). The data has demonstrated in principle that with
            this experimental setup electrical energy can be extracted
            from the Earth's electrostatic field. The Earth's surface
            and the ionosphere substitutes for the two charged
            electrodes, which exhibit negative and positive polarities,
            respectively. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Atmospheric electricity manifests
            as a buildup of electrostatic energy, a phenomenon that
            permanently electrifies our environment (Anderson, R. V. in
            Electrical Processes in Atmospheres, H. Holezalek and R.
            Reiter, eds., (Steinkopff, Darmstadt, 1977) pp. 87-99). The
            voltage gradient between the Earth's surface and the
            ionosphere is thought to be maintained by the electrical
            activity of the troposphere as well as the solar
            wind-coupled magnetospheric dynamo (Roble, R. G. Tzur, I. in
            The Earth's Electrical Environment, Studies in Geophysics
            (National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 1986) pp.
            206-231). The Earth's electrostatic field is never depleted,
            despite the constant discharges of energy. There are two
            segments of atmospheric electrical processes that
            potentially could be tapped, fair weather and thunderstorm
            related atmospheric electrical phenomena. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The Earth's voltage field creates
            a potential difference of about 400,000 V (Feynman, R. P.
            Lectures on Physics (Addison Wesley, Inc., Palo Alto,
            Calif., 1964) v.2, Chapter 9), with a voltage gradient of
            about 200-300 V/m around the surface of the Earth (W.
            Gringell, J. M. Rosen, D. I. Hofmann, in The Earth's
            Electrical Environment, Studies in Geophysics (National
            Academy Press, Washington D.C., 1986) pp. 166-182). Given
            this voltage drop of 200-300 V/m, the desired 30 kV
            potential can be obtained at a pyramid height of about
            100-150 m. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Due to the evolving nature of our
            understanding of atmospheric electrical processes, we do not
            have a clear picture of the magnitude of electrical energy
            generated (and dissipated) in the global atmospheric
            electrical circuit by localized convective phenomena. Direct
            measurement of the atmospheric vertical potential difference
            using tethered balloons have shown that under fair weather
            conditions and at low altitudes (150-550 m), short circuit
            currents on the order of 10 .mu.A were obtained with a
            single wire collector yielding a power of about 1 W
            (Holzworth, R. H. et al., Direct measurement of lower
            atmospheric vertical potential differences, Geophys. Res.
            Lett. 8, 783-786 (1981), and Holzworth, R. H. Hy-wire
            measurement of atmospheric potential, J. Geophys. Res. 89,
            1395-1401 (1984)). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">These data remarkably
            demonstrated that it is possible to couple to a large
            portion of the atmosphere and also gave an indirect proof of
            the presence of a fair weather convective generation
            process. Since at a low altitude of 1500 m, the entire
            atmospheric vertical electric potential (400 kV) could be
            bridged, it may even be possible to couple right into
            ionospheric electrical processes (Holzworth, R. H. et al.,
            Direct measurement of lower atmospheric vertical potential
            differences, Geophys. Res. Lett. 8,783-786 (1981)). This
            would significantly expand the available energy pool for
            this device. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The other possibility is to tap
            localized peaks of atmospheric electrical activity arising
            from thunderstorm activity. The approximate order of
            magnitude of electrostatic energy generated in the
            troposphere could be estimated by the amount of energy
            dissipated by lightning discharges. The estimates for the
            total number of lightning strikes over the entire surface of
            the Earth vary from 100 to 300 per second (Orville, R. E. in
            The Earth's Electrical Environment, Studies in Geophysics
            (National Academy Press. Washington D.C., 1986) pp. 23-29).
            The estimate for the power discharged in an average
            lightning event is 10.sup.12 watts over a time period of
            about 0.2 sec (Christian, H. J. and McCook, M. A. in A
            lightning primer at http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/). This
            yields a total of 2-6.times.10.sup.13 W-sec of electrical
            energy spent by lightning discharges globally in each
            second, or approximately 4.times.10.sup.17 W-h per year.
            Over 90% of all lightning occur over landmasses. The
            distribution of tropospheric electrical activity is highly
            concentrated, the major production zones being Central
            Africa, the south central United States and the Amazon Basin
            (Miller, T. L. Global lighting activity at
            http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/rotating/otd_oval_full.html).
            This suggests that the density of atmospheric electrical
            activity in these zones may be high enough to tap. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The current annual global
            electricity production by the world's power generating
            industry is 1,22.times.10.sup.16 W-h (Seth, A. Nuclear power
            and its role in global electricity and energy, Institute for
            Energy and Environmental Research, at
            http://www.ieer.org/ensec/no-1/glbnrg.html (1997)) which is
            only a small fraction, about 1/30th, of the electricity
            generated and discharged naturally by lightning activity. As
            lightning represents only peak charge density events, the
            localized total charge production of thunderstorms is
            necessarily underestimated by a factor, the magnitude of
            which is still unknown. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">These indicate that atmospheric
            electricity, if harnessed, could meet all the energy needs
            of mankind. This invention describes a new electrical
            phenomenon that allows the conversion of electrostatic
            energy into an alternating current. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Research on the average
            electrical power generated and dissipated by the Earth's
            global electrical circuit suggests that about 2000
            thunderstorms are in progress at any given time, and that
            the average storm current delivered to the ionosphere is of
            the order of one ampere (Roble, R. G. Tzur, I. in The
            Earth's Electrical Environment, Studies in Geophysics
            (National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 1986) pp.
            206-231). The potential difference between the Earth and the
            ionosphere is of the order of 500 kV; therefore, the total
            source power is of the order
            2000.times.1.times.5.times.10.sup.5, or 10.sub.9 watts over
            the entire planet. Thunderstorms produce an average of one
            to several nanoamperes per square meter at the surface
            (Standler, R. B. and Winn, W. P. Quart. J. Met. Soc. 105 285
            (1979)). These estimates would suggest that there might not
            be sufficient energy to tap. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">However, the limitation of these
            low, average Earth surface current densities is not
            applicable to the pyramid collector for several reasons. In
            thunderstorms, terawatts of electrical power are generated
            over relatively long periods of time. To capture this
            electric power and prevent its dissipation, an effective
            "charge sink" is necessary. The sub-optimal geometry of the
            Earth's surface terrain and its relatively low conductivity
            produce an ineffective sink which leads to small ground
            surface current densities. A metal pyramid, however, due to
            its optimal geometry and construction acts as an effective
            charge sink. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">FIG. 3 shows power transmission
            on the pyramid setup. In FIG. 3, a pyramid 200 as described
            above is in contact with a coil 202 and a bridge rectifier
            204. The latter is charging capacitor 206 which feeds load
            208. Oscilloscope 210 measures the voltage drop on the load.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Accordingly, one embodiment of
            the invention is a method for converting DC electrostatic
            energy into usable electrical energy, the method comprising
            the steps of: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(1) providing a capacitor of
            pyramidal shape; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(2) placing an insulated coil on
            the surface of the capacitor, the coil having leads; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(3) attaching a rectifier to the
            leads of the coil, the rectifier having leads; and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(4) attaching a capacitor or a
            battery to the leads of the rectifier so that DC
            electrostatic energy is converted into usable electrical
            energy. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">As detailed below, typically, a
            clock-like signal is detected from the leads of the coil.
            The signal can be rectified, pooled in a capacitor, or
            pooled in a battery. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A production pyramid, with a
            projected 40,000 m.sup.2 base surface area, a height of 150
            m, and a metallic composition would provide a far more
            effective charge sink than the surrounding ground surface.
            As current always flows in the direction of least
            resistance, this would lead to a concentrated flow of
            current from the thunderclouds into the pyramid. As a
            result, a column of air above the surface of the pyramid
            would become highly ionized and much more conductive than
            the air in the surrounding area. This would ensure a rapid
            transfer of charges from the thunderclouds into the pyramid.
            Therefore, the current flowing into the pyramid would likely
            be very strong. As a result, lightning activity could be
            reduced or abolished. In addition, since the threshold
            effect causes exponential power amplification, such a
            pyramid could produce very large quantities of electrical
            energy. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The generation of
            thunderstorm-related electrical energy in the atmosphere
            shows a high degree of concentration into three major
            geographical zones (Miller, T. L. Global lightning activity
            at
            http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/rotating/otd_oval_full.html).
            By placing energy-producing pyramids into these zones of
            high-energy electrical activity, vast quantities of
            electricity could be obtained. Atmospheric electricity would
            be a renewable, clean energy source, and could give us the
            opportunity to begin reversing the process of global warming
            caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This
            process, which now produces well-measurable results,
            threatens to upset our ecosystem with unpredictable
            consequences (Kerr, R. A. Science 286 1828 (1999)). </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Electrostatic energy could also
            be used to produce a propulsive force. A capacitor made into
            the shape of a pyramid or cone is suitable. The conductive
            elements of the capacitor are layered into the pyramidal or
            conical segment of the hull of such craft. Optimally, there
            should be several layers of negatively charged conductors on
            the outside while a single layer of positively charged
            conductor is in the inside of the craft. All conductive
            elements should be carefully insulated in order to maintain
            the charges inside the capacitor. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In the center of the craft, a
            conductive, insulated pole is mounted such that the pole
            extends out into the exterior at the top of the craft. The
            tip of that pole has a metal ball mounted on which is also
            positively charged. When all capacitor plates are charged, a
            pressure differential is induced and above the craft the
            pressure will be higher than at the bottom of the craft.
            This pressure differential is unstable and progresses
            towards an equilibrium. It will propel the craft forward in
            order to eliminate the pressure gradient. This requires that
            a sufficiently high voltage (&gt;100,000 V) be applied. The
            capacitors incorporated into the hull will give control over
            the lift. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">To obtain directional control
            over all three axes of movement, three capacitors need to be
            mounted at the bottom of the craft placed 120.degree. apart
            from each other. These capacitors could take the shape of a
            ball and would be mounted on retractable shafts. The top
            half of the capacitors would be positively charged while the
            bottom half is negatively charged. When in flight, the
            capacitors are retracted and charged based on the needs of
            directional control so that the ball-shaped capacitors
            provide lateral movement control for the vehicle. To achieve
            forward movement, the charges on one capacitor facing the
            direction of the desired path should be reduced relative to
            the other two capacitors. This would make the craft tilt
            forward and start moving in that direction. An alternative
            method of lateral directional control could be obtained by
            dividing the capacitor bank inside the hull into segments
            which segments would be charged individually. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Upon landing, the three ball
            capacitors would be protracted on their shafts and serve as
            landing gear. On landing, they would be discharged because
            the earth is the greater ground. On launching, the main
            capacitors of the hull would be activated leading to
            takeoff. The three-capacitor landing gear would then be
            retracted and charged up so that they can function for
            lateral directional control after takeoff. On-board static
            generators would supply voltage required for the operation
            of the craft. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Accordingly, another embodiment
            of the invention comprises a method for converting DC
            electrostatic energy into propulsive force comprising the
            steps of: </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(1) providing a first capacitor
            of pyramidal shape; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(2) placing an insulated
            conductive tip on the point of the capacitor; </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(3) providing a static generator
            for charging the capacitor, and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(4) attaching 3 ball-shaped
            smaller capacitors to the bottom of the pyramidal-shaped
            capacitor; and </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">(5) providing means to extend or
            retract the ball-shaped capacitors from the pyramidal-shaped
            capacitor, so DC electrostatic energy is converted into
            propulsive force by the action of the first capacitor and
            the 3 ball-shaped smaller capacitors provide directional
            control. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Inertial forces pose great
            obstacles to improving the performance of current propulsion
            systems. The most significant aspect of this type of
            propulsion would be the loss of inertia during acceleration.
            The passengers of such craft would feel no forces acting
            upon their bodies even if the craft achieved enormous
            accelerations. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This overall design is suitable
            for the development of a wide range of transportation
            vehicles, from automobile-type to aircraft and potentially
            to spacecraft. With such technology, we could eliminate a
            major factor in environmental pollution which place a great
            stress on our ecosystem. In the United States,
            transportation vehicles produce 66% of the greenhouse gases.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The subject invention offers a
            solution by providing a renewable, non-polluting electricity
            generation method as well as an electricity-based
            transportation method capable of levitation and flight. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The following Example illustrates
            the features and advantages of the subject invention.
            Accordingly, it is to be understood that the description in
            this disclosure is to facilitate comprehension of the
            invention and should not be construed to limit the scope
            thereof as persons skilled in the art can, in light of this
            disclosure, generate additional embodiments without
            exceeding the scope or departing from the spirit of the
            claimed invention. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>EXAMPLE 1 </b></p>
          <b> </b>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Demonstration of the pyramid
            generator: For the experiments, I have selected a one-foot
            base length foam pyramid from a pyramid vendor (The Pyramid
            Project, Ft. Wayne, Ind.). The outside of the pyramid was
            covered with aluminum foil. The pyramid was placed on a
            2'.times.2'insulating polyethylene platform equipped with an
            adjustable height 2'.times.2'size aluminum top plate, 1/16"
            thick. The height of the aluminum plate was adjusted as
            needed and a gap of 1 1/4" between the plate and the tip of
            the pyramid was used in the experiments. In some
            experiments, an aluminum pyramid was used with a wall
            thickness of 1/16". </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">A high voltage (HV) CRT power
            source producing 30 kV DC was taken from a color monitor. I
            have assumed that an actual energy-producing pyramid should
            be relatively high in order to obtain a large voltage drop
            from its tip to the ground. Therefore, assuming a height of
            100-150 m for a life-size pyramid and a voltage drop of
            200-300 V/m near the surface of the Earth, the 30 kV is in
            the range of the voltage-drop expected for the height of a
            life size pyramid. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The positive pole was attached to
            the top aluminum plate. This simulated the positive charge
            of the atmosphere. One corner of the pyramid was attached to
            the negative pole of the high voltage power source, while
            the opposite corner of the pyramid was grounded. This setup
            served as a model for the electrostatic field distribution
            around a potential life-sized pyramid. As controls, either a
            1'.times.1' sheet of aluminum foil or an aluminum
            foil-covered box, having the main dimensions of the test
            pyramid (1'.times.1'.times.7 5/8"), was used as a negative
            pole. The detector coils were made by winding up a 24 gauge
            enamel-coated magnet wire (20 turns, approximately 8 cm in
            diameter). A Tektronix high-frequency oscilloscope, Model
            no. 2236 was used for signal acquisition and analysis. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The first sets of experiments
            were control measurements with a box of the same height and
            base length as the test pyramid. The detector coil was
            placed on the top of the box. Measurements were taken with
            or without the high voltage applied. One corner of the box
            was attached to the HV power source (negative pole) and the
            opposite corner to the ground. The same arrangement was used
            for the flat square (1'.times.1') foil. The peak-to-peak
            signal amplitude for the box was 8 mV and the signal
            frequency was 2 MHz. For the flat foil sheet, the signal
            amplitude was 12 mV with a frequency of 1.43 MHz. The signal
            form was of a decaying sine wave. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">When high voltage was applied to
            these shapes, signal amplitude of 14 mV was obtained for the
            flat sheet and of 16 mV for the box. The signal frequency
            was 1.54 MHz for the flat sheet and 2 MHz for the box. The
            waveforms were of decaying sine waves in all these
            experiments. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">When the pyramid was tested
            without HV, the peak-to-peak signal amplitude was measured
            at 60 mV with a frequency of 2 MHz. When the high voltage
            was applied, the signal amplitude increased up to 180-200
            mV, while the frequency remained at 2 MHz. The pyramid
            produced signal intensity significantly higher than the
            controls. The signal is regularly repeating, clock-like in
            nature (FIG. 2). When a metal (aluminum) pyramid of the same
            size (wall thickness 1/16" inch) was tested in the same high
            voltage field using the same detection coil, a voltage of
            1-1.5 V was detected at the frequency of 2 MHz. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">To collect energy from the coil,
            a bridge rectifier (1000 V peak voltage at 6 A) was attached
            to the leads of the coil. The rectified current was fed into
            a capacitor (1500 .mu.F, 250 V DC max.), and a direct
            current of 45 V was obtained. This has demonstrated a simple
            method to convert electrostatic energy into a continuous
            direct current. An 8-turn coil having an output of 200-300 V
            AC (peak-to-peak) was also used for energy conversion. The
            rectified current from the 8-turn coil powered a 0.186 W
            light bulb (FIG. 3). The bridge rectifier is optimally made
            of fast-recovery diodes. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Even in the absence of an
            externally applied voltage, current is always present in the
            circuit. Charge builds up in the capacitor and 1 V was
            obtained overnight using the 20-turn coil setup. Over 48 h,
            a voltage of 5 V was measured. Faraday shielding practically
            abolished the phenomenon. </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The preferred shape of the
            pyramid as a charge collector was again demonstrated in
            further experiments using the 8-turn coil-bridge
            rectifier-capacitor (1,500 .mu.F) assembly placed on the 1
            ft base length aluminum pyramid. A same volume and height
            aluminum box was used as control. Charging times of 1-2 h
            were used under fair weather conditions. For the pyramid,
            550 mV was measured on the capacitor while on the box 100 mV
            was obtained. This demonstrated the superiority of the
            pyramidal shape in capturing atmospheric electrostatic
            energy. It also demonstrated that we could tap into the
            electrostatic field of the atmosphere and draw electric
            energy. For the collection of energy, a battery could
            substitute for the capacitor.<br>

            </b><br>
            A pyramid electric generator for harvesting the vibrational
            energies of Earth's atomic oscillators according to the
            present invention comprises: (1) an antenna/waveguide that
            is geometrically optimized; (2) a coil wound with an
            insulated conductor on a nonconductive coil form, the coil
            being connected at its top lead to the conducting surface of
            the antenna/waveguide such that the coil is connected near

            <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0002] This invention relates to the generation of
            electrical power by drawing energy from Earth's electric
            field. Earth represents a resonant system in which both
            atmospheric and telluric electrical processes can be
            harvested. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,974,110, we have provided an
            apparatus and method for converting the electrostatic
            potential energy of Earth's atmosphere into usable power.
            The present invention aims to provide an electric generator
            that, in addition to tapping atmospheric electric processes,
            extracts electrical power from the vibrational energy of
            atomic oscillators by a novel resonant coupling method.<br>
            <br>

            <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0022] One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for
            capturing atmospheric and telluric electric energies,
            comprising:<br>
            <br>
            [0023] (1) an antenna/waveguide that is geometrically
            optimized having a conducting surface; and<br>
            <br>
            [0024] (2) a coil wound with an insulated conductor over a
            non-conductive coil form, the coil being connected to an AC
            or AC-DC driver at its bottom lead and, by its top lead to
            the conducting surface of the antenna/waveguide near the
            point where the electric field contacts the
            antenna/waveguide, with the antenna/waveguide serving as a
            quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific
            resonant frequency;<br>
            <br>
            [0000] wherein the generator absorbs impulses from Earth's
            electric oscillations; and<br>
            wherein the attracted energy manifests as high voltage
            sinusoidal waveform in the coil, representing harvested
            electrical energy of atomic oscillators and measurable on
            the leads of the coil.<br>
            <br>
            [0025] Typically, the electric generator stimulates and
            attracts the electric emissions of atomic oscillators by the
            use of high voltage. Typically, the antenna/waveguide is
            designed based on functions of phi and/or pi.<br>
            <br>
            [0026] In one alternative, the antenna/waveguide is placed
            on an insulated base.<br>
            <br>
            [0027] Typically, the antenna/waveguide is at a high voltage
            during the operation of the generator. Typically, the
            antenna/waveguide voltage is measured by using an E-field
            antenna.<br>
            <br>
            [0028] The antenna/waveguide can be connected to an
            oscillator. The oscillator can be a resonant step-up
            transformer.<br>
            <br>
            [0029] Preferably, the antenna/waveguide is of pyramidal
            shape. Preferably, the antenna/waveguide exhibits functions
            of phi and/or pi. However, any geometric form employing
            these functions can be used for the antenna/waveguide. When
            it is of pyramidal shape, the primary (apex) coil is
            preferably connected near or at the apex of the
            antenna/waveguide. The shape and size of the
            antenna/waveguide can be optimized depending on the intended
            use of the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0030] Typically, the generator further comprises an
            insulating base on which the antenna/waveguide is placed.
            The size and shape of the insulating base can also be
            optimized, depending on the intended use of the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0031] Typically, the output of the apex
            coil-antenna/waveguide series resonant circuit or that of
            the secondary coil is harvested. One way to do this is by
            connecting to a step-down transformer and
            rectifier-capacitor-load resistance. The optimal circuit can
            be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to optimize
            power extraction. The load draws power from the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0032] The driver can supply AC or a combination of AC-DC
            power to activate the resonant circuit.<br>
            <br>
            [0033] Typically, the antenna/waveguide is positioned in the
            general North-South direction. In this arrangement, when the
            antenna/waveguide is of pyramidal shape, the height of the
            pyramid can vary from about 0.1 m to about 1000 m. The
            optimal pyramid size is a function of the power
            requirements. However, a pyramid can be built as high as 1
            km in height. The base surface area of the pyramid may range
            from about 0.01 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 1,000,000 m&lt;2&gt;.
            Naturally, other heights and base surface areas or shapes
            can be used for particular applications. The numbers of
            sides can also vary. When the pyramid is small (e.g., the
            6.26 feet base length described in this application), there
            is an insufficient atmospheric potential gradient on its
            apex to trigger the attraction of energy. In such event, a
            driver is necessary to bring the pyramid to the electric
            potential necessary for its harvesting function.<br>
            <br>
            [0034] Another embodiment of the present invention is an
            electric generator for harvesting the energies of atomic
            oscillators comprising:<br>
            <br>
            [0035] (1) an antenna/waveguide that is geometrically
            optimized having a conducting surface; and<br>
            <br>
            [0036] (2) a primary (apex) coil wound with an insulated
            conductor over a non-conductive coil form, the coil being
            connected to an AC or AC-DC driver at its bottom lead and,
            by its top lead to the conducting surface of the
            antenna/waveguide near the point where the electric field
            contacts the antenna/waveguide, and the antenna/waveguide
            serving as a quasi-capacitive series element to provide a
            specific resonant frequency; and<br>
            <br>
            [0037] (3) a secondary coil of smaller diameter than the
            primary (apex) coil having a greater number of turns than
            the primary coil, the secondary coil being positioned
            coaxially within the primary coil and acting as a resonant
            step-up transformer winding inductively coupled with the
            apex coil;<br>
            <br>
            [0000] wherein the generator absorbs impulses from Earth's
            electric oscillations; and<br>
            wherein the attracted energy manifests as high voltage
            sinusoidal waveforms in the secondary coil, representing
            harvested electrical energy of atomic oscillators and
            measurable on the leads of the secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            [0038] In this embodiment, more than one resonant step-up
            transformer winding can be used. As described above for the
            first embodiment, in this embodiment, the electric generator
            stimulates and attracts the electric emissions of atomic
            oscillators by the use of high voltage. Typically, in this
            embodiment, the antenna/waveguide is designed based on
            functions of phi and/or pi. In one alternative, in this
            embodiment, the antenna/waveguide is placed on an insulated
            base. Typically, in this embodiment, the generator further
            comprises an insulating base on which the antenna/waveguide
            is placed. Typically, in this embodiment, antenna/waveguide
            is at a high voltage during the operation of the generator.
            Typically, in this embodiment, the antenna/waveguide voltage
            is measured by using an E-field antenna. In this embodiment,
            the antenna/waveguide can be connected to an oscillator. The
            oscillator can be a resonant step-up transformer.
            Preferably, in this embodiment, the antenna/waveguide is of
            pyramidal shape. Preferably, in this embodiment, the
            antenna/waveguide exhibits functions of phi and/or pi.
            Typically, in this embodiment, the antenna/waveguide is
            positioned in the general North-South direction. In this
            embodiment, in this arrangement, when the antenna/waveguide
            is of pyramidal shape, the height of the pyramid can vary
            from about 0.1 m to about 1000 m. The optimal pyramid size
            is a function of the power requirements. However, a pyramid
            can be built as high as 1 km in height. In this embodiment,
            the base surface area of the pyramid may range from about
            0.01 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 1,000,000 m&lt;2&gt;.<br>
            <br>
            [0039] In this embodiment, typically, the primary (apex)
            coil of the resonant transformer is connected near the point
            where the electric field contacts the antenna/waveguide.<br>
            <br>
            [0040] In this embodiment, typically, the bottom lead of the
            secondary coil is connected to ground. In this embodiment,
            typically, the primary (apex) coil is inductively coupled to
            the secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            [0041] In this embodiment, typically, the output of the
            secondary coil is connected to a load for drawing power from
            the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0042] Another embodiment of the present invention is an
            electric generator for harvesting the electric emissions of
            atomic oscillations comprising an oscillator.<br>
            <br>
            [0043] In this embodiment, typically, the oscillator
            operates in the LF or ELF bands.<br>
            <br>
            [0044] Typically, in this embodiment, the electric generator
            comprises:<br>
            <br>
            [0045] (1) a primary (apex) coil wound with a conductor over
            a secondary coil, the primary (apex) coil being connected

            primary coil having a greater number of turns than the
            primary coil, the secondary coil being positioned coaxially
            within the first coil and acting as a resonant step-up
            transformer winding inductively coupled with the primary;<br>
            <br>
            [0000] wherein said resonant step-up transformer's output
            voltage exceeds 500 VRMS;<br>
            wherein the electric generator attracts impulses from
            Earth's electric oscillations;<br>
            and wherein the attracted energy manifests as high voltage
            sinusoidal waveforms representing harvested electric energy
            of atomic oscillations in the secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            [0047] In this embodiment, typically, the output of the
            secondary coil is connected to a load for drawing power from
            the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0048] Another aspect of the invention is a method of
            tapping Earth's electric energy based on the following
            concepts:<br>
            <br>
            [0049] (1) utilizing a pyramidal antenna/waveguide designed
            based on the functions of phi and/or pi;<br>
            <br>
            [0050] (2) using the antenna/waveguide to absorb and focus
            specific frequencies of Earth's electric field;<br>

            [0051] (3) positioning a coil(s) connected to the pyramidal
            antenna/waveguide near or at its apex according to the
            present invention; and<br>

            [0052] (4) generating a high-voltage sinusoidal signal,
            representing harvested atmospheric and telluric electrical
            energy, by the operation of the system.<br>
            <br>
            [0053] Typically, the harvested electric energy can be fed
            into a power grid for distribution, but smaller units
            capable of distributed power generation or for use as
            stand-alone generators are also feasible by the concept of
            this invention.<br>
            <br>
            [0054] In this aspect, the method typically comprises a
            method of tapping Earth's electric oscillatory energies
            comprising the steps of:<br>
            <br>
            [0055] (1) positioning an electric generator according to
            the present invention as described above such that it is
            exposed to Earth's electric oscillations; and<br>
            <br>
            [0056] (2) generating a sinusoidal voltage signal
            representing harvested electric energy of atomic oscillators
            by the operation of the generator.<br>
            <br>
            [0057] The invention is described by the following Example.
            This Example is included for illustrative purposes only and
            is not intended to limit the invention.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Example</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0058] We have introduced a new theory of space, energy and
            matter that predicted that electromagnetic interaction
            propagates through a carrier medium called the space lattice
            that is made up of pulsating, phi-based spiral vortices
            (STAR), the excitation of which generates propagating
            sinusoidal lines of force across the space lattice recorded
            as electromagnetic waves by our instruments [1,2]. We have
            also predicted that natural pressure gradients exist within
            the space lattice that can be used for power generation by
            inserting a capacitor into such gradient. Furthermore, we
            proposed that a pyramid-shaped capacitor is an optimally
            shaped device for tapping the energy gradient of the space
            lattice that manifests in the form of an electrical
            potential gradient in Earth's atmosphere. This was
            subsequently demonstrated [3-5]. We also found that the
            pyramid-shaped capacitor design should be based on functions
            of phi and/or pi [5] because electrical energy propagates
            along a phi-based spiral [6].<br>
            <br>
            [0059] We suggested that elemental particles are composed of
            STAR oscillators that make up the space lattice by
            electromagnetic compression of its elemental cubes into
            pulsating conical/vortexual subunits that form the basis for
            all particles of matter [1,2]. We proposed that atomic and
            subatomic oscillators could vibrate in a very wide frequency
            range from sub-acoustic to extremely high EM frequencies
            [1,2]. This does not mean that material bodies can take or
            maintain a physical form at any energy level, but this
            allows the recycling of atoms into the space lattice as part
            of their natural evolution [2,6].<br>
            <br>
            [0060] Atomic oscillators are constantly in motion, and such
            motion is electric because all motion and energy is
            fundamentally electric [2,6]. It is known that atomic bodies
            constantly exchange electric energy. Such energy flow can be
            harvested when the spiral physical nature of electric waves
            is recognized. Russell observed that energy moves during its
            generative cycle in spirals towards the higher potential
            [7]; therefore, we reasoned that an "attractor" of high
            electric potential must be provided to pull in the random
            electromagnetic emissions of atomic oscillators. The
            "attractor" must function as a phi-based antenna/waveguide
            to focus the phi-based electric emissions of atomic bodies
            into the apex of a vortex, the same method Nature uses for
            power multiplication [6,7]. Therefore, a phi-based pyramidal
            antenna/waveguide must be at a high voltage in order to
            perform its attractor function.<br>
            <br>
            [0061] To achieve this goal, a geometrically optimized
            pyramidal antenna/waveguide must be connected to an
            oscillator that operates at a high voltage and is tuned to a
            suitably selected frequency.<br>
            <br>
            [0062] The appropriate resonant frequency is dictated by
            practical considerations. Atomic oscillators can vibrate in
            a very wide frequency range [1, 2, 7, 8] but short
            wavelength radiations are readily re-absorbed by atoms and
            are rapidly attenuated; therefore, long wavelength
            electromagnetic emissions should be targeted. The operation
            of the pyramid generator is most practical in the ELF to the
            LF range. As electric radiation propagates in a vortex
            [2,7,8], the emitted electric vortex over the pyramidal
            antenna (FIG. 1) increases its "size," and so it is capable
            of funneling atmospheric electromagnetic emissions of the
            same frequency back into the antenna/receiver. Thus, the
            pyramid electric generator could capture the energy emitted
            by both telluric and atmospheric atomic oscillators. We have
            tested these assumptions and demonstrated the basic
            principles of an electric generator.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Methods and Results</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0063] In our previous paper, we reported on a
            pyramid-shaped capacitor/antenna connected in series to a
            coil that form a resonant circuit for harvesting an expanded
            range of atmospheric and telluric electric energies [6]. As
            the signals in the pyramid energy harvester system are at
            extremely high voltages, we have developed a measurement and
            control system that allows secure remote transmission of
            test signals with great accuracy while removing all the
            hazards associated with direct connection of ultra-high
            voltages (over 50 kV AC) to the measurement and data-logging
            system. The voltage and current signals measured across a
            resistor are turned into a proportional electronic signal,
            which is then fed to a light emitting diode (opto
            transmitter) and sent through an optical cable to the
            instrumentation part of the system where it is converted
            back by an opto receiver module into an electronic signal
            for acquisition and processing by the National Instrument
            PXI 1042Q controller programmed with Labview 6. An
            ENI-1140LA amplifier was used to activate the oscillator at
            the resonant frequency.<br>
            <br>
            [0064] For the experiments, we used a novel tetrahedral
            pyramid-shaped antenna/waveguide that expressed the golden
            mean in its ratios. The base length of the pyramidal antenna
            was 6.26 feet. The pyramid was built of a wooden frame and
            covered with 26 AWG triangular copper sheets on its sides
            that were electrically connected. It was placed on an
            insulating base and positioned in the general North-South
            direction.<br>
            <br>
            [0065] The apex coil was wound on a HDPE cylindrical coil
            form using a 14 AWG insulated magnet wire with a
            monofilament spacer polyester twine (0.05'' diameter)
            between the turns, and connected to the conducting surface
            of the pyramid near its apex. Thus, the apex coil is
            connected to the pyramidal antenna/waveguide acting as a
            quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific
            resonant frequency by coupling to the ambient
            electromagnetic environment. The bottom lead of the apex
            coil was connected to a driver and grounded via the driver
            (FIG. 2). The purpose of the monofilament spacer is to
            reduce interwinding capacitance in the apex coil by
            increasing distance between wire turns of the coil.<br>
            <br>
            [0066] The parameters of the apex coil are shown in Table 1.<br>
            <br>

            [0067] In the experiment, the controlled variable was the
            voltage, which was increased in steps by the controller
            until a maximum voltage in the system (permitted by circuit
            components and test equipment) was achieved for the given
            resonant frequency. The objective was to "drive the
            atmosphere and ground" by radiating a high voltage (~200 kV
            p-p), LF (~70 kHz) signal fed by a powerful signal generator
            at a resonant frequency determined by the pyramid as a
            quasi-capacitive series element connected to the apex coil
            and radiating to the local atmosphere and the ground.<br>
            <br>
            [0068] The experimental data are shown in Table 2. An
            apparent power gain of nearly 170-fold was achieved in the
            resonant circuit relative to input power from the driver.<br>

            [0069] A load may be connected to the system to draw power
            from it. The load may also be connected via a secondary coil
            inductively coupled to the apex coil. The load may be a
            resistor, a rectifier or storage capacitor powering a DC
            load. The high voltage, high frequency output can also be
            converted to the frequency and voltage of standard mains
            power.<br>
            <br>
            [0070] A graphic representation of the system is shown in
            FIG. 2. The pyramidal antenna/waveguide, placed on an
            insulating base, is coupled to the ambient electromagnetic
            environment and serves as an antenna/waveguide for the
            harvesting of atmospheric and telluric electromagnetic
            oscillations at resonance frequency (FIG. 1). The
            atmospheric electric vortex possibly acts as an ionic
            antenna pulling in EM radiations from a large atmospheric
            domain.<br>
            <br>
            [0071] The pyramid's apex is connected to a coil of high
            turn number (FIG. 2). This apex coil wound on a
            nonconductive coil form forms a resonant circuit with the
            pyramid that acts as a quasi-capacitive series element. An
            RF power amplifier activates the apex coil. The measurement
            points are also indicated, displaying the positions of
            voltage and current sense resistors and opto-electric
            transmitters. A detailed description of the system follows
            in FIG. 2.<br>
            <br>
            [0072] The source of radiative and electromagnetic power to
            earth is the Sun 1, which is harvested by effect of pyramid
            operations. Solar radiation is separated into light, heat,
            electromagnetic waves 2 by interaction with atmosphere,
            magnetosphere, ionosphere. "Electrosphere" 3 comprises of
            ionized, highly conductive air. It can be understood as a
            conductive spherical band about 60 mi above the surface of
            the earth. Virtual "Ground" 4 in electrosphere-a low
            impedance spherical area that in the circuit may be
            considered as a "ground" (for non-harvesting calculations)
            or a variable circuit source (for harvesting calculations).
            Effective resistive impedance 5 is from pyramid surface to
            "sky" or "electrosphere" (radiative impedance). Effective
            capacitive impedance 6 is from pyramid surface to "sky" or
            "electrosphere". Effective resistive (conductive) impedance
            7 is from pyramid external surface to nearby atmosphere due
            to "corona" type ionic conduction through ionized air,
            caused by high peak voltages on the pyramid's surface.
            Conductive pyramidal transducer/energy harvester 8 is
            coupled to the ambient electromagnetic environment as above.
            Radiated "near field" electromagnetic field 9 from pyramid
            surface (toward "sky") is measured by E-field antenna 10.
            The antenna does indirect measurement of pyramid surface
            voltage based on E-field pick-up of alternating current
            field within ~20 ft of pyramid surface, at a particular
            fixed distance and orientation. Impedance-matching resistor
            11 couples E-field antenna to coaxial cable and
            impedance-matching capacitor 12 for coupling E-field antenna
            to coaxial cable. Coaxial cable 13 connects to measurement
            system interface with a "BNC" connector 14 to provide
            electrical interface to measurement system. System "ground"
            (common connection point) 15 is for measurement/control
            system components. Switch 16 is for disconnection of
            pyramid/antenna from pyramid driving electronics. Radiative
            "cone" 17 emits from inside and bottom surface of pyramid
            towards "ground" underneath the pyramid harvester system.
            Radiated E-M field 18 is directed from pyramid to ground
            surface directly underneath. Resistive impedance 19 of
            radiated E-M field ("virtual" component) is derived from
            measurement and calculation of E-M field model to ground
            area. Capacitive impedance 20 of radiated E-M field to
            "ground" area is a "virtual component" derived from
            measurement and calculation of E-M field model. Virtual
            resistance of radiated energy 21 from bottom of pyramid, is
            conducted through earth to "firm ground" potential (another
            "virtual component" derived from measurement and
            calculation). Pyramid ground 52 is an equipotential
            "zero-impedance" point in the earth which serves as the
            ground reference for both conducted (from pyramid ground
            stake 52) and radiated 18, 19, 20, 21 energy underneath the
            pyramid harvester device. In a non-harvesting model this
            ground point is always at zero potential. However, in an
            energy-harvesting model the point 22 serves as an AC voltage
            source, sending conducted energy back into the pyramid
            system through all the components that "drain" to it in the
            non-harvesting model. Sense resistor 23 for apex current
            monitor in pyramid energizing system is a low value resistor
            (typically 0.05 to 0.2 ohms) that allows a small voltage to
            develop, proportional to the current flowing to the pyramid
            apex from the energizing system. Apex current monitor opto
            transmitter 24 measures the voltage across resistor 23 and
            turns it into a proportional electronic signal, which is
            then fed to a light emitting diode and transmitted through
            an optical cable to the instrumentation part of the system.
            All the signals in the pyramid harvester system are at
            extremely high voltages, and the optical cable allows secure
            remote transmission of these signals to the measurement and
            data-logging system (not shown on this diagram). Resistance
            25 of the apex excitation coil 26 is measured at DC. This is
            a "virtual" component, since the resistance is in the coil
            itself, and is not a separate component. Apex coil 26
            translates the stimulation power signal from amplifiers 34,
            35 into a very high voltage at the resonant frequency
            established by the coil and intrinsic capacitance of the
            pyramid. Mutual inductance coupling exists between the apex
            coil and the harvest or secondary coil 27. This is another
            "virtual component" consisting of the electromagnetic signal
            coupling between the two coils based on many different
            factors. Optional resistor 28 can be used for resonance or
            phase tuning of pyramid network. The main resonance is
            determined by apex coil 26 inductance and pyramid lumped
            capacitive element 8. However, this will make the voltage at
            the junction of the pyramid (capacitor) and the apex coil 26
            approximately 90 degrees out of phase with the current. One
            approach to reduce the phase angle and also to possibly tune
            the resonant frequency and the Q of the circuit is to insert
            an additional reactive element 29 in parallel into the apex
            coil 26. The apex coil winding resistance is expressed here
            as resistor 25 in series with inductor 26. The inserted
            element is an additional optional capacitor 29 in parallel
            with the apex coil. This capacitor develops an independent
            L-C resonant circuit, besides the L-C resonant circuit of
            the apex coil and pyramid. An anticipated function if used
            in the circuit would be to lower the resonant frequency.
            Drive current monitor current sense resistor 30 is for drive
            current opto transmitter 31. Summing/protection resistors
            are placed in series with 32 drive 1 and 33 drive 2. Power
            amplifiers 34, 35 drive coil/pyramid resonant system. Power
            (drive) amplifier signal input 36 is fed through opto
            receiver 37. The signal in the optical cable 38 is from the
            National Instruments control system for control of power
            amplifiers. Pyramid system ground (star-ground) connects to
            top of pyramid ground stake, after ground stake disconnect
            switches 39 and 50. Power supply 40 is for pyramid driver
            amplifier. Resistor 41 is used for voltage measurement
            across power driver higher value terminals. Opto transmitter
            42 is for voltage measurement across power amplifier and
            includes drawing of optical cable to measurement system.
            Current-sensing resistor 43 is for current measurement from
            pyramid amplifiers to ground post. Opto transmitter 44 is
            for transmitting ground current to control and measurement
            system. Voltage sense resistor 45 is between pyramid ground
            stake 52 and remote ground stake 55 (100 kohm-1 Mohm). Opto
            transmitter 46 is for voltage sense from pyramid ground 52
            to remote ground 55. Current sense resistor 47 from pyramid
            ground to remote ground is for opto transmitter 48. When
            used, this closes switch 49B to short out the voltage
            measurement 45 and also short out the intrinsic ground
            impedance 58 between pyramid ground and remote ground
            stakes. Ground post disconnect switch 49 is below the system
            star ground stake and is very dangerous when open. Main
            connection point for pyramid system is the star ground
            terminal 50. Ground surface 51 is on which pyramid system is
            placed. Ground stake 52 for pyramid system is a 1'' diameter
            copper rod, 8-12 ft deep. R absolute 53 is between ground
            stake and earth integrated from ground stake theoretically
            through entire earth. "Absolute ground" is located under
            pyramid and ground stake 54. Remote ground stake 55 is about
            200 feet away from pyramid system and is used as remote
            reference ground although a real remote ground would likely
            be much further away. R absolute 56 is from remote ground
            stake to absolute ground under remote stakes 57. Ground
            impedance 58 between 52 and 55 stakes appears mostly
            resistive and is about 28-30 ohms based on AC measurements
            at 1 KHz. The remote ground setup is not required for the
            operation of the system but provides test data.
            Harvest/secondary coil 59 is an inductor wound with 3 to 6
            times as many turns as the apex coil, and connected to it by
            mutual inductance 27. Current sense resistor 60 is placed on
            top lead of harvest coil. Opto transmitter 61 is for top
            harvest coil current. Voltage sense resistor 62 that
            measures voltage across harvest coil is for opto transmitter
            63. Load resistor 64 is for secondary/harvest coil and the
            load resistor is optimized to draw the maximum power from
            the harvest/secondary coil such that the energy harvest
            efficiency of the entire system is optimized. This is the
            defining element of the system. Voltage sense resistor 65
            for the opto transmitter for load voltage 66 measures the
            voltage across the load. Current sense resistor 67 is placed
            at bottom side of harvest coil. Opto transmitter 68 is for
            bottom lead current sense resistor 67. A jumper is placed to
            system ground 69 that allows grounded operation of the
            harvest coil with system ground 70. More than one step-up
            transformer coil can be used as energy harvester in the
            pyramid generator system.<br>
            <br>
            [0073] The minimum system is shown in FIG. 3. When a minimum
            system is used, a load can be directly connected to the
            pyramid's surface.<br>

            <b>DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0074] This invention demonstrates a novel approach to
            harvest Earth's electric energy. The masses of Earth and its
            atmosphere represent a coupled resonant system that is
            continually electrified by solar radiation. We have found
            that a pyramidal antenna designed based on the functions of
            phi and/or pi is optimal for the capture of atmospheric
            electrostatic discharge (ESD) impulses [3-5]. Atmospheric
            ESD is a product of solar radiation and is a wide bandwidth
            phenomenon. The pyramid as a wideband, non-resonant antenna
            is uniquely adapted to harvest the energy of atmospheric
            ESD.<br>
            <br>
            [0075] This invention also points out an additional
            energizing mechanism at work during the operation of the
            pyramid electric generator. The observation is derived from
            our theory on energy, matter and space [1,2] as well as that
            of Russell [7]. Both Russell and we observed that spiral
            motion is a fundamental action of matter and that the vortex
            is the mechanism of power multiplication in Nature. A vortex
            concentrates power into its apex where the highest velocity
            of motion, the highest pressure and the highest electric
            potential resides [1, 2, 6, 7]. As electricity propagates
            along a pulsating phi-based spiral [6,7], a phi-based
            antenna/waveguide is suitable to focus its energy into the
            apex of a vortex inside the antenna. A phi-based pyramid is
            optimal for this purpose.<br>
            <br>
            [0076] As atomic bodies can oscillate in a very wide
            frequency range [1, 2, 7, 8], a pyramidal antenna/waveguide
            coupled to an oscillator that is tuned to a suitable
            frequency can focus the "electric noise" from Earth's atomic
            oscillators into the apex of the pyramid at a high voltage.
            Russell observed that energy moves towards the higher
            potential during its generative cycle [7]; therefore, it is
            essential that the pyramidal antenna be at a high potential.
            Our results corroborated this assumption.<br>
            <br>
            [0077] For practical reasons on our small pyramid, we have
            chosen a frequency above the audio range but below the radio
            frequency spectrum; our antenna was made to emit at the
            target wavelength. The wavelength of the 50-120 kHz range is
            6 km to 25 km, thus allowing energy to be harvested over a
            large atmospheric domain. As electrical energy propagates in
            a vortex [6,7], the emitted electric vortex (ionic antenna)
            over the pyramidal antenna/waveguide increases its "size"
            and enables it to funnel the same frequency atmospheric
            electromagnetic radiations back into the antenna. Thus, the
            pyramid electric generator captures at the selected
            frequency the energy emitted by Earth's atomic oscillators.<br>
            <br>
            [0078] The presence of an electric (ionic) vortex was
            demonstrated by radar testing of the space over a 44 m tall
            fiberglass pyramid located near Moscow [12]. The Russians
            found that the large ionized column of air over the area of
            the vertical axis of the pyramid had a width of about 500 m
            and reached an altitude of 2 km. It is remarkable that this
            effect was induced by a nonconductive pyramid surface and
            demonstrating a significant degree of atmospheric ionization
            even under fair weather conditions. Thus, a suitably sized
            large or an electrically activated small pyramid should open
            a low impedance path to higher elevations of relatively
            conductive atmospheric domains.<br>
            <br>
            [0079] In conclusion, the total power that can be extracted
            from Earth's atomic oscillators must be extremely large,
            likely far exceeding current global electric generation
            capacity. In our experiment, we measured over 196 kVA power
            at the pyramid's apex at about 200 kV p-p voltage using a
            6.26 feet base length pyramid. This power is 175 times
            greater than the power necessary to drive the pyramid to
            this operating voltage. By constructing the pyramid
            generator from appropriate high voltage components and using
            higher drive voltages, a significant increase in power
            output is envisioned. The power extraction will also be
            enhanced by further optimization of the designs of both the
            pyramid and the coil system.<br>
            <br>
            [0080] The power output will also increase by employing
            larger pyramid structures and coils. As voltage is the
            primary factor in attracting power into the system, the
            necessary voltage can be provided by the vertical
            atmospheric potential on a tall pyramid. Since the
            atmospheric vertical potential gradient could go as high as
            1200 V/m near Earth's surface under fair weather conditions
            [13], a pyramid height of 20-150 m seems sufficient to
            provide the apex voltage for a self-sustaining power
            generator. As the pyramid scales up volumetrically, a power
            generator pyramid of the size range of the GPG could likely
            have an output in the range of hundreds of gigawatts. Groups
            of several pyramid electric generators could be placed
            within specific geographical areas, thus combining their
            energy harvesting capacity.<br>

            <b>ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
            <br>
            [0095] The present invention provides a new method of
            tapping Earth's electric energy pool and providing usable
            power that can be fed into the power grid or supplied by
            stand-alone power generators. It does so without the need
            for mechanical energy or the consumption of fossil fuel or
            the long-term risks associated with power generated by
            nuclear fission, including the risk of diversion of
            fissionable material to terrorist aims or the risk posed by
            the required long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel.

            virtually continuously with little to no maintenance.<br>

            </b><br>
            This invention relates to the generation of electrical power
            by drawing energy from Earth's electric field. Earth
            represents a resonant system in which both atmospheric and
            telluric electrical processes can be harvested. In U.S. Pat.
            No. 6,974,110, we have provided an apparatus and method for
            converting the electrostatic potential energy of Earth's
            atmosphere. The present invention aims to provide an
            electric generator that, in addition to tapping atmospheric
            electric processes, extracts electrical power from the
            vibrational energy of atomic oscillators by a novel resonant
            coupling method.<br>

            </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            One aspect of the present invention is an electric generator
            for attracting the electric emissions of atomic oscillations
            by the use of high voltage, to harvest electric energy
            therefrom.<br>
            <br>
            One embodiment of this aspect of the invention is an
            apparatus for capturing atmospheric and telluric electric
            energies by harvesting the energies of atomic oscillators,
            comprising:<br>
            <br>
            (1) an antenna/waveguide that is geometrically optimized,
            having a conducting surface;<br>
            <br>
            (2) a primary coil wound with an insulated conductor, the
            coil being connected to an AC or AC-DC driver; and<br>
            <br>
            (3) a secondary coil smaller in diameter than the primary
            coil, having a greater length and a greater number of turns
            than the primary coil and having a first lead and a second
            lead, the secondary coil being positioned coaxially within
            the first coil and acting as a resonant step-up transformer
            winding, inductively coupled with the first coil; and an
            external capacitor connected in parallel with the secondary
            coil to provide a specific resonant frequency; or<br>
            <br>
            (4) a secondary coil smaller in diameter than the primary
            coil, having a greater length and a greater number of turns
            than the primary coil and having a first lead and a second
            lead, the secondary coil being positioned coaxially within
            the first coil and acting as a resonant step-up transformer
            winding, inductively coupled with the first coil and
            connected with the antenna/waveguide serving as a
            quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific
            resonant frequency, with the secondary coil attached near
            the point at which the electric field contacts the
            antenna/waveguide;<br>
            <br>
            wherein the generator absorbs electromagnetic impulses from
            Earth's electric field; and<br>
            <br>
            wherein a high-voltage, sinusoidal waveform is generated in
            the secondary coil representing harvested atmospheric and
            telluric electrical energy and measurable on leads of the
            secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            Preferably, the antenna/waveguide is of pyramidal shape.
            However, any geometric shape can be used for the
            antenna/waveguide. When it is of pyramidal shape, the
            secondary coil is preferably connected near or at the apex
            of the antenna/waveguide. The shape and size of the
            antenna/waveguide can be optimized depending on the intended
            use of the generator. Preferably, the antenna/waveguide
            exhibits ratios of pi and the Fibonacci number (phi).<br>
            <br>
            Typically, the generator further comprises an insulated base
            on which the antenna/waveguide is placed. The size and shape
            of the insulated base can also be optimized, depending on
            the intended use of the generator. The second lead of the
            secondary coil is typically connected to earth ground.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, the output of the secondary coil is harvested.
            This can be done by connecting to a rectifier-capacitor-load
            resistance, or by a third coil inductively coupled with the
            secondary coil. In one alternative, the output of the
            secondary coil is coupled to a load for drawing power from
            the generator. The optimal circuit can be selected by one of
            ordinary skill in the art to optimize power extraction. The
            load draws power from the generator. The load can be a
            resistor, a rectifier or a storage capacitor powering a DC
            load. Typically, the antenna/waveguide is at a high voltage
            during the operation of the generator. Typically, the
            antenna/waveguide voltage is greater than 500 VRMS. The
            antenna/waveguide can be connected to an oscillator. The
            oscillator can comprise a resonant step-up transformer.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, the antenna/waveguide is in resonance with the
            secondary coil. Typically, the primary coil is inductively
            coupled to the secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, the antenna/waveguide is positioned in a
            generally north-south direction to tap atmospheric and
            telluric electric energy. In this arrangement, when the
            antenna/waveguide is of pyramidal shape, the height of the
            pyramid can be from about 0.5 m to about 1000 m, more
            typically, from about 0.50 m to about 150 m. The optimal
            pyramid size is a function of the power requirements.
            However, a pyramid can be built even 1 km in height.
            Typically, the base surface area of the pyramid ranges from
            about 0.25 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 1,000,000 m&lt;2&gt;; more
            typically, from about 0.25 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 25,000
            m&lt;2&gt;. Naturally, other heights and base surface areas
            can be used for particular applications. The numbers of
            sides can also vary. When the pyramid is small (e.g., 6-feet
            base length described in this application), there is an
            insufficient atmospheric potential on its apex to trigger
            the attraction of power. In such event, an AC or AC-DC
            driver is necessary to bring the pyramid to the electric
            potential necessary. A suitable voltage is typically greater
            than 500 VRMS.<br>
            <br>
            In one alternative, the primary coil is wound with a
            conductor over the secondary coil, the primary coil being
            connected electrically to a driver operating in the LF or
            ELF bands.<br>
            <br>
            Another aspect of the present invention is an electric
            generator for harvesting the electric emissions of atomic
            oscillations comprising an oscillator. Typically, the
            oscillator operates in the LF or ELF bands.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, in this aspect of the present invention, the
            generator comprises:<br>
            <br>
            (1) a primary coil wound with a conductor over a secondary
            coil, the coil being connected electrically to a driver
            operating in the LF or ELF bands; and<br>
            <br>
            (2) a secondary coil of smaller diameter than the primary
            coil having a greater length and a greater number of turns
            than the primary coil, the secondary coil being positioned
            coaxially within the first coil and acting as a resonant
            step-up transformer winding inductively coupled with the
            primary;<br>
            <br>
            wherein said resonant step-up transformer's output voltage
            exceeds 500 VRMS;<br>
            <br>
            wherein the electric generator attracts impulses from
            Earth's electric oscillations; and<br>
            <br>
            wherein the attracted energy manifests as high voltage
            sinusoidal waveforms representing harvested electric energy
            of atomic oscillations in the secondary coil and measurable
            on leads of the secondary coil.<br>
            <br>
            In this alternative, the output of the secondary coil can be
            coupled to a load for drawing power from the generator.<br>
            <br>
            Another aspect of the invention is a method of tapping
            Earth's electric energy based on the following concepts:<br>
            <br>
            (1) utilizing a pyramidal antenna/waveguide designed based
            on the ratios of pi and phi;<br>
            <br>
            (2) using the antenna/waveguide to absorb and focus specific
            frequencies of Earth's electric field;<br>
            <br>
            (3) positioning a resonant coil system connected to said
            antenna/waveguide near or at its apex according to the
            present invention; and<br>
            <br>
            (4) generating a high-voltage sinusoidal signal,
            representing harvested atmospheric and telluric electrical
            energy, by the operation of the coil system.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, in this method, the method comprises the steps
            of:<br>
            <br>
            (1) positioning an electric generator according to the
            present invention as described above such that it is exposed
            to Earth's electric oscillations; and<br>
            <br>
            (2) generating a high voltage sinusoidal signal representing
            harvested electric energy of atomic oscillators by the
            operation of the generator.<br>
            <br>
            Typically, the harvested electric energy can be fed into a
            power grid for distribution, but smaller units capable of
            distributed power generation or for use as stand-alone
            generators are also feasible by the concept of this
            invention.<br>

            Example is included for illustrative purposes only and is

            excitation of which generates propagating sinusoidal lines
            of force across the space lattice recorded as
            electromagnetic waves by our instruments [1,2]. We have also
            predicted that natural pressure gradients exist within the
            space lattice that can be used for power generation by
            inserting a capacitor into such gradient. Furthermore, we
            proposed that a pyramid-shaped capacitor is an optimally
            shaped device for tapping the energy gradient of the space
            lattice that manifests in the form of an electrical
            potential gradient in Earth's atmosphere. This was
            demonstrated subsequently [3-5]. We also found that the
            pyramid-shaped capacitor design should be based on ratios of
            pi and phi [5] because electrical energy propagates along a
            phi-based spiral [6].<br>
            <br>
            We suggested that elemental particles are composed of STAR
            oscillators that make up the space lattice by
            electromagnetic compression of its elemental cubes into
            pulsating conical/vortexual subunits that form the basis for
            all particles of matter [1,2]. We proposed that atomic and
            subatomic oscillators could vibrate in a very wide frequency
            range from sub-acoustic to extremely high EM frequencies
            [1,2]. This does not mean that material bodies can take or
            maintain a physical form at any energy level, but this
            allows the recycling of atoms into the space lattice as part
            of their natural evolution [2,6].<br>
            <br>
            Atomic oscillators are constantly in motion, and such motion
            is electric because all motion and energy is fundamentally
            electric [2,6]. It is known that atomic bodies constantly
            exchange electric energy. Such energy flow can be harvested
            when the spiral physical nature of electric waves is
            recognized. Russell observed that energy always moves during
            its generative cycle in spirals towards the higher potential
            [7]; therefore, we reasoned that an "attractor" of high
            electric potential must be provided to pull in the random
            electromagnetic emissions of atomic oscillators. The
            "attractor" must function as a phi-based antenna/waveguide
            to focus the phi-based electric emissions of atomic bodies
            into the apex of a vortex, the same method Nature uses for
            power multiplication [6,7]. Therefore, a phi-based pyramidal
            antenna/waveguide must be at a high voltage in order to
            perform its attractor function.<br>
            <br>
            As all material manifestations are tonal [8], acoustic
            vibrations are always generated during the oscillations of
            atomic bodies, even though they are inaudible most of the
            time. Sometimes, however, they are detected; one such
            example is Earth's hum [9-11]. Earth's solid mass and its
            atmosphere represent a coupled resonant system, and is
            therefore our expanded target power source. Acoustic waves
            are also electrical [8] and can be harvested. To achieve
            this goal, the geometrically optimized pyramidal
            antenna/waveguide must be connected to an oscillator that
            operates at a high voltage and is tuned to a suitably
            selected frequency.<br>
            <br>
            The appropriate resonant frequency is dictated by practical
            considerations. Atomic oscillators can vibrate in a very
            wide frequency range [1,2,6-8] but short wavelength
            radiations are readily re-absorbed by atoms and are rapidly
            attenuated; therefore, long wavelength electromagnetic
            emissions must be targeted. The operation of the pyramid
            generator is feasible in the ELF to the LF range. As
            electric radiation propagates in a vortex [2,6-8], the
            emitted electric vortex over the pyramidal antenna (FIG. 1)
            increases its "size," and so it is capable of funneling
            atmospheric electromagnetic emissions of the same frequency
            back into the antenna/receiver. Thus, the pyramid electric
            generator could capture the energy emitted by both telluric
            and atmospheric atomic oscillators. We have tested these
            assumptions and demonstrated the basic principles of an
            electric generator.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Methods and Results</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            In our previous papers, we reported that a pyramid-shaped
            capacitor/antenna converts atmospheric electrostatic
            discharge impulses (ESD) into a periodic high-frequency
            signal that can be detected in an insulated coil placed in
            proximity of the capacitor [3,4]. Here, we report on further
            developments including a new design for the resonant coil
            system and an expanded range of energy sources targeted. A
            Tektronix TPS 2024 digital oscilloscope was used for signal
            acquisition and analysis, and Tektronix A503 current
            amplifiers were used with the Tektronix A6302 and A6303
            probes for current measurement. High voltage was measured
            using a Tektronix P6015 probe. An ENI-1140LA amplifier was
            used to activate the primary coil of the resonant coil
            system at the selected frequency.<br>
            <br>
            For the experiments, we used a geometrically optimized
            pyramid-shaped antenna/waveguide [3-5]. The pyramid
            expressed ratios of pi and phi and was approximately a 1:125
            scaled down replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza (GPF), 6
            feet base length. The pyramid was built of a wooden frame
            and covered with triangular copper sheets of 0.66 mm
            thickness on its sides that were electrically connected. It
            was placed on an insulating base and positioned in the
            general North-South direction.<br>
            <br>
            The secondary coil (coil 2) was wound with a 20 AWG
            insulated magnet wire with a monofilament nylon spacer (0.06
            mm diameter) between the turns on a fiberglass cylindrical
            coil form, and connected to the conducting surface of the
            pyramid near its apex. Thus, the secondary coil was
            connected with the pyramidal antenna/waveguide as a
            quasi-capacitive series element to provide a specific
            resonant frequency with coupling to the surrounding
            electromagnetic environment. The other lead of coil 2 was
            grounded (FIG. 2). The purpose of the monofilament spacer
            was to reduce interwinding capacitance in coil 2 by
            increasing distance between wire turns of the coil.<br>
            <br>
            A primary coil of larger diameter (coil 1) was wound on or
            near the lower cylindrical volume of coil 2 with the lead
            connected to earth ground, and served as a driver coil
            inductively coupled with the secondary (coil 2). The
            secondary was isolated from the primary by layers of silicon
            rubber and foam. The two coils make a resonant step-up
            transformer, the parameters of which are shown in Table 1.<br>

            In the experiment; the controlled variable was the voltage,
            which was increased in steps until the maximum voltage in
            the secondary (permitted by circuit components and test
            equipment) was achieved for the given resonant frequency.
            The objective was to "drive the atmosphere" by radiating a
            high voltage (~20 kV p-p), LF (40-120 kHz) signal developed
            by the high ratio step-up transformer and fed by a powerful
            signal generator at a resonant frequency either with an L-C
            resonant secondary coil, or a resonance determined by the
            pyramid as a quasi-capacitive series element connected to
            the secondary coil of the transformer and radiating to the
            local atmosphere. The data are shown in Table 2.<br>
            <br>
            The experimental data are shown in Table 2. The current
            readings were also confirmed by using "current sensing"
            resistors (not shown). A apparent power gain of nearly
            100-fold was achieved in the secondary coil relative to
            input power in the primary coil, and a linear increase of
            power in the secondary coil with the increase of input power
            into the primary coil (FIG. 3). The power in the secondary
            coil exponentially increases with the pyramid apex voltage
            (FIG. 4).<br>

            A load may be connected to coil 2 to draw power from the

            inductively coupled to the secondary coil. The load may be a

            <br>
            A graphic representation of the test system is shown in FIG.
            5. The pyramidal antenna/waveguide, placed on an insulating
            base, is coupled to the surrounding electromagnetic
            environment and serves as an antenna/waveguide for the
            concentration of atmospheric and telluric electromagnetic
            oscillations at resonance frequency. As the flow of electric
            energy is always balanced [6], two vortices may cross the
            pyramidal antenna: one from the direction of the ground
            concentrating into its apex, and another one from its apex
            propagating into the atmosphere (FIG. 1). The atmospheric
            electric vortex possibly acts as an ionic antenna pulling in
            EM radiations from a large atmospheric domain. In FIG. 5,
            the antenna/waveguide 10 is attached to a coil 12. To drive
            the system, a RF generator 14 is connected to a signal
            amplifier 16. The signal amplifier 16 is also connected to
            an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) 18 through a sinewave
            generator 20 and a frequency counter 22. Outputs from the
            sinewave generator 20 and frequency counter 22 are also
            connected to a first current amplifier 24. The output from
            the antenna/waveguide 10 and coil 12 are also connected to a
            second current amplifier 26. The sinewave generator 20,
            frequency counter 22, first current amplifier 24, and second
            current amplifier 26 are connected to a digital oscilloscope
            28. Outputs from the antenna/waveguide 10 and coil 12 are
            also connected to the digital oscilloscope 28. A laptop
            computer 30 controls the sinewave generator 20 and frequency
            counter 22.<br>
            <br>
            The pyramid's apex is attached to a coil of high turn number
            (FIGS. 2 &amp; 4). This secondary coil wound on a
            nonconductive coil form serves as a step-up transformer, and
            forms a resonant circuit with the pyramid that acts as a
            quasi-capacitive series element. The secondary coil is
            activated by a signal from an RF generator via a primary
            coil of a few turn numbers inductively coupled to coil 2.
            The measurement points are also indicated, displaying the
            positions of voltage and current probes. The data are
            captured by a digital oscilloscope and recorded on a laptop
            computer.<br>

            <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            This invention demonstrates a novel approach to harvest
            Earth's electric energy. The masses of Earth and its
            atmosphere represent a coupled resonant system that is
            continually electrified by solar radiation. We have found
            that a pyramidal antenna designed based on the ratios of phi
            and pi is optimal for the capture of atmospheric
            electrostatic discharge (ESD) impulses [3-5]. Atmospheric
            ESD is a product of solar radiation and is a wide bandwidth
            phenomenon. The pyramid as a wideband, non-resonant antenna
            is uniquely adapted to harvest the energy of atmospheric
            ESD.<br>
            <br>
            This invention also points out an additional energizing
            mechanism at work during the operation of the pyramid
            electric generator. The observation is derived from our
            theory on energy, matter and space [1,2] as well as that of
            Russell [6,7]. Both Russell and we observed that spiral
            motion is a fundamental action of matter and that the vortex
            is the mechanism of power multiplication in Nature. A vortex
            concentrates power into its apex where the highest velocity
            of motion, the highest pressure and the highest electric
            potential resides [1,2,6,7]. As electricity propagates along
            a pulsating phi-based spiral [6,7], a phi-based
            antenna/waveguide is suitable to focus its energy into the
            apex of a vortex inside the antenna. A phi-based pyramid is
            optimal for this purpose.<br>
            <br>
            As atomic bodies can oscillate in a very wide frequency
            range [1,2,6-8], a pyramidal antenna/waveguide coupled to an
            oscillator that is tuned to a suitable frequency can focus
            the "electric noise" from Earth's atomic oscillators into
            the apex of the pyramid at a high voltage. Russell observed
            that energy moves towards the higher potential during its
            generative cycle [7]; therefore, it is essential that the
            pyramidal antenna be at a high potential. Our data
            corroborated this assumption.<br>
            To select a suitable frequency range, one can begin with the
            observation that all material manifestations are tonal [8],
            and that acoustic frequencies are always generated during
            the oscillations of atomic bodies even though they remain
            inaudible most of the time. Acoustic waves are also electric
            [8] and therefore Earth's enormous mass and its atmosphere
            represent a coupled resonant system that offer a vast source
            of power.<br>
            <br>
            For practical reasons on our small pyramid, we have chosen a
            frequency above the audio range but below the radio
            frequency spectrum; our antenna was made to radiate at the
            target wavelength. The wavelength of the 50-120 kHz range is
            6 km to 25 km, thus allowing energy to be harvested over a
            large atmospheric domain. As electrical energy propagates in
            a vortex [6,7], the emitted electric vortex (ionic antenna)
            over the pyramidal antenna/waveguide increases its "size"
            and enables it to funnel the same frequency atmospheric
            electromagnetic radiations back into the antenna. Thus, the
            pyramid electric generator captures at the selected
            frequency the energy emitted by Earth's atomic oscillators.<br>
            <br>
            The presence of an electric (ionic) vortex was demonstrated
            by radar testing of the space over a 44 m tall fiberglass
            pyramid located near Moscow [12]. The Russians found that
            the large ionized column of air over the area of the
            vertical axis of the pyramid had a width of about 500 m and
            reached an altitude of 2 km. It is remarkable that this
            effect was induced by a nonconductive pyramid surface
            demonstrating a significant degree of atmospheric ionization
            even under fair weather conditions. Thus, a suitably sized
            large or an electrically activated small pyramid should open
            a low impedance path to higher elevations of relatively
            conductive atmospheric domains.<br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, the total power that can be extracted from
            Earth's atomic oscillators must be extremely large, likely
            far exceeding current global electric generation capacity.
            In our experiment, we obtained over 7000 VA power at about
            20 kV p-p pyramid voltage using a 6 feet base length
            pyramid. This power is nearly 100 times greater than the
            power necessary to drive the pyramid to the required
            operating voltage. By constructing the pyramid generator
            from dedicated high voltage components and using higher
            drive voltages, a significant increase in power output is
            envisioned. The power extraction will also be enhanced by
            further optimization of the designs of both the pyramid and
            the coil system.<br>
            <br>
            The power output will also increase by employing larger
            pyramid structures and coils. As voltage is the primary
            factor in attracting power into the system, the necessary
            voltage can be provided by the vertical atmospheric
            potential on a tall pyramid. Since the atmospheric vertical
            potential gradient could go as high as 1200 V/m near Earth's
            surface under fair weather conditions [13], a pyramid height
            of 80-150 m seems sufficient to provide the apex voltage for
            a self-sustaining power generator. As the pyramid scales up
            volumetrically, a power generator pyramid of the size range
            of the GPG could likely have an output in the hundreds to
            thousands of megawatts range. Groups of several pyramid
            electric generators could be placed within specific
            geographical areas, thus combining their energy harvesting
            capacity.<br>

            </b><b>ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
            <br>
            The present invention provides a new method of tapping
            Earth's electric energy and providing usable power that can
            be fed into a power grid or supplied by stand-alone power
            generators. It does so without the need for mechanical
            energy or the consumption of fossil fuel or the long-term
            risks associated with power generated by nuclear fission,
            including the risk of diversion of fissionable material to
            terrorist aims or the risk posed by the required long-term
            storage of spent nuclear fuel. Devices according to the
            present invention can operate virtually continuously with
            little to no maintenance.<br>
            <br>
            With respect to ranges of values, the invention encompasses
            each intervening value between the upper and lower limits of
            the range to at least a tenth of the lower limit's unit,
            unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Moreover,
            the invention encompasses any other stated intervening
            values and ranges including either or both of the upper and
            lower limits of the range, unless specifically excluded from
            the stated range.<br>
            <br>

            belongs. One of ordinary skill in the art will also
            appreciate that any methods and materials similar or
            equivalent to those described herein can also be used to
            practice or test this invention.<br>

            As used in this specification and in the appended claims,
            the singular forms include the plural forms. For example the
            terms "a," "an," and "the" include plural references unless
            the content clearly dictates otherwise. Additionally, the
            term "at least" preceding a series of elements is to be
            understood as referring to every element in the series. The
            inventions illustratively described herein can suitably be
            practiced in the absence of any element or elements,
            limitation or limitations, not specifically disclosed
            herein. Thus, for example, the terms "comprising,"
            "including," "containing," etc. shall be read expansively
            and without limitation. Additionally, the terms and
            expressions employed herein have been used as terms of
            description and not of limitation, and there is no intention
            in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any
            equivalents of the future shown and described or any portion
            thereof, and it is recognized that various modifications are
            possible within the scope of the invention claimed. Thus, it
            should be understood that although the present invention has
            been specifically disclosed by preferred embodiments and
            optional features, modification and variation of the
            inventions herein disclosed can be resorted to by those
            skilled in the art, and that such modifications and
            variations are considered to be within the scope of the
            inventions disclosed herein. The inventions have been
            described broadly and generically herein. Each of the
            narrower species and subgeneric groupings falling within the
            scope of the generic disclosure also form part of these
            inventions. This includes the generic description of each
            invention with a proviso or negative limitation removing any
            subject matter from the genus, regardless of whether or not
            the excised materials specifically resided therein. In
            addition, where features or aspects of an invention are
            described in terms of the Markush group, those schooled in
            the art will recognize that the invention is also thereby
            described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of
            members of the Markush group. It is also to be understood
            that the above description is intended to be illustrative
            and not restrictive. Many embodiments will be apparent to
            those of in the art upon reviewing the above description.
            The scope of the invention should therefore, be determined
            not with reference to the above description, but should
            instead be determined with reference to the appended claims,
            along with the full scope of equivalents to which such
            claims are entitled. Those skilled in the art will
            recognize, or will be able to ascertain using no more than
            routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific
            embodiments of the invention described. Such equivalents are
            intended to be encompassed by the following claims.<br>
