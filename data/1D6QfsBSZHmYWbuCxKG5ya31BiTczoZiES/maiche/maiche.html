          "M. Louis Maiche is the inventor of the wireless telephone
          and, like many scientists, is not so famous as he ought to
          be". <br>
          <br>
          That is how an article in the Auckland Star on March 6, 1907,
          introduced the French inventor Louis Maiche, who also could be
          called the inventor of a mobile phone.<br>
          <br>
          In the article M. Maiche describes how it all began:<br>
          <br>
          "My first trials took place in 1867, but they were concerned
          more with wireless telegraphy, and it was not until 1893 that
          I exchanged a conversation through a wireless telephone at a
          distance of 30 yards."<br>
          <br>
          Two months earlier, the New York Times had also published an
          article on M. Maiche and his wireless telephone invention. In
          the article the inventor refers to his successful experiments
          with telegraphy and then describes his work with the wireless
          telephone:<br>
          <br>
          "I then made use of the ground as a means of transmission. The
          discovery of today enables me to do away with all visible
          means of communication and to project the words in any given
          direction without the danger that they may be radiated
          elsewhere; and, more interesting still, I do this with an
          infinitesimal expenditure of electricity, while, as you well
          know, other wireless telegraphic and telephone systems expend
          enormous amounts of electricity radiated in all directions."<br>
          <br>
          "When once perfected my apparatus may be practically used at
          an insignificant cost. Just now it is still&nbsp; at the
          laboratory and experimental stages." <br>
          <br>
          "You see", said M. Maiche,"that our experiments have succeeded
          in spite of all obstacles. Neither the water, nor rocks, nor
          ice can interfere. All that the telegrapher considers as
          insurmountable barriers we easily pass through. Surely we have
          much to perfect! All that we have done up to the present is to
          be able to converse distinctly up to a distance of a little
          over 1,800 feet. But once the practicality of the theory is
          established, then the mechanism must be perfected."<br>
          <br>
          "It is being perfected day by day - just as Branly one day
          succeeded in modifying the conductibility of his tube&nbsp;
          fillings from one end of his laboratory to the other, thereby
          making wireless telegraphy an established fact. And it will
          the same with our wireless telephone,which seems to us called
          to a very different destiny, not as aid to war, but as an aid
          to peace, as a savior of human life."<br>
          <br>
          In the Auckland Star article M. Maiche gives some examples of
          the future use of his wireless telephone:<br>
          <br>
          "Imagine two steamers steering through a fog. With my little
          apparatus the captain can tell the direction the other ship is
          taking. In case of an accident to a submarine my apparatus
          would enable the crew in danger to communicate with the
          convoying tug without fearing the breaking of a line as in the
          case of a telephone buoy. Miners entombed after a disaster
          like that at Courrieres could communicate with the rescue
          party. Two army corps making a night attack could keep in
          constant touch without risk of interruption. The ordinary
          citizen could have it in his drawing room, and would no longer
          be dependent upon the vagaries of the telephone exchange." <br>
          <br>
          Both articles also include some technical descriptions of the
          use of M. Maiche's new wireless phone. It is possible that the
          French inventor's theories were not as successful as he
          himself thought. Otherwise it is difficult to understand why
          this page (in French) is the only one with information about
          him that I have been able to locate. Still, his concept of
          wireless (and mobile) telephony should merit him a place in
          the hall of fame of modern communication technology .<br>

          <br>
          The object of the present invention is a new method of
          transmitting and receiving wireless electrical signals. The
          essential means on which is based the system is the production
          transmits position and uses the position receiver electricity
          manifested in a new form which may be referred to as
          "electrostatic vibration" and&nbsp; is obtained as will be
          explained further by modification of a spark inductor. One of
          distinctive characters of this new manifestation of
          electricity is that it can be transmitted in space without the
          aid antennas and ground at all distances, and, in the same
          form as sound, light and heat, that is to say without poles.<br>
          <br>
          The inductor being communicated c with a power source, a
          battery, for example, and a special switch which will be
          described below, each interruption is to be born in the
          armature current giving a spark, and it is the latter that is
          transform an "electrostatic vibration." The armature out of
          the coil wire after the last winding outside, is for this
          purpose connected to a large metal surface which can be
          exposed to air. This surface may be constituted either by c a
          hollow or solid cylinder or by one or more sheets of iron,
          copper or any other metal usual more or less thick. The
          surface is preferably rounded at the corners or packed with a
          border all around to remove spikes, as in the conductive
          electrostatic machines. It should be about one square meter
          per watt of the current flowing in the inductor. The other end
          of the armature is connected to an adjusting screw of which
          the tip k of platinum or gold is next to a button, also in a
          gold or platinum, carried on the large surface.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FIGS. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings show two
            provisions which may be 5 h adopted for the preparation of

          One end of the armature wire of the coil -j is connected to
          the cylinder 3 rounded at its ends, and the end k of the wire
          is connected to plate 5 mounted on the insulating support 6
          which is fixed to the cylinder 3 . The plate 5 is traversed by
          a setscrew 55 provided beyond tip 7 made of gold or platinum.
          The end of the induced wire k is that by which begins rolling
          on a bobbin. Wire 8 communicates with the earth or the plate 5

          The present invention relates to electric transformers of the
          class described by Specifications Nos. N;821901 (Amberg),
          z1854 (Swinburne), and 4/I83 (Clerc) and it particularly
          concerns the arrangement of the windings.<br>
          <br>
          The invention is represented in the accompanying drawings;-<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figs. 1 and 2, show a section and a front view respectively
            of the improved transformer.</b><b><br>

          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="gb190727157.JPG"
              height="485" width="390"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The transformer which has no magnetic core, is merely
          constituted by a convenient number of insulated wires, 10 for
          example, which are united to form a cable a which is wound
          around a frame b. The ends of the cable project through two
          holes of the frame and the ends of each wire are joined to
          terminals 1 to 10 and 11 to 101 respectively. In the drawings
          are shown 20 terminals, the first ten of which correspond to
          the beginnings of the 10 wires, and the other ten correspond
          to the ends of the same wires.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, a winding of a certain number of identical wires is
          obtained which are all wound parallel and simultaneously and
          which may be connected by means of a commutator so as to form
          groups to 'be varied according to requirement; so that there
          are thus constituted three or more circuits which are entirely
          independent the one of the other and the length of which can
          be varied at will.<br>
          <br>
          By conveniently joining the free ends of some of the wires, a
          primary winding of weak resistance is obtained with the wires
          of same joined for quantity, while one or more of the
          secondary windings are joined for tension, thus providing any
          required resistance.<br>
          <br>
          The construction of the transformer by means of a great number
          of separate wires offers numerous advantages amongst which are
          the facility of connecting the separate wires at will to
          constitute the circuits; the arrangement enabling a
          supplementary circuit to be branched off at any point of the
          said circuits; and the reciprocal independence of these
          circuits with large number.<br>

          Transformers for telegraphy and wireless telegraphy are made
          without a magnetic core, and of little depth but of large
          diameter. They have the primary winding e enclosed within the
          secondary winding c, g, but separated therefrom by insulation
          d, f. The windings may be formed in sections, and coupled up
          in any order by means of a commutator.<br>

          <br>
          My improved electric transformer contains its primary wire

          As will be seen from the drawings, the transformer a is of
          comparatively large diameter which may be several meters. In
          the drawing the transformer is represented of circular
          cross-section, it could however be of square or other
          cross-section. This transformer is very short because all the
          wires of the winding are located on its periphery in an
          appropriate hollow or groove b. For manufacturing the
          trans-former I place around the rim of this kind of wheel or
          dial: a, a first layer of secondary wire which is covered by a
          suitable insulator d and upon this insulator the primary wire
          e is wound which is covered by another layer of insulating
          material f. The two insulating layers d and f are connected in
          such a manner that the primary wires e are well insulated, and
          the coil is then finished by applying an outer winding of
          secondary wire g, the latter surrounding the primary in such a
          manner as to form a cable. In this manner a ring of large
          diameter is obtained which is composed of the secondary wires
          c, g which enclose a core of suitably insulated and wholly
          surrounded primary wires e and which ring is applied to a
          ring-shaped transformer-body having a peripheral groove of
          suitable cross-section.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus comprises four terminals h, two of which serve
          for fixing the ends of the secondary wires, the other two
          serving for fixing the ends of the primary winding.<br>
          There could be arranged several independent cables or rings in
          each of which the secondary wires entirely surround the
          primary wires and in such case each of the terminals would be
          replaced by a multiple commutator permitting to join up the
          different secondary wires as well as the different primary
          wires either for tension or for quantity according to the
          effect to be obtained.<br>

          The transmitting and receiving circuits at one station for an
          inductive system of telephony or telegraphy are arranged as
          shown. A coil a, consisting of a few turns of thick wire, is
          used alone in transmitting, but is connected in series with a
          coil b, consisting of a large number of turns of fine wire,
          for receiving; the circuit of the coil b is broken
          automatically, during transmission, by means of a Morse key c.
          The circuit of the coil a includes a battery n and a
          microphone o for telephony, or an interrupter for telegraphy,
          and the coil b is connected with a telephone h.<br>
          <br>
          There are known systems for telegraphy and telephony without
          connecting wires which utilise, instead of Hertzian waves, the
          phenomena of distant induction by means of electric vibrations
          of very short duration, but great amplitude. With such
          systems, one and the same winding is used fur sending and for
          receiving; for sending it is placed in circuit with a source
          of electricity (battery, accumulator, etc.) and with a
          microphone or an interrupter destined to produce the
          vibrations in question. The same winding is placed in circuit
          with a .receiving telephone .for receiving the currents which
          arc induced at a. distance from the sending winding of the
          other station.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that this single coil cannot equally well serve
          for the sending as for the receiving. To transmit well it
          ought to be made from thick and short wire, whilst for
          receiving well it ought to be of long and thin wire.<br>
          <br>
          It would evidently be the simplest to provide each station
          with two different coils of which one serves as transmitter
          and the other as receiver, but lucre is another difficulty to
          be considered; for receiving, the long and thin coil has to be
          closed by the telephone and in that condition it would absorb
          nearly all the energy which ought to be sent out by the
          transmitter.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention rotates to a special method of mounting
          the parts constituting a station in order to overcome the
          above mentioned difficulty; besides, the special method of
          mounting permits to join the two coils one behind the other
          for receiving whereby the receiving power of the station is
          considerably increased.<br>
          <br>
          The accompanying drawing represents diagrammatically a station
          according to the present Invention.<br>

          a is the inductor wire which serves fur transmitting; this
          wire is thick and relatively short. b is the induced winding
          for receiving the induced vibrations from the inductor winding
          of the transmitting station; this winding consists of thin
          wire of considerable length. c is a. Morse-manipulator the
          lever of which is connected through the contact let with one
          end of wire a, its connector e is through the contact f
          connected with one of the ends of wire; the wire g which
          connects the contact f with wire b comprises the telephonic
          receiver h ;the other connector i of the Morse apparatus is
          connected through terminal with the free ends of the two wires
          a and b which are joined at this point. The connecting wire m
          which serves for this purpose, comprises the battery n and the
          microphone o.<br>
          <br>
          It is easily' understood that in the inoperative position of
          the Morse key (as represented in the drawings) the two coils
          and b form one circuit closed on the telephone h. This
          position is the receiving position. For transmitting, the key
          is depressed and brought in contact with the connector whereby
          the coil b is opened whilst the coil a is closed on the
          microphone and the battery.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be understood, that the station described serves for
          the transmission of sounds. For the transmission of
          telegraphic signals, the microphone o is replaced by a
          suitable interruptor-vibrator and the apparatus is operated
          through the Morse key as usual.<br>

          In a system of telegraphy or telephony by magnetic induction,
          the coils are placed vertically and the same coil is used for
          transmitting and receiving. The coil b is wound on a frame a
          of any suitable shape, which may be lined with iron. One
          terminal of the coil b is connected to a key f, one contact of
          which is connected through a microphone p and battery o to the
          other terminal d of the coil. A telephone m is connected
          across the terminals of the coil through another contact of
          the key f, and its circuit is normally completed for receiving
          telephonic or telegraphic messages. Telegraphy is effected by
          manipulating the kev f to complete the circuit of battery o ;
          to telephone, the key is depressed and the microphone p is
          utilized. A high-frequency alternator may be used instead of
          the battery o, and a screen composed of sheets of paper soaked
          in paraffin, varnish, or glue may be placed behind the frame.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;The present invention relates to improvements in that
          class of magnetic induction telegraphy and telephony in which
          transmission is effected between similar coils of wire at the
          receiving and transmitting stations. The invention is
          characterized by the fact that senders and receivers.are
          reversible, the member for transmitting the waves being the,
          same as the member which receives the waves.<br>
          <br>
          In the drawing, a diagram of a station according to the
          present system is represented.<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="gb190712529.JPG"

          </div>
          <br>
          The transmitter and receiver for the electric waves consists
          of a. wooden frame (a) of fairly large dimensions; for example
          4 meters square for a distance of 20 kilometers. In the
          drawing the frame is shown as being square but it may be of
          any other geometric shape having as center a.rectangle a
          lozenge, a circle, etc. The wall of the frame is provided with
          a groove (b) in which an insulated conducting wire is placed
          which is connected with the terminals (c) and (d). This wire
          is wound a. varying number of times around the frame so that
          it is of sufficient length according to the power of
          transmission required of the apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          The frame (a) must be of sufficiently large dimensions to
          prevent the currents generated in opposite directions in the
          sides of the frame from tending to neutralise each other.<br>
          <br>
          Each station comprises besides a Morse manipulator (e), the
          commutator of which is connected with one of the terminals (c)
          of frame (a) through the wire, its terminals (r) and (h) being
          connected with the other terminal (d) of frame (a).<br>
          <br>
          An ordinary telephonic receiver (m) is inserted in, the
          circuit (k) which leads from the terminal (h.) of the
          manipulator to the frame, and in the other circuit (n),
          connecting the terminal (g) of the manipulator with. the
          frame, a battery (o) is inserted near the frame and ,
          microphone (p) is inserted near the manipulator.<br>
          <br>
          When the manipulator (c) is at rest (position shown in the
          drawing) the station is ready to receive the transmissions,
          the electric circuit (a, c, i, f, m, k, d, a) enclosing the
          frame and the telephone -being closed. One has only to hold
          the telephone to the ear to perceive all the currents which
          a.re induced in the frame (a).<br>
          <br>
          The telephone (m) is put out of circuit when the commutator
          (f) is pressed down, whilst t.he circuit will be closed upon
          the frame (a.) and battery (o). The station has thus become 11
          sender, the battery sending variable currents into the frame
          according to the nature of the transmission to be effected. To
          telegraph according to the Morse alphabet one manipulates the
          commutator (f) in the usual manner, the telephone (m) of the
          other station permitting to distinctly perceive the dots and
          dashes. The operator simply gives one contact for the dot and
          two contacts following in quick succession for a dash. In this
          case the microphone (p) is superfluous but it does not
          disturb. When however one wants to telephone, the contact (g)
          has to be kept closed and one speaks in front of or into the
          microphone (p); the telephone (in.) of the other station will
          reproduce the sounds.<br>
          <br>
          The source of electricity (o) can be a battery or an
          electro-magnetic generator giving alternating currents of high
          frequency. The currents which are thus sent into the frame (a)
          of the sender station have no appreciable effect upon the
          telegraphic receivers which could be provided at this station;
          they even do not influence the magnet needle owing to their <b>illst,nntfmeousness.</b><br>
          <br>
          To establish the communication between two stations the two
          frames (a) have to be placed in parallel planes, perpendicular
          to the line which would connect their centers, which can be
          effected through various&nbsp; means. The action (if the one
          of the frames on the other is effected through any obstacles
          whatsoever, no earth connection or air connection being
          necessary.<br>
          <br>
          The reciprocal action of the frames can be increased through
          lining the bottom of groove (b) for its entire length with
          soft sheet iron, the lining being continuous or interrupted.
          The frame will thus become a kind of electro-magnet, the
          proportion of which are just the reverse of those generally
          used.<br>
          <br>
          To communicate at very great distances several frames (n,) are
          joined up, the wires being joined up in series or for tension.<br>
          <br>
          The efficiency can be considerably increased and the direction
          of transmission localised in avoiding dispersion at the sides
          or behind the frame, by means of a thick screen composed of
          superposed sheets of paper soaked in paraffn ; the paper could
          also be impregnated with varnish, glue or any other equivalent
          material. <br>

          Relates to the arrangements of circuits in telegraph and
          telephone systems. In Fig. 1, a microphone b is shown in a
          main line a, and at the receiving-station is connected to the
          middle of a split battery f, g, two receivers l, m being
          connected between battery and earth. When induction coils are
          employed, two separate primaries take the place of the
          receivers in the Figure, and the receiver employed is placed
          in a common secondary. In another modification, the
          transmitter is bridged across two parallel closed circuits,
          including primaries and batteries, the secondary forming the
          line circuit.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to telegraphic and telephonic systems
          and has for its object certain improvements hereinafter more
          particularly referred to and finally pointed out in the
          claims.<br>
          <br>
          As is well known, in order to prevent over-heating of' the
          receiving and transmitting apparatus in telephonic or
          telegraphic installations it is necessary to prevent very
          strong current passing over them. It may however, in certain
          cases, be necessary to provide currents of varying energy
          within rather large limits, and this invention has for its
          object to provide a simple device which will permit currents
          of any force being passed through telegraphic and telephonic
          apparatus without the slightest risk of deterioration to such
          apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          In order that my invention may be readily understood and
          carried into effect I will now proceed to describe the same
          fully with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein are
          shewn diagrammatically several methods of carrying my.
          invention into practice.<br>
          <br>
          In the drawings :<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure 1 shows the principle of my improved arrangement,

          </div>
          <br>
          My improved system consists essentially of a line a of any
          convenient length in which is interpolated a microphone b or
          other appropriate transmitting apparatus. One end of this line
          is grounded at c and the other end is connected at d to.a wire
          e adapted to place into communication the opposite poles of
          the two sources of electricity of equal power, which for
          greater clearness sake I have represented as two single
          batteries f and g. These two batteries are respectively
          connected to earth at h and i. In the earth wires j and k are
          interpolated telegraphic or telephonic receivers l, m, of any
          convenient construction. In the example shown in the drawing
          the receivers and m are indicated as being telephonic
          receivers.<br>
          <br>
          Having thus described the general arrangement of the system I
          will now explain the function of the various apparatus of the
          system.<br>
          <br>
          Presuming that the wire a is non-existent and that the
          communication of the battery f and g with the earth has been
          established, a current passes from the positive pole of the
          battery f to earth through the wire then back .through the
          wire k, battery 9 and finally through the wire e to the
          negative pole of the battery f. Thus a closed circuit is
          established. Admitting now the wire a to be connected to the
          wire e at d and the transmitter b operated, the single current
          generated in the previous case will be replaced, by two
          currents which circulate in the same direction.<br>
          <br>
          One of these currents starts from the positive pole of the
          battery f through the wire through earth from h to c through
          the transmitter b, wire a and wire e to the negative pole of
          the battery f.<br>
          <br>
          The other current starts from the positive pole of the battery
          9 through the 'wires e and a, the transmitter b, through earth
          from c to i and wire k to the negative pole of the battery g.<br>
          <br>
          It will thus be seen that the wire a and transmitter b are
          simultaneously traversed by two equal currents in inverse
          directions.<br>
          <br>
          In Figure 2 I have shown a telegraphic transmitter or key b
          but the general arrangement of the system is the the same as
          that previously described with the exception that the wires j
          and k form the primary conductors of the transformers n and o.
          The secondary conductor p, which is common to both
          transformers, leads,to the receiving apparatus q, for example
          a telegraphic receiving instrument.<br>
          <br>
          Each contact ejected with the key b produces, as before
          explained a double derivation acting by subtraction of
          intensity upon the two transformers n and o, produces an
          induced current which is reproduced in totality in the
          receiving apparatus q. In the case of telephonic transmission
          the key must be replaced by a microphone as shown in Figure 1,
          while further the receiver q would also be a telephonic
          receiver.<br>
          <br>
          By extending the same principle I can, as indicated in Figure
          3, replace the two earth wires by two conductors and k joined
          together at r after having traversed the transformers x and o.
          The induced current may then be conveyed to the receiving
          instrument t over two lines, or as in the previous example
          over a line s and two earth connections u and v, placed more
          or less apart from each other. <br>
          <br>
          It will be noticed that the microphone b forms part of the
          neutral conductors.<br>
          <br>
          It acts exactly as in Figure 1. The differences of resistance
          produced by its vibrations influence the two coils x and o,
          and it is easy to understand that, whatsoever may be the
          intensity of the two electric sources f and g, the microphone
          is never exposed to the risk of becoming overheated for the
          reason that it is traversed by two equal currents in opposite
          directions.<br>
          <br>
          It will thus be understood that the transmissions will be
          rendered perceptible in the receivers through the differences
          of intensity of the electric current; the differences being
          due to the differences of resistance of the neutral conductor
          which, in receiving two equal currents in opposite directions,
          is not much affected itself.<br>

          The local circuits at each station are doubly earthed at e, f,
          j, k symmetrically about a straight line joining the stations.
          The earths may be formed of porous pots containing water in
          which the ends of the conductors are immersed, or deep ditches
          filled with gas coke may be employed. Insulating screens may
          be placed in deep ditches dug behind the earths.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to an improved method of transmitting
          electrical telegraphic and telephonic signals from one point
          to another without the employment of wires connecting the two
          points.<br>
          <br>
          In my improved system of transmission, the two poles of the
          transmitting station are put to earth and the two conductors,
          upon which the receiving apparatus is mounted are also both
          put to earth; the signals emitted by the transmitting
          apparatus are transmitted to the receiving station through the
          earth alone.<br>
          <br>
          In order that my invention may be readily and clearly
          understood, I have represented in the accompanying drawing, by
          way of example only, a diagrammatic view of my device as a
          whole.<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="gb190117711.JPG"

          </div>
          <br>
          As shewn in the drawing, the transmitting station comprises a
          transmitter a one of the terminals of which is electrically
          connected to one of the poles of a source of electricity b
          whilst the other pole communicates with the earth; the second
          pole of the source of electricity is also run to earth and
          with this object the two conductors c d terminate in two
          porous pots e f embedded in the ground and filled with water.<br>
          <br>
          The receiving station comprises a receiver 9 such as a
          telephone for example, the conductors h i which are put to
          earth by the intermediary of two porous pots j k similar to
          those of the transmitting station.<br>
          <br>
          The porous pots of the receiving station should be arranged
          upon a line parallel with that which joins the two porous pots
          of the transmitting station, and they should be equidistant
          from an axis passing through the middle point of this line and
          at right angles to said axis.<br>
          <br>
          The porous pots may advantageously be replaced by deep ditches
          sunk down to the humid earth, filled with gas coal or coke and
          containing at their centre a plate of carbon which is a good
          conductor, to which the transmission and receiving wires
          respectively are attached.<br>
          <br>
          When contact is established by manipulation the transmitter a,
          the electric circuit passing through the source of electricity
          b, the conductor c, the porous pot e earth-connected to the
          other porous pot f the conductor d and the transmitter a, is
          closed. The current thus produced causes a change of condition
          in the ground ; all around the porous pots electric radiation
          is produced, the polarity of which is that of the
          corresponding conductor; its density decreases in proportion
          as it is further removed from the point of departure. This
          radiation is infinite with respect to space if nothing
          obstructs its passage.<br>
          <br>
          The radiation extends so much the further according as the
          distance between the two porous pots of the transmitting
          station is greater.<br>
          <br>
          These radiations, starting respectively from the porous pots e
          f thus create two zones one of which is positive and the other
          negative, the intersection of which constitutes % line
          absolutely neutral. It follows from this that the porous pots
          of the receiving station should be arranged upon either side
          of the neutral axis, because if these two earth connections
          were upon the same side they would both collect fluid of the
          same polarity, and in these conditions the receiver would not
          be traversed by any current.<br>
          <br>
          In order to collect the maximum of current at the receiving
          station, the two porous receiving pots should be as nearly as
          possible equidistant from the neutral axis, as if one of the
          two porous pots is nearer than the other, the difference of
          separation of that which is the furthest removed is not only
          lost but is prejudical since it causes useless resistance
          without adding anything to the effect.<br>
          <br>
          Experience has demonstrated that the disposition which
          furnishes the maximum of reception is that which consists in
          arranging the porous pots of the receiver at the same interval
          as separates the porous pots of the transmitting station.<br>
          <br>
          In order to install my method of electrical transmission, it
          is first of all necessary to draw a straight line a y
          connecting the two stations and .then to produce upon each of
          these stations a line proceeding from this line x y at right
          angles, the said perpendicular lines being of equal length.<br>
          <br>
          The transmitting and receiving appliances may be arranged at
          any convenient point on the conductor which connects the
          porous pots.<br>
          <br>
          In order that the whole of the radiation emitted may be
          utilised at the receiving station, the propagation of this
          radiation is prevented (at the transmitting station upon the
          side opposite to that on which the receiving station is
          situated by burying in the ground an insulating screen l which
          may be of glass, tarred fabric, ebonite or the like, or by
          sinking a sufficiently deep ditch with or without an
          insulating screen.<br>
          <br>
          Each time contact is made at the transmitter a, a sharp blow
          is audible at 'the receiving telephone g ; a second blow is
          heard when the circuit is broken.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that there may be arranged both at the
          transmitting and receiving station transmitting and receiving
          appliances of the greatest possible sensibility, either for
          serving as relays for telegraphic purposes, or for directly
          receiving and recording the signals; for example an ink siphon
          mounted upon a galvanometric frame, or any other suitable
          device.<br>
          <br>
          My method of transmission also permits of the transmission of
          speech; it is only necessary to replace the transmitter by an
          ordinary microphone interposed either directly upon the
          circuit, or arranged upon the primary of an induction coil,
          the secondary wire of which terminates at each extremity of
          the two porous pots.<br>
          <br>
          It will of course be understood that in practice each station
          comprises both a transmitter and a receiver. <br>

          Telegraph and telephone systems are arranged with the
          line-wire a connected to the center point of a battery c, c,
          the opposite poles of which are earthed and shunted by a
          normally closed circuit key g or microphone. The earth
          connections are made through non-polarizable cells f, f,
          containing, for example, two plates of copper immersed in
          copper-sulphate solution. The receiver is bridged between one
          earth and a switch h by which the transmitter is normally
          connected to line. The microphone may be inserted in the
          primary of an induction coil, the two secondaries of which
          oppose and are connected to the two earths and line. The two
          earth connections may be brought nearer together by the
          receiver and switch in the primary of the induction coil, so
          that this coil acts both to receive and transmit according to
          the position of the switch h. The microphone is arranged in
          the primary of a second induction coil.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to improvements in the transmission of
          electric currents and is more particularly adapted for
          telegraph and telephone lines, whereby condensation in the
          cable is avoided, while at the same time "tapping" of the ,
          line at any point thereof, for the purpose of ascertaining the
          purport of the message in transmission is rendered impossible.<br>
          <br>
          My improved system of transmission comprises a single line
          wire between the two stations and branched at these two
          stations to the zero point of a circuit, the two extremities
          of which are connected to earth or the sea ; the current
          furnished at each station by a local source of electricity
          being sent through the circuit by means of any convenient
          transmitting apparatus, (such as a Morse key, microphone or
          the like) either direct or by induction.<br>
          <br>
          Each station is furnished amongst other apparatus, with a
          receiving apparatus consisting of a key-instrument connected
          with the line-wire and permitting the current sent into the
          line from the transmitting station, to pass into a conductor
          leading direct to one of the wires running to earth and to
          which is connected the receiver proper.<br>
          <br>
          In order to avoid the polarization of the earth-wires, each
          such wire is connected with a conductor leading to a copper or
          other metallic blade immersed in an impolarizable saline
          solution in which is disposed a second similar blade connected
          to earth or sea.<br>

          In all the figures the same letters of reference designate the
          same parts.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Figure 1 the two stations are connected by a
          single line-wire a, branched at the zero point b of the
          battery formed of the different elements c of which the end
          poles are connected to earth, or to sea, by a conductor d e
          lead- ing to a copper or other metallic plate f immersed in a
          liquid of good conductivity, such as for example a solution of
          a sulphate of copper, in which another copper plate f1 is
          placed connected to earth, or sea by a conductor d1 .<br>
          <br>
          A transmitting apparatus g of any convenient construction,
          such as a Morse- key instrument, is connected with the two end
          poles of the battery in such a manner that in its position of
          rest it closes the circuit of the latter by establishing a
          short circuit so that no current passes, (or at most a very
          weak one) through the wire line a or through the earth-wires.<br>
          <br>
          To send a current to the receiving station, the key 9 is
          depressed whereupon the short circuit is interrupted and the
          current is caused to pass simultaneously through the line-wire
          a and the earth-wires d d1 e e*. The line-wire is in reality
          traversed by two currents in opposite directions, so that it
          is in an apparently neutral state, and thus no interception of
          the messages can be effected for the, reason that if a
          receiver be interpolated, at any point of. the line, said
          receiver would receive two currents in opposite directions'
          which would neutralize each other.<br>
          <br>
          Each station is furnished also with a receiving apparatus
          consisting of a commutator h connected with the line-wire a
          and permitting, when depressed, the current from the
          transmitter to pass into a wire i leading direct to one of the
          earth-wires (d1 for example) and in which is interpolated the
          receiving instrument j.<br>
          <br>
          To receive signals sent from the transmitting station, it 'is
          necessary that the commutator lever h be kept depressed, so as
          to cause the current from the transmitting station to pass
          into the wire In connection with the receiving instrument.<br>
          <br>
          'The connections may also be established in such a manner that
          when the commutator h is in its normal .position, it cuts the
          wire ( and connects the wire with that part of the said wire
          which leads to the other station ; in this case for
          transmitting a signal it is necessary to depress the
          commutator lever h previously so as to re-establish the
          continuity of the line-wire and the operator then acts on the
          key-lever g as hereinbefore stated.<br>
          <br>
          My arrangement is equally applicable to telephonic messages as
          will now be explained with reference to Figure 2, The
          transmitting instrument g is in this case replaced by a
          microphone g1 and the receiving instrument j is replaced by a
          telephone receiver j 1 the operation of the arrangement is
          exactly, the same as that above described.<br>
          <br>
          The vibrations of the microphone cut the short circuit and the
          current from the local, source of electricity thereupon passes
          over the line-wire a and the earth-wires d d1 c el as
          previously stated.<br>
          <br>
          The telephonic message is received in the same manner as
          before through the intervention of the commutator h which
          passes the current, sent from the transmitting station; to the
          telephonic receiving instrument jl.<br>
          <br>
          The line-wire may also be operated by induction currents a3 is
          indicated at Figure 3.<br>
          <br>
          The local circuit in which the transmitting apparatus (for
          instance, the microphone g1) is inserted comprises a primary
          winding k surrounding a central soft- iron core, or bundle of
          wires, l which is further provided with two secondary windings
          m m in opposite directions. The line wire a is connected to
          each of these secondary windings at the two extremities m1 n1
          of opposite polarity and the opposite extremities ms p2 are
          connected with the earth-wires d d c set in the manner already
          explained.<br>
          <br>
          When operating the transmitting apparatus or when speaking
          into the microphone 0 for example, induction currents are
          generated in the secondary windings m n and they then affect
          the receiving apparatus jl at the receiving station as already
          stated.<br>
          <br>
          The primary winding and the two secondary windings may have
          the three wires wound in the same direction upon the soft iron
          core and the two extremities of the primary convolutions are
          connected with the local circuit in which is interpolated the
          transmitter while two extremities of opposite polarities of
          the secondary convolutions are connected to line and the two
          osiers to earth as previously explained.<br>
          <br>
          In my improved transmitting arrangement the two earth wires at
          'each station must be the more separated from each other the
          longer the distance is between the two stations so that the
          resistance of the earth between the said earth-wires will be
          sufficient to cause the single line-wire to be traversed by
          the greatest possible quantity of the current.<br>
          <br>
          In order to reduce as far as possible the distance between the
          earth-wires the beginning of the single wire a and the wires
          rl rl' leading to earth are advantageously rm distance from
          the transmitting instrument and receiving instrument
          respectively at the telegraphic or telephonic station and thus
          permit the two earth connections of the two telegraphic or
          telephonic stations to be placed nearer each other.<br>
          <br>
          The telegraphic or telephonic station is then divided and the
          transmitting instrument is connected with the magnet with its
          earth connections and line wire a ' by two conducting wires kl
          k2 connected with the ends of the convolutions k which
          generates induction currents in the secondary windings m n
          (Figure 4).<br>
          <br>
          The current sent into the conducting wires k1 k2 and. passing
          through the convolutions k may itself be an induced current
          generated in the coil k3 when a current from the source of
          electricity c is passing through the. primary coil o through
          the action of the transmitting microphone gl for example.<br>
          <br>
          In the case when' the distance of the telegraphic or
          .telephonic transmitting station from its earth-connections is
          not too excessive the current traversing the&nbsp; conductors
          k1 1.:2 instead of being an induction current may be furnished
          direct by the source of electricity of such station, and
          naturally the, transmitting instrument, (microphone or 'key),
          and the source of electricity are then placed direct in the
          circuit;1 k2.<br>
          <br>
          An interrupter A interpositioned in the conductor kl permits
          of cutting the circuit in leading to the secondary coil k3 and
          of closing the circuit for the conductor i leading to the
          conductor k 2 in which is interpolated' the receiving
          instrument j.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the coil k is either inductor or induction according to
          whether there is transmission or reception.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be well understood that my system of transmission is
          entirely independent of the nature of the telegraphic or
          telephonic apparatus employed therewith, and that the source
          of electricity at the stations may be of any convenient kind,
          either derived from a battery, accumulators, dynamo,
          magneto-electric machine or the like.<br>

          <br>
          My improved system of transmission comprises a single
          line-wire between the two stations and branched at these two
          stations to the zero point of a circuit, the two extremities
          of which are connected to earth or the set; the current
          furnished at each station by a local source of electricity
          being sent through the circuit by means of any convenient
          transmitting apparatus, '(such as a Morse key .microphone or
          the like) either direct or by induction.<br>
          <br>
          Each station is furnished, amongst other apparatus, with a
          receiving apparatus consisting of a key-instrument connected,
          with the line-wire and permitting the current sent into the
          line from the transmitting station, to pass into a conductor
          leading direct to one of the wires running to earth and to
          which is connected the receiver proper.<br>
          <br>
          In order to avoid the polarization of the earth-wires, each
          such wire is connected with a conductor leading to a copper or
          other metallic blade immersed in an impolarizable saline
          solution in which is disposed a second similar blade connected
          to earth or sea..<br>
          <br>
          In order that my invention may be clearly understood and
          readily carried into effect I will now proceed to describe the
          same more fully with reference to the drawings accompanying my
          Provisional Specification in which:.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1, is a diagram showing my improved system as applied
          to telegraphy.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2, is a diagram showing the same applied to telephony.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 3 shows the system of Figure 2 with induced current.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 4 shows a modified arrangement.<br>
          <br>
          In all the figures the same letters of reference designate the
          same parts.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Figure 1 the two stations are connected by a
          single line-wire a branched at the zero point b of the battery
          formed of the different elements c of 'which 'the end poles
          are connected to earth, or to sea, by a conductor d e leading
          to a copper or other metallic plate f immersed in a liquid of
          good conductivity, such as for example a solution of sulphate
          of copper, in which another copper plate f1 is placed
          connected to earth, or sea by a. conductor d1 e1.<br>
          <br>
          A transmitting apparatus q of any convenient construction,
          such as a Morse-key instrument, is connected with the two end
          poles of the battery in such a manner that in its position of
          rest it closes the circuit of the latter by establishing a
          short circuit so that no current passes, (or at most a very
          weak one) through the wire line a or through the earth-wires.<br>
          <br>
          To send a current to the receiving station, the key g is
          depressed whereupon the short circuit is interrupted and the
          current is caused to pass simultaneously through the line-wire
          a and the earth-wires d d1 e el. The line wire is in reality
          traversed by two currents in opposite directions, so that it
          is in an apparently neutral state, and thus non interception
          of the messages can be effected for the reason that if a
          receiver be .interpolated at any point of the line, said
          receiver would receive two currents in opposite directions
          which would neutralize each other<br>
          <br>
          Each station is furnished also with a receiving apparatus
          consisting of a commutator h connected with the line-wire a
          and permitting, when depressed. the current from the
          transmitter to pass into a wire i leading direct to one of the
          earth-wires (d1 for example) and in which is interpolated the
          receiving instrument j.<br>
          <br>
          To receive signals sent from the transmitting station, it is
          necessary that the commutator lever h be kept depressed, so as
          to cause the current from the transmitting station to pass
          into the wire i in connection with the receiving instrument.<br>
          <br>
          The connections may also be established in such a manner that
          when the commutator h is in its normal position, it cuts the
          wire' a and connects the wire i with that part of the said
          wire which leads to the other station; in this case for
          transmitting a signal it is necessary to depress the
          commutator lever h previously so as to re-establish the
          continuity of the line-wire and the operator then acts on the
          key-lever as hereinbefore stated.<br>
          <br>
          My arrangement is equally applicable to telephonic messages as
          will now be explained with reference to Figure 2. The
          transmitting instrument g is in this case replaced by a
          microphone 1 and the receiving instrument j is replaced by a
          telephone receiver il the operation of the arrangement is
          exactly the same as that above described.<br>
          <br>
          The vibrations of the microphone cut the short circuit and the
          current from the local source of electricity thereupon passes
          over the line-wire a and the earth-wires d d1e e1 as
          previously stated,<br>
          <br>
          The telephonic message is received in the same manner as
          before through the intervention of the commutator h which
          passes the current sent from, the transmitting station to the
          telephonic receiving instrument j1.<br>
          <br>
          The line wire may also be operated by induction currents as is
          indicated at Figure 3.<br>
          <br>
          The local circuit in which the transmitting apparatus (for
          instance, the microphone g1). is inserted comprises a ,primary
          winding k surrounding a central soft iron core,, or bundle of
          wires, 1 which is further provided with two secondary windings
          m n in opposite directions. The line wire a is connected to
          each of these secondary windings at the two extremities in n1
          of opposite polarity and the opposite extremities m2 n2 are
          connected with the earth wires clt c ex in the manner already
          explained.<br>
          <br>
          When operating the transmitting apparatus or when speaking
          into the microphone for example, induction currents are
          generated in the secondary windings m n and they then affect
          the receiving apparatus l at the receiving station as already
          stated. The primary winding and the two secondary windings may
          have the three wires wound in the same direction upon the soft
          iron core and the two extremities of the primary convolutions
          are connected with the local circuit in which is interpolated
          the transmitter while two extremities of opposite polarities
          of the secondary convolutions are connected to line and the
          two others to earth as previously explained.<br>
          <br>
          In my improved transmitting, arrangement the. two earth wires
          at each. station must be the more separated from each other
          the longer the distance is between the two stations so that
          the resistance of the earth between the said earth-wires will
          be sufficient to cause the single line-wire to be traversed by
          the greatest possible quantity of the current.<br>
          <br>
          In order to reduce as far as possible the distance between the
          earth-wires the beginning of the single line wire a and the
          wires d d1 leading to earth are advantageously removed at a
          distance front the transmitting instrument and receiving
          instrument respectively at the telegraphic or telephonic
          station and thus permit the two earth connections of the two
          telegraphic or telephonic stations to be placed nearer each
          other.<br>
          <br>
          The telegraphic or telephonic station is then divided and the
          transmitting instrument is connected with the magnet with its
          earth connections and line wire z by two conducting wires k'
          k2 connected with the ends of the convolutions which generates
          Induction currents in the secondary windings m n (Figure 4).<br>
          <br>
          The current sent into the conducting wires k1 k2 .and, passing
          through the convolutions k may itself be an induced current
          generated in the coil k3 when a current from the source of
          electricity c is passing through the primary coil or through
          the action of the transmitting microphone f/I for example.<br>
          <br>
          In the case when the distance of the telegraphic or telephonic
          transmitting station from its earth connections is not too
          excessive the current traversing the conductors k le2 instead
          of. being an induction current may be furnished direct by the)
          source, of electricity of such station, and naturally
          transmitting instrument (microphone or key) and the source of
          electricity are then placed direct in the circuit leI k-S.<br>
          <br>
          An interrupter It interpolated in the conductor k1 permits of
          cutting the circuit in leading to the secondary coil k3 and of
          closing the circuit for in conductor i leading to the
          conductor 3 in which is interpolated the receiving instrument
          j1.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the coil k is either inductor or induction according to
          whether there is transmission or reception.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be well understood that my system of transmission is
          entirely independent of the nature of the telegraphic or
          telephonic apparatus employed therewith, and that the source
          of electricity at the stations may be of any convenient kind,<br>

          Telegraph and telephone lines are arranged so that any pair of
          lines bearing instruments may be used as a lead or return for
          another set of instruments without interference. Thus, as an
          example, four metallic circuits carry four separate sets of
          instruments individually but may have circuits A and B, C and
          D, used as other metallic circuits, or A and B may form a lead
          and C and D a return for a seventh metallic circuit. The
          Specification describes telephone instruments as used on the
          metallic circuits and telegraph or telephone instruments
          inserted in the earth return circuits. Fig. 1 shows a pair of
          lines L&lt;1&gt;, L&lt;2&gt; forming a metallic circuit and
          capable of use as the line with an earth return through
          L&lt;3&gt;, L&lt;3&gt;, the lines L&lt;2&gt; being connected
          to the loop at the centre of the secondary coil S', S&lt;2&gt;
          of the induction coil X. The receiving-instrument is shown in
          a bridge, such as Z. The positions of the transmitting T and
          receiving R instruments may be reversed. Each side of a metal
          loop may also be used as the line with an earth return.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to the connecting of telephonic and
          telegraphic instruments to conducting lines in such a manner
          that several telephonic and telegraphic messages can be
          simultaneously transmitted without interfering with one
          another.<br>

          Referring first to Fig. 1 the two lines Ll L2 are at each end
          connected as shewn at X through two equal secondary coils 8 1
          and s 2 wound with a primary coil P which is in circuit with a
          telephone transmitter T and local battery B.<br>
          <br>
          The lines L1 L2 are so connected to the secondary coils 8 1 s
          2 that the currents induced in the lines by the telephone
          transmitter are always in opposite directions.<br>
          <br>
          The telephone receiver R, as shewn at Z, is in circuit with a
          secondary coil 8 3 wound with a primary coil p connecting the
          two lines L1 L2.<br>
          <br>
          At a point l intermediate to the coils s1 s2 a third line L3
          is connected, this line being employed for telephone or
          telegraph transmission. When either of the telephone
          transmitters T is employed, the induced currents pass through
          the primary coil p thus causing the receivers R to act. But
          should any current flow by L3 it must flow in opposite
          directions through 8 1 and s2, and therefore in the same
          direction along the lines L1 L2 so that it cannot influence
          the receivers R nor the transmitters T. At each end a line L3
          may be connected as shewn by Y, Fig. 2, at l a point
          intermediate to two equal primary coils p1 p2 which connect
          the lines Ll LO and are wound with the secondary S3 of each
          telephone receiver R.<br>
          <br>
          With connections thus arranged any current flowing in the same
          direction through the coils pl p 2 actuates the telephone
          receivers R, whereas a current from L3 flows in opposite
          directions through the coils pl p 2 and therefore is
          ineffective on the receivers R. By combining several ordinary
          transmitters T and several of the receiver arrangements marked
          Y in Fig. 2 with a number of double lines as shewn in Fig. 3,
          a number of messages can be sent over these lines without
          interfering with each other.<br>
          <br>
          Thus referring to Fig. 3 the transmitter 1 works over the pair
          of lines L1 in the - usual way, one of these lines serving as
          metal return. In like manner the transmitter 2 works over the
          pair L2, transmitter 4 over the pair L 4 and transmitter 5
          over the pair L 5. Again the transmitter 3 works through the
          pair of lines L 3 and the two pairs L 1 and L 2, one of these
          pairs serving as metal return.<br>
          <br>
          In like manner the transmitter 6 works through the pair of
          lines L 6 and through the two pairs L 4 L 5. Finally the
          transmitter 7 works through the pairs of lines L 7 and through
          the two pairs L 3 and L 6 and the. four pairs L 1 L 2 L 4 and
          L 5, two of these pairs such as L 4 and L 5 serving as metal
          return.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously this system may be duplicated, and reduplicated so
          that one transmitter can be made to work over 8 pairs or 16
          pairs of lines or other multiple of 4.<br>
          <br>
          As shewn in Fig. 4 a telephone and a telegraph are connected
          to one line L having earth return. In this case X and Z are
          the telephone arrangements so marked in Fig. 1, K is the key,
          C the battery and D the receiver for telegraphing in the
          connection of Z to earth there is an adjustable resistance F
          to balance that of the line. As shewn in Fig. 5 two sets of
          the telegraphic connections shewn in Fig. 4 and two lines Ll
          L2 which may be both to one place or each to a different place
          with earth return are combined with one telephone arrangement.<br>
          <br>
          The transmitter T by its primary P induces currents in the
          secondaries $ 1 89 both in the same direction and therefore in
          opposite directions in the lines Ll L2. The currents being in
          the same direction in p1 and p2 act on the secondaries 1 3 of
          the receivers 1,. Currents from the telegraph gi dividing at
          11 pass in opposite directions through sl and pl and therefore
          do not affect the telephonic receivers. And in like manner the
          currents from the telegraph K2 are ineffective on the
          receivers.<br>
          <br>
          For the sake of clearness the primary and secondary coils have
          been shewn in the form of many lines side by side.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be understood however that they are wound in each
          case all on one bobbin.<br>
          <br>
          In Figs. 3,4 and 5 the arrangements are shewn at only one end
          of the conducting lines.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be understood however that they are symmetrically
          repeated at the other end as shewn in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
          <br>
          COMPLETE SPECIFICATION.<br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to the connecting of telephonic and
          telegraphic instruments to conducting lines in such a manner
          that several telephonic and telegraphic messages can be
          simultaneously transmitted without interfering with one other.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1 of the drawings accompanying my Provisional
          Specification shews diagrammatically connections for a
          telephone and also for another telephone or .telegraph to a
          double conducting line. Figure 2 shews a modification. Figure
          3 shews how seven sets of the connections may be applied to
          four double conducting . lines: Figure 4 shews the connections
          for a telephone and telegraph to a single line with earth
          return. Figure 5 shews connections for telephoning over two
          telegraph lines one of them forming a metal return.<br>
          <br>
          1 . Referring first to Figure 1 the two lines Ll L2 are at
          each end connected as shewn at X through two equal secondary
          coils s1 and 8 2 wound with a primary coil P which is in
          circuit with a telephone transmitter T and local battery B.<br>
          <br>
          The lines Ll L 2 are so connected to the secondary coils 8 1
          s'" that the currents induced in the lines by the telephone
          transmitter arc always in opposite directions.<br>
          <br>
          The telephone receiver R, as shewn at Z, is in circuit with a
          secondary coil s3 wound with a primary coil p of high
          resistance connecting the two lines L1 L2.<br>
          <br>
          At the point intermediate to the coils sr s 2 a third line L3
          is connected, this line being employed for telephone or
          telegraph transmission. 'When either of tho telephone
          transmitters T is employed, the induced currents pass through
          tho primary coil p thus causing the receivers R to act. But
          should any current flow by L3 it must flow in opposite
          directions through sl and s2, and therefore in the same
          direction along the lines Ll L2 so that it cannot influence
          the receivers It nor the transmitters T. At each end a line L3
          may be, connected as shewn by Y, Figure 2, at l a point
          intermediate to two equal primary coils p1 p2 which connect
          the lines L1 L2 and are wound with the secondary 8 3 of each
          telephone receiver R. With connections thus arranged any
          current flowing in the same direction through the coils yx
          actuates the telephone receivers R, whereas a current from L3
          flows in opposite directions through the coils p1 p2 and
          therefore is ineffective on the receivers R. By combining
          several ordinary transmitters T and several of the receiver
          arrangements marked Y in Figure 2 with a number of double
          lines as shewn in Figure 3, a number of messages can be sent
          over these lines without interfering with each other.<br>
          <br>
          Thus referring to Figure 3 the transmitter 1 works over the
          pair of lines L 1 in the usual way, one of these lines serving
          as metal return.. In like manner tho transmitter 2 works over
          the pair L 2, transmitter 4 over the pair L 4 and transmitter
          5 over the pair L 5. Again the transmitter 3 works through the
          pair of lines L 3 and the two pairs L 1 and L 2, one of these
          pairs serving as metal return.<br>
          <br>
          In like manner the transmitter ti works through the pair of
          lines JLA b and through the two pairs L 4 L 5. Finally the
          transmitter 7 works through the pairs of lines L 7 and through
          the two pairs L 3 and L 6 and the four pairs L 1 L 2 L 4 and L
          5, two of these pairs such as L 4 and L 5 serving as metal
          return.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously this system may be duplicated, and reduplicated so
          that) one transmitter can be made to work over 8 pairs or 16
          pairs of lines or other multiple of 4.<br>
          <br>
          As shewn in Figure 4 a telephone and a telegraph are connected
          to one line L having earth return. In this case X and Z are
          the telephone arrangements so marked in Figure 1, K is the
          key, C the battery and D the receiver for telegraphing.<br>
          <br>
          In the connection of p to earth there is an adjustable
          resistance F to balance that of the line. As shewn in Figure 5
          two sets of the telegraphic connections shewn in Figure 4 and
          two lines Ll L2 which may be both to one place or each to a
          different place with earth return are combined with one
          telephone arrangement.<br>
          <br>
          The transmitter T by its primary P induces currents in the
          secondaries sl S2 both in the same direction and therefore in
          opposite directions in the lines L1 L2. The currents being in
          the same direction in pI and pS act on the secondaries i1 of
          the receivers It.<br>
          <br>
          Currents from the telegraph K1 dividing at 1 1 pass in
          opposite directions through sl and I &gt; I and therefore do
          not affect the telephonic receivers. And in like manner the
          currents from the telegraph K2 are ineffective on the
          receivers.<br>
          <br>
          The connections of p1 and p2 to earth may have suitable
          resistances as shewn at F in Figure 4.<br>
          <br>
          For the sake of clearness the primary and secondary coils have
          been shewn in the form of many lines side by side.<br>
          <br>
          It is to be understood however that they are wound in each
          case all on one bobbin.<br>
          <br>
          In Figures 3,4 and 5 the arrangements are shewn at only one
          end of the conducting lines.<br>

          The present invention relates to an improved induction coil in
          order to obtain induction currents in very short periods.
          These currents, whose durations are extremely short 5, enjoy
          special properties which find application mainly in telegraphy
          and wireless telephony.<br>
          <br>
          This induction coil is characterized by the absence of the
          magnetic core and the winding mode of the inductor and the
          armature on a short length coil, but a very large diameter,

          Telephone transmission system of mounting each station
          transmitter and or serial receivers and to bring the two
          stations by three son line, including 5o first two
          respectively together the poles of the two stations and the
          third is mounted derivation at a point of each station caught
          between the transmitters and the receiver or receivers, one or
          even two of these three son may be replaced by equivalent
          landings. <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          The present invention provides a way to increase the distance
          at which it is possible to call or to increase the intensity
          of sound transmitted at a given distance 5.<br>
          <br>
          When installing a regular telephone line, it is customary to
          bring the two stations using two wires, one for the second
          round for the return; at-10 there is no fear induction from
          neighboring lines, one connecting the two stations by a thread
          alone and return through the ground at each station.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 of the accompanying drawing shows the 15 most simple
          provision of a regular line with two son; there is one at each
          station magnetic phone, a1 met by both son line c and d; when
          speaking in the phone, the phone is 30 a1 receiver and vice
          versa; this provision is entirely satisfactory from the
          standpoint of the actual transmission, but it has the obvious
          disadvantage that the two parties can not break interfere,
          each necessarily listen to while the other speaks .<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="fr377785.JPG"
              height="759" width="468"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          To overcome this disadvantage, it immediately offered to have
          each transmitter station a phone or a 1 and a receiver or
          telephone b bl, allowing 3 to the two interlocutors to talk
          while listening. This solution suffers a disadvantage from the
          standpoint of the transmission; in fact, as shown in Fig. 2,
          the four phone a, b, a}, bx 3 are mounted in series on the
          line cd, so that the sound transmitted by a transmitter has or
          a1 necessarily travels in addition interesting b1 or b
          receptor both other phones of the circuit. The telephone
          circuit thus unnecessarily h has a high resistance which
          reacts disadvantageously either on the possible length of the
          line cd, either the intensity of the sound transmitted to a
          given line length.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to a device easy positive h to
          remedy the drawbacks both of the two transmission systems
          according to Fig. 1 and 2 and make a new telephone
          transmission system providing both the benefits of the 5 two
          known systems.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in Fig. 3, this invention is simply to dispose
          between the two stations a third e line wire terminating at
          each station between the telephone transmitter 5 tor a or a1
          and the receiver phone b or b1. In these conditions the wall
          sent by "will be fully received by b1 without crossing
          unnecessarily b and a1 resistance and vice versa speech
          transmitted by a1 will be fully received by b.<br>
          <br>
          The need for three son line c, d, e 5 is required when the
          line is around other transmissions; but when isolated, it can
          simplify the transmission as shown in Fig. k or 5.<br>
          <br>
          According to FIG. h, the wire line drifted o-tion e is deleted
          and replaced by a ground f and f1 taken at each station
          between the transmitter and receiver.<br>
          <br>
          In special cases, it is even possible to reduce the line to a
          single wire e in '5 with each station two landings g, h and #
          1, h1), the receiver and transmitter are each disposed station
          in series between the two landings; under these conditions,
          the two conductors c and d are formed by o the ground and
          there is no longer a single line wire e.<br>
          <br>
          In the above, to simplify the description and drawings, we
          assumed the exclusive use of magnetic phones; 5 Fig. 6 shows
          the circuit diagram in the case of induction phones. In this
          case each position i includes a battery, a transmitter
          microphone and primary k of an induction coil, mounted in
          series o on a closed circuit; the line circuit c, d comprises
          series headphones b, b and b1, b1 and side and ll of the coil.
          In this<br>
          <br>
          If the invention is to attach the derivative e line wire
          between the two receivers b, b or i1, A1 on the one hand and
          the secondary or ll 35 on the other hand, as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          The result of these provisions is summed up by the possibility
          of quadrupling of the intensity of the reception for a given
          length of line, or the length of the line Zio maintaining the
          same intensity.<br>

          <br>
          To understand our invention, it is good to remember that&nbsp;
          in an ordinary telegraph line a thread, more or less isolated,
          from a point to another, communicates with earth at each end.
          A power source; and a transmitter unit are sandwiched between
          the starting line and earth. Upon arrival, a receiver also
          communicates with the line and the earth.<br>
          <br>
          We know that each of the posts supporting the line passes a
          small amount of power that is lost in the ground. Large amount
          of current is now lost all <b>plus 1 large 5</b> that the
          distance between stations is itself larger and, consequently,
          the number of' poles is higher. Loss can become considerable,
          without preventing transmissions. It may even happen that the
          ao thread without being broken, drags on earth there for a
          certain length of son'parcours and continues to allow the
          current of a shift to another, albeit very weakly,<br>
          <br>
          The experience proved us uninsulated conductor could even, for
          certain distances, be simply placed on the ground and that
          transmissions would nevertheless be possible.<br>
          <br>
          We are able to continue, transmit signals is greatly increased
          if, at each end, the uninsulated wire touching the ground, met
          in a well-insulated wire that extends the line to a ground to
          the point where so are transmitters and receivers.<br>
          <br>
          It is understood that the ground at the end of a secluded part
          forces the return current from sinking into the depths of the
          earth ho and that, consequently, there is an infinitely small
          closure point where the uninsulated wire touches the ground.
          In other words, the loss suffered in ground contact, the
          uninsulated wire, is even less than each end of uninsulated
          wire so is an insulated wire from the ground at a greater
          distance.<br>
          <br>
          Hence, if the lead wire, instead of iron, consisting of
          a&nbsp; much less conductive material, coal, for example,
          everything would be the same way. We also recognized that even
          when iron, coal or other similar material, are replaced by
          placed water, salt if possible, and, consequently, by a
          stretch of sea or any other part of sea whose geographic
          provision lends itself to this kind of installation. <br>
          <br>
          When it comes to cross an arm of the sea, the isolated line
          extension is placed preferably in the direction of the
          straight line through the two points to be connected.<br>
          <br>
          In case one transmission on a role, isolated leagues will be
          perpendicular to the straight line joining the two stations.<br>
          <br>
          Isolated lines will not be too long, and therefore, will
          provide not only coast to coast, but between two points
          inland. The thickness of the salt water layer being at even
          greater depths, only about the thickness of the land mass, the
          proportions remain between water and adequate the earth so
          that water plays exactly the same role that the uninsulated
          conductor touching the ground.<br>
          <br>
          To make our evplications as clear as possible, we have shown
          diagram-matically, in the accompanying drawing, an
          installation in which our invention is applied.<br>
          <br>

          A is the sea (Fig. I) and 13 b are both shores, c and d both
          stations, e and f insulated, and the plates located in the
          water, i and it updates earth.<br>
          We see that the sea is an extension isolated son e and f, and
          it plays the role of an uninsulated conductor based on floor.<br>
          <br>
          To make it clear how 3 o operates the propagation of electric
          currents, we assume an isolated line (Fig. A) within two
          earthed m and n. If the current is moving in the direction of
          the <b>llèche</b>, electricity arriving ashore in n
          flourishes spheres 3.) concentric o, p, q, etc., all points of
          each sphere simultaneously receiving the same amount of
          electricity if the propagation medium is uniform. Be grounded
          in r therefore receive the current along the earth m, r and if
          this land is connected by a line by t, s land to another, even
          very close to her, the current finding less resistance in the
          isolated line in the middle (Jun separates the two nets land,
          will follow this line, as shown in llèche a. It will be thus
          possible to establish a wireless communication between any
          point of the line / on which find transmitting devices, and
          any point on line T which will be <b>appareds</b> receptors.<br>
          <br>
          To establish simultaneously on each of the leagues and t, a
          position transmitter and a receiver will require that the line
          is the same length as the line 1, J J as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
          <br>
          If the medium is found to be twice as conductor between h and
          r between m and n, on the one hand, and between r and s on the
          other hand, the lines l and t may have as half the
          length&nbsp; of the distance between the points n and r
          (fig.û).<br>
          <br>
          Of course, transmissions based on the principle that we have
          indicated, may be made by taking as con- bo different
          producers, not only the earth and the sea water, but the earth
          and air, land in this case, acting as a better conductor
          brought by the air; the insulated wire from the earth lead to
          the air at each station 7. tion to a more or less remote
          distance according to the distance that would take. It is
          obvious that the latter provision, the sea and fresh water
          advantageously replace the earth. 7°<br>
          <br>
          In summary, we claim as our exclusive property, the new
          method, described above, transmission without telegraph and
          telephone currents, said transmission mode of making pass in a
          conductive medium the current emitted by the base station and
          to receive on arrival in this current an insulated wire of
          suitable length, which are sandwiched the receivers and
          resulting in a&nbsp; second medium whose specific conductivity
          is less than that of the first medium, but passes the total
          quantity of electricity because of its mass which is greater
          than that first medium, an insulated wire, on which the
          transmitting devices is also leading into the second medium,
          so that the first medium is an extension of two isolated
          lines, and the second medium acts as the return wire, the two
          isolated lines to be used both for shipping and for the
          reception.<br>

          In an electrical circuit consisting of a power source and a
          metallic conductor whose ends are grounded, which closes the
          circuit, the earth acts as 5 driver not only a straight line
          between the two landings, but on a almost infinite extent;
          However, with a power density decreasing in proportion to the
          distance.<br>
          <br>
          If parts of the ground are better conductors than others
          (because of the moisture, the saltiness of the water or any
          other cause) the current preferably passes through these parts
          describing curves or bends as does a river following the
          slopes of the terrain.<br>
          <br>
          It follows that if, on part of the land used as return
          conductor,&nbsp; it artificially creates a better conductor
          line as the earth, it will be traversed by the current in
          preference to any other lower conductive part.<br>
          <br>
          The effect is much more complete and can collect the current
          and note its existence when the best conductive line is
          insulated from earth and communicates with it by its ends. The
          current that would have crossed the land finding a wise not
          easier by the wire preferably follows and restores much faster
          electrical neutrality of the ground. It is isolated by cutting
          the line at any point that can be inserted in the course of
          the current instruments ( telegraphic or telephonic receivers)
          that can detect its existence.<br>
          <br>
          It is understood that if the isolated artificial line is a
          very good conductor, if its ends are connected to metal
          surfaces large enough in contact with the ground, the closing
          of the circuit will cause the ground to be in a state of
          electrical neutrality absolute.<br>
          <br>
          Under these conditions, if a current electric is sent
          intermittently in the metal line, charge the earth, for each
          issue, a certain amount of electricity instantaneously
          discharge into the isolated artificial line. <br>
          <br>
          Experience has shown that these phenomena can occur even when
          there is almost no gap between the two landings transmitter
          station or between two plates that collect the&nbsp; color
          rant crossing the line isolated the receiving station, to the
          condition that at each station the plates which lead to the
          two lands are carefully insulated from each other by means of
          a sufficiently thick insulating separation that no induction
          effect or condensation on one another can occur, and fairly
          large compared to the dimensions of the plates to prevent
          current from closing on itself too close to the to start. The
          current is so obliged to flourish "right and left of the
          landings, and the point where the positive and negative
          electric waves begin to reach is considerably related. I can
          further increase the desired effect by minimizing the current
          closure on itself through a number of insulating walls
          arranged below the plates to prevent <b>farm-i o ture</b> of
          the circuit by the depth of the earth, on the side opposite
          that in which the transmission must be received and, if
          necessary, above the plates.<br>
          <br>
          In general, the plates will be placed vertically on either
          side of an insulating wall, their smaller dimensions being
          turned to the opposite position.<br>
          <br>
          I can also use a wide insulating tube divided in two by a
          thick wall normal to isolated generators. The plates will be
          set back to back on either side of this partition in the
          interior of the tube and placed in communication with the
          outer conductor through insulated <b>son</b>.<br>
          <br>
          The tube may be straight, or consists of two parts forming
          between them an angle properly calculated so that the circuit
          is closed by the earth is done by almost entirely in the <b>3
            o</b> where the current is sent.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that the installation is completed by
          transmitters and telegraph or telephone receivers that may be
          any, as the source of electricity.<br>
          <br>
          I claim as my exclusive new property above described
          transmission and reception of telegraph and telephone currents
          without other driver as land or water, said system of
          separating the two landings each position by established
          insulating material to prevent the production of induction
          phenomena of condensation and the circuit closing on or by the
          depth of the earth, and force the air to flourish right and
          left, so that they can begin to get to and distant from the
          transmitter station, the two earthed of each position can thus
          without drawbacks, are moved towards one another until they
          fit on either side of the same insulating wall.<br>
