      Fontus is a self-filling water bottle for your bicycle. This
      device collects the moisture contained in the air, condenses it
      and stores it as safe drinking water. Powered by solar cells, it
      can harvest up to 0,5 l water in an hour´s time under the right
      climatic conditions. <br>

      <b>The Inspiration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to UN statistics, More than 2 billion people in more
      than 40 countries live in regions with water scarcity. In 2030,
      47% of the world´s population will be living in areas of high
      water stress. Water scarcity may be the most underestimated
      resource issue facing the world today. Every measure to ease this
      upcoming crisis is a welcome one.<br>
      <br>
      Harvesting water from the air is a method that has been practised
      for more than 2000 years in certain cultures mostly in Asia and
      Central America. The Earth’s atmosphere contains around 13.000 km3
      of mostly unexploited freshwater. This project is an attempt to
      discover these resources.<br>
      <br>
      My goal was to create a small, compact and self-sufficient device
      able to absorb humid air, separate water molecules from air
      molecules and store water in liquid form in a bottle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stages of Development</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I conducted a series of experiments trying to identify the ideal
      conditions, materials and cooling systems. I simulated different
      climatic conditions in my bathroom, modifying the air temperature
      and humidity. After more than 30 experiments, I finally achieved a
      constant drop-flow of one drop of condensed water per minute.
      After developing a functioning inner system, I designed a compact
      and practical hull which can be easily attached to a bicycle,
      integrates the water bottle and can be comfortably handled.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Function</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fontus can be applied in two different areas. Firstly, it may be
      interpreted as a sporty bicycle accessory. Useful on long bike
      tours, the constant search for freshwater sources such as rivers
      and gas stations can cease to be an issue since the bottle
      automatically fills itself up.<br>
      <br>
      Secondly, it might be a clever way of acquiring freshwater in
      regions of the world where groundwater is scarce but air humidity
      is high. Experiments suggest that the bottle could harvest around
      0,5l water in one hour's time in regions with high temperature and
      humidity values.<br>
      <br>
      <b>How it works:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to achieve condensation, one must cool hot, humid air
      down. The device has a small cooler installed in its centre called
      Peltier Element. This cooler is divided in two: When powered by
      electricity, the upper side cools down and the bottom side gets
      hot. The more you cool the hot side down, the colder the upper
      side will get. Consequently, these two sides are separated and
      isolated from each other.<br>
      <br>
      The air enters the bottom chamber at a high speed when moving
      forward with the bike and cools the hot side down. Moreover, when
      the air enters the upper chamber it is stopped by little walls
      perforated non-linearly, reducing its speed in order to give the
      air the needed time to lose its water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      The condensing structure represents the largest surface in the
      smallest space possible. This provides a large surface for
      condensation to happen. Droplets then flow through a pipe into a
      bottle. The bottle can then be turned to a vertical position and
      losened. Every kind of PET 0,5l bottle fits. <br>

      It’s every cyclist’s nightmare – discovering that they have run
      out of water half way up a hill on a sweltering day.<br>
      <br>
      But the days of topping up water bottles may soon be over, now
      that one designer has created a bottle that collects and condenses
      moisture from the air while a bike is in motion.<br>
      <br>
      The ‘Fontus’ bottle uses the principle of thermoelectric cooling
      to fill up with water when attached to a bike frame (pictured).
      It's named after the Roman god of wells and springs<br>
      <br>
      Kristof Retezár, an industrial design student at the University of
      Applied Arts in Vienna came up with the idea, and a finalist in
      the 2014 James Dyson Award.<br>
      <br>
      Named after the Roman god of wells and springs, the upper part of
      the bottle holder is cooled by electricity generated by solar
      panels, while the bottom heats up.<br>
      <br>
      This means that as the bike moves, air is sucked inside and moves
      through the upper chamber of the holder, where it cools down. The
      air condenses into water and drips into the bottle attatched
      below.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Useful on long bike tours, the constant search for freshwater
      sources such as rivers and gas stations can cease to be an issue
      since the bottle automatically fills itself up,’ he wrote on the
      James Dyson Award website.<br>
      <br>
      The upper part of the bottle is cooled by electricity generated by
      solar panels, while the bottom heats up. This means that as the
      bike moves, air is sucked inside and moves through the upper
      chamber of the bottle, where it cools down. It condenses into
      water and drips into the bottle (a cross section of the design is
      shown)<br>

      The upper part of the bottle is cooled by electricity generated by

      water and drips into the bottle (a cross section of the design is
      shown)<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOW DOES FONTUS WORK? </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The bike-mounted device that the bottle attaches to, has a small
      cooler at its centre called Peltier Element.<br>
      <br>
      This cooler is divided in two. Solar panels generate electricity
      to cool the upper part down, while the bottom side warms up.<br>
      <br>
      As air enters the bottom chamber of the bottle at high speed -
      when the bike is moving forwards - the hot side of the device is
      cooled down, which in turn cools the cold side further.<br>
      <br>
      When the air enters the top chamber it is stopped with 'little
      walls' that are perforated, and the water condenses.<br>
      <br>
      Droplets flow through a pope into the bottle, which can be turned
      into a vertical position and loosened.<br>
      <br>
      Any standard 500ml bottle can be used.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Retezár said that the device can harvest half a litre of water
      in an hour under the right climatic conditions - in temperatures
      of around 20°C (68°F) and 50 per cent humidity.<br>
      <br>
      The bottle has a filter to keep dust out of the water, but does
      not yet purify it, which may be important the Fontus bottle is
      used in a polluted city.<br>
      <br>
      He told The Huffington Post that the prototype cost between $25
      (£16) and $40 (£26) to make, but he plans on refining the design
      before bringing it to market and setting a price for consumers.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Retezár has not ruled out raising money via crowdfunding and
      aside from consumer cycling applications, believes the product
      could be used to acquire fresh water in regions of the world where
      groundwater is scarce but air humidity is high.<br>
      <br>
      ‘Harvesting water from the air is a method that has been practised
      for more than 2,000 years in certain cultures mostly in Asia and
      Central America,’ he said.<br>
      <br>
      ‘The Earth’s atmosphere contains around 8,077 cubic miles (13,000
      km3) of mostly unexploited freshwater. This project is an attempt
      to discover these resources.’<br>
      <br>
      The bottle may be able to help the two billion people in more than
      40 countries who live in regions with water scarcity. It is
      predicted that 47 per cent of the world’s population will be
      living in areas of high water stress in 2030.<br>
      <br>
      Industrial design student, Mr Retezár said that the device can
      harvest half a litre of water in an hour under the right climatic
      conditions - in temperatures of around 20°C (68°F) and 50 per cent
      humidity. A diagram of the different parts of the device is shown.<br>
