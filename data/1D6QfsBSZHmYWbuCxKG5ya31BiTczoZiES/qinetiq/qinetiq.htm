        <p><b><font size="+1">Beetle-Based Water Harvesting</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>By 2025, the United Nations forecasts that 1.8 billion people
        will be living in countries or&nbsp; regions with water scarcity
        and two thirds of the world’s population could be under
        conditions of water stress. </p>
      <p>Climate change is expected to aggravate water problems via more
        extreme weather events. Many intelligent and improved management
        options can overcome these challenges and one may rest on the
        extraordinary ability of the Namib Desert beetle. </p>
      <p>The beetle lives in a location that receives a mere half an
        inch of rain a year yet can harvest water from fogs that blow in
        gales across the land several mornings each month. </p>
      <p>Enter a team from the University of Oxford and the UK defense
        research firm QinetiQ. They have designed a surface that mimics
        the water-attracting bumps and water-shedding valleys on the
        beetle’s wing scales that allows the insect to collect and
        funnel droplets thinner than a human hair. </p>
      <p>The patchwork surface hinges on small, poppy-seed sized glass
        spheres in a layer of warm wax that tests show work like the
        beetle’s wing scales. </p>
      <p>Trials have now been carried out to use the beetle film to
        capture water vapour from cooling towers.&nbsp; Initial tests
        have shown that the invention can return 10 per cent of lost
        water and lead to cuts in energy bills for nearby buildings by
        reducing a city’s heat sink effect. </p>
      <p>An estimated 50,000 new water-cooling towers are erected
        annually and each large system evaporates and loses over 500
        million litres. </p>
      <p>Other researchers, some with funding from the US Defense
        Advanced Research Agency, are mimicking the beetle water
        collection system to develop tents that collect their own water
        up to surfaces that will “mix” reagents for “lab-on-a-chip”
        applications. </p>

      <p>The Namib Desert beetle lives in one of the driest places on
        earth - just one half of an inch of rain per year. When early
        morning fog offers the hint of moisture, the beetle is ready to
        take a drink - from the amazing surface on its back. MIT
        researchers, inspired by the beetle, have created a material
        that can capture and control tiny amounts of water. </p>

      </center>
      <p>When the slightest fog blows horizontally across the beetle's
        back, water droplets just 15-20 microns in diameter start to
        accumulate on the bumps on its back. The bumps are surrounded by
        waxy water-repelling channels. When a bump collects enough water
        to form a big droplet, it rolls down a channel right into the
        beetle's mouth. </p>
      <p>MIT researchers <b>Robert Cohen</b> and <b>Michael Rubner</b>
        were inspired by a 2001 article in the journal Nature describing
        the beetle, and thought it would be a good candidate for
        biomimicry - the imitation of a natural-world solution to a
        problem. </p>

          (MIT researchers Cohen and Rubner in situ in their lab)</p>
      </center>
      <p>Their newly designed material combines a superhydrophilic
        (water-attracting) surface with superhydrophobic
        (water-repelling) surface. A Teflon-like substance is applied to
        a surface (for water-repulsion); silica nanoparticles and
        charged polymers help create a rough texture to attract
        droplets. The research was funded by our good friends at DARPA.
      </p>
      <p>Science fiction writer Frank Herbert wrote about this same idea
        in his remarkable 1965 novel Dune. Most of the novel takes place
        on the planet Dune, which has no liquid surface water at all. In
        order to plant vegetation, special materials are used to create
        dew collectors, to gather even the tiniest amount of moisture. </p>
      <p>"Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg," she said,
        "how do you suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted
        most tenderly in its own little pit. The pits are filled with
        smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns them white. You can
        see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high
        place. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the
        chromoplastic reverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with
        extreme rapidity. The surface condenses moisture out of the air.
        That moisture trickles down to keep our plants alive." </p>
      <p>In the dew collectors of Herbert's imagination, a special
        material changes from light to dark in order to pull moisture
        out of the air. Cohen and Rubner's new material should be able
        to do the same trick using a different technology. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> -- The surface comprises alternating liquid
        attracting 13, 51 and liquid repelling 12, 52 materials. The
        diameter of the droplets is controlled by the size of the
        smallest dimension of the liquid attracting material. The
        surface may be textured and/or form a pattern. The surface is
        used for collecting and purifying water. It is also used in a
        printing process. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a surface suitable for promoting the
        formation of droplets of a liquid on said surface in such a
        manner as to control the droplet dimensions. The invention is in
        particular suitable for enabling collection of that liquid from
        a wind-blown fog or mist. </p>
      <p>It is well-known that certain materials exhibit surfaces that
        attract water whilst others actively repel it, such materials
        being described as hydrophilic and hydrophobic respectively. It
        is also still known that water is attracted or repelled due to
        the fact that it is a polar liquid, and that any similar polar
        liquid will be influenced in the same manner by such surfaces.
        It should also be noted that non-polar liquids such as oils will
        be attracted to a hydrophobic surface and repelled by a
        hydrophilic surface. </p>
      <p>There are a number of situations where the collection and
        storage of liquids is of importance. One such situation is where
        the environment is arid and there is no easily accessible source
        of water. Another situation could be when chemicals are in
        vapour form during distillation. </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a surface
        suitable for promoting the formation of liquid droplets of a
        tailored size. It is a further object to collect said droplets.
      </p>
      <p>According to a first aspect of the present invention a surface
        suitable for promoting the formation of droplets of a liquid
        comprises regions of liquid repelling and liquid attracting
        material alternating in at least one direction across the
        surface whereby the diameter of the droplets is controlled by
        the size of the smallest dimension of the liquid attracting
        material. </p>
      <p>If the liquid is polar, hydrophilic regions of the surface
        attract the polar liquid and the hydrophobic regions repel the
        polar liquid. If the liquid is an oil, the hydrophobic regions
        attract the liquid and the hydrophilic regions repel the liquid.
      </p>
      <p>The smallest dimension (the width) of the liquid attracting
        regions determines the size of the droplet to be formed. There
        is a maximum diameter that a stable droplet can attain which is
        related to the width of the liquid attracting regions. The
        liquid repelling regions separating the liquid attracting
        regions are preferably of at least the same width, so as to
        prevent overlap of droplets on neighbouring liquid attracting
        regions. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the liquid attracting regions take the form of
        discrete regions on a liquid repelling substrate i.e. each
        liquid attracting region is isolated from other liquid
        attracting regions. This enables the droplets to form in
        isolation, constraining them in two dimensions and limiting
        their surface contact area with the liquid attracting substrate
        (and hence their adhesion to the surface). </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the surface is textured such that
        the regions of liquid attracting material protrude in relation
        to the regions of liquid repelling material. This allows for the
        droplets, when formed, to sit proud in relation to the liquid
        repelling regions, and encourages detachment of the droplets
        from the liquid attracting material when a specified droplet
        size is attained i.e. when the diameter of the droplet has
        reached its maximum stable size. </p>
      <p>Preferably the said smallest dimension of the liquid attracting
        material regions is more than 150 .mu.m, more preferably more
        than 200 .mu.m, and for certain applications is preferably more
        than 300 .mu.m, 400 .mu.m, 500 .mu.m, or even at least 600
        .mu.m. Preferably the said smallest dimension is in the said one
        direction of the surface. If the said smallest direction is in
        another direction from the said one direction, then in the said
        one direction the smallest dimension of the liquid attracting
        material region in the said one direction preferably also has
        the stated preferred minimum sizes (more than 150, 200, 300,
        400, 500, or at least 600 .mu.m). </p>
      <p>The said surface is preferably substantially planar. It is also
        envisaged that the surface may be curved, e.g. concave or
        convex, or be a combination of curved and substantially planar
        parts. Where we say that a surface is substantially planar, this
        specifically includes substantially planar surfaces with regions
        projecting or protruding from the surface, e.g. protruding above
        the surface. </p>
      <p>The surface is preferably designed in use to be inclined to the
        horizontal plane. This is described in more detail below with
        reference to other categories of the invention. It is mentioned
        here because, especially where the surface is substantially
        planar, the said one direction of the said surface is preferably
        the direction of the surface that defines the incline. More
        specifically, when the surface is inclined the angle of
        inclination is preferably defined as the angle between the
        horizontal and any line drawn along the surface in the said one
        direction. </p>
      <p>Preferably the said smallest dimension of the liquid attracting
        region is at most 5 mm, more preferably at most 4 mm, and for
        certain applications is preferably at most 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, or
        0.8 mm (800 .mu.m). </p>
      <p>Where we talk about the smallest dimension of the liquid
        attracting region this will typically be the width, depending on
        the shape of the region. Thus, for example if the liquid
        attracting regions are in the shape of stripes, it will be the
        width of the stripes. Similarly if the liquid attracting regions
        are in the shape of discrete dots, it will be the width or
        diameter of the dots. For other less regular shapes it will be
        whatever is the smallest dimension in any direction. Preferably
        where there are a plurality of liquid attracting regions these
        will all be of similar shape and size. However it is envisaged
        that combinations of shapes and sizes of liquid attracting
        regions could also be used. </p>
      <p>The liquid repelling regions are preferably at least as wide as
        the liquid attracting regions, and possibly twice as wide.
        Preferably the width or distance of liquid repelling region
        separating adjacent liquid attracting regions is at least 400
        .mu.m, more preferably at least 600 .mu.m, especially at least
        800 .mu.m, or even at least 1 or 2 mm. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above the smallest dimension of the liquid
        attracting regions control the diameter of the droplets formed
        on the surface. This can best be explained by considering a
        preferred substantially planar surface in its preferred use
        position in which it is inclined to the horizontal. In this
        orientation, when small liquid droplets from a vapour adjacent
        the surface strike the inclined surface, if they strike a liquid
        attracting region then they may form a droplet attached to the
        liquid attracting region, but if they strike a liquid repelling
        region they will roll down the inclined surface to the nearest
        liquid attracting region. The droplets grow, by joining with
        other droplets that attach to the same liquid attracting region,
        until they reach a point at which their surface contact area
        covers the liquid attracting region. Beyond this size the
        droplets are gaining in mass without any increase in contact
        area, so that the droplet has to move into the liquid repelling
        regions. As this happens the force of gravity increases without
        any increase in surface adhesion, causing the droplet to move
        down the inclined slope. If the surface is in a calm environment
        the droplets will fall directly down the slope, but if the
        surface is facing into a headwind the droplets may be blown
        randomly across the surface by the wind. Preferably the surface
        spacing and the size of the liquid attracting regions is
        sufficiently large that the droplets will roll down the slope
        only once they are sufficiently heavy to roll directly downwards
        even against a headwind. </p>
      <p>According to a second aspect of the present invention a method
        of collecting a liquid carried by or condensed out of a vapour
        comprises passing a vapour across a surface; and collecting
        droplets of liquid formed on the surface in collecting means;
        wherein the surface comprises alternating regions of liquid
        repelling and liquid attracting material in at least one
        direction across the surface and the collecting means is
        disposed so as to collect drops formed on the surface. </p>
      <p>The surface will usually be a man-made surface, and the method
        may comprise an initial step of selecting the smallest dimension
        of the liquid attracting regions so as to determine the droplet
        size having regard to the prevailing environmental conditions. </p>
      <p>Throughout this specification, the term vapour is used to
        embrace media both in an entirely gaseous state and also in
        which liquid droplets are suspended in the gas forming for
        example a fog or a mist. </p>
      <p>Preferably the surface is inclined to the horizontal plane.
        This enables the droplets to flow under the influence of gravity
        towards the collecting means which is a container of some
        description. </p>
      <p>According to a third aspect of the present invention a system
        for collecting a liquid comprises a surface having alternating
        regions of liquid repelling and liquid attracting material in at
        least one direction across the surface; and collection means,
        whereby on the movement of a vapour across the surface, droplets
        within the vapour collect into larger droplets on the surface
        and are collected by the collection means. </p>
      <p>In a preferred method and system according to the invention for
        collecting a liquid, the surface is preferably inclined to the
        horizontal plane by an angle of at least 5.degree., more
        preferably at least 10.degree.. For certain applications the
        surface is preferably inclined by at least
        20.degree.,30.degree., or even 40.degree.. Preferably the
        surface is inclined at most 90.degree., especially at most
        80.degree., or sometimes at most 70.degree.. The angle of
        incline, like the width of the liquid attracting regions, is one
        of the factors determining when a droplet forming on the surface
        will roll down the slope for collection. </p>
      <p>The surface, and the method and system for collecting a liquid
        are particularly applicable for collecting liquid from a vapour
        that is moving across the surface. This will be the case, for
        example in a headwind. </p>
      <p>The behaviour of droplets of liquid falling on various
        surfaces, particularly where inclined into the headwind may be
        described as follows. For a vapour carrying headwind striking an
        entirely liquid attracting surface or an entirely liquid
        repelling surface, the liquid droplets would form on the surface
        in various sizes but would not amalgamate. These would therefore
        be blown in random directions across the surface by the
        headwind. For the surface of the present invention alternate
        regions of liquid attracting and repelling regions are provided.
        Droplets will either strike the liquid attracting regions and
        stay there, or roll to the nearest liquid attracting region if
        they initially land on a liquid repelling region. These droplets
        amalgamate until they are so large that no further purchase on
        the liquid attracting region is possible. At this time they will
        roll away (if the surface is inclined). </p>
      <p>Where the surface is inclined it is preferably inclined to face
        any headwind. Typical preferred headwinds according to the
        invention may be at most, or of the order of 5 ms.sup.-1, 10
        ms.sup.-1, 15 ms.sup.-1or 20 ms.sup.-1. The headwind is another
        factor that affects when droplet forming on the surface will
        roll down the slope for collection too large a headwind (for the
        size of drop and angle of surface incline) will cause a drop to
        be randomly blown across the surface, rather than rolling
        directly down for collection. </p>
      <p>Where reference is made to "headwind" this may be in a natural
        environment, or in a controlled environment such as a
        distillation or a dehumidifier unit. </p>
      <p>Preferably the smallest dimension of the liquid attracting
        regions is selected so that it can be used in a variety of
        headwinds, by appropriate variation of slope, such that in this
        controlled manner the droplets always grow to a sufficiently
        large size before rolling down the slope to be heavy enough to
        roll directly down the slope even against the headwind. </p>
      <p>Preferably the arrangement of liquid attracting and repelling
        regions on the surface is such that along any line drawn along
        the surface in the said one direction there will be alternating
        liquid attracting and liquid repelling regions. The said one
        direction is preferably the direction which together with the
        horizontal defines the angle of tilt, so that with this
        arrangement any drop rolling down the slope in the said one
        direction will always meet a liquid attracting region as it
        rolls. This arrangement can be for example provided by stripes
        of liquid attracting and repelling regions crossing, preferably
        perpendicular to the said one direction. As another example
        there may be mentioned discrete portions, e.g. dots, of liquid
        attracting regions in a surround of liquid repelling material,
        the liquid attracting discrete portions being off set laterally
        to each other relative to the said one direction. Thus, dots in
        adjacent rows may be staggered with respect to each other so as
        to prevent there being a clear "uphill" path of liquid repelling
        regions along which droplets could be blown away. </p>
      <p>In the method of collecting a liquid according to the present
        invention, and in the system for collecting a liquid according
        to the present invention the path into the collecting means of
        substantially all the liquid is preferably across both liquid
        attracting and liquid repelling regions. </p>
      <p>The aforementioned method and/or system for collecting a liquid
        may be a water collection method or system being used or
        intended for use in an arid/desert environment and adapted to
        collect at least 100 ml, preferably at least 0.5 l and ideally
        at least 1 l per week. </p>
      <p>According to a fourth aspect of the present invention a method
        of spreading a liquid across a surface comprises providing a
        surface having alternating regions of liquid repelling and
        liquid attracting material in at least one direction across the
        surface, placing a liquid on the surface; and spreading the
        liquid across the surface using spreading means. </p>
      <p>Preferably, the regions of liquid attracting material comprise
        a pattern whereby on placing a sheet of printing material over
        the surface, the pattern produced by the positioning of the
        liquid attracting material is transferred to the sheet of
        printing material. </p>
      <p>By tailoring the surface as described previously it is possible
        to dictate the maximum size of the droplets held at the liquid
        attracting regions when the surface is tilted, or otherwise
        treated to remove excess liquid, and hence dictate the density
        and distribution of liquid, for example in ink. </p>
      <p>The patterned region may be made by a continuous liquid
        attracting region, or more preferably by a plurality of discrete
        liquid attracting regions, e.g. a plurality of liquid attracting
        dots, surrounded by liquid repelling regions. The latter
        configuration better controlling the density and distribution of
        liquid, e.g. ink </p>
      <p>A surface as hereinbefore described has the added advantage
        that it may be self cleaning. The surface promotes droplet
        formation and those droplets may be directed under the influence
        of gravity. As the droplets move over the surface, small
        particles will be picked up by the droplets and thus removed
        from the surface. </p>
      <p>In a further aspect the invention provides a water collection
        kit that may be assembled to form a collection system as
        described above, the kit comprising the surface, support means
        for supporting the surface at a desired inclination, and
        collection means. The kit may form part of a portable survival
        kit. </p>
      <p>A number of embodiments of the invention will now be described
        by way of example only, with reference to the drawings, of
        which: </p>

      <p><b>FIG. 5c</b> shows an alternative surface suitable for a
        method of printing according to the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>Fig 1</b> shows a surface 1 having hydrophobic 2 and
        hydrophilic 3 regions. </p>
      <p>The hydrophobic 2 and hydrophilic 3 regions alternate across
        the surface 1 and form a striped pattern. An efficient surface
        for the collection of water from wind-blown fogs consists of 600
        to 800 micron width hydrophilic regions spaced a minimum of 800
        microns apart on a hydrophobic substrate. This allows for the
        formation of droplets of a size whereby, under the influence of
        gravity on a tilted surface, the droplets flow downwards into a
        moderate headwind. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 2</b> shows a surface 10 having hydrophobic 12 and
        hydrophilic 13 regions. </p>
      <p>The hydrophobic regions 12 form a grid structure across the
        surface 10. The hydrophilic regions 13, are raised above the
        hydrophobic regions 12 forming a textured surface. When a vapour
        is passed over the surface 10, droplets within the vapour are
        attracted to the hydrophilic regions 13. After a period of time,
        larger droplets of liquid begin to form on the hydrophilic
        regions 13 as the small droplets in the vapour combine on the
        surface. When the droplets reach a certain size, they move from
        one hydrophilic region 13a to another hydrophilic region 13b
        under the influence of gravity. </p>
      <p><b>FIGS. 3a to 3d</b> show a textured surface 20 inclined to
        the horizontal plane having hydrophobic 22 and hydrophilic 23
        regions. </p>
      <p>The hydrophilic regions 23 protrude in relation to the
        hydrophobic regions 22. When small droplets from a wind-blown
        vapour strike the tilted surface 20 then they may form a droplet
        24 attached to a hydrophilic region 23. As such droplets grow
        larger (by joining with other droplets that attach to the
        surface or by getting larger), the drops will reach a point at
        which their surface contact area covers the hydrophilic region
        23, as is shown in FIG. 3b, 25. Beyond this size they are
        gaining in mass without a corresponding increase in surface
        contact area, as shown in FIG. 3c, 26, thereafter, the droplet
        must now expand into the water-repelling hydrophobic regions of
        the surface, shown in FIG. 3d, 27. As this happens the
        gravitational forces on the droplet increase without a
        corresponding increase in surface adhesion, and eventually the
        droplet will move down the slope. By tailoring the slope of the
        surface, the size and spacing of the hydrophilic regions, and
        the exact hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the surface
        regions, droplets of a tailored diameter can be formed that can
        roll into the headwind of the wind-blown fog or mist and be
        collected at the lowest point of the tilted surface. In certain
        controlled environments, such as during distillation, the
        windspeed may also be controlled and tailored. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that small droplets striking a hydrophobic
        surface would immediately be free to roll across that surface,
        but are likely to be blown away by the prevailing wind due to
        their small size, and may simply bounce from the surface back
        into the vapour. If the surface were entirely hydrophilic then
        the droplets would form a film that would move in a more random
        fashion, if at all, and limit the speed and efficiency of the
        water-collection process. </p>
      <p>When droplets move on such a tailored surface, they may also be
        guided by the hydrophilic regions, the surface attraction being
        sufficient to influence their direction and speed of motion.
        This would particularly be the case if the liquid attracting
        regions formed channels or stripes on the hydrophobic surface. </p>
      <p>A textured surface as described above can manufactured using a
        variety of techniques. Clean (grease-free) glass surfaces are
        hydrophilic, and hence glass can be combined with hydrophobic
        materials such as waxes in order to produce appropriate
        patterns. Glass beads of 800 micron diameter can be partially
        embedded into a wax film to produce an array of hydrophilic
        hemispheres on a hydrophobic substrate. A clean glass surface
        can be made hydrophobic by exposure to materials such as
        hexamethyldisilazane, and this may be used in combination with
        contact masks to produce an appropriate pattern of hydrophilic
        regions. Surface texturing can be achieved via techniques such
        as the moulding and hot-pressing of plastics, which can
        subsequently be treated with hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface
        coatings. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 4</b> shows a schematic sectional illustration of a
        textured surface 30 suitable for collecting liquid 35 having a
        surface 31 with hydrophobic 32 and hydrophilic 33 regions. A
        collector 34 is positioned below the surface. </p>
      <p>When a vapour is passed over the surface 30, droplets in the
        vapour are attracted to the hydrophilic regions 33. After a
        period of time, larger droplets of liquid begin to form on the
        hydrophilic regions 33 as more and more small droplets from the
        vapour are attracted to the surface. When the droplets reach a
        certain size, they move under the influence of gravity. The
        hydrophilic regions 33 are tapered towards the collector 34 and
        the droplets tend to move from one hydrophilic region to another
        so the liquid from a number of hydrophilic regions 33 is
        collected in one collector 34. </p>
      <p>An application of such a surface would be in distillation
        processes, for example, to purify a liquid. If a vapour is to be
        cooled and collected it is often passed through a tube that is
        enclosed in a cooling system (e.g. a second tube through which
        cold water flows). Vapour condenses on the walls of the inner
        tube and runs down to a collector. Since any vapour that
        condenses into a film on this inner wall insulates the remaining
        vapour from the cold surface, the inner tube is sometimes coated
        with a hydrophobic material to encourage condensed droplets to
        quickly flow downwards. However, small vapour droplets are more
        likely to be repelled from the hydrophobic walls, being
        deflected back into the vapour and hence slowing the collection
        process. Also, if the vapour is travelling in a specific
        direction (e.g. rising up a vertical pipe via convection
        currents) then small droplets are less likely to fall downwards
        against the vapour flow. For such applications a textured
        hydrophobic/liquid attracting surface such as those described
        above would improve the efficiency of the distillation process.

      <p><b>FIG. 5a</b> illustrates a surface 50 having ink attracting
        51 and ink repelling 52 regions. The ink repelling regions 52
        form or define a recognisable shape. Ink 54 (not shown) is
        spread across the surface 50. </p>
      <p>Ink 54 is attracted to the ink attracting 51 regions and
        repelled from the ink repelling regions 52 shown in FIG. 5b.
        This causes the ink 54 to only be present on the surface 50 in
        the ink attracting regions 51. A sheet of paper (not shown)
        placed over the surface 50 results in a transfer of ink from the
        surface 50 to the paper and thus in production of a print of the
        recognisable shape or negative thereof. </p>
      <p>Whichever region is ink attracting and ink repelling depends on
        whether the ink is oil or water based. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 5c</b> shows an alternative surface 50' having a
        plurality of densely distributed discrete dot shaped ink
        attracting regions 51' in a surround or matrix of ink repelling
        material 60. These ink attracting regions 51' in a surround or
        matrix of ink repelling material 60 form a pattern (which is the
        letter "A" in the Figure). The pattern region is in a background
        of ink repelling material 52 as in the previous embodiment. Ink
        54 (not shown) is spread across the surface 50'. As in the
        previous embodiment, ink is attracted to the regions 51'. Ink is
        repelled from regions 60 and 52. The discrete dot nature of the
        liquid attracting regions 51' in the "A" pattern better controls
        the density of the ink held on the pattern compared with the
        continuous liquid attracting region 51 of the FIGS. 5a and 5b
        embodiment. The pattern can then be printed by transfer to a
        sheet of paper as in the FIGS. 5a/5b embodiment. </p>
