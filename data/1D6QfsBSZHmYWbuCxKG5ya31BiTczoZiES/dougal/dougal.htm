          Dementia Patient makes 'amazing' progress after using
          infra-red helmet</font></center>
      <center>By
        <p><b>David Derbyshire</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Two months ago Clem Fennell was fading fast. </p>
      <p>The victim of an aggressive type of dementia, the 57-year-old
        businessmen was unable to answer the phone, order a meal or
        string more than a couple of words together. </p>
      <p>In desperation, his family agreed to try a revolutionary new
        treatment - a bizarre-looking, experimental helmet devised by a
        British GP that bathes the brain in infra-red light twice a day.
      </p>
      <p>To their astonishment, Mr Fennel began to make an astonishing
        recovery in just three weeks. </p>
      <p>Dr Gordon Dougal, a GP from County Durham, treated dementia
        patient Clem Fennell with his infra-red device </p>
      <p>"My husband, Clem, was fading away. It is as if he is back"
        said his wife Vickey Fennell, 55. "His personality has started
        to show again. We are absolutely thrilled." </p>
      <p>While the helmet has yet to be proven in clinical trials, the
        family say the effects of the 10 minute sessions are incredible.
        Mr Fennell can now hold conversations and go shopping
        unaccompanied. </p>
      <p>The treatment is the brainchild of Dr Gordon Dougal, a County
        Durham GP. He believes the device could eventually help
        thousands of dementia patients. </p>
      <p>"Potentially, this is hugely significant," said Dr Dougal, who
        is based in Easington, County Durham and is a director of
        Virulite, a medical research company. </p>
      <p>Developed with Sunderland University, the helmet has 700 LED
        lights that penetrate the skull. They are thought to be the
        right wavelength to stimulate the growth of brain cells, slowing
        down the decline in memory and brain function and reversing
        symptoms of dementia. </p>
      <p>Clem Fennell - the head of a family engineering firm in
        Cincinnati, Ohio - travelled to the UK after neurologists told
        him nothing could stop the decline of his dementia. The family's
        friends had seen a report about the helmet on CBS. </p>
      <p>"Honestly I can tell you that within ten days, the
        deterioration was stopped, then we started to see improvements,"
        said Mrs Fennell, from North Kentucky. "He started to respond to
        people more quickly when they talked to him." </p>
      <p>Three weeks later, the father of two is still making gradual
        improvements. </p>
      <p>His daughter, 22-year-old Maggie said: "When we go to the
        restaurant we usually have to order his meals for him, now he
        can order for himself." </p>
      <p>"Now we are okay about letting him go to the bank or the&nbsp;
        post office but he would not have been able to do that three
        weeks ago. </p>
      <p>Mr Fennell could hardly string two words together. But since
        using the infra-red helmet, he can hold a conversation. </p>
      <p>"Dr Dougal has been a godsend to our family. There was nothing
        anyone could do to help Clem until now." </p>
      <p>It is too soon to say whether Dr Dougal's invention could help
        other sufferers. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and
        dementia can vary from day to day --- and relapses are not
        unusual. And not all patients may benefit from the treatment. </p>
      <p>Dr Dougal stressed that a full, clinically controlled trial
        would be needed&nbsp; before his anti-dementia helmet could be
        licensed for public use. A trial of 100 patients is expected to
        start later this year. </p>
      <p>"I made it clear to the Fennells that I didn't know for a
        fact&nbsp; whether it would work or not, but the results are
        good," said Dr Dougal. </p>
      <p>"He was monosyllabic when I first saw him, but if I ring up now
        he will answer&nbsp; the phone. He didn't have the verbal skills
        to do that three weeks ago." </p>
      <p>The Fennells have been told they can take the prototype helmet
        back to the US&nbsp; with them so they can continue the
        treatment at home. </p>
      <p>Commercial versions of the helmet will include 700 LEDs and
        cost around £10,000. </p>
      <p>The Alzheimer’s Society said: "’A treatment that reverses the
        effects of dementia rather than just temporarily halting its
        symptoms could change the lives of the hundreds of thousands of
        people who live with this devastating condition. </p>
      <p>‘Non-thermal near infra-red treatment for people with dementia
        is a potentially interesting technique. We look forward to
        further research to determine whether it could help improve
        cognition in humans. Only then can we begin to investigate
        whether near infra-red could benefit people with dementia.’ </p>
      <p>One in three people will end their lives with a form of
        dementia. Around 700,000 suffer from dementia - with more than
        half having Alzheimer's disease.</p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Infra Red Helmet For Reversing Early
              Alzheimer's To Be Tested</font></b> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;by <b>Catharine Paddock</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Medical experts in the North-East of England, UK, have found
        that safe exposure to infra-red light improves learning and
        cognitive functioning in the brain, and they are going to test
        the method by getting Alzheimer's patients to wear an infra-red
        "helmet" for a short time every day. </p>
      <p>The scientists believe the method can turn back the brain's
        biological clock and reverse some of the early stage damage
        typical of dementia and memory loss. </p>
      <p>Dr Gordon Dougal, a director of medical research company
        Virulite, in County Durham, came up with the idea of using infra
        red to repair damage to human brain cells after successfully
        developing a cold sore machine that boosts the body's own
        ability to fight the virus instead of attacking it directly. </p>
      <p>The idea has been tested independently by researchers at the
        University of Sunderland, who showed that low power infra-red
        light (1072nm) improved learning. </p>
      <p>Human trials on patients with diseases like Alzheimer's are due
        to start. The low level of infra-red light is the same as that
        which occurs in natural sunlight and is completely safe, said
        the researchers. The level of exposure is the same as that used
        in the cold sore machines, which have now been approved for
        prescription on the NHS. </p>
      <p>The idea is that patients could use an infra red helmet for ten
        minutes a day in their own home and notice a significant
        improvement in the space of four weeks. </p>
      <p>The researchers are hoping to start testing the idea on
        patients with Alzheimer's and other degenerative brain diseases
        this summer. </p>
      <p>It is possible that the method not only halts but actually
        reverses the effects of dementia, said Dougal, who went so far
        as to suggest that one day the method might even be used to
        change the rate at which our bodies age. </p>
      <p>"As we get older, cells stop repairing themselves and we age
        because our cells lose the desire to regenerate and repair
        themselves," said Dougal. </p>
      <p>"This ultimately results in cell death and decline of the organ
        functions, for the brain resulting in memory decay and
        deterioration in general intellectual performance," he added. </p>
      <p>"But what if there was a technology that told the cells to
        repair themselves and that technology was something as simple as
        a specific wavelength of light? Near infrared light penetrates
        human tissues relatively well, even penetrating the human skull,
        just as sunlight passes through frosted glass," explained
        Dougal. </p>
      <p>Neuroscientists at the University of Sunderland, Drs Dr Abdel
        Ennaceur and Paul Chazot carried out the independent research
        that confirmed Dougal's findings. Chazot said: </p>
      <p>"The treatment can indeed improve learning ability. The results
        are completely new this has never been looked at before." </p>
      <p>"Dr Dougal's treatment might have some potential in improving
        learning in a human situation by delivering infra red through
        the thinnest parts of the skull to get maximum access to the
        brain," he added. </p>

        disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in
        their entireties. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] This invention relates to an apparatus producing, and a
        method of therapy using, electromagnetic radiation for the
        treatment of diseases and for the maintenance or improvement of
        organs or body tissues, including muscles. The invention may be
        used in connection with the cure or alleviation of a variety of
        diseases including infectious diseases and pathological
        processes including those caused by viruses and bacteria. </p>
      <p>[0003] By way of example, the invention may be used in
        connection with diseases caused by the herpes virus which is
        known to be responsible for a number of common ailments
        including corneal dendritic ulcers, genital herpes, herpes
        labialis (cold sores), herpes zoster (shingles) and herpes
        stomatitis. These infections tend to be recurrent and are not
        cured by existing, medically accepted treatments. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] Current medically accepted methods of treating
        infections caused by the herpes virus are chemotherapeutic
        agents which are applied topically, injected or taken orally.
        Such treatment can often deal with the immediate infection but
        does not prevent a recurrence of the infection at a later date
        after the treatment has ceased. </p>
      <p>[0005] It has been known for several decades that the use of
        light can give a positive therapeutic effect in the treatment of
        a wide spectrum of diseases. In the 1960's the use of narrow
        wavelength light was investigated in in vivo/in vitro
        experiments. It was found that light of wavelength greater than
        440 nm did not work. Further investigations were carried out
        with light having a wavelength of from 300 to 350 nm (UV light)
        but it was found that infection was exacerbated/promoted rather
        than ameliorated/eliminated. Some attempts have been made to
        treat individuals affected with the herpes virus by treatment
        with light of the wavelength 660 nm, as described in U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,500,009. However, the present inventor was unable to
        achieve a significant clinical outcome or benefit at that
        wavelength. </p>
      <p>[0006] Additionally, it is known from the prior art to use a
        laser to produce coherent radiation and to focus it on the area
        to be treated. Nd YAG laser treatment at a fundamental
        wavelength of 1064 nm is associated with decreased pain,
        scarring and improved healing (U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,146).
        Additionally it has been reported that diodes emitting light at
        the red wavelength, 940.+-.25 nm can be used to treat a range of
        essentially musculoskeletal ailments (U.S. Pat. No. 5,259,380).
        However there is no indication that light of a wavelength above
        this would be of any therapeutic use. </p>
      <p>[0007] It has now been surprisingly established that low
        intensity electromagnetic radiation of small bandwidth is
        effective in the treatment of infectious diseases,
        inflammatory-type diseases and other conditions, including the
        alleviation of pain. It is postulated that the way in which the
        electromagnetic radiation effects its action is by way of energy
        transmission through cellular components/organelles. </p>
      <p>[0008] A water molecule that has a range of electromagnetic
        radiation wavelengths passed through it will produce several
        transmission peaks. These transmission peaks are associated with
        the preferred therapeutic electromagnetic radiation wavelength
        range of the invention and thus implies a role for the water
        molecule in the general mechanism of action. </p>
      <p><b>STATEMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0009] According to the present invention there is provided an
        electromagnetic radiation therapy system comprising means for
        emitting divergent electromagnetic radiation between 980 and
        1500 nm and being capable of producing, at the site being
        treated, a radiation intensity of at least 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2
        and up to 2 Watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0010] Reference herein to a site being treated is intended to
        include, without limitation, the skin or musculature or internal
        organ of a human or animal subject. </p>
      <p>[0011] Preferably the wavelength of the electromagnetic
        radiation is in the range 980 nm-1300 nm. A particularly
        preferred wavelength is at, or about, 1072 nm. A yet further
        particularly preferred wavelength is at, or about, 1268 nm. </p>
      <p>[0012] Our studies have shown that the wavelength centred
        around 1072 nm is particularly effective at treating herpetic
        and bacterial infections, alleviating acute pain and in treating
        eye conditions, whilst the wavelength centred around 1268 nm is
        particularly effective at providing pain relief from deep muscle
        injury. It is of note that these two preferred wavelengths
        correspond to the peak emission wavelengths of a water molecule
        light transmission profile and thus we believe that the
        mechanism of action is related to water and possibly cell
        membranes. </p>
      <p>[0013] By divergent it meant that the electromagnetic radiation
        emitted from the system of the invention has a divergent half
        angle of at least 5.degree.. Preferably divergence of the
        electromagnetic radiation is in the range 15.degree. to
        45.degree. half angled divergent. </p>
      <p>[0014] Preferably the electromagnetic radiation is continuous
        or pulsed. </p>
      <p>[0015] Preferably when the electromagnetic radiation is
        continuous the intensity is at least 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 for
        treatment of eyes and mucous membranes, and more preferably is
        at least 500 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 for treatment of skin and up to
        2 Watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0016] Preferably when the electromagnetic radiation is pulsed
        the intensity is at least 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 peak power for
        treatment of eyes and mucous membranes, and more preferably is
        at least 500 .mu.Watts/cm peak power for treatment of skin and
        the average power is up to 2 Watts/cm.sup.2. The average power
        is the peak power multiplied by the proportion of the total time
        that the radiation is applied. For instance if the peak power is
        500 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 and is pulsed for 10 .mu.seconds at a
        frequency of 600 Hz then the average power is 30
        .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0017] Preferably when the electromagnetic radiation is pulsed
        the average power of the intensity is in the region of 50-100
        .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0018] We have found that the power may suitably range from 500
        .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 peak to 2 Watts/cm.sup.2 continuous or peak
        power when applied to the skin. In the instance of applying
        electromagnetic radiation therapy to the eye or mucous membrane,
        powers as low as 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 continuous or pulsed are
        found to be beneficial. Typically 10 mWatts/cm.sup.2 are used on
        skin but this value is dependent on how fat or muscular the
        subject is and thus how deep the tissue/area/organ to be treated
        may lie beneath the skin surface. Typically radiation of the
        intensity 5 mWatts/cm.sup.2 is used on mucous membranes. </p>
      <p>[0019] Preferably when the electromagnetic radiation is pulsed
        it is applied for pulse duration periods of at least 10-15
        .mu.seconds and more preferably is applied at a
        frequency/repetition rate in the range 480-800 Hz. More
        preferably still, the frequency/repetition rate is at, or about,
        600 Hz. </p>
      <p>[0020] Our studies have shown that the electromagnetic
        radiation can be either coherent or non-coherent the clinical
        outcomes are not affected by this parameter. </p>
      <p>[0021] Preferably the electromagnetic radiation is applied to
        the affected area for at least 30 seconds and upto a few
        minutes. A typical exposure time for the skin or eye is in the
        region of 3 minutes, however for tissues well below the skin
        surface this time is increased according to the individuals
        fat/muscle layer depth and exposure could be up to 10 minutes. </p>
      <p>[0022] It should be appreciated that the power source emitting
        the electromagnetic radiation will have to produce more than the
        required intensity for the clinical effect since we have shown
        that approximately 99% of the applied therapeutic amount of
        light is lost across the skin surface during treatment. Thus the
        intensity of applied radiation will have to be corrected for
        when carrying out a treatment. </p>
      <p>[0023] Our studies have shown that the first clinical effects
        can be detected following 30 seconds of treatment for herpetic
        infections and that the majority of immediate clinical effects
        are experienced following 90 seconds of treatment. However
        certain tissues are more sensitive, for example the mucous
        membranes are exposed to the dosing regimen for approximately 30
        seconds and immediate clinical effects are noted after only 3
        seconds of treatment. </p>
      <p>[0024] From the foregoing it is understood that the
        electromagnetic radiation may be directed to the target site
        either continuously or in a switched (pulsed) manner. The main
        benefit of switching enables power conservation and facilities
        much higher peak power output, thereby improving clinical
        response. </p>
      <p>[0025] Preferably, electromagnetic radiation therapy system
        also includes means for reducing the amount of ambient radiation
        which impinges on the site of infection. The presence of
        ultraviolet light and violet light as in sunlight exacerbates
        herpetic conditions and it is preferred to exclude wavelengths
        below 400 nm. More preferably, wavelengths below 500 nm are
        excluded. </p>
      <p>[0026] Preferably the system further includes means for fixing
        the intensity of the radiation within a pre-determined range.
        The radiation output may be monitored with a visible display
        indicating correct function of the device both for intensity and
        wavelength. </p>
      <p>[0027] Preferably the system further includes means for
        controlling the duration of the application of the radiation.
        Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with the use of
        electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength in the range from
        visible to infra red and applied at a low intensity such that no
        thermal damage is caused to any human or animal tissues. </p>
      <p>[0028] In the case where the system is to be used in such a way
        that radiation will be caused to enter the eye, it is preferred
        that the power intensity does not exceed 100 mWatts/cm.sup.2.
        Otherwise, the power intensity may be higher and can suitably be
        delivered in pulsed form, thereby obtaining several watts of
        momentary power output, allowing good penetration of tissue and
        substantial systemic effect. </p>
      <p>[0029] The radiation producing means are preferably solid state
        light emitting devices, more preferably solid state light
        emitting diodes or gas discharge devices. The radiation from
        such devices can be electrically operated or the radiation can
        be delivered to an applicator via a fibre-optic delivery system.
      </p>
      <p>[0030] Preferably, the radiation emitter includes a PN junction
        arranged to emit radiation with a wavelength centring at or
        about 1072 nm or at or about 1268 nm. A single light diode
        assembly may include a plurality of orientated junctions. </p>
      <p>[0031] Infrared emitting diodes may be arranged not only to
        emit radiation at a specific frequency but also to emit a high
        intensity divergent beam. </p>
      <p>[0032] A gas discharge device may include a mixture of gases
        which will give an output at the desired wavelength, for
        instance, 1072 nm. </p>
      <p>[0033] Another preferred radiation producing means is a laser
        diode device, an example being a laser diode emitting light at a
        frequency of 1064 nm. Such a light emitting means is of low
        power intensity having a divergent beam and not giving rise to
        thermal damage. It may be used to treat many conditions,
        including pain relief. </p>
      <p>[0034] The present invention also provides the use of divergent
        electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of between 980 and
        1500 nm and an intensity of at least 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 and
        up to 2 Watts/cm.sup.2 to treat an area of biological tissue of
        a living human or animal subject. </p>
      <p>[0035] Preferably the electromagnetic radiation as produced by
        the system of the invention provides for treating conditions
        such as, without limitation, herpetic infections, bacterial
        and/or viral infections of the skin or upper respiratory tract,
        ophthalmic conditions such as "dry eye syndrome", caustic
        injuries, musculoskeletal conditions, inflammatory conditions
        such as rheumatoid arthritis and malignancies, reduction of
        scarring, promotion of wound healing, sports performance and
        providing acute and chronic pain relief. </p>
      <p>[0036] The use of restricted bandwidth radiation can enhance
        the immune system as a result of which the body is able to
        combat infections, such as the herpes virus. </p>
      <p>[0037] Although reference has been made to infections caused by
        the herpes virus, the present invention is not limited to such
        infections. It is applicable to other infections caused by all
        viruses including HIV, common cold and influenza viruses. </p>
      <p>[0038] The present invention also provides a method of treating
        an area of biological tissue of a living human or animal subject
        comprising applying to said area divergent electromagnetic
        radiation having a wavelength of between 980 and 1500 nm at an
        intensity of at least 50 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2 and up to 2
        Watts/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>[0039] Preferably, the area to be treated is irradiated so that
        the affected tissue receives at least 50-500 .mu.Watts/cm.sup.2
        peak power of radiant energy, depending on the tissue to be
        treated. A factor here is the period of irradiation and,
        preferably, the period should be at least a specified minimum of
        10-15 .mu.seconds at a repetition rate/frequency of 450-800 Hz
        and preferably for at least 30 seconds duration. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>[0040] Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by
        way of examples only, and with reference to the accompanying
        drawings, in which: </p>
      <p>[0041] FIGS. 1 to 4 are a view with cover removed, side view,
        under view and front view respectively of a first embodiment in
        accordance with the present invention; </p>
      <p>[0042] FIGS. 5 to 7 are a front view, top view and under view
        of a second embodiment in accordance with the present invention;
      </p>
      <p>[0043] FIGS. 8 to 10 are a back view, top view and a side view
        of a third embodiment of the present invention; </p>
      <p>[0044] FIGS. 11 and 12 are a side view and a view from the
        right (as seen in FIG. 11) of a fourth embodiment in accordance
        with the present invention; and </p>
      <p>[0045] FIGS. 13 and 14 show further embodiments of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>[0046] Referring to FIGS. 1 to 4, a first embodiment in
        accordance with the present invention includes a hand held
        divergent narrow wavelength radiation source 4 with a built in
        timer and ambient radiation detector. A single wavelength is
        used at any one time, preferably in the infrared spectrum.
        However, the effective wavelengths, which may be covered by such
        a device, extend from the visible spectrum to the infrared. In
        another embodiment of the invention, two wavelengths are used,
        one that is visible and the other that is invisible,
        particularly in the case where the optimal wavelength is in the
        infrared. </p>
      <p>[0047] Radiation source 4 includes an elongate, rectangular
        cross-section hollow body with one end 8 being transparent to
        light. The radiation source includes an array of light emitting
        diodes 2 mounted close to transparent end 8. Power is delivered
        to devices 2 by means of batteries 3 located within hollow 3 of
        the body 4. </p>
      <p>[0048] The radiation source is provided with two On/Off
        switches 5, which may be actuated to initiate the operation of
        the internal electronics. Both buttons 5 have to be pressed
        simultaneously in order to operate the device correctly, thereby
        preventing inadvertent use of the device. Close to the end
        opposite transparent end 8 is a utility hole 6 which allows the
        radiation source to be hung up or attached to another article
        such as a bunch of keys. </p>
      <p>[0049] The radiation source is provided with control
        electronics, which limit the time that the radiation source is
        on and then automatically switches off the radiation source. The
        control electronics monitor the ambient radiation and, in the
        event that the ambient radiation is of an intensity that would
        interfere with the therapeutic effect of the radiation source,
        an alarm buzzer (not shown) sounds. The radiation emitting
        devices 2 and their location and arrangement within the
        radiation source are such that the radiation emitted from the
        radiation source is in the form of a divergent light beam.
        Flange 1 restricts the ambient radiation incident on the area
        whilst being treated. </p>
      <p>[0050] The radiation therapy system of the present invention
        could be adapted to be portable and for use by those individuals
        wishing to have their own self-contained and battery operated
        devices. Additionally it could be adapted so that during use an
        animal or human appendage could be located within a hollow body
        3 to receive radiation emitted therefrom. This particular
        modification is particularly suited to treatment of genital
        herpes around the scrotal sac and/or penis. </p>
      <p>[0051] Referring to FIGS. 5 to 7 of the accompanying drawings,
        a second embodiment in accordance with the present invention is
        in the form of a multi-panel narrow wavelength radiation source.
        In this case, a plurality of panels A are mounted in a side by
        side relationship on hinges 7 and 7A which, in turn, are
        connected to a stand 9 by means of arms 10 and 10A. The
        arrangement is such that the panels can move relative to each
        other and the stand can be adjusted to alter the direction of
        illumination. The stand either extends from the floor or is
        attached to a chair or bed. </p>
      <p>[0052] The front wall of each panel A is transparent and,
        mounted below the front wall, is an array of radiation emitting
        devices 2. </p>
      <p>[0053] As with the earlier above described embodiments this
        embodiment of the invention includes control electronics to
        limit the time of the application of the radiation and to
        monitor the ambient radiation and provide an alarm when the
        threshold value of the ambient radiation is exceeded. </p>
      <p>[0054] Referring to FIGS. 8 to 10 of the drawings, a third
        embodiment in accordance with the present invention is in the
        form of a narrow wavelength radiation source with adjustable
        headgear. </p>
      <p>[0055] Flange 1 excludes ambient light if the device is in
        contact with the body. </p>
      <p>[0056] The radiation source is, in use, located on the
        operator's head by a band or helmet B and includes two panels
        11A and 11B of radiation emitting devices, panels 11A and 11B
        being separated by an intervening notch 13. These radiation
        panels 11A and 11B can be used either simultaneously or
        separately, there being provided a switch (not shown) to direct
        electrical power to one or both of panels. </p>
      <p>[0057] The radiation panels 11A and 11B are held close to the
        eyes by adjustable control elements 12A and 12B. </p>
      <p>[0058] The radiation source is provided with control
        electronics 4, which limit the time of application of the
        photons to the affected site and also automatically switch off
        the radiation at the end of the application period. As before
        the control electronics monitor the ambient radiation and
        provide an alarm when the threshold level is exceeded. </p>
      <p>[0059] Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12 of the accompanying
        drawings, a fourth embodiment of the present invention is in the
        form of a narrow or restricted bandwidth radiation source for
        delivery of photons to an orifice. In this case the body of the
        radiation source includes an elongate cylindrical portion 15
        having at one end a flange 4 whose shape is indicated in FIG.
        12. At its other end, elongate portion 15 is hemispherical 15A.
        Radiation emitting devices are located both in the elongate
        portion 15 and the flange 16 and this radiation source can be
        used to deliver photons to any orifice in the human/animal body,
        for instance, the vagina, anus, oro and nasopharynx and buccal
        cavity. The radiation source may be provided in different sizes
        according to the size of the orifice into which it is to be
        inserted. </p>
      <p>[0060] Control electronics limit the time of irradiation and
        monitor the ambient radiation, as with the previously described
        embodiments of the invention. </p>
      <p>[0061] FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate devices useful in the
        treatment of the common cold and acne. </p>
      <p>[0062] The common cold is caused by a viral infection of the
        upper respiratory tract. The viral particles are almost
        exclusively found in the pharynx, sinuses and nasal passages. </p>
      <p>[0063] The device is a radiation emitting apparatus, which
        delivers a narrow bandwidth radiation, which, is of a
        wavelength, that will penetrate the superficial skin and
        penetrate the underlying tissue to sufficient extent to generate
        a therapeutic effect. </p>
      <p>[0064] The device in FIG. 14 is flexible and is placed against
        the patient's face whilst he is lying supine. Notch 18 provides
        an aperture for the patient's eyes. Panel A provides treatment
        for the frontal sinuses. Panel A' provides treatment for the
        maxillary sinuses and nose, and the intervening bridge 17
        provides treatment for ethmoid sinuses and nose. </p>
      <p>[0065] The device in FIG. 13 is a flexible radiation emitting
        apparatus, which is placed against the patient's neck so that
        the points 20 approximate the base of the patient's ears. This
        apparatus delivers radiation for therapeutic effect to the
        patients larynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Depression 19
        fits underneath the patient's chin. </p>
      <p>[0066] Devices for treating acne are as shown in FIGS. 13 and
        14 and comprise several panels of variable shape and size. All
        the panels have a radiation emitting device 2 and are flexible
        to enable the panel to follow the contour of the face and neck.
        Panels A and A' (FIG. 13) are applied to the inferior aspect of
        the chin and the neck respectively. </p>
      <p>[0067] Panels A and A' in the FIG. 14 device are applied to the
        face so that notch 1 enables the patient to see whilst being
        treated. Bridge 17 treats the bridge of the nose and extension 2
        the cheeks. Notch 21 rests on the tip of the nose allowing the
        patient to breathe comfortably during treatment. Panel A' is
        used to treat the chin area and the area at notch 22 adjacent to
        the mouth. </p>
      <p>[0068] Where the chest and/or back is involved a larger version
        of panel A would be used as in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>[0069] Due to the superficial nature of the pathology ambient
        radiation is of significance and an ambient radiation detector
        is utilised. </p>
      <p>[0070] Treatment time is at most 10 minutes but typically 5
        minutes. </p>
      <p>[0071] It should be appreciated that two or more of the
        above-described devices can be used in conjunction with one
        another. An example is in the treatment of paediatric herpetic
        stomatitis where the device for delivery of radiation to an
        orifice could be used in conjunction with the multipanel device
        to ensure adequate delivery of the radiation system. </p>
      <p>[0072] The application of radiation in the manner described
        appears to give the patient immediate (within 6 minutes) relief
        from any pain which is chemically mediated irrespective of the
        inflammatory condition causing it i.e. it gives pain relief in
        conditions other than those caused by viral infections. It does
        not affect the conduction of pain impulses as in local
        anaesthetics. </p>
      <p>Experimental Results </p>
      <p>[0073] Examples of the invention will now be described with
        reference to the treatment of particular conditions. </p>
      <p><b>Herpes</b> </p>
      <p>[0074] The radiation-emitting surface was placed against the
        cold sore for at least 90 seconds, typically 4 minutes. The
        environmental conditions must be such that the ambient radiation
        to the cold sore must be decreased below acceptable levels. This
        can be achieved either by switching the radiation off or
        designing the device with a flange around the outside,
        diminishing the ultraviolet light to the area. Treatment is only
        once a day. One treatment may be all that is necessary however,
        in view of the fact that this also enhances wound regeneration
        and the wound regenerative effect only lasts 24 hours, daily
        treatments would improve clinical response. Various wavelengths
        were evaluated using a double blind control trial, Zovirax.RTM.)
        being given to the control patients. The average time for
        patient to be treated with 660 nm radiation took 7.5 days. The
        average time for a patient to be treated with 1072 nm radiation
        was 3 days if lesion was already present. However it was less
        than 12 hours if the patient only has a tingling sensation. </p>
      <p>[0075] 99.5% of patients abort their attack if they are treated
        within the tingling period using 1072 nm radiation. The cure
        rate of the patients receiving radiation treatment was total, in
        that none had a recurrence of their cold sores at the site
        treated. However 20% of the acyclovir treated group had
        recurrence at the site of treatment. </p>
      <p>[0076] The number in the trial was 300. </p>
      <p>[0077] A further study was conducted in a double blind protocol
        comparing radiation treatment to acyclovir. The group receiving
        radiation therapy had cold sores that healed within 4.7 days and
        the group receiving acyclovir had cold sores that healed within
        4.7 days. Statistical analysis resulted in a p value of 0.027,
        which was statistically significant. </p>
      <p>[0078] Please refer to the table below for further details.
        TABLE-US-00001 Number of Mean Time to Treatment Patients Healing

        15 4.7 Active radiation plus placebo cream 16 6.7 Acyclovir 18
        8.5 Red Light 20 7.5 </p>
      <p><b>Genital herpes</b> </p>
      <p>[0079] Again the applicator was required to follow the contours
        of the genitals and for a woman the cervix and posterior fornix
        was treated simultaneously with vagina and perineum. The
        treatment period is only 4 minutes. Due to the shape of the
        device, ambient radiation is excluded from the treatment area,
        and darkened room is not necessary. </p>
      <p>[0080] A total of eight patients have been treated, all of who
        have reported a shorter duration of their recurrent attacks of
        genital herpes. In addition, after one year of treatment, for
        each attack, all patients have been free from recurrence for the
        last 6 months, whereas they typically had an attack per month. </p>
      <p><b>Shingles</b> </p>
      <p>[0081] The radiation panel was applied to the area that is
        infected, for periods of 4 minutes. If the panel is applied to
        the actual skin surface and the panel is optically opaque it
        will occlude the ambient radiation from the area and hence allow
        treatment to proceed successfully. The only exception where a
        darkened room is essential is for the treatment of ophthalmic
        conditions when one cannot have the radiation-emitting surface
        close to the eye because of the generation of heat. The
        generation of heat in association with ophthalmic conditions is
        contraindicated. A helmet was used with an ambient radiation
        detector with alarm so that the radiation can be delivered to
        the orbital region. Again the treatment period was 4 minutes.
        Generally ophthalmic conditions are treated on a daily basis.
        However, ophthalmic herpes can be treated once every three days
        to achieve a positive result. </p>
      <p>[0082] Four patients have been treated; all of who had
        significantly shortened healing periods and decreased incidence
        or recurrence. </p>
      <p><b>The Common Cold</b> </p>
      <p>[0083] The patient was reclined on a bed, preferably in subdued
        lighting, but this is not essential. The device was placed
        against the skin ensuring that the frontal, ethmoidal and
        maxillary sinuses are covered. Another panel was placed again
        the neck, ensuring that the device goes as high as the angle of
        the jaw to enable treatment of the pharynx and larynx areas. The
        treatment cycle is at least 4 minutes. After that has been
        completed an oral device was used which is very similar to the
        vaginal applicator without the flange. The device was inserted
        into the patient's mouth. The treatment period was again for 4
        minutes. This applicator has a disposable outer skin, which is
        changed with each patient. The applicator will treat the soft
        palate and the back of the oral pharynx and the top of the
        nasopharynx where the surface applicator would not achieve
        acceptable penetration levels. Using this protocol alleviation
        of the pain associated with pharyngitis was achieved
        immediately, i.e. within 90 seconds, and the symptoms associated
        with oral pharyngitis have been alleviated within six hours. </p>
      <p>[0084] Ten patients have been treated. Of note is that
        unrestricted light can be applied to the pharynx with immediate
        relief of symptoms, however for improved efficacy, light of the
        wavelength 1072 nm is required to be applied to the face and
        sinuses. We noted that in all cases the sore throat was improved
        immediately and symptoms of congestion and flu-like illness were
        alleviated in 4-6 hours. </p>
      <p><b>Acne</b> </p>
      <p>[0085] Using the same applicator adolescent acne can be treated
        by the simple addition of a chin extension. The treatment time
        is 4 minutes. Ambient light is important but not in as much as
        the applicator will have an opaque surface so therefore it will
        be sheer proximity to the skin reduce ambient light to the skin.
        Applications should initially be every two to three days and
        maintenance would be perhaps once a week. </p>
      <p>[0086] Twelve patients have successfully been treated with
        light of the light therapy system. Results indicate that if 950
        nm 5 mm diodes were used there was a marked exacerbation of the
        disease process, however when using 950 nm 8 mm diodes there was
        a slight increase in inflammation but an overall improvement.
        The use of restricted radiation resulted in a rapid resolution
        of acne over 7 days. Daily treatment enhanced clinical results.
        Once a clinical result was achieved, the regimen was maintained
        for 1-2 treatments per week for a satisfactory outcome. </p>
      <p><b>Musculoskeletal Disorders</b> </p>
      <p>[0087] Treatment of musculoskeletal disorders such as tennis
        elbow gout, muscle injuries and knee injuries. The application
        time again is only 4 minutes. The radiation is directed over the
        affected area and gentle pressure is applied. Once the treatment
        is complete the patient feels immediate pain relief and improved
        joint movement. Muscle stiffness is greatly improved. This is a
        distinct advantage in the treatment of gout since this can be an
        extremely painful condition. The treatment could be repeated
        after 24 hours. Generally speaking treating prior the 24 hours
        is not indicated, as there is no additional clinical benefit. </p>
      <p><b>Post-Operative Wounds</b> </p>
      <p>[0088] 24 hours after an operation, a 4-minute treatment period
        reduces pain for 6-8 hours and this was repeated three to four
        times a day to enhance would healing. The treatment may be used
        on a daily basis with or without the pain for post-operative
        wounds. </p>
      <p>[0089] Seven volunteers, all of whom had minor surgery found
        decreased scar formation if the area of surgical incision was
        treated daily for 10 days commencing on the day of surgery. Thus
        it is envisaged that the present invention has applications in
        the treatment of keloids, burns and cosmetic surgery. </p>
      <p><b>Connective Tissue Diseases</b> </p>
      <p>[0090] Rheumatoid arthritis is an example of this group of
        conditions. The painful areas are treated in a device which
        comprises one fixed panel in which the hands are placed on and a
        flexi panel which is placed over the top of the hands applying
        gentle pressure to aid additional penetration of the skin. The
        treatment time is 4 minutes. Ambient radiation does not appear
        to be a significant factor in the treatment of rheumatoid
        arthritis. Part of the treatment protocol can also be in the
        treatment of thymus, liver and regional lymph nodes, which are
        all associated with antigen recognition. Again treatment time is
        4 minutes. The thymus, lymph nodes, liver and spleen may be
        treated once a week, whereas the hands may be treated initially
        once a week. However, during an acute exacerbation they can be
        treated daily. If treated more than once daily there appears to
        be no advantage. </p>
      <p>[0091] A small trial involving eight patients in the
        Rheumatology Clinic resulted in the findings that those
        receiving placebo radiation treatment felt more relief than
        those patients receiving active 950 nm radiation. However, when
        using radiation in the restricted wavelength according to the
        present invention, all ten patients reported a clinical benefit
        compared to the placebo treatment. In addition we found that if
        the thymus and other aspects of the reticuloendothelial system
        were treated with the restricted radiation the patients
        experienced an overall cessation of their arthralgia and
        myalgia. </p>
      <p><b>Malignancy</b> </p>
      <p>[0092] The area of the tumour is treated together with
        treatment to the antigen recognition centres such as thymus,
        spleen, liver and lymph nodes. Daily whole body treatments may
        be carried out. </p>
      <p><b>Bacterial Infections</b> </p>
      <p>[0093] A number of diverse minor bacterial infections have been
        treated successfully in 35 patients. In all cases the infection
        had been present for at least three days and was considered to
        be worsening daily. At the time of treatment each patient would
        have ordinarily been prescribed an oral antibiotic. In 70% of
        cases the infection was resolving 6 hours after treatment and
        was completely better within one day. In the remaining 30% of
        cases the infection had improved considerably within one day and
        following a second radiation treatment, the infection was gone
        by the second day. Of clinical note was the observation that in
        the Caucasians treated there was a significant decrease in
        superficial scar tissue at the site of assault. As previously
        noted, the 8 mm 950 nm diode unrestricted radiation source was
        effective but not as effective as the restricted radiation of
        1072 nm of the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>Sports Medicine</b> </p>
      <p>[0094] Treating all muscle groups prior to training will
        increase the level to which the athlete can train by as much as
        50%, in addition to decreasing the incidence of muscle injury. </p>
      <p>[0095] In a double blind trial, five volunteers were used by
        treating one limb with placebo radiation and the corresponding
        other limb with active radiation. In all cases the volunteers
        were able to increase their effort tolerance before feeling
        muscle fatigue by 30-50% in the limb treated with the active
        radiation. </p>
      <p>[0096] Muscle injuries have been successfully treated in 35
        patients. The pathology involved included rotor cuff syndrome,
        tennis elbow, lower back pain and lumbar fascitis. The response
        to therapy ranged from immediate relief in 30% of cases to
        complete relief after 24 hours in the remaining 70%. Daily
        treatment is required until the problem is resolved. </p>
      <p><b>Ophthalmic Conditions</b> </p>
      <p>[0097] Chronic ophthalmic pain was successfully alleviated
        permanently in 90% of the eleven patients treated. </p>
      <p>[0098] Unstable corneal epithelium (over a period of 6 weeks)
        which resulted in recurrent corneal ulceration, was stabilised
        in 6 patients promoting an intact corneal surface within 5 days
        of commencement of daily treatments of radiation therapy. </p>
      <p>[0099] Four patients with conjunctivitis sicca or dry eye
        syndrome, reported significantly decreased eye irritation and
        produced significantly less debris accumulation within fornices
        following radiation treatment. Of note was the experience that
        whilst radiation centred on 1072 nm was effective in this
        condition, radiation centred on 1268 nm was more effective. Once
        weekly treatment with radiation was sufficient to alleviate
        symptoms. </p>
      <p>[0100] Episcleritis and other inflammatory conditions of the
        eye were successfully treated in 11 patients. Daily treatments
        were necessary to obtain the desired clinical effect. The
        recurrence of the inflammatory condition was decreased in all
        cases. All patients treated had suffered their conditions over
        several months and resolution occurred in 3-4 days without the
        use of eye drops. </p>
      <p>[0101] Severe caustic injury to the eye is considered
        untreatable and almost always results in destruction of the
        cornea and blindness. Animal experiments (conducted in South
        Africa) have indicated that caustic injury is treatable with the
        radiation of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0102] Five pairs of rabbit eyes were exposed to a
        supersaturated solution of NaOH for 30 seconds after topical
        administration of an anaesthetic. All eyes were washed out
        thoroughly following the caustic injury and it was noted that
        the corneas were immediately opaque following the injury. One
        eye of each rabbit was then either treated with conventional
        steroids plus antibiotic whilst the other eye was treated with
        the radiation of the present invention. All rabbits were
        sacrificed 4 weeks following twice daily treatment. In all cases
        the eyes that had been treated with conventional therapy
        (steroids plus antibiotic) rapidly developed panophthalmilitis
        with resulting blindness, whilst the eyes treated with the
        radiation therapy of the invention showed that the anterior
        chamber, lens, vitreous and retina were intact despite corneal
        damage. In addition the scar tissue in the radiation treated
        eyes was reduced by at least 50% compared to the conventionally
        treated eyes. </p>
      <p>[0103] Further experiments involving a less concentrated
        solution of NaOH being applied for a longer duration, 3 minutes,
        resulted in corneal damage to all eyes as gauged by pale milky
        appearance to the corneas. The same protocol of treatment was
        applied, I.E. one eye being treated in conventional manner and
        the other by radiation therapy. The animal were sacrificed
        following two weeks of treatment and the results showed that
        eyes treated with the radiation therapy were clear whilst the
        conventionally treated eyes remained opaque. </p>
      <p>[0104] The ability to reduce scarring was investigated using 5
        pairs of rabbit eyes. Each eye was scarred by a 4 mm linear full
        thickness incision in the centre of the corneas under topical
        anaesthesia. One eye was treated conventionally and the other by
        radiation therapy. All eyes healed however the eyes receiving
        radiation therapy healed at a faster rate with scarring reduced
        by 50%. It was noted that radiation centred on 1072 nm gave best
        similar results. </p>
      <p><b>Pain</b> </p>
      <p>[0105] Radiation at 950 nm was only marginally effective
        compared to the restricted radiation at 1072 and 1268 nm. It was
        noted that 1072 nm was more effective than 1268 nm radiation in
        treatment of acute pain as caused by a superficial burn However,
        1268 nm radiation was reported as more effective at alleviating
        deep muscle pain caused by muscle injury. </p>
      <p>[0106] Pain was gauged in patients by subjective assessment. </p>
      <p>[0107] Thus it will be appreciated that the radiation therapy
        system of the present invention has wide application in treating
        a variety of different diseases and conditions. The radiation
        therapy system effects on a patient are rapidly felt and since
        the system is non-invasive it presents a less
        stressful/traumatic therapy to the patient. Moreover, the system
        could be used to treat a wide variety of patients quickly thus
        reducing the financial burden to the health service. </p>
