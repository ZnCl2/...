      — Imagine if the next coat of paint you put on the outside of your
      home generates electricity from light -- electricity that can be
      used to power the appliances and equipment on the inside.<br>
      <br>
      A team of researchers at the University of Notre Dame has made a
      major advance toward this vision by creating an inexpensive "solar
      paint" that uses semiconducting nanoparticles to produce energy.<br>
      <br>
      "We want to do something transformative, to move beyond current
      silicon-based solar technology," says Prashant Kamat, John A. Zahm
      Professor of Science in Chemistry and Biochemistry and an
      investigator in Notre Dame's Center for Nano Science and
      Technology (NDnano), who leads the research.<br>
      <br>
      "By incorporating power-producing nanoparticles, called quantum
      dots, into a spreadable compound, we've made a one-coat solar
      paint that can be applied to any conductive surface without
      special equipment."<br>
      <br>
      The team's search for the new material, described in the journal
      ACS Nano, centered on nano-sized particles of titanium dioxide,
      which were coated with either cadmium sulfide or cadmium selenide.
      The particles were then suspended in a water-alcohol mixture to
      create a paste.<br>
      <br>
      When the paste was brushed onto a transparent conducting material
      and exposed to light, it created electricity.<br>
      <br>
      "The best light-to-energy conversion efficiency we've reached so
      far is 1 percent, which is well behind the usual 10 to 15 percent
      efficiency of commercial silicon solar cells," explains Kamat.<br>
      <br>
      "But this paint can be made cheaply and in large quantities. If we
      can improve the efficiency somewhat, we may be able to make a real
      difference in meeting energy needs in the future."<br>
      <br>
      "That's why we've christened the new paint, Sun-Believable," he
      adds.<br>
      <br>
      Kamat and his team also plan to study ways to improve the
      stability of the new material.<br>
      <br>
      NDnano is one of the leading nanotechnology centers in the world.
      Its mission is to study and manipulate the properties of materials
      and devices, as well as their interfaces with living systems, at
      the nano-scale.<br>
      <br>

      Basic Energy Sciences.<br>

      A transformative approach is required to meet the demand of
      economically viable solar cell technology. By making use of recent
      advances in semiconductor nanocrystal research, we have now
      developed a one-coat solar paint for designing quantum dot solar
      cells. A binder-free paste consisting of CdS, CdSe, and TiO2
      semiconductor nanoparticles was prepared and applied to conducting
      glass surface and annealed at 473 K. The photoconversion behavior
      of these semiconductor film electrodes was evaluated in a
      photoelectrochemical cell consisting of graphene–Cu2S counter
      electrode and sulfide/polysulfide redox couple. Open-circuit
      voltage as high as 600 mV and short circuit current of 3.1 mA/cm2
      were obtained with CdS/TiO2–CdSe/TiO2 electrodes. A power
      conversion efficiency exceeding 1% has been obtained for solar
      cells constructed using the simple conventional paint brush
      approach under ambient conditions. Whereas further improvements
      are necessary to develop strategies for large area, all solid
      state devices, this initial effort to prepare solar paint offers
      the advantages of simple design and economically viable next
      generation solar cells.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Embodiments of
      the present invention provide nanomaterial scaffolds for
      transporting electrons. There is provided a single wall carbon
      nanotube (SWCNT) architecture employed as a conducting scaffold in
      semiconductor based photoelectrochemical cells. SWCNT architecture
      provides a nanotube network to disperse nanoparticles and/or
      quantum dots, whether ordered or randomized. As a result, an
      increase in incident photon conversion to charge carrier
      conversion efficiency (IPCE) represents a beneficial role of SWCNT
      architecture as a conducting scaffold to facilitate charge
      collection and charge transport in nanostructured semiconductor
      films. Embodiments may be used for solar cells based on
      semiconductor quantum dots and nanostructures, solar hydrogen
      production, microcapacitors and storage batteries, solar-fuel cell
      hybrids, etc.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Embodiments of the present invention relate to the fields
      of nanotechnology and energy, and, more specifically, to
      nanomaterial scaffolds for transporting electrons, such as for use
      in photoelectrochemical solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] The photocatalytic activity of semiconductor films has been
      widely explored in designing solar cells, solar hydrogen
      production and environmental remediation. Of particular interest
      is the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) which uses mesoscopic TiO2
      films modified with sensitizing dyes. Despite the initial success
      of achieving 10% solar conversion efficiency, the effort to
      further improve their performance has not resulted in
      breakthroughs. A major hurdle in attaining higher photoconversion
      efficiency in such nanostructured electrodes is the transport of
      electrons across the particle network. The photogenerated
      electrons in mesoscopic films for example have to travel through
      the network of semiconductor particles and encounter many grain
      boundaries during the transit. Such a random transit path for the
      photogenerated electrons increases the probability of their
      recombination with oxidized sensitizer. The use of a redox couple
      such as I3&lt;-&gt;/I&lt;-&gt; facilitates the electron transport
      to some extent by rapid regeneration of the oxidized sensitizer.
      However, the conversion efficiency is still not entirely
      favorable.<br>

        EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0022] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which
      are shown by way of illustration embodiments in which the
      invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other

      with the present invention is defined by the appended claims and
      their equivalents.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Various operations may be described as multiple discrete
      operations in turn, in a manner that may be helpful in
      understanding embodiments of the present invention; however, the
      order of description should not be construed to imply that these
      operations are order dependent.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The description may use perspective-based descriptions such
      as up/down, back/front, and top/bottom. Such descriptions are
      merely used to facilitate the discussion and are not intended to

      "A/B" or in the form "A and/or B" means (A), (B), or (A and B).
      For the purposes of the description, a phrase in the form "at

      <br>
      [0027] The description may use the phrases "in an embodiment," or
      "in embodiments," which may each refer to one or more of the same
      or different embodiments. Furthermore, the terms "comprising,"
      "including," "having," and the like, as used with respect to
      embodiments of the present invention, are synonymous.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Embodiments of the present invention provide nanomaterial
      scaffolds for transporting electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In an embodiment, there is provided a single wall carbon
      nanotube (SWCNT) architecture employed as a conducting scaffold in
      semiconductor based photoelectrochemical cells. In an embodiment,
      such a configuration may boost photoconversion efficiency. In an
      embodiment, such a configuration may boost photoconversion
      efficiency by a factor of two or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an embodiment, SWCNT architecture provides a nanotube
      network to disperse titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles, or other
      nanoparticles, such as SnO2 or others. In an embodiment, an
      increase in incident photon conversion to charge carrier
      conversion efficiency (IPCE) represents a beneficial role of SWCNT
      architecture as a conducting scaffold to facilitate charge
      collection and charge transport in nanostructured semiconductor
      films. Such nanotube/nanoparticle architecture may provide a
      variety of benefits, including improving the efficiency of
      nanostructure based solar cells, e.g., dye sensitized solar cells,
      or in water photoelectrolysis. Embodiments may be used for solar
      cells based on semiconductor quantum dots and nanostructures,
      solar hydrogen production, microcapacitors and storage batteries,
      solar-fuel cell hybrids, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an embodiment, there is provided a nanostructured
      material, comprising a single wall carbon nanotube having a first
      and second end and an outer and inner surface, the first end of
      the single wall carbon nanotube coupled to a substrate, and a
      plurality of nanoparticles coupled to the single wall carbon
      nanotube.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In an embodiment, TiO2 nanoparticles may be dispersed on
      single wall carbon nanotubes to improve photoinduced charge
      separation and transport of carriers to the collecting electrode
      surface. In accordance with an embodiment, a shift of 100 mV in
      apparent Fermi level of an SWCNT/TiO2 system as compared to an
      unsupported TiO2 system indicates the Fermi level equilibration
      between the two systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In an embodiment of the invention, one dimensional
      nanostructures may be used to direct the flow of photogenerated
      charge carriers. In an embodiment, a nanotube network may be used
      as a support to anchor light harvesting semiconductor particles
      and may facilitate the electron transport to the collecting
      electrode surface/substrate in a photovoltaic/solar cell.
      Scenarios that illustrate the electron transport in a
      semiconductor particle based film and an exemplary
      nanotube-nanoparticle composite are presented in FIGS. 1A and 1B,
      respectively. The particle based film and nanotube-nanoparticle
      composite are shown coupled to a collecting electrode
      surface/substrate, which may be, in an embodiment, part of a
      photovoltaic/solar cell. In a further embodiment, the collecting
      electrode surface/substrate may be further coupled to one or more
      other electronic components for further handling/processing of the
      harvested energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In embodiments, the term "substrate" may refer to any
      suitable substrate used, for example, as a collecting electrode
      surface/substrate, including one or more of silicon, metal,
      polymers, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The unique electrical and electronic properties, wide
      electrochemical stability window, and high surface area render
      SWCNT beneficial as a scaffold to anchor light harvesting
      assemblies. In accordance with an embodiment, the electron
      accepting ability of semiconducting SWCNT thus offers an
      opportunity to facilitate electron transport and thus increase the
      photoconversion efficiency of nanostructure semiconductor based
      solar cells. In further embodiments, semiconductor particles, such
      as CdSe and CdTe, may be attached to carbon nanotubes directly, to
      other nanoparticles, and/or via functional linker molecules and
      may induce charge transfer processes under visible light
      irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] SWCNT networks may be constructed using a variety of
      methods. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, FIG. 2 shows
      low and high magnification scanning electron micrographs (SEM
      images) of carbon fiber paper (carbon fiber electrodes (CFE)) at
      different stages of modification. Preparation of the carbon fiber
      paper may be done using any of a variety of methods, including as
      described in Kongkanand et al., Single Wall Carbon Nanotube
      Scaffolds for Photoelectrochemical Solar Cells Capture and
      Transport of Photogenerated Electrons, Nano Lett., Vol. 7, No. 3,
      676-680 (2007), the entire contents of which are hereby
      incorporated by reference. These images provide a perspective of
      the overall electrode morphology and the ability to anchor TiO2
      nanoparticles on CFE and SWCNT networks with a good
      dispersibility. The carbon fibers of the CFE electrode are in
      micron size (row A) and they serve as the backbone of the
      electrode in collecting photogenerated electrons and communicating
      with the external circuit. When TiO2 particles are dispersed on
      the CFE, they get dispersed quite uniformly on the carbon
      microfibers (row B). The higher magnification micrograph confirms
      the ability of carbon microfibers to support TiO2 photocatalyst
      particles and collect photogenerated electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In accordance with another embodiment, SWCNT was deposited
      on the carbon fiber electrode using an electrophoretic deposition
      method. This allowed extension of the carbon support network at a
      nanometer scale. At low magnifications the SWCNT film may be seen
      covering the voids in the larger carbon microfiber network (row
      C). The magnified view of the same film shows a close interwoven
      network of SWCNT bundles. In an embodiment, the CFE/SWCNT was
      further modified by casting a film of TiO2 nanoparticles. The
      figures in row D show the micrograph of the electrode obtained
      after deposition of TiO2 nanoparticles on the SWCNT network. In
      the selected high magnification image, both TiO2 particle
      aggregates and the underlying SWCNT network are shown. However,
      most of the other areas show complete coverage of TiO2 particles.
      In an embodiment, the aggregation of TiO2 particles becomes
      predominant when the ratio of TiO2 to SWCNT is increased. If the
      TiO2 coverage is kept sufficiently low, in an embodiment, the
      SWCNT network is expected to interact quite effectively with TiO2
      particles and facilitate charge transport in the composite film.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Films of TiO2 particles undergo charge separation upon
      excitation with UV-light (Eg&gt;3.2 eV). When employed as
      photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical cell, TiO2 particulate films
      cast on electrode surfaces exhibit anodic photocurrent generation.
      The magnitude of the photocurrent represents the charge collection
      efficiency of the electrode surface. FIG. 3A shows the short
      circuit photocurrent generation at CFE/TiO2 and CFE/SWCNT/TiO2
      electrodes. Both electrodes are prompt in generating photocurrent
      with a reproducible response to ON-OFF cycles. In an embodiment,
      the TiO2 particles deposited on the SWCNT network exhibit an
      enhanced photocurrent.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In an embodiment, when in contact with photoirradiated TiO2
      nanoparticles, SWCNTs may accept and store electrons. The Fermi
      level equilibration with photoirradiated TiO2 particles indicates
      storage of up to 1 electron per 32 carbon atoms in the SWCNT. The
      stored electrons are readily discharged on demand upon addition of
      electron acceptors such as thiazine and oxazine dyes (i.e.,
      acceptors having a lower reduction potential than the SWCNT
      conduction band) to the SWCNT/TiO2 suspension. The ability of
      SWCNT to accept electrons and transfer them to a suitable electron
      acceptor highlights the mediating role that these nanotubes may
      play in a charge transfer process.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The stepwise electron transfer from photoirradiated TiO2
      nanoparticles to SWCNT to redox couple has enabled the probing of
      the electron equilibration process and determination of the
      apparent Fermi level of the SWCNT/TiO2 system. SWCNTs undergo
      charge equilibration with semiconductor particles such as TiO2 and
      attain an apparent Fermi level lower (20-30 mV in suspensions and
      130 mV in films) than the Fermi level of semiconductor TiO2. A
      positive shift in apparent Fermi level indicates the ability of
      SWCNTs to undergo charge equilibration with photoirradiated TiO2
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In an embodiment, the effect of electron equilibration
      between TiO2 and SWCNT on the photoelectrochemical effect in TiO2
      and SWCNT/TiO2 films was explored. The films of TiO2 and
      SWCNT/TiO2 were cast on conducting glass electrodes as described
      previously. These films are photoactive and generate photocurrent
      under UV-excitation when employed as a photoanode in a
      photoelectrochemical cell. The primary process responsible for
      photocurrent generation is the charge separation in TiO2 particles
      as they are subjected to bandgap (Eg&gt;3.2 eV) excitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Under open circuit conditions, the electrons accumulate and
      equilibrate with the redox couple in the electrolyte. The measured
      open circuit voltage is the difference between the apparent Fermi
      level of the semiconductor film and the reduction potential of the
      redox couple employed. Thus, open-circuit voltage is a direct
      measure of the apparent Fermi-level of the semiconductor film if
      one employs the same redox couple. The photovoltage response of
      optically transparent electrode OTE/TiO2 and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2
      electrodes shows a rise in photovoltage in two steps: a prompt
      increase followed by a slow growth as the electrode system
      equilibrated with the redox couple. Notably, the magnitude of the
      photovoltage was 130 mV lower for OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 electrode. The
      lower photovoltage further supports the notion that the SWCNT/TiO2
      composite has a lower apparent Fermi level than the pristine TiO2
      system. Similar to the charge equilibration effects in suspension,
      the electrons are transferred from TiO2 to SWCNT and thus attain a
      lower equilibrium potential.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] It is interesting to note that the photovoltage decay of
      OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 is slower than that of OTE/TiO2 electrode. This
      observation further indicates the involvement of SWCNT in
      participating in the electron storage and equilibration process,
      and thus increasing the survivability of accumulated electrons.
      Indeed, the ability of SWCNT to accept and transport electrons in
      the SWCNT/TiO2 films has a beneficial effect in overall
      photocurrent generation. In an embodiment, an approximately
      two-fold increase of incident photon-to-photocurrent generation
      efficiency was achieved by employing a SWCNT conducting scaffold
      in TiO2-nanostructure based photoelectrochemical cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In an embodiment, electrode performance was further
      evaluated by recording the IPCE by monitoring the photocurrent at
      different incident wavelengths. The photocurrent action spectra of
      the two electrodes at short circuit and 0 V vs. SCE (standard
      calomel electrode) are shown in FIG. 3B. Both of these electrodes
      have a photocurrent onset at 380 nm corresponding to the bandgap
      of TiO2. In the absence of SWCNT network, a maximum IPCE of 7.36%
      (350 nm) at 0 V vs. SCE was observed. The IPCE response shows a
      significant enhancement with an IPCE of 16% when a SWCNT scaffold
      supports the TiO2 particles. Nearly doubling of the
      photoconversion efficiency is an indication of the improved charge
      collection efficiency using a SWCNT network.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In accordance with an embodiment, fuel cell experiments
      carried out with a Pt/SWCNT system shows that both semiconducting
      and metallic carbon nanotubes contribute to improving the charge
      transfer and charge collection in both cathodic and anodic
      compartments. In an embodiment, such charge transport properties
      of carbon nanotubes may also improve photocurrent generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In an embodiment, the role of SWCNT in enhancing the
      photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 film was probed by
      varying the ratio of SWCNT/TiO2 in the composite film. The
      concentration of the SWCNT was kept constant while TiO2 loading
      was varied. FIG. 4 compares the photocurrent observed with
      CFE/TiO2 and CFE/SWCNT/TiO2 electrodes at different loading of
      TiO2 particles. In the case of the CFE/TiO2 film, an increase in
      photocurrent is observed with increased TiO2 loading (at loadings
      below 2 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;) as more excited TiO2 particles undergo
      charge separation and participate in the photocurrent generation.
      At higher TiO2 loadings, saturation in the photocurrent is
      observed showing the limitations of light absorption within the
      TiO2 film. In the case of CFE/SWCNT/TiO2, a similar increasing
      trend is observed at TiO2 loadings up to 1.5 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;. The
      photocurrent observed at these TiO2 loadings is significantly
      greater than the photocurrent observed without the SWCNT support.
      This increase in the photoconversion efficiency shows that the
      SWCNT support architecture plays an important role in improving
      the charge transport properties within the composite film. At
      these TiO2 loadings, SWCNT is capable of dispersing TiO2 particles
      quite effectively and facilitating charge collection and
      transportation toward the collecting electrode surface. At higher
      loadings, a decrease in the photocurrent is observed as it
      approaches the value obtained in the absence of SWCNT. At these
      high TiO2 loadings, the particles may tend to aggregate and most
      of these TiO2 aggregates do not make a direct contact with the
      SWCNT bundles. The photoelectrochemical behavior at high TiO2
      loadings (4 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;) thus tends to be similar for both
      CFE/TiO2 and CFE/SWCNT/TiO2. Thus, in an embodiment, beneficial
      TiO2 loadings (or other such particles) may be approximately 0.5
      to 4 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In order to probe the charge transfer interactions between
      the excited TiO2 particles and SWCNT, the current-voltage (I-V)
      characteristics of the OTE/TiO2 and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 electrodes were
      analyzed. The films deposited on OTE provided responses similar to
      those obtained with CFE. In an embodiment, casting of films on OTE
      allowed annealing of the TiO2 films at higher temperature (673 K)
      and better electrochemical performance compared to CFE based
      electrodes. The I-V characteristics of OTE/TiO2 and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2
      films in 1 M KOH solution recorded using dark and UV-illumination
      are shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In accordance with an embodiment, the application of anodic
      bias facilitates charge separation in TiO2 particulate films. The
      anodic bias provides the necessary driving force for transport of
      electrons to the collecting electrode surface and thus minimizes
      charge recombination. Both OTE/TiO2 and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 exhibit
      similar enhanced photocurrent response at positive applied
      potentials. The OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 exhibits higher photocurrent than
      OTE/TiO2, thus confirming the role of a conducting SWCNT scaffold
      in improving the overall photoelectrochemical performance.
      However, the potentials corresponding to zero current (often
      referred to as flat band potential) are different. The flat band
      potential as recorded from the zero current potential (FIG. 5)
      were -0.86 V and -0.79 V versus SCE for TiO2 and SWCNT/TiO2 films,
      respectively. Such a positive shift in the flat band potential is
      an indication of the electron transfer from TiO2 to SWCNT as the
      two systems undergo charge equilibration. Since the conduction
      band of SWCNT (0 V versus NHE (normal hydrogen electrode)) is
      expected to be lower than that of TiO2 (-0.5 V versus NHE), charge
      equilibration is expected between the two systems causing the
      shift of apparent Fermi level to more positive potentials. In an
      embodiment, a shift of 70 mV in apparent Fermi level of the
      SWCNT/TiO2 system is a further indication that the interplay
      between the two systems in charge equilibration is an important
      factor in controlling its photoelectrochemical properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In an embodiment, since the photogenerated holes reaching
      the electrode surface participate in the water oxidation reaction,
      one may evaluate the photoconversion efficiency (q) for the water
      splitting reaction based on the following expression,<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [eta]=power output/incident power=Voc*Isc/Iinc<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where Voc refers to open circuit voltage, Isc refers to
      short circuit current and Iinc is the incident light intensity (50
      mW/cm&lt;2&gt;). If one assumes the electrolysis efficiency
      proceeds with 100% water splitting reaction, one may use Voc as
      1.23 V (the ideal chemical energy limit at 297 K). Using the
      current value of 36 and 81 [mu]A/cm&lt;2 &gt;(obtained
      independently under no bias conditions), an efficiency of 0.09 and
      0.20% may be obtained for OTE/TiO2 and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 electrodes
      (0.06 and 0.12% for CFE/TiO2 and CFE/SWCNT/TiO2).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an embodiment, the influence of SWCNT architectures for
      facilitating charge transport in mesoscopic semiconductor films
      has been further probed using a TiO2/Ru(II)trisbipyridyl complex
      system. Both transient absorption and emission measurements
      indicate that the SWCNT network in the film has no noticeable
      influence on the charge injection process from the excited Ru(II)
      trisbipyridyl complex into TiO2 particles. However, it plays an
      important role in improving the charge separation, as the rate of
      back electron transfer between the oxidized sensitizer (Ru(III))
      and the injected electrons becomes slower in the presence of the
      SWCNT scaffold. The beneficial aspect of charge collection by
      SWCNT has been further explored by carrying out
      photoelectrochemical measurements. In an embodiment,
      dye-sensitized solar cells constructed using this SWCNT scaffold
      show an improvement in photocurrent generation. However, this
      improvement in photocurrent generation may be partially
      neutralized by a lower photovoltage, as the apparent Fermi level
      of the TiO2 and SWCNT composite becomes more positive than that of
      pristine TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In embodiments, semiconductor nanotube assemblies, when
      assembled on an electrode surface and then modified with dye
      molecules, offer the possibility to improve the charge collection
      and transport of charge carriers. While ruthenium is discussed as
      an exemplary sensitizer, in embodiments, any suitable sensitizer
      may be utilized, whether a dye, a short bandgap semiconductor,
      etc. In an embodiment, short bandgap semiconductors such as CdS,
      PbS, Bi2S3, CdSe and InP may serve as sensitizers as they may
      transfer electrons to large bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2 or
      SnO2 under visible light excitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In an exemplary embodiment, both OTE/TiO2 and
      OTE/SWCNT/TiO2 films were immersed in an ethanol solution of
      Ru(II)(bpy)2(dcbpy) (henceforth referred to as Ru(II)) for several
      hours to facilitate the binding of the dye to the TiO2 surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In accordance with an embodiment, films of TiO2 particles
      may respond solely to UV light as they undergo charge separation
      upon bandgap excitation (Eg&gt;3.2 eV). When modified with a
      sensitizer such as Ru(II)(bpy)2(dcbpy), the TiO2 particles may
      directly interact with the excited state of the sensitizer via a
      charge transfer mechanism (Reactions 1-4):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Ru(II)+h[nu]-&gt;Ru(II)* (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Ru(II)*-&gt;Ru(II)+h[nu]' (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Ru(II)*+TiO2-&gt;Ru(II)+TiO2(e&lt;-&gt;) (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Ru(II)+TiO2(e&lt;-&gt;)-&gt;Ru(II)+TiO2 (4)<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Although a SWCNT does not influence the primary charge
      injection process in the TiO2/Ru(II)* system, in an embodiment, it
      may participate in facilitating charge separation and in promoting
      electron transport to the electrode surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The results suggest that the photoinjected electrons in
      TiO2 survive roughly 50% longer when embedded within the SWCNT
      network. The equilibration of electrons between SWCNT and TiO2
      results in the transfer of a fraction of electrons into SWCNT,
      thus stabilizing the photogenerated electrons and reducing the
      rate of exciton recombination.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In order to probe the beneficial aspects of a SWCNT network
      in dye-sensitized solar cells, in accordance with an embodiment,
      photoelectrochemical cells were constructed using the
      Ru(II)-modified TiO2 particulate films as photoanodes. The
      magnitude of the photocurrent response represents the charge
      collection efficiency at the electrode surface. FIG. 6A shows the
      short-circuit photocurrent generation of the OTE/TiO2/Ru(II) and
      OTE/SWCNT/TiO2/Ru(II) electrodes. Both electrodes were prompt in
      generating photocurrent with a reproducible response to ON-OFF
      cycles. It is interesting to note that the films containing a
      SWCNT network exhibited a roughly 30% higher photocurrent. This
      increase is greater than the small (2.3%) difference in absorbance
      between OTE/TiO2/Ru(II) and OTE/SWCNT/TiO2/Ru(II) films. On the
      other hand, the photovoltage (FIG. 6B) recorded during ON-OFF
      cycles shows a decreased open-circuit voltage when SWCNT was
      present in the film.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The two opposing trends seen in the short-circuit current
      and open-circuit voltage (FIGS. 6A and 6B) may be explained on the
      basis of the electron capture properties of SWCNT. As the
      photoinjected electrons are transferred to TiO2 from excited
      Ru(II)*, they undergo charge equilibration with SWCNT. This charge
      equilibration is associated with the shifting of the apparent
      Fermi level to more positive potentials. A positive shift of tens
      to hundreds of millivolts in the apparent Fermi level has been
      noted from the redox equilibration experiments. This shift causes
      the open-circuit voltage of the photoelectrochemical cell, which
      is dependent on the difference in Fermi levels between the
      photoanode and the redox couple, to be lower than that obtained in
      the absence of SWCNT. The electrons transferred into the SWCNT
      network may be quickly transported to the collecting electrode
      surface, minimizing the possibility of charge recombination at
      grain boundaries. The incorporation of a SWCNT network in the TiO2
      film thus helps to transport electrons through its conductive
      scaffold and to generate higher photocurrent, at the expense of
      the open-circuit potential (see FIG. 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In an embodiment, the electrode performance was further
      evaluated by recording the IPCE at different incident wavelengths
      of light. The photocurrent action spectra of the two electrodes
      under unbiased conditions are shown in FIG. 8. Both of these
      electrodes exhibit an IPCE maximum corresponding to the absorption
      maximum of the Ru(II) complex. In an embodiment, the IPCE response
      at all wavelengths is enhanced by a factor of 1.4 as a result of
      introducing a SWCNT scaffold in the TiO2 film. Suppressing the
      back electron transfer and improving the electron transport within
      the nanostructured TiO2 film are regarded as the two most
      important factors controlling the overall IPCE of the cell.
      Enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency in the present
      embodiments suggests that charge collection and transport in these
      films are improved by the SWCNT network.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In an embodiment, the power characteristics were also
      evaluated by varying the load resistance (FIG. 9). A 45% increase
      in short circuit current seen with the SWCNT nanostructure is
      consistent with the IPCE and photocurrent measurements described
      earlier. However, the open-circuit voltage is decreased by about
      60 mV as a result of charge equilibration between TiO2 and SWCNT.
      A shift in open-circuit potential was also noted in UV-irradiated
      SWCNT/TiO2 films. In an embodiment, since the conduction band of
      SWCNT (0 V vs. NHE) is expected to be more positive than that of
      TiO2 (-0.5 V vs. NHE), charge equilibration is expected between
      the two systems causing the shift of apparent Fermi level to more
      positive potentials. Spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical
      measurements have also confirmed the ability of SWCNT to accept
      electrons and undergo charge equilibration. The power conversion
      efficiency for the DSSC's employing OTE/TiO2/Ru(II) and
      OTE/SWCNT/TiO2/Ru(II) electrodes were 0.18% and 0.13%,
      respectively. The similarity between these two values suggests
      that improvement in photocurrent may be at least partially
      nullified by the decrease in photovoltage. As a result of these
      opposing factors, a small decrease in the fill factor and net
      power conversion efficiency may be seen.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In an embodiment, quantum dots, such as CdSe quantum dots,
      may be assembled on TiO2 films composed of nanoparticle and/or
      nanotube morphologies to enhance their function. In an embodiment,
      the quantum dots may be coupled to the nanoparticles/nanotubes
      using a bifunctional linker molecule (see FIGS. 10A and 10B). The
      hollow nature of the nanotubes makes both inner and outer surface
      areas accessible for modification with sensitizing dyes and/or
      semiconductor quantum dots. Further information regarding quantum
      dot solar cells and tuning of the photoresponse through size and
      shape control of the quantum dots may be found in Kongkanand, et
      al., Quantum Dot Solar Cells-Tuning Photoresponse Through Size and
      Shape Control of CdSe-TiO2 Architecture, J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
      Published on Web, Mar. 1, 2008, the entire contents of which are
      hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In accordance with an embodiment, upon bandgap excitation,
      CdSe quantum dots may inject electrons into TiO2
      nanoparticles/nanotubes, thus enabling the generation of
      photocurrent in an associated photoelectrochemical solar cell.
      Embodiments of the invention thus provide: (i) an ability to tune
      the photoelectrochemical response and/or photoconversion
      efficiency via size control of quantum dots, and (ii) improvement
      in photoconversion efficiency by facilitating charge transport
      through the nanotube architecture.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In accordance with an embodiment, the IPCE obtained with 3
      nm diameter CdSe nanoparticles was 35% for particulate TiO2 and
      45% for tubular TiO2 morphology. The IPCE observed at the
      excitonic band increases with decreasing particle size, as the
      shift in conduction band to more negative potentials increases the
      driving force and favors fast electron injection. The power
      conversion efficiency &lt;=1% obtained with CdSe-TiO2 nanotube
      films highlights the usefulness of tubular morphology in
      facilitating charge transport in nanostructure based solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] While CdSe quantum dots are discussed throughout this
      application as exemplary quantum dots, other quantum dots may be
      utilized, such as PbSe, InAs, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In an embodiment, various linker molecules may be used to
      link the quantum dots to the nanoparticles and/or nanotubes. In an
      embodiment, bifunctional linker molecules, such as MPA
      (HOOC-CH2-CH2-SH), which have both carboxylate and thiol
      functional groups, facilitate binding between CdSe quantum dots
      and TiO2 surfaces. The CdSe quantum dots bound to the TiO2 surface
      inherit native quantization properties. The shift in onset
      absorption with decreasing particle size is similar in both
      OTE/TiO2(NP)/CdSe and Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe electrodes. Relatively high
      absorption of the visible light (absorbance 0.7) by these
      electrodes ensures absorbance of more than 80% of the incident
      light at wavelengths below the onset.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In accordance with an embodiment, success in achieving
      relatively high coverage of CdSe quantum dots on these TiO2 films
      highlights the ability of small size CdSe quantum dots to
      penetrate the porous network of a TiO2 film and provide a uniform
      coverage throughout the film.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The open-circuit potential is independent of CdSe particle
      size indicating that electrons injected from excited CdSe into
      TiO2 quickly relax to the lowest conduction band energy. Hence the
      conduction band level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the
      sulfide electrolyte alone dictate an open-circuit voltage of 600
      mV.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The photocurrent response, however, varies with particle
      size (see FIGS. 11A and 11B). Of those tested, the maximum
      photocurrent is seen with 3.0 nm diameter CdSe particles. Two
      opposing effects account for the difference in photocurrent
      generation at OTE/TiO2/CdSe electrodes. Decreasing particle size
      of CdSe increases photocurrent as the shift in conduction band to
      more negative potentials increases the driving force for charge
      injection. On the other hand, decreasing the CdSe particle size
      lowers photocurrent due to an inherently smaller response in the
      visible region.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In an embodiment, the photoelectrochemical response may be
      tuned through size quantization. The photoelectrochemical response
      of both OTE/TiO2/CdSe films to monochromatic light irradiation was
      analyzed in terms of IPCE. The IPCE was determined from short
      circuit photocurrents (Jsc) monitored at different excitation
      wavelengths ([lambda]) using the expression:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where Iincident is the energy of the monochromatic light
      incident on the electrode. The IPCE action spectra for
      OTE/TiO2(NP)/CdSe and Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe electrodes are presented in
      FIGS. 12A and 12B. The photocurrent action spectra obtained with
      3.7, 3.0, 2.6, and 2.3 nm CdSe particles show similar trends for
      both films. The current peaks may be observed at 580, 540, 520 and
      505 nm. Thus, in an embodiment, the photocurrent generation at
      OTE/TiO2(NP)/CdSe and Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe electrodes originates from
      the individual CdSe quantum dots and their size quantization
      property is responsible for tuning the performance of quantum dot
      solar cells. In particular, the ability to tune the photoresponse
      by varying the size of CdSe particles affords the ability to tune
      the performance of quantum dot solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Comparison of IPCE at the excitonic peaks shows an
      interesting dependence on the particle size. The IPCE values
      measured at 580 nm (d=3.7 nm), 540 nm (d=3.0 nm), 520 nm (d=2.6
      nm) and 505 nm (d=2.3 nm) were 14, 24, 26 and 28% for
      OTE/TiO2(NP)/CdSe and 19, 32, 35 and 36% for Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe
      respectively. It should be noted that the absorbance at the
      excitonic band was matched to 0.7+-0.05. The difference in
      absorption (&lt;=5%) is smaller than the variation in the IPCE for
      these four electrodes. Hence, the strong dependence of IPCE on
      particle size is not due to the relatively small difference in
      absorption between the two electrodes. The improved IPCE with
      smaller size quantum dots may arise from the improved rate of
      electron transfer. The smaller size particles, being more
      energetic in their excited state, are capable of injecting
      electrons into TiO2 at a faster rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] It is also interesting to note that the maximum IPCE
      obtained with CdSe quantum dots linked to TiO2 particles and tubes
      are different. The maximum IPCE values in the visible region range
      from 25% to 35% for OTE/TiO2(NP)/CdSe electrodes while they vary
      from 35% to 45% for OTE/Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe electrodes. These IPCE
      values are relatively higher than those reported in the literature
      for the sensitization of TiO2 films (IPCE 25%) and ZnO nanorods
      (IPCE=18%) with CdSe quantum dots. Note that the comparison made
      here is based on IPCE or external quantum efficiency values and
      not based on absorbed light harvesting efficiencies or APCE
      values.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Although in embodiments, nanotube TiO2 films generally
      absorb more light than nanoparticle TiO2 films, this difference
      accounts for a no more than 5% increase in overall photons
      absorbed. Comparing this with a 10% improvement in IPCE of the
      nanotube film over the nanoparticle film, as represented in an
      exemplary embodiment, demonstrates an advantage of a nanotube
      architecture for facilitating electron transport in nanostructure
      based semiconductor films. The electrons in the particulate TiO2
      films are more susceptible to loss at grain boundaries than those
      in nanotube TiO2 films. In addition, one also needs to take into
      consideration the role of crystal structure and surface defects
      between TiO2 tubes and particles during their interaction with
      CdSe quantum dots.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The open-circuit voltage recorded after stopping the
      illumination shows slower decrease for Ti/TiO2(NT)/CdSe than for
      Ti/TiO2(NP)/CdSe electrodes. Under open-circuit conditions,
      electrons may accumulate within the nanostructure semiconductor
      films following visible irradiation and shift the apparent Fermi
      level to negative potentials. Once the illumination is stopped,
      the accumulated electrons may be slowly discharged as they are
      scavenged by the redox species in the electrolyte. The slower
      decay observed with tubular morphology is a further indication
      that the electrons injected from excited CdSe may survive longer
      and hence may facilitate electron transport without undergoing
      losses at the grain boundaries. The results discussed here
      demonstrate an advantage of assembling semiconductor particles or
      light harvesting assemblies on nanotube architecture for improving
      the photocurrent generation efficiency of solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In an embodiment, short bandgap semiconductors (e.g., CdS,
      PbS, Bi2S3, CdSe, InP) may be used as sensitizers to extend the
      photoresponse of TiO2 into the visible region. CdSe quantum dots
      are capable of injecting electrons into the conduction band of
      TiO2 in a manner analogous to sensitizing dyes. The lower lying
      conduction band of TiO2 (-0.5 V vs. NHE) compared to quantized
      CdSe (&lt;=-1.0 V vs. NHE) is expected to minimize the charge
      recombination and rectify the transport of charge carriers.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The CdSe particles exhibit a band edge emission peak which
      also shifts to the blue region with decreasing particle size. FIG.
      13 (a,c) shows the emission spectra of 2.6 and 3.7 nm CdSe quantum
      dots deposited on glass slides. These quantum dots exhibit
      characteristic emission peaks at 550 nm and 600 nm respectively.
      When CdSe is anchored onto a TiO2 film (b,d) a significant
      quenching of the emission is seen, thus confirming the excited
      state interaction between the two semiconductor particles. This
      quenching behavior represents the deactivation of the excited CdSe
      via electron transfer to TiO2 particles. The processes that follow
      the bandgap excitation of CdSe are presented in Equations 1-3:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CdSe+h[nu]-&gt;CdSe(e+h)-&gt;CdSe+h[nu] (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CdSe(e)+TiO2-&gt;CdSe+TiO2(e) (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      CdSe(h)+Red-&gt;CdSe+Ox (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0075] While the electrons injected into TiO2 are collected to
      generate photocurrent, in an embodiment, a redox couple may be
      employed to scavenge the holes (Equation 3). Failure to scavenge
      holes may lead to surface oxidation, especially during extended
      periods of irradiation. In a typical photoelectrochemical cell,
      such oxidation may be minimized by using a sulfide electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The excited CdSe deactivation may be further analyzed by
      monitoring the emission decay. FIGS. 14A and 14B show the emission
      decay recorded with 2.6 and 3.7 nm CdSe quantum dots. The emission
      decay was multiexponential as the distribution in the
      recombination rate constants influenced the decay kinetics.
      Triexponential decay kinetics were found to be satisfactory in the
      determination of emission lifetimes. These values were then used
      to estimate the average lifetime of CdSe emission decay using the
      following expression:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0077] When deposited on a glass slide, 2.6 and 3.7 nm CdSe
      particles exhibited emission decay with average lifetimes of 4.1
      and 7.9 ns respectively. When anchored on TiO2 particles the
      average time decreased to 0.4 and 1.3 ns for 2.6 and 3.7 nm
      diameter CdSe quantum dots respectively. Similar decrease in the
      CdSe emission lifetime was also seen in the case of TiO2
      nanotubes.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] If one assumes the observed decrease in lifetime to the
      charge transfer to TiO2 one can estimate the charge transfer rate
      constant by the following expression:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Using observed lifetime values, electron transfer rate
      constant of 2.5*10&lt;9 &gt;s&lt;-1 &gt;and 0.63*10&lt;9
      &gt;s&lt;-1 &gt;for 2.6 and 3.7 nm diameter CdSe quantum dots on
      particulate TiO2 films may be obtained. Similar rate constants
      were also observed for TiO2 nanotubes. Similarity between the rate
      constant values observed for TiO2 particles and TiO2 nanotubes
      indicates that the charge injection dynamics are dictated mostly
      by the energetics of quantized CdSe particles and not the
      morphology of the acceptor TiO2. The conduction band of TiO2 is at
      -0.5 V versus NHE. Larger CdSe particles with the bulk properties
      have band energy close to the reported value of -0.8 V vs. NHE.
      The difference between the two conduction band energy levels
      serves as a driving force for the interparticle electron transfer
      (see FIG. 15). Since the shift in the conduction band energy is
      significantly greater than the shift in valence band energy for
      quantized particles, the conduction band of CdSe quantum dots may
      be expected to become more negative (on NHE scale) with decreasing
      particle size. Thus, an increase of a factor of two in the charge
      injection rate constant may be seen when 2.6 nm CdSe instead of
      3.7 nm quantum dots are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In an embodiment, further optimization of cell
      configuration and improvements in the light absorption properties
      of the electrodes may be utilized to further improve the
      performance of quantum dot photovoltaic cells (such as solar
      cells). In an embodiment, one such approach is the construction of
      a rainbow solar cell which employs an ordered assembly of
      nanoparticle quantum dots, such as CdSe, of different diameter. An
      example of TiO2 nanotubes decorated with different sized CdSe
      nanoparticles is shown in FIG. 16. As white light enters the cell,
      smaller size nanoparticles (larger bandgap) absorb the portion of
      the light with smaller wavelengths (blue region). Light with
      longer wavelengths (red region) which is transmitted through the
      initial layer is absorbed by subsequent layers, and so on. By
      creating an orderly gradient of quantum dots of different size,
      the effective capture of incident light may be enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In an embodiment, smaller size particles exhibit higher
      photoconversion efficiency but absorb less light than larger size
      particles. In an embodiment, if the quantized particles are
      anchored on a nanotube array, incident light may be captured while
      collecting and transmitting electrons through the nanotube
      network. It is true that the excess energy of electrons of small
      size particles may be lost once transferred to a supporting
      manifold; however, such a rainbow cell configuration allows one to
      couple the faster electron injection rate of small size particles
      and greater absorption range of large particles effectively.<br>

      [0081] Thus, in an embodiment there is provided a nanostructure
      comprising a nanomaterial comprised of nanoparticles and/or
      nanotubes, the nanomaterial coupled at one or more locations to a
      substrate, and a plurality of quantum dots coupled to the
      nanomaterial, at least two of the plurality of quantum dots being
      differently sized. In an embodiment, differently sized quantum
      dots may be randomly distributed on the nanomaterial, or may be
      ordered, or a combination of random and ordered arrangements may
      be used. In an embodiment, ordered quantum dots may be arranged
      with a short wavelength quantum dot located closer to a light
      source (such as the sun) than a longer wavelength quantum dot. In
      such an embodiment, the arrangement of the quantum dots may be
      done in accordance with the intended direction of the light
      source, although may contact the quantum dots from other
      directions as well. In an embodiment, ordered quantum dots may be
      arranged to form a size gradient (whether partial or completely
      uniform) with shorter wavelength quantum dots located a greater
      distance away from the substrate and longer wavelength quantum
      dots located closer to the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In an embodiment there is provided a photovoltaic cell
      (such as a solar cell) comprising a collecting electrode
      substrate, a nanomaterial scaffold comprising nanoparticles and/or
      nanotubes, the nanomaterial scaffold coupled at one or more
      locations to the substrate, and a plurality of quantum dots and/or
      nanoparticles coupled to the nanomaterial scaffold. In an
      embodiment, the collecting electrode substrate may be coupled to
      or have one or more integrated conducting elements to move the
      charge/current to a location for use and/or storage. Other
      components of a photovoltaic cell as known in the art or later
      developed, such as anti-reflection coatings, concentrating or
      focusing lenses or other such systems, etc. may be incorporated
      with embodiments as provided above.<br>
