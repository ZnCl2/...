      There is as little known energy device, runored to ghave been used
      by teh govbernment, which manifested a spectacular 20 kilowatt
      output from a pair of "thermionic" cylindrical tubes. The
      stainless steel stuber were 22 inches long and only 4 inches in
      diamerter. The inventor, Jasper L. James, died shortly after
      filing his patent in 1981, but the patent,
      Thermionic-Thermoelectric Generator System and Apparatus, USP
      4368416, was stillissued in 1983. What is peculiar is that the
      explanation in the patent completely violates thermodynamics on a
      number of points, yet the patent was granted because the device
      actually worked -- perhaps too well.<br>
      <br>
      What did make sense in the patent was the switching circuit, which
      offered a clue to the correct explanation for the device. The
      output from each hot tube was switched to charge an associated
      external capacitor via a large pulse. The thermionic tube operates
      at the "pulsed abnormnal c=discharge" region, discovered by Paulo
      and Alexandra Correa ( USP 5449989 ), to manifest a negative
      resistance characteristic and excess energy production...<br>

      <br>
      Apparatus is disclosed including a compact thermionic generator
      formed with an outer cathode cylinder and an axially concentric
      inner anode cylinder. The cylinders are sealed and evacuated and
      provided with external electrical connections leading to the
      cathode and anode cylinders. A thermoelectric generator formed of
      a folded length of thermocouples is nested within the anode
      cylinder with respective ends thermically and electrically coupled
      to the cathode and anode cylinders. Sufficient heat applied to the
      outer cylinder causes the thermionic emission from the cathode to
      anode cylinders to be enhanced by the positive potential applied
      to the anode cylinder from the internal thermoelectric generator
      which is also responsive to the applied heat to generate the
      positive potential relative to the potential of the cathode
      cylinder. A generator system is also disclosed in which a pair of
      these generators is interconnected by a solid state switching
      circuit to an output load via intermediate charging capacitors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a combination thermionic-thermoelectric
      generator and more particularly to an apparatus and system which
      provides improved performance over prior known apparatus of this
      general type.<br>
      <br>
      Thermionic and thermoelectric generators are well known in the art
      to be capable of generating electric currents by the application
      of heat to the devices. In the case of thermionic generators,
      current is created by the emission of electrons from a surface
      which has been heated sufficiently to allow the electron energy to
      overcome the potential barrier energy level of the surface. The
      basic theory of thermionic energy conversion is discussed in U.S.
      Pat. No. 2,980,819--Feaster issued Apr. 18, 1961. One difficulty
      known to exist with converters of this type is the relatively low
      usuable potential that can be developed unless a relatively large
      number of converters are cascaded in series with consequent
      increase in bulk and cost. Also, converters that give usuable
      current levels generally require extremely close interelectrode
      spacing between the emitters and collector electrodes, generally
      on the order of one millimeter. The difficulty in achieving and
      maintaining such close spacing, particularly at the high
      temperatures, e.g. 1200 DEG C. required to have usable electron
      emission, has limited the commercial usefulness of thermionic
      converters to highly specialized applications.<br>
      <br>
      Thermoelectric converters, comprising a series of thermocouples,
      are also well known. In this device a current is generated by
      electron flow at the interface between the abutting surfaces of
      dissimilar materials maintained at different temperatures. By
      cascading a large number of these thermocouples, a thermopile can
      be produced which generates usable potential levels limited, in
      general, only by the practical length of the thermopile.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, a number of combined thermionic and thermoelectric
      generators have been proposed in which the two types of devices
      are packaged together and electrically connected at a common
      therminal so that the heat applied to the package causes both
      generators to develop current outputs, usually at separate output
      terminals. Examples of such devices are shown and described in
      U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,189,765 and 3,430,079 issued June 15, 1965, and
      Feb. 25, 1969, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the prior art which exists in this technology, it is
      believed that heretofore there has not existed a small, compack
      thermionic-thermoelectric generator apparatus capable of producing
      usable levels of current at usable potential levels. It is an
      object of this invention to provide a system embodying the
      improved apparatus with suitable switching circuits to furnish
      electrical current at usable potential levels to a load impedance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Thus in accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is
      provided thermionic-thermoelectric generator apparatus comprising
      a first elongated metallic cylindrical electrode having its
      internal surface coated with a thermionic electron emmissive
      material and a second elongated metallic cylindrical electrode
      nested coaxially within the first cylinder electrode, this second
      cylinder having at least the outer surface thereof coated with
      graphite to serve as a collector electrode for the electrons
      emitted from the first cylinder surface. Preferably the
      interelectrode spacing between the two cylinders is substantially
      uniform along the axial length thereof. The apparatus is further
      provided with a plurality ofthermopiles nested within the second
      cylinder, the thermopiles being electrically connected in series
      with one end consisting of electron donor material electrically
      coupled to the first cylinder, the other end consisting of
      electron acceptor material being electrically coupled to the
      second or inner cylinder. Means, such as sealable vacuum fittings
      are provided by which the outer cylinder may be evacuated and the
      vacuum maintained in the interelectrode space between the two
      cylinders. Means are also provided , such as at the end of the
      cylinders opposite the vacuum fitting, to provide external
      electrical connections from the cylinder electrodes to a load
      circuit.<br>
      <br>
      In the system of the invention, there is also included, with a
      pair of generators such as just described, circuit means for
      coupling in repetitive alternating sequence, each of the
      generators to output load terminals to provide a continuous
      electrical current flow to a load impedance connected to the load
      terminals.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Referring jointly to FIGS. 1-5,the thermionic-thermoelectric
      generator apparatus 10 includes a first or outer cylinder 11,
      preferably of stainless steel, enclosed at one end by an end cap
      12 and suitable vacuum fittings 13 and at the other end by an end
      cap 14 having an elongated output terminal electrode 15 sealed at
      the distal end by a ceramic seal and the extension 17a of interior
      terminal electrode 17. As best seen in FIG. 2, the generator
      apparatus comprises first outer cylinder 11 in which is nested, in
      coaxial manner, a second or inner cylinder 20, preferably also of
      stainless steel. As seen in the drawings, the righthand end of
      cylinder 20 is supported by four L-shaped aluminum oxide mounts 21
      attached to stainless steel blocks 22 which in turn are secured in
      suitable manner to the interior face of end cap 12. The interior
      surface 11a of the outer cylinder 11 is coated in well known
      manner with a suitable thermionic electron emissive material such
      as a mixture of barium oxide, strontium oxide and calcium oxide,
      mixed in the ratio of 1:1:1 by weight. The outer surface 20a of
      inner cylinder 20 is coated in known manner with graphite to serve
      as a collector of electrons emitted from outer cylinder surface
      11a.<br>
      <br>
      Nested within inner cylinder 20 is a thermopile assembly best seen
      in FIGS. 3 and 4 and comprised of a plurality, in this case four,
      thermopile sections 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d, each of which consists of
      approximately 380 thermocouples formed of thin wafers of carbon
      and silicon carbide in alternating sequence. The sections are
      electrically connected in series by tungsten connectors 31. One
      end 32 of the thermopile series, formed of a wafer of the electron
      donor material silicon carbide is adhered to a stainless steel
      block 33. The other end 34 of the thermopile series formed of a
      wafer of electron acceptor material carbon is attached to a
      stainless steel block 35 to which is attached an electode rod 36
      of stainless steel. The thermopile sections 30a-30d are positioned
      snugly within recesses of a ceramic extruded cruciform shaped
      insulator support 37 (best seen in FIG. 4) and thereafter the
      tungsten connectors 31 are attached. Ceramic end caps 38 and 39
      are positioned at the ends of the cruciform thermocouple assembly
      and the entire assembly is then placed inside a ceramic housing 40
      which is closed at one end 41. The housing 40 is then placed
      inside inner cylinder 20. Preferably, the cross-sectional diagonal
      dimension of housing 40 is the same as the inner diameter of
      cylinder 20 so that the housing is properly supported and held in
      place within cylinder 20. A stainless steel end cap 45 is placed
      over the end of housing 40 so as to touch thermopile terminal
      block 33 and secured to the end of inner cylinder 20 to provide
      electrical coupling between the end of the thermopile and cylinder
      20. Electrode rod 36, extends through an opening 46 suitably
      provided in end cap 45 and touches end cap 14 of outer cylinder 11
      so as to provide electrical electrical coupling from the other end
      of the thermopile 30 to the outer cylinder 11 which comprises the
      cathode of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      An elongated electrically conductive stainless steel rod 17
      extends axially outward from inner cylinder end cap 45 and serves
      as the positive connection for the generator. Rod 17 extends
      concentrically through an outer tube 15 and secured by a suitable
      collar fitting to extension rod 17a which projects through ceramic
      seal fitting 16. Rod 17a ends in a terminal connector 17b which
      serves as the positive terminal of the generator 10 while tube 15
      ends with an electrical connector 15a which serves as the negative
      terminal of the generator 10.<br>
      <br>
      In an actually constructed and operated device, the length of
      cylinder 11 is 22 inches long and 4 inches in outer diameter. The
      inner cylinder 20 is 16 inches in length and 3 inches in diameter.
      Both cylinders are made of stainless steel, the inner cylinder 20
      being 16 gauge while outer cylinder 11 is 0.237 inches thick. The
      thermopile consists of 380 junctions of silicon carbide and
      carbon. Any suitable heat source capable of heating the generator
      to temperatures of 400 DEG-450 DEG C. may be used to operate the
      generator.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 6, a suitable switching and control circuit
      is shown for use in a system of the invention utilizing a pair of
      the thermionic-thermoelectric generators 10 and 10' as described
      above. Thus, the circuit of FIG. 6 includes a timer circuit 60 of
      the well known 555 integrated circuit type operated in the astable
      mode at a frequency of, for example, 400 Hz., as determined
      principally by the value of resistors 61-64 and the value of
      capacitor 65. The output of timer 60 is coupled by line 60a to the
      input of J-K flip-flop 68 to cause the output states on line 68a
      and 68b to reverse at the aforementioned 400 Hz. rate. A pair of
      Darlington connected transistors 70 and 80 are alternately biased
      into conduction by flip-flop 68 causing SCR 79 and 89,
      respectively, to be triggered into conduction. When, for example,
      SCR 89 is conducting, the current output of generator 10 is
      coupled to charging capacitor 96. At this time, SCR 79 is off and
      charging capacitor 94 is isolated from generator 10'.<br>
      <br>
      The circuit further includes transistors 75 and 85, the outputs of
      which are cross-coupled to opposite branches of the balanced
      switching circuit including SCR 79 and current transistor 90 in
      one branch and SCR 89 and current transistor 92 in the other
      branch. In this manner, when Darlington transistor 80 has
      triggered SCR 89 into conduction to couple generator 10 to
      charging capacitor 96, the output of transistor 85 causes
      transistor 90 to conduct resulting in coupling of current from
      previously charged capacitor 94 to output terminals 87, 98 and
      through load 100. When flip-flop 68 switches state, the sequence
      is reversed and generator 10' is coupled to charging capacitor 94
      through SCR 79 and transistor 92 is pulled into conduction to
      couple charging capacitor 96 to output terminals 97, 98 and load
      100.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example and without limitation thereto, the following
      circuit values were used in an actually constructed embodiment of
      the invention, viz:<br>

      With generator apparatus 10 as described, it will be appreciated
      that the generator system of the invention is compact and
      efficient in operation. Using the thermopile nested within the
      inner cylinder 20 to operate from the same heat source as used for
      the thermionic converter stage to apply a positive potential to
      the collector cylinder 20 allows greater interelectrode spacing to
      be used between cylinders 11 and 20 and provides high currents at
      usable potential levels. For example, with the generator system as
      described, currents of 200 amps at 108 volts are possible when the
      generators are heated only to 400 DEG-450 DEG C., assuming 380
      thermocouple junctions in each of the thermopile sections 30a-30d.
      Since the system is compact, portable and requires low
      temperatures available from conventional heat sources to operate,
      it can be installed for use in, for example, electrically powered
      vehicles without the limitations associated with electric storage
      batteries. It can also readily be used as a source of electric
      power for residential purposes of as a back-up power source for
      emergency facilities such as hospitals.<br>
      <br>
      While there has been described what at present is believed to be
      one preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be appreciated
      that modifications therein can be made by those skilled in the art
      without departing from the spirit of the invention and it is
      intended that all such modifications are to be covered as are
      within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
