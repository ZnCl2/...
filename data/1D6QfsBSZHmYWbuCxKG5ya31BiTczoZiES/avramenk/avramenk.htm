      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Low cost and low losses
          single-wire electric power system (SWEPS) has been
          developed.&nbsp; The new technology of electric power
          transmission uses idle operation mode of the transmission line
          and reactive capacitive current for transmission of active
          electric power.&nbsp; Three different SWEPS has been
          constructed and tested: 230V, 10kV and 100kV, each is of one
          kilowatt capacity.&nbsp; Resonance mode of oscillation at the
          frequency from 3 kHz to 30 kHz was used to provide the most
          efficient power transmission.&nbsp; Frequency converter and
          modified Tesla transformer were applied at the generator site
          to generate high frequency reactive capacitive current.&nbsp;
          Reversal Tesla transformer and standard rectifier and inverter
          were used at the consumer end to convert the reactive high
          frequency electric power to standard 50-60Hz
          electricity.&nbsp; It has been experimentally proved that
          SWEPS has quasi-superconductivity properties for reactive
          capacitive current flow along the line even at high operation
          temperature of the electric conductor.&nbsp; SWEPS has no
          resistance losses for following tested conductor materials of
          the line: copper, aluminium, steel, tungsten, carbon, water,
          damp soil.&nbsp; Analysis of theoretical calculations and
          experimental study shows that SWEPS can be applied both for
          energy transmission from renewable powerful generation site to
          a large energy system and for transmission lines connecting
          different parts of renewable energy system.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Renewable-based electric
          grids are increasingly being viewed as an attractive
          alternative for providing power to rural communities.&nbsp;
          Technology options include small hydropower, biomasspowered
          generators, small geothermal, PV, solar-thermal, wind turbines
          and hybrid systems with back-up diesel generator, which may be
          connected to the local utility.&nbsp; Implementation of
          renewable-based technologies for rural electrification would
          contribute to the social and economic growth of the rural
          communities and would serve sustainable progress of the remote
          regions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electric grids face specific
          problems of non-efficient operations, including transmission
          losses and the high cost of grid extension in remote sparsely
          populated areas.&nbsp; For example off-shore wind turbine,
          micro-hydro or geothermal generator are often located far from
          consumers and requires costly installation of a long distance
          transmission line which usually has from 6% to 10% of electric
          losses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hybrid system, comprising
          jointly operating small power generators of equal capacity,
          faces the EMC problem resulting in pure operation stability
          due to renewable energy potential or electric load variations.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We propose and investigate
          single-wire power transmission line systems instead of
          three-phase lines and apply steel conductor or even non-metal
          conductive media instead of traditionally used aluminium or
          copper conductor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Objective of this
          project is to implement the original low cost and low-loss
          single-wire electric power system for renewable-based electric
          grids.&nbsp; Project program covers design and manufacture of
          50 kW single-wire power transmission line.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The block diagram of the
          single-wire power transmission line is shown in the
          Appendix.&nbsp; The complete set of equipment contains:
          audio-frequency converter, resonance generator - monostable
          multivibrator, rectifier and inverter.&nbsp; Transmitted
          electromagnetic energy has a voltage of 5 kV to 20 kV and a
          frequency of 1 kHz to 20 kHz.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SWEPS operation principle is
          the following: In no load operation mode the active current
          and the magnetic field of the line are equal to zero, while
          the electric field intensity has its maximum value owing to
          reactive displacement current that charges the capacitance of
          the line. It is well known, that the Ohm's law and Joule's law
          are not applicable to displacement current, and Joule
          (resistive) losses are equal to zero.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Activities ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Resonance mode of
          oscillation at the frequency from 3 kHz to 30 kHz was used to
          provide the most efficient power transmission.&nbsp; Frequency
          converter and modified Tesla transformer were applied at the
          generator site to generate high frequency reactive capacitive
          -current.&nbsp; Reversal Tesla transformer and standard
          rectifier and inverter were used at the consumer end to
          convert the reactive high frequency electric power to standard
          50-60Hz electricity.&nbsp; Three different SWEPSs have been
          developed and tested: 230V, 10kV and 100kV, each of them
          having capacity of 1 kBA, see Appendix. 5 to 100 mm diameter
          wires of copper, aluminium, steel and tungsten (as well as 100
          mm carbon wire, 10 mm plastic tube and 0.3mm thick ITO film on
          glass substrate) were used as electric power transmission
          media.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Level of Implementation ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Theoretical and experimental
          study of parameters of the single-wire transmission power
          system has been carried out demonstrating its ability of
          efficient operation.&nbsp; Different kinds of electrical
          apparatus and application possibilities has been investigated.
          Analysis of theoretical calculations and experimental study
          shows that SWEPS can be applied both for energy transmission
          from renewable powerful generation site to a large energy
          system and for transmission lines connecting different parts
          of renewable energy system.&nbsp; The transmission method and
          the device has been protected by patents [1-7].&nbsp; The two
          next implementation stages are:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stage 1 (12 months): 20 kW
          to 50 kW 50 km single-wire electric power system for renewable
          based electric grid ($350 000) and</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stage 2 (24 months): 1 MW
          quasi-superconductive line for wind-offshore and island
          application ($3.5M).</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Results ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Single-wire electric power
          system for electric grid can be applied instead of three-phase
          network.&nbsp; SWEPS uses one pole single-wire open-tuned
          circuit, capacitive and displacement current for transmission
          of active power.&nbsp; Modified step-up Tesla transformer was
          applied at the generator site to generate high frequency
          reactive capacitive current.&nbsp; Reversal step-down Tesla
          transformer or diode-capacitor block was used at the user's
          end to convert high frequency reactive power to standard ac 50
          Hz or dc electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Substantial reduction of
          distribution network construction cost is expected owing to
          reduced consumption of wires and accessories and application
          of light type poles and structures.&nbsp; Energy losses in
          distribution networks are much lower compared with
          conventional power distribution lines.&nbsp; It has been
          experimentally proved that SWEPS has no resistance losses with
          conductor media like: steel, tungsten and carbon wires having
          diameter from 5 mm to 100 mm, water, ITO film on glass
          substrate, damp soil etc.&nbsp; It makes it possible to
          construct electric power transmission lines using steel
          conductors and even non-conductive materials.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Computer simulation of
          distributed solar power system, consisting of several solar
          power plants installed in Spain, in European part of Russia
          and Far East of Russia, connected by low loss transmission
          line, showed that this power system generates electricity 24
          hours a day 6 months a year and does not require electric
          accumulator or back-up generator during the night.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to
          the field of electrical technology, and relates particularly
          to a method for the continuous transformation of electrical
          energy with its subsequent transmission from an initial source
          (transformer) to a consuming device, and also to an apparatus
          for the implementation of this method of transformation and
          the supplying of power to electrical devices through a
          transmission line which does not form a closed circuit, i.e.,
          consists of a single conducting wire. This invention therefore
          provides a method and associated apparatus for supplying power
          to an electrical device(s), including generation and
          subsequent transmission thereof to a receiving device via a
          transmission line, the method being characterised by the
          transformation of the electrical energy which is generated
          into the energy of oscillation of a field of free electrical
          charges such as the displacement current or longitudinal wave
          of an electrical field, the density of which charges varies in
          time, and the transmission of the energy via a transmission
          line which does not form a closed circuit comprising a
          single-wire transmission line and, where necessary, its
          transformation into the electromagnetic energy of conduction
          currents.</font> </p>

          transmission of electrical energy along a conducting wire

          conductivity. The essence of this phenomenon consists in the
          fact that electricity may be transmitted from one body to
          another along a metal conductor or a length of yarn, and that
          the electrical charge is distributed over the surface of the

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary of the Invention:</font></i>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a first aspect
          of the present invention there is provided a method of
          supplying power to one or more electrical devices, including
          generation and transformation of electrical energy and
          subsequent transmission thereof to a receiving device via a
          transmission line, the method being chracterised by the
          transformation of the electrical energy which is generated
          into the energy of oscillation of a field of free electrical
          charges such as a displacement current or longitudinal wave of
          an electrical field, the density of which charges varies in
          time, and the transmission of the energy via a transmission
          line which does not form a closed circuit comprising a
          single-wire transmission line and, where necessary, its
          transformation into the electromagnetic energy of conduction
          currents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, the invention provides
          transformation of electrical energy generated in an initial
          source into energy of oscillation of a field of free
          electrical charges (the displacement current or longitudinal
          wave of the electrical field), which energy is transmitted to
          the consuming device via a conductor of the transmission line
          which does not form a closed circuit and, where necessary,
          transformed into the electromagnetic energy of closed circuit
          conductive currents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The oscillations of the
          field of free electrical particles occur either by means of
          the reciprocating (cyclical) displacement of a concentrated
          electrical charge in space, or by means of a periodical change
          in density (and/or polarity) of the free electrical charges on
          a particular surface (in a particular volume).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a second aspect
          of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for
          the implementation of the above method of supplying power to
          one or more electrical devices, the apparatus providing an
          initial source of electrical energy, a transforming device, a
          transmission line and a receiving device, the apparatus being
          characterised by the provision of a variable density generator
          of free electrical charges as the displacement current or
          longitudinal wave of an electrical field, an output of which
          is connected by means of: a conductor of a transmission line
          which does not form a closed circuit to a receiving device,
          either directly or via a blocking capacitor, and further to
          any conductive body possessing an equivalent (natural)
          capacity adequate to ensure the normal functioning of the
          receiving device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, the invention provides
          a variable (alternating) density generator of free electrical
          charges, which flow under the influence of coulomb forces
          along a conductor of the transmission line which does not form
          a closed circuit to the site of a device which consumes
          electrical energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A possible variant of the
          generator is a generator at the outlet of which not only the
          density of the free electrical charges, but also their
          polarity, may be varied.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The outlet of the generator
          is connected to a conductor of the transmission line which
          does not form a closed circuit line either directly or via a
          blocking capacitor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition, the generator
          of oscillations of the electrical field of free charges may be
          constructed in a similar fashion to a generator of
          displacement current (travelling longitudinal waves of an
          electrical field), by using a sequential resonance circuit in
          the form of two interconnected inductors such that the
          equivalent inductivity of the resonance circuit is provided by
          their resultant inductivity, and the equivalent capacity of
          the resonance circuit is provided by the equivalent (natural)
          capacity of the interconnected inductors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To supply power to
          electrical devices which consume alternating current, the
          output of the conductor of the transmission line which does
          not form a closed circuit may be connected:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">a) to one of the input
          terminals of the receiving devices, while the device's other
          input terminal is either grounded or connected to any
          conductor possessing a natural (equivalent) capacity adequate
          to provide for the normal working of the receiving (consuming)
          device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">b) to an accommodating
          device employing a conversion circuit consisting of two
          interconnected inductors, such that the receiving device
          (load) is connected to the two ends of the first inductor, the
          output of the conductor of the transmission line which does
          not form a closed circuit is connected to one end of the
          second inductor, and the other end of the second inductor
          connected to any conductor with an equivalent (natural)
          capacity and inductance selected in order to provide for the
          nominal power consumption of the receiving device (load).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To supply power to devices
          consuming direct current, the conductor of the transmission
          line which does not form a closed circuit may be connected to
          an adjustment circuit in the form of:</font> </p>

          second diode, while the cathode of the first diode and the
          anode of the second diode are the output points for connection
          to the receiving device, either directly or with a capacitor

          electrical field), the density of which charges varies in
          time, and this energy is transmitted via a conductor of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention is intended
          for the creation of a highly efficient means for the
          transformation and transmission of electrical energy, and also
          for the creation of both permanent and mobile devices for the
          transmission of electrical energy from an initial source to a
          consuming device via a transmission line which does not form a
          closed circuit, ie a single-wire transmission line.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention may be used
          conjointly with various power-engineering and technological
          processes which involve the use of super-high voltage
          electrical and electromagnetic fields, electron beams and
          super-long wave radio communications, when it will make
          possible a sharp reduction in the dimensions and weight of
          equipment as compared with the means traditionally employed.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The proposed apparatus,
          which may be termed a "monovibrator", may consist of two
          inductively connected much layered coils in accordance with
          the scheme of a consecutive resonance circuit. As a rule, the
          secondary coil consists of up to some tens of thousands of
          turns of thin isolated wire with the turns wound one to
          another in many layers on a dialectic core. Disposition of the
          primary coil in respect to the secondary one doesn't matter
          much. What does matter is an inductive link which determines
          potential transmitted from the primary to the secondary coil.
          The monovibrator may or may not have a ferromagnetic core. The
          ferromagnetic core influences the width of the working
          frequency bandwidth -- it broadens it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">High working outcoming
          voltage is the result of a high coefficient of transformation,
          as the primary coil usually contains a couple of dozens of
          winds for working frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to a couple
          of hundred kHz. A preferred working frequency is 5 kHz.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With a sequential resonance
          circuit including two interconnected inductors having
          inductance L1 and L2, and an equivalent inductance of the
          resonance circuit being provided by the resultant inductivity
          L1+L2, the load of the monovibrator when running idle acquires
          capacitance character that means which it is reactive. The
          magnitude of an active constituent of a monoconductive line
          with the consecutive resonance is rather low and its incoming
          resistance is approaching zero. That is why with rather a
          powerful primary source the consecutive resonance makes it
          possible to transmit more power through the monoconductive
          line in case there is an outtake of this power at the other
          line terminal, which is opposite to the primary source of
          power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reaction of the
          monoconductive line of any length can always be compensated by
          regulating the frequency of the primary source (generator,
          converting devices), thus providing consecutive resonance in
          the line itself with all the magnitudes of incoming and
          outgoing characteristics arising therefrom.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Currently there are
          different schemes of automatic frequency regulation of
          generators of alternating electromotive power depending on
          changing inductive-capacitant parameters of conductive lines.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The method and apparatus of
          the present invention does not have the drawbacks of
          previously known single line systems.</font> </p>
