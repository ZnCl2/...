        <p><b><font size="+1">ShockWave Power</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>During the past several years of intensive research, Hydro
        Dynamics has studied the production of shock waves for the
        purpose of transforming fluids. Early prototypes, consisting of
        a rotor spinning inside a housing, were able to significantly
        increase the temperature of water flowing through the device.
        This result indicated that it was possible to harness the power
        of cavitation. This controlled cavitation generates shock waves,
        which convert mechanical energy into heat energy. </p>
      <p>The first patent was issued to the Company for the ShockWave
        Power generator in 1993 (U.S. Patent No. 5,188,090). The Hydro
        Dynamics, Inc --- The Solutions Company is now patented in the
        US, Canada, Japan and 11 European countries. The Company has
        also filed process patent applications for gas/liquid mixing
        using its technology. </p>
      <p>Continuous research has led Hydro Dynamics to develop
        commercial applications that provide significant economic
        improvements in large industrial processes based upon the
        presence of the following attributes: </p>
      <p>I. Employs multiple large-scale, high-volume processes
        involving heating, evaporation, separation, or mixing; <br>
        II. No significant changes or technological advancements in
        processing equipment in recent history;III. Requires significant
        capacity utilization to lower production costs through economies
        of scale; <br>
        IV. Cannot increase capacity without large capital expenditures
        (the "Cliff Effect"), and <br>
        V. Challenged by ever-tightening environmental regulations. </p>
      <p>ShockWave Power (SP) technology represents a new and innovative
        way to apply energy to liquids. The technology has two distinct
        capabilities: </p>
      <p>1. SP can apply direct <b>heat or evaporate liquids</b>
        without scale buildup. </p>
      <p>2. SP also provides a more efficient process for <b>mixing
          dissimilar fluids,</b> such as gases and liquids-a process
        used widely in heavy industry for oxidation of chemicals or
        separation of oil and water. </p>
      <p>While varying by application, one or more of these significant
        benefits will be realized through the use of SP over
        conventional technologies: </p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; reduced energy requirements, <br>
        &gt;&gt; improved process efficiencies (in time, operating
        costs, and/or capital costs), <br>
        &gt;&gt; elimination of process downtime from the maintenance
        requirements of conventional technologies. <br>
        &gt;&gt; more effective and efficient mixing and increase
        transfer rate. </p>
      <p>The ShockWave Power (SP) generator works by taking a fluid,
        pure or impure, into the machine housing, where it is passed
        over the generator's spinning cylinder. The specific geometry of
        the holes in the cylinder, clearance between the cylinder, and
        the housing and rotational speed create pressure differences
        within the liquid where tiny bubbles form and collapse. These
        collapsing bubbles generate shock waves that are used to heat,
        concentrate and mix. The result is the conversion of mechanical
        energy into heat energy. In the case of mixing, the shock waves
        increase the surface area of the gas and liquid being mixed so
        that a higher mass transfer rate occurs. </p>
      <p>ShockWave Power technology provides a unique method of heating
        and evaporating liquids that provides industries with
        "scale-free" processing. </p>
      <p>The SP generator heats liquids in a totally different way and
        creates the heat in a totally different place - inside the
        liquid. The heat is created where it is needed. In the SP
        generator, there are no heat transfer surfaces - the metal
        surfaces are actually cooler than the liquid. Impurities will
        not migrate from a hotter liquid and build up on cooler metal.
        Therefore, there is no reason for the SP Generator to scale. The
        T between the liquid and the metal is negative. </p>
      <p>In addition, there is an ultrasonic cleaning effect that occurs
        on the metal surfaces inside the SP generator as the shock waves
        are generated within narrow tolerances. This cleaning effect, in
        conjunction with a negative T between metal and liquid, ensure
        scale-free heating. </p>

        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Richard Milton</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font size="-0">For more than two years debate has raged on the
          Internet about an ordinary-looking metal drum sitting on the
          concrete floor of a factory building in Rome, Georgia, 50
          miles from Atlanta. Its inventor, the man about whom the
          Internet debate is raging, is James Griggs, an industrial
          heating engineer.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The invention that has brought Griggs such
          notoriety is a device that he began developing in 1987, that
          he calls the 'Hydrosonic Pump' and that many of his supporters
          believe is over-unity, in that it generates around 30 per cent
          more energy as heat than is put in as electricity.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">To the skeptics, the Griggs Gadget is, at best,
          a case of self-delusion on a grand scale, and, at worst, a
          case of scientific fraud. To his supporters, the pump is the
          first unequivocal public demonstration of undoubted
          over-unity.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Jim Griggs told me, 'the pump is based on a
          theory of what takes place when a shock wave is created in a
          fluid. We know that when you create a shock wave in a liquid
          there is a minute amount of energy released into the fluid in
          the form of heat.'</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">'Most of the previous studies had been done in
          how to eliminate that shock wave, instead of putting the heat
          to a useful purpose. We've designed a system to take the
          shock-wave heat energy, capture it, and produce hot water or
          steam.'</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Griggs believes that his device works on
          perfectly normal principles and violates no laws of physics.
          Just what happens when the Hydrosonic pump is filled up with
          water and switched on is described by over-unity investigator
          Jed Rothwell who conducted a detailed engineering
          investigation of the device in January 1994.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">'During one of the demonstrations we watched,'
          he says, 'over a 20 minute period, 4.80 Kilowatt Hours of
          electricity was input, and 19,050 BTUs of heat evolved, which
          equals 5.58 Kilowatt Hours, or 117 per cent of input. The
          actual input to output ratio was even better than this, when
          you take into account the inefficiencies of the electric
          motor.'</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">But if there are kilowatts of excess heat
          available, why doesn't Griggs simply use the steam to turn a
          turbine-generator and connect the output to the input -- thus
          getting a perpetual motion machine?</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">One reason is that converting steam into
          electricity is an extremely inefficient process. You would be
          lucky to convert 5 per cent of the output heat energy back
          into electricity -- and 2 per cent might be nearer the mark.
          The Hydrosonic pump would therefore have to be massively
          over-unity before you could recover enough energy to make it
          self-sustaining, and at present the margin is a 'modest' 30
          per cent.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">More importantly, the excess energy does not
          actually appear at the output steam pipe for a constant input
          of energy. What happens is this; the pump is started and after
          five or ten minutes reaches a steady state where it is
          converting water at room temperature to steam. Once this
          steady state is reached, the pump, according to Griggs, goes
          into an over-unity mode where the output temperature is
          maintained, but the amount of energy needed at the input to
          maintain it, drops by 30 per cent.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Griggs has been working with a number of
          physicists and engineers to try to get to the bottom of just
          how his device works. As well as Jed Rothwell's consulting
          engineering firm in Atlanta he has worked with Professor
          Keizios, dean emeritus of the Department of Mechanical
          Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology and past
          president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
          Professor Keizos supervised the design of the instrumentation
          that measures the energy input and output of the Griggs
          Gadget.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">In a second test, during which the over-unity
          effect was measured, the adjusted co-efficient of power was a
          remarkable 168 per cent -- the machine produced 1.68 times the
          energy that was input. A third test did nearly as well with a
          Co-efficient of power of 157 per cent.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">If the only evidence for these claims were the
          colour brochure printed by Griggs's company, Hydro Dynamics
          Corporation Inc., and reports of his supporters, then most
          observers might be inclined to side with the skeptics:
          Griggs's claims seem fundamentally improbable. Yet
          surprisingly, Griggs has not only patented his device and
          started manufacturing a commercial version on a small scale,
          he has also sold and installed devices to users in the Atlanta
          area.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">The customers include the Atlanta Police
          Department, a fire station, a dry cleaning plant, and a
          gymnasium. Interestingly, the Hydrosonic pump was installed in
          the public buildings by the county engineer after evaluating
          the device. The buildings are using the device mainly for
          heating purposes, and they have been running for more than a
          year. The customers have bills from their local electric
          utility company showing a year on year decrease in bills
          equivalent to 30 per cent.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">What precisely causes the claimed excess heat?
          Griggs himself rejects the popular idea that his pump has
          something to do with so-called 'cold fusion'.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">'We have kind of been lumped into the cold
          fusion field', he says wryly, 'because we have experienced
          excess energy out of the pump. As far as cold fusion goes, we
          don't believe that we're accomplishing any type of nuclear
          reaction within our system. We feel that it can be explained
          through the theory of cavitation or sonoluminescence.'</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Griggs's gadget has been examined by a steady
          stream of investigators, both friendly and skeptical. So far,
          they have all gone away mystified. Unlike most 'over-unity'
          devices, however, you can buy and install a hydrosonic pump in
          your own home.</font> </p>

          for heating fluids. The devices employ a cylindrical rotor
          which features surface irregularities. The rotor rides a shaft
          which is driven by external power means. Fluid injected into
          the device is subjected to relative motion between the rotor
          and the device housing, and exits the device at increased
          pressure and/or temperature. The device is thermodynamically
          highly efficient, despite the structural and mechanical
          simplicity of the rotor and other compounds. Such devices
          accordingly provide efficient, simply, inexpensive and

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates to devices containing rotating members for heating
          fluids.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Various designs exist for
          devices which use rotors or other rotating members to increase
          pressure and/or temperature of fluids (including, where
          desired to convert fluids from the liquidous to gaseous
          phases). U.S. Pat. # 3,791,349 issued Feb. 12, 1974 to
          Schaefer, for instance, discloses an apparatus and method for
          production of steam and pressure by intentional creation of
          shock waves in a distended body of water. Various passageways
          and chambers are employed to create a tortuous path for the
          fluid and to maximize the water hammer effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other devices which employ
          rotating members to heat fluids are disclosed in U.S. Pat. #
          3,720,372 issued Mar. 13, 1973 to Jacobs which discloses a
          turbing type coolant pump driven by an automobile engine to
          warm engine coolant; U.S. Pat. # 2,991,764 issued Jul. 11,
          1961 which discloses a fluid agitation-type heater; and U.S.
          Pat. # 1,758,207 issued May 13, 1930 to Walker which discloses
          a hydraulic heat generating system that includes a heat
          generator formed of a vaned rotor and stator acting in concert
          to heat fluids as they move relative to one another.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These devices employ
          structurally complex rotors and stators which include vanes or
          passages for fluid flow, thus resulting in structural
          complexity, increased manufacturing costs, and increased
          likelihood of structural failure and consequent higher
          maintenance costs and reduced reliability.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Devices according to the
          present invention for heating fluids contain a cylindrical
          rotor whose cylindrical surface features a number of
          irregularities or bores. The rotor rotates within a housing
          whose interior surface conforms closely to the cylindrical and
          end surfaces of the rotor. A bearing plate, which serves to
          mount bearings and seals for the shaft and rotor, abuts each
          side of the housing. The bearing plates feature hollowed
          portions which communicate with the void between the housing
          and rotor. Inlet ports ar formed in the bearing plates to
          allow fluid to enter the rotor/housing void in the vicinity of
          the shaft. The housing features one or more exit ports through
          which fluid at elevated pressure and/or temperature exits the
          apparatus. The shaft may be driven by electric motor or other
          motive means, and may be driven directly, geared, powered by
          pulley or otherwise driven.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to one aspect of
          the invention, the rotor devices may be utilized to supply
          heated water to heat exchangers in HVAC systems and to
          deenergized hot water heaters in homes, thereby supplanting
          the requirement for energy input into the hot water heaters
          and furnace side of the HVAC systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is accordingly a object
          of the present invention to provide a device for heating fluid
          in a void located between a rotating rotor and stationary
          housing, which device is structurally simple and requires
          reduced manufacturing and maintenance costs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is an additional object
          of the present invention to produce a mechanically elegant and
          thermodynamically highly efficient means for increasing
          pressure and/or temperature of fluids such as water
          (including, where desired, converting fluid from liquid to gas
          phase).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is an additional object
          of the present invention to provide a system for providing
          heat and hot water to residences and commercial space using
          devices featuring mechanically driven rotors for heating
          water.</font> </p>

          Shaft 14 in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 has a
          primary diameter of 13/4" and may be formed of forged steel,
          cast or ductile iron, or other materials as desired. Shaft 14
          may be driven by an electric motor or other motive means, and
          may be driven directly, geared, driven by pulley, or driven as
          otherwise desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Attached rigidly to shaft 14
          is rotor 12. Rotor 12 may be formed of aluminum, steel, iron
          or other metal or alloy as appropriate. Rotor 12 is
          essentially a solid cylinder of material featuring a shaft
          bore 18 to receive shaft 14, and a number of irregularities 20
          in its cylindrical surface. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1
          and 2, rotor 12 is six inches in diameter and nine inches in
          length, while in the embodiment shown in FIG. 3 the rotor is
          ten inches in diameter and four inches in length. Locking pins
          set screws or other fasteners 22 may be used to fix rotor 12
          with respect to shaft 14. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1,
          rotor 12 features a plurality of regularly spaced and aligned
          bores 24 drilled, bored, or otherwise formed in its
          cylindrical surface 26. Bores 24 may feature countersunk
          bottoms, as shown in FIG. 2. Bores 24 may also be offset from
          the radial direction either in a direction to face toward or
          away from the direction of rotation of rotor 12. In one
          embodiment of the invention, bores 24 are offset substantially
          15 degrees from direction of rotation of rotor 12. Each bore
          24 may feature a lip 28 (not shown) where it meets surface 26
          of rotor 12, and the lip 28 may be flared or otherwise
          contoured to form a continuous surface between the surfaces of
          bores 28 and cylindrical surface 26 of rotor 12. Such flared
          surfaces are useful for providing areas in which vacuum may be
          developed as rotor 12 rotates with respect to housing 16. The
          depth, diameter and orientation of bores 24 may be adjusted in
          dimension to optimize efficiency and effectiveness of device
          10 for heating various fluids, and to optimize operation,
          efficiency, and effectiveness of device 10 with respect to
          particular fluid temperatures, pressures and flow rates, as
          they relate to rotational speed of rotor 12. In a preferred
          embodiment of the device, the bores 24 are formed radially
          substantially 18 degrees apart from on another.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment shown in
          FIGS. 1 and 2, housing 16 is formed of two housing bells 30A
          and 30B which are generally C-shaped in cross section and
          whose interior surfaces 32A and 32B conform closely to the
          cylindrical surface 26 and ends 34 of rotor 12. The devices
          shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 feature a 0.1 inch clearance between
          rotor 12 and housing 16. Smaller or larger clearances may
          obviously be provided, once again depending upon the
          parameters of the fluid involved, the desired flow rate and
          the rotational speed of rotor 12. Housing bells 30A and 30B
          may be formed of aluminum, stainless steel or otherwise as
          desired, and preferably feature a plurality of axially
          disposed holes 36 through which bolts or other fasteners 38
          connect housing bells 30A and 30B in sealing relationship.
          Each housing bell 30A and 30B also features a axial bore
          sufficient in diameter to accommodate the shaft 14 together
          with seals about the shaft, and additionally to permit flow of
          fluid between the shaft, seals, and housing bell 30A and 30B
          and bore 40.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The interior surface 32A and
          32B of housing bells 30A and 30B may be smooth with no
          irregularities, or may be serrated, feature holes or bores or
          other irregularities as desired to increase efficiency and
          effectiveness of device 10 for particular fluids, flow rates
          and rotor 12 rotational speeds. In the preferred embodiment,
          there are no such irregularities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Connected to an outer end
          44A and 44B of each bell 30A and 30B is a bearing plate 46A
          and 46B. The primary function of bearing plates 46A and 46B is
          to carry one or more bearings 48A and 48B (roller, ball, or as
          otherwise desired) which in turn carry shaft 14, and to carry
          an O-ring 50A and 50B that contacts in sliding relationship a
          mechanical seal 52A and 52B attached to shaft 14. The seals
          52A and 52B acting in combination with the O-rings 50A and 50B
          prevent or minimize leakage of fluid adjacent to shaft 14 from
          the device 10. Mechanical seals 52A and 52B are preferably
          spring-loaded seals, the springs biasing a gland 54A and 54B
          against O-ring 50A and 50B formed preferably of tungsten
          carbide. Obviously, other seals and o-rings may be used as
          desired. One or more bearings 48A and 48B may be used with
          each bearing plate 46A and 46B to carry shaft 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bearing plates 46A and 46B
          may be fastened to housing bells 30A and 30B using bolts 58 or
          as otherwise desired. Preferably disk-shaped retainer plates
          through which shaft 14 extends may be abutted against end
          plates 46A and 46B to retain bearings 48A and 48B in place.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment shown in
          FIGS. 1 and 2, a fluid inlet port 63 is drilled or otherwise
          formed in each bearing plate 46A and 46B or housing 16, and
          allows fluid to enter device 10 first by entering a chamber or
          void 64 hollowed within the bearing plate 46A or B, or
          directly into the space 43 located between rotor 12 and
          housing 16. Fluid which enters through a bearing plate 46 then
          flows from the chamber 64 through the axial bore 40A and 40B
          in housing bell 30A and 30B as rotor 12 rotates within housing
          16. The fluid is drawn into the space 43 between rotor 12 and
          housing 16, where rotation of rotor 12 with respect to
          interior surface 32A and 32B of housing bells 30A and 30B
          imparts heat to the fluid.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One or more exhaust ports or
          bores 66 are formed within one or more of housing bells 30A
          and 30B for exhaust of fluid and higher pressure and/or
          temperature. Exhaust ports 66 may be oriented radially or as
          otherwise desired, and their diameter may be optimized to
          accommodate various fluids, and particular fluids at various
          input parameters, flow rates and rotor 12 rotational speeds.
          Similarly inlet ports 63 may penetrate bearing plates 46A and
          46B or housing 16 in an axial direction, or otherwise be
          oriented and sized as desired to accommodate various fluids
          and particular fluids at various input parameters, flow rates
          and rotor 12 rotational speeds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device shown in FIGS. 1
          and 2, which uses a smaller rotor 12, operates at a higher
          rotational velocity (on the order of 5000 rpm) than devices 10
          with larger rotors 12. Such higher rotational speed involves
          use of drive pulleys or gears, and thus increased mechanical
          complexity and lower reliability. Available motors typically
          operate efficiently in a range of approximately 3450 rpm,
          which the inventor has found is a comfortable rotational
          velocity for rotors in the 7.3 to 10 inch diameter range.
          Devices as shown in FIGS. 1-3 may be comfortably driven using
          5 to 7.5 horsepower electric motors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device shown in FIGS. 1
          and 2 has been operated with 1/2 inch pipe at 5000 rpm using
          city water pressure at approximately 75 pounds. Exit
          temperature at that pressure, with a comfortable flow rate, is
          approximately 300 F. The device shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 was
          controlled using a valve at the inlet port 63 and a valve at
          the exhaust port 66 and by adjusting flow rate of water into
          the device 10. Preferably, the inlet port 63 valve is set as
          desired, and the exhaust water temperature is increased by
          constricting the exhaust port 66 orifice and vice versa.
          Exhaust pressure is preferably maintained below inlet
          pressure; otherwise, flow degrades and the rotor 12 simply
          spins at increased speeds a flow of water in void 43
          apparently becomes nearer to laminar.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 3 shows another
          embodiment of a device 10 according to the present invention.
          This device features a rotor 12 having larger diameter and
          smaller length, and being included in a housing 16 which
          features only one housing bell 30. The interior surface 32 of
          housing bell 30 extends the length of rotor 12. A housing
          plate 68 preferably disk shaped and of diameter similar to the
          diameter of the housing bell 30 is connected to housing bell
          30 in a sealing relationship to form the remaining wall of
          housing 16. Housing plate 68, as does housing bell 30,
          features an axial bore 40 sufficient in diameter to
          accommodate shaft 14, seals 52A and 52B and flow of fluid
          between voids 64 formed in bearing plates 46A and 46B. This
          embodiment accommodates reduced fluid flow and is preferred
          for applications such as residential heating. The inlet port
          63 of this device is preferably through housing 16, as is the
          exhaust port 66, but may be through bearing plates 46 as well.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device 10 shown in FIG.
          3 is preferably operated with 3/4 inch copper or galvanized
          pipe at approximately 3450 rpm, but may be operated at any
          other desired speed. At an inlet pressure of approximately 65
          pounds and exhaust pressure of approximately 50 pounds, the
          outlet temperature is in the range of approximately 300 F.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 4 shows a residential
          heating system 70 according to the present invention. The
          inlet side of device 10 is connected to hot water line 71 of
          (deactivated) hot water heater 72. Exhaust of device 10 is
          connected to exhaust line 73 which in turn is connected to the
          furnace or HVAC heat exchanger 74 and a return line 76 to cold
          water supply line 77 of hot water heater 72. The device 10
          according to one embodiment of such a system features a rotor
          12 having a diameter of 8 inches. A heat exchanger inlet
          solenoid valve 80 controls flow of water from device 10 to
          heat exchanger 74, while a heat exchanger exhaust solenoid
          valve 82 controls flow of water from heat exchanger 74 to
          return line 76. A third solenoid valve, a heat exchanger
          by-pass solenoid valve 84, when open, allows water to flow
          directly from device 10 to return line 76, bypassing heat
          exchanger 74. Heat exchanger valves 80 and 82 may be connected
          to the normally closed side of a ten amp or other appropriate
          relay 78, and the by-pass valve 84 is connected to the
          normally open side of the relay. The relay is then connected
          to the air conditioning side of the home heating thermostat,
          so that the by-pass valve 84 is open and the heat exchanger
          valves 80 and 82 are closed when the home owner enables the
          air conditioning and turns off the heat. A contactor 86 is
          connected to the thermostat in the hot water heater and the
          home heating thermostat so that actuation of either thermostat
          enables contactor 8 to actuate the motor driving device 10.
          (In gas water heaters, the temperature switch may be included
          in the line to replace the normal thermalcouple.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The hot water heater 72 is
          turned off and used as a reservoir in this system to contain
          water heated by device 10. The device 10 is operated to heat
          the water to approximately 180.degree.-190.degree. F., so that
          water returning to hot water heater 72 reservoir directly via
          return line 76 is at approximately that temperature, while
          water returning via heat exchanger 74, which experiences
          approximately 40.degree. temperature loss, returns to the
          reservoir at approximately 150.degree. F. Cutoff valves 88
          allow the device 10 and heat exchanger 74 to be isolated when
          desired for maintenance and repair.</font> </p>
