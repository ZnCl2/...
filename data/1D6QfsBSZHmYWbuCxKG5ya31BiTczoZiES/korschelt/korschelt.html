      <div align="center"><b>The Ether Radiating Apparatuses of Oskar
          Korschelt (1853-1940)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In April 1890 Korschelt constructed healing ray device from a
      special kind of&nbsp;pipe. He believed that the Sun emits small
      ether particles and by appropriate antennas it should be possible
      to use these particles for healing purposes.<br>
      <br>
      His first device was comprised of two circular copper plates (13
      cm in diameter) with regular grid of square holes (10 mm in
      diameter). The copper plates were positioned inside cylindrical
      wooden ring (12 cm in length) to the opposite ends. The wooden
      ring was positioned in a tin can, which was open on the one end
      and soldered to a truncated cone followed by 1.5 meters long tube.
      <br>
      <br>
      The copper plate on the tin cans back end was connected through
      the lid to positive terminal of the battery and the copper plate
      on the beaming end was connected to negative terminal. The copper
      plate connected to the positive plate was moveable inside the
      wooden cylinder. (15)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 5. Etheric healing ray apparatus</b><b><br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="etherbeam1.jpg" height="172"
          width="728"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      Korschelt discovered that the effects were considerably reinforced
      when both of the copper plates were connected to battery
      terminals. If only one copper plate was connected, the effect was
      sensed only weakly. The treatments lasted from few minutes up to
      30 minutes. The distance of the plates was adjusted to less than 6
      cm for non sensitive people. Calm persons felt better with longer
      distances. There was an individually harmonious distance for each
      person. The ether radiation influenced not only people; after 15
      minutes it fulfilled the entire room. (15)<br>
      <br>
      The power supply played a role on the effects, although the
      apparatus worked also without electricity, albeit not so strongly.
      The ether radiation worked harmoniously with coal, silver and gold
      electrodes, but rejected current out of dynamo. If the current was
      lead trough glass of fresh water, the results improved. Suitable
      metals for the apparatus proved to be gold, silver, copper,
      nickel, iron, zinc, tin, and its alloys. Lead was recognized as
      unsuitable. <br>
      <br>
      The radiation was influenced by the weather; only in the fair
      weather success were obtained. (15)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 6. Ether ray disc</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <div align="center"><b><img alt="" src="etherdiskkorschelt.jpg"
            height="643" width="782"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The ray apparatus described above was large and impractical in the
      handling. <br>
      <br>
      Consequently Korschelt developed a smaller ray disc (German patent
      69340, July 14, 1891). The ray disc was handy, but not
      particularly strong. It was a wooden disc with a hole in its
      centre. On both sides spirals of copper chain were fastened, on
      the front clockwise spiral facing the Sun and on the back
      counterclockwise spiral facing the patient. The clockwise spiral
      collects the ether particles and the counterclockwise spiral
      radiates them like a beam. The spirals were connected to each
      other through the hole. To increase the power of the device, a
      heavy gauge antenna wire was lengthened by twisting two copper
      wires helically (like caduceus), separating and cutting every
      fourth twist, shaping them like rings and soldering them together
      like a chain. (15, 16)<br>
      <br>
      The effects from these ray apparatus were perceived by healthy
      people as cold and others as warmth, some sweat a lot, although
      the body temperature remains normal. As a rule, the effects were
      calming. The heart activity becomes stronger and slower. The sleep
      becomes deeper and therefore less sleep is required. The memory
      becomes better. The apparatuses were especially suitable for
      healing stomach problems, nerve diseases, insomnia and pains.

      <br>
      <b>Magnetic fields and energies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The coil winding direction may have an effect in the finer ethers.
      From previous studies, it is suggested that right-handed helix may
      be a better collector and left-handed helix may be a better
      emitter of life-enhancing etheric energies (See Spurling and
      Korschelt). Here are the helices and their magnetic poles when
      electric current is passed through. <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="helices.jpg" height="390"
          width="300"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      According to Howard Johnson [1970] (2006) the magnetic fields are
      more complex than usually thought. The usual way of making the
      magnetic field lines visible with iron fillings do not show the
      fields as they are; they only show what little pieces of iron do
      in magnetic fields. The below picture, based on Hall effect
      gaussmeter readings, shows the direction of the lines of force,
      which are tracks of a particles. Since there are two lines of
      force, there must be two different particles. In a permanent
      magnet, there are two vortices present at each pole. There is an
      element both the "north" (ccw) and the "south" (cw) in each pole.
      The north element has proven to be the stronger vortex with higher
      gauss ratings. The factor that distinguishes the north pole from
      the south pole is that the north pole is the one with the weakest
      south vortex. (26)<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="magnet2.jpg" height="360"
          width="540"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The lines of force going in the same direction repel and therefore
      as the lines leave the poles, they repel each other. And also,
      there is a fine line between the vortices in the center of the
      magnet with no lines of force. <br>
      <br>
      Another interesting thing is that vortex spins in opposite corners
      attract each other and can form continuous spins from corner to
      corner. Below is a computer picture which recorded the discovery
      of the double vortex at each pole. Different arrangements of
      magnets can be used to manipulate the form of the double vortex.

      <div align="center"><big><b>The orgone pioneer Oskar Korschelt</b></big><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      In April 1890 in Leipzig something strange happened: A man of
      almost 40 years taught a special kind tube of 1.7 m length on the
      mind of a 18 year old girl. That was health damaged by long work
      in weaving. After almost a minute the girl noticed a pressure on
      the back of the head, which then went into a flow from the head to
      the fingertips and toes. The warmth she felt first at the back,
      then the whole body. After 3 minutes, she burst into warm sweat.
      She was sleepy and was attracted to the pipe. The experiment had
      to be canceled after 5 minutes, as they threatened to fall into
      "magnetic sleep" (Hypnosis). This was the first treatment with a
      healing beam device, also odic device Orgonstrahler, KE spotlight
      etc. called.<br>
      <br>
      The Lord was Oskar Korschelt, by profession a chemist, born in
      1853 in Berthelsdorf / Saxony, d. 1940, 1876-1884 Professor in
      Tokyo, later in Leipzig. He had since 1888 intensively with the
      "healing magnetism", today spiritual healing, is concerned. After
      studying literature, he immediately began to conduct their own
      experiments, that is, he began to treat the sick mind heal Risch.
      That was not a problem as there was in Germany at that time the
      courier freedom. Hypnosis gimmicks with healthy he refused
      decidedly. The activity of a spirit healer has in all personal
      satisfaction with achieved improvements two serious disadvantages:
      Each treatment takes strength. The spiritual healer is tired. This
      usually only takes half an hour, but can be increased in some
      cases to the point of exhaustion that lasts several days. We all
      know this phenomenon by visiting the sick. After that we often
      have the impression of being very exhausted. The second
      disadvantage is the risk of disease transmission. And not by the
      transmission of bacteria or viruses, but through the biophotonics
      information transmission. Many spiritual healers who despite
      overzealous washing thereby contracted with cold water some
      disease *.<br>
      <br>
      Korschelt, a clever and willing to experiment head, now mused
      because of these disadvantages on Remedy. He had studied the works
      of Karl von Reichenbach and combined this knowledge with the
      physical knowledge of his time. Hertz just made a splash with the
      discovery of radio waves (FM meter waves). So Korschelt had the
      idea to construct an ether jet apparatus. He was of the opinion
      that the sun emits tiny particles that enter the "ether",
      according to former view, the carrier medium of the light rays to
      the earth. By appropriate antennas it would be possible to capture
      these particles and to utilize.<br>
      <br>
      Helical copper wires seemed to him particularly suitable. The
      electricity would play a special role. In April 1890, was now
      ready. Korschelt began to build on an aether ray apparatus. If we
      follow his description: "I took two circular copper discs of 1.5
      mm thickness and 13 cm in diameter and punched in regular rows
      square holes of 10 mm in the same strip between the holes were 2.5
      mm wide Then I left.. beechwood a cylindrical ring unscrew of 13.5
      cm inner and 16 cm in outer diameter and 12 cm length. At one end
      of an inwardly projecting edge was palmed. On the inside of the
      rim, I nailed to a disc and soldered to the same a braided wire.
      At the center of the other disk I soldered a round copper bar of
      0.5 cm in diameter perpendicular to the same. The wooden ring I
      brought in a box of tinned tinplate, which on one side had an
      approach in the form of a truncated cone to which another tube of
      1.5 m length was soldered. On the other hand the bank with a
      comprehensive cover was closed, the in the middle had a piece of
      tin plate. The perforated plate with the rod I brought in the wood
      ring a, as shown in the figure, a cork stopper isolated the rod in
      the neck. The lead wire of the other disc led by a cork stopper in
      a nozzle in the funnel-shaped parts. The inner pane was with the
      zinc poles - connected, the outer pane with the carbon pole (+) of
      a chromic acid element (). The outer, ie positive plate was
      displaced in the wood rings "Unless Korschelt in his book:". The
      harnessing of kinetic energy of the ether in the healing arts,
      agriculture and technology ", 2nd edition to 1921st<br>
      <br>
      <b>The healing beam device</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Korschelt now examined the influence of the electric power to the
      transmission of the tube. Was just a chromic acid element applied,
      the broadcast was only faintly noticeable. 2 elements reinforced
      the effect considerably. In the following months Korschelt treated
      all people, sick and healthy only attainable. In all cases, the
      apparatus was like a light spirit heal innovative treatment.
      Edwards would describe this as a spirit heal innovative treatment
      of the first type.<br>
      <br>
      Initial successes could continue Korschelt. Sick felt invigorated,
      healthy fresh. The treatments lasted only a few minutes: The
      fastest we went in children. This needed to sleepiness only 3 to 5
      minutes. Women required 10 to 15 minutes. Only strong men took up
      to 30 minutes to feel an effect. The treatments over an hour
      beyond were never made. The distance between the discs was set to
      feeling disc distances less than 6 cm proved less suitable for
      sensitive users. Quiet people felt more comfortable at longer
      intervals. In general it must be said that there is an individual
      distance for each person by these best harmonises. The radiation
      had not only to the people but filled after about 15 minutes the
      entire room. Could even walls and walls, although weakened,
      penetrate.<br>
      <br>
      Systematically examined Korschelt different influence factors such
      as voltage and material. Here he experienced a tremendous
      surprise. The jet apparatus also worked without applying a
      voltage. The effect was somewhat reduced, but still present. In
      general, the power supply played a role. The radiation hung
      obviously also depends on the type of power source. At that time,
      electrochemical elements of various types were used. Especially
      like he took elements Kohlepol, but also those with gold and
      silver electrodes. Electricity from Dynamos he refused.
      Tentatively, he led the power to "cleaning" by a glass of fresh
      water, which improved the results. He later renounced with a few
      exceptions entirely on electricity.<br>
      <br>
      A special object of his research was aging of wine and alcoholic
      beverages. Grossly simplified, you can summarize the results as
      follows: young wine taste was improved by irradiation of between 3
      hours and 7 days, just bad liquor. Contrast Old wine was worse.
      The influence of the weather should not be underestimated. Only in
      clear weather respective successes have been achieved. From
      Orgonforschung we now know that the Orgongehalt the air is highly
      dependent on the weather. When the sky is clear, we have
      significantly higher values than in cloudy weather or fog.
      Korschelt discovered even then these relationships.<br>
      <br>
      The different materials were tested. Particularly suitable proved
      to the metals gold, silver, copper, nickel, iron, zinc and tin and
      their alloys. Lead has been identified as unsuitable. Aluminium
      was not yet in use, so that Korschelt could not do as Reich
      negative experiences with it.<br>
      <br>
      The jet apparatus described above was quite a monster that was not
      practical to use. Korschelt looking for more manageable devices
      and developed over time a jet disk, a tripod apparatus, a jet
      traffic light for spaces, a plant coaster and finally a jet rod
      for fields and plantations. The jet disc was spirally wound on
      both sides a wooden disk of around 16 cm in diameter with a chain
      of three times the copper wire spirals. The spirals on both sides
      were consistent, then, was on one side of a left hand helix, on
      the other a right-handed helix. In making this spray discs showed
      that both sides have a different effect. The right-handed helix
      sucks that links spiral radiate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The radiation plate washer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The jet disc was very handy, but was not particularly strong. A
      serrated disc made of zinc metal and sheet iron have been added,
      spirally connected to the beam side of a jet washer, the whole
      mounted in a suitable housing, bolted to a height adjustable
      stand, completed was the stand apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The tripod apparatus and the beam slices Korschelt had patented
      (Patent 69340, 07.14.1891) and produced by a company in Dresden.
      These devices found in the German-speaking countries a certain
      paragraph in individuals and naturopathic institutions, however,
      could not generally prevail despite the proven track record. Until
      the '30s strove a number of people to make improvements. Were
      known by such senior engineer Meyer and Prof. Dr. Eckhoff, Paul
      Loose, Pastor Jacob and HU Ottinger. After the war, tried the
      Viennese binder and Halik, otherwise, interest in Korschelt
      appliances completely off. Again and again surprised that observed
      in total darkness weak intrinsic lights, indicating currently
      expected to Orgon.<br>
      <br>
      Korschelt presented all sorts investigations with his apparatus.
      He discovered that the effect of the jet apparatus is completely
      independent of the operator. The operator also did not tire as in
      spiritual healing. For successful treatment it did not matter,
      from the person to be treated with trust came to the jet
      apparatus, or this was suspicious.<br>
      <br>
      The influence on chemical reactions interested him as a chemist
      particularly. The jet apparatus of 1890 he found no acceleration
      of chemical reactions and crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      To know the effect of his jet projecting machines closer,
      Korschelt treated a variety of healthy and sick people.<br>
      <br>
      In both healthy and sick, he made the following observations: In
      general, one must say that the effects are not always clear, but
      sometimes contrary. Also overloads be observed as with orgone
      accumulators. It is also evident that there are people who can not
      tolerate this kind of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The effect of the ejectors on the Health</b><b>y<br>
      </b><br>
      Sense: Many feel cold, others get violent sweat. Malodorous
      secretions are secreted through the skin is not uncommon. The
      excretion of faeces and urine is increased.<br>
      <br>
      Heart / pulse: In most cases, the heart activity and strong pulse
      slower (up to 10-11 beats / min). At low pulsation only occurs a
      little humiliation. Seldom it comes to pulse increases. The
      radiation treatments are soothing generally. Very rare (&lt;1%)
      observed increased nervousness. The body temperature remains
      constant.<br>
      <br>
      Sleep: The need for sleep is reduced, up to 2 hours less sleep is
      required. Falling asleep is easier. Some Healthy need initially
      for some time (weeks) longer sleep. Later, these get along with
      less. The sleep depth is greater and shortened sleep duration.<br>
      <br>
      Miscellaneous: Particularly surprising is the greatly reduced food
      intake of sensitive people. These come from the half to one third
      of the usual amount. And that with a greater ability to work.
      However, other people need more food than usual. One means of
      losing weight is not the radiation. The memory is better. And it
      occurs to many through ongoing radiation a gradual change of
      character towards gentleness and tranquility on. Relapses,
      however, are not excluded. How to help the radiation also against
      "shrewish wives".<br>
      <br>
      <b>The effect of the ejectors on the sick</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Korschelt treated with very few exceptions (colds, flu)
      chronically ill. Thus statements are impossible to acute
      illnesses. The use of a weak radiator (flower wheel) can prove
      successful if the stronger radiator (ray disc, tripod device) is
      not tolerated.<br>
      <br>
      Congestion in the head: irradiating the back of the head not
      applicable. Therefore irradiate solar plexus.<br>
      <br>
      Gout: There are very few positive experiences. Irradiation is
      slowly increasing, because otherwise too many "deposits" can not
      be excreted.<br>
      <br>
      Stomach problems: diseases of the stomach, including degraded
      digestion, heal particularly easy.<br>
      <br>
      Migraine: attacks are docked.<br>
      <br>
      Nervous disorders: Very good results. Only it remains unclear in
      which nerve disorders these successes can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Kidney: to be irradiated directly.<br>
      <br>
      Back pain: Significant improvements to the stand apparatus. This
      neck start, every 5 min to reduce the apparatus by 15 cm.<br>
      <br>
      Insomnia: Good success with the jet disc. Women need about 1/2
      hour irradiation, men 1 hour per day. The insomnia is usually
      reduced, even eliminated in some cases. The jet disc is hang with
      the beam side at the head end of the bed. If you, however,
      situated at the foot of the bed, so it comes to the disturbance of

      Pain: For acute pain usually the pain is alleviated, even
      completely eliminated in some cases. Headache, toothache is gone
      mostly after treatment. Also typical healing crises are observed:
      old pains come first again, and then in the course of treatment
      finally disappearing.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>BACKGROUND:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1893 the German scientist Oskar Korschelt was granted a patent
      for using cavity structures (CS) for therapeutic purposes. In the
      end of the 20th century in Russia Victor Grebennikov also studied
      possibilities of using CS in curing various diseases. Korschelt
      used artificial CSs made of copper chains or plates. Grebennikov
      used mainly natural CS, e.g., empty bee combs. The main features
      of the CS effect are: the therapeutic efficacy of a CS depends on
      its orientation with respect to the biological object and on the
      material the CS is made of. It does not depend on the presence of
      acoustic or electromagnetic screens. The CS influence on the
      target biological object may not cease after removal of the CS,
      i.e. there is an after-effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is shown in the paper that it is possible to explain the
      effects of CSs on biological objects under the assumption that the
      physical vacuum has the properties of superfluid (3)He-B.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><br>
      <br>
      The effects may be due to spin supercurrents being present in CSs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>
      <br>
      CSs differ from bodies of other form in that the cavity is
      'filled' with spin supercurrents. The properties of the
      supercurrents are like those of the spin supercurrents between
      spin structures in superfluid (3)He-B.<br>

      Oscar Korschelt of Leipzig. <br>
      July 14, 1891 <br>
      <br>
      Translated from the German by Bodo Capeller, 1986<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus utilizes the living forces of the ethers for
      healing purposes. The electro dynamic theory of Wilhelm Weber
      concerning the structure of smallest parts results in the insight
      that all ether is identical with Weber's electric particles, that
      all solids rotate around it at a certain distance because of
      attraction of positive to negative ether particles in relation to
      solids. Through a corresponding arrangement of solids it ought to
      be possible to condense the diffuse ether and redirect it. A
      similar arrangement has been utilized in the following described
      apparatus which has been named by the inventor "Ether Radiating
      Apparatus".<br>
      <br>
      This invention, like the introduction of mobile phones in recent
      times, was received with caution as well as fascination. This
      apparatus can be used for the purpose of increasing the intensity
      of the power of living ether. The difference between several
      versions of this apparatus is that of shape of materials used. In
      order to get increased power electric current may be used. Since
      the same appears to consist of positive and negative particles
      that try to find equilibrium, the amount of liberated ether
      particles within the wiring of the apparatus and the diameter of
      the wire formed ether vortex will increase with the spun off ether
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      In drawings 1 through 5 an ether radiating device is shown. Within
      the apparatus the arrangement of the metal wiring is formed in a
      spiral that will cause ether particles to spin in a predetermined
      direction so that the living force can be utilized in many ways.<br>
      <br>

          height="643" width="782"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The version in drawing #3 shows the wire is formed in spiral
      configuration on both sides of plate E and is connected in the
      center. Through this arrangement the ether particles will
      accumulate in the center of the disk and be thrown forward. In
      order to achieve a longer path for the ether vortex one may
      utilize a chain instead of a simple wire which consists of
      horizontal displaced links (drawing #5). <br>
      <br>
      The disk is intended to cause physiological changes in humans (see
      drawing #1).<br>
      <br>
      Patent request: An apparatus for therapeutic purposes with direct
      or indirect suggestion consisting of a non conductive disk (E),
      free standing or installed in a tube, where both sides of the disk
      contain spiral wound wire with the side toward the light exposed
      as the collector and the opposite the radiating portion.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>SUN-ETHER DISC</b><br>
        <b>By Albert Zock</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The German inventor Oscar Korschelt based his cosmic ether
      accumulator, German Patent #69340, dated July 14, 1891, on the
      teaching of Wilhelm Weber not realizing that it incorporated the
      implosion principle as well. Weber professed that all particles of
      the ether, having an electrical charge, are circling around solid
      objects without touching them, the molecular particles being
      negative and the ether particles being positive, according to the
      law of attraction and repulsion. Since a solid body attracts ether
      particles, Korschelt searched for a way to collect, condense and
      to rectify them.<br>
      <br>
      On a wooden disc with a hole in its center, Korschelt fastened
      spirals of copper wire, on both sides, one wound clockwise and the
      other, as a mirror image, counter clockwise, and connected the
      ends together through the hole in the center. His assumption was
      that the collected energy would be condensed in the center and
      then be beamed off at a right angle to the disc. He termed the
      side facing the light positive and the other negative. To increase
      the condensation and lengthen the antenna, Korschelt wound small
      coils like key rings and assembled them like links in a chain. He
      was convinced this device would give additional life energy if the
      beam was directed at the neck of a person in the height where the
      18 cranial nerves are leaving the skull, (medulla oblongata). Such
      a spiral resembles a Nornen coil, which is stretched out and is
      used to eliminate undesirable emanations.<br>
      <br>
      An application of a Korschelt coil seems to have its merits. In
      one case a relative of an elderly man suffering an acute
      pneumonia, being already unconscious and according to his
      physician, beyond hope, hung a Sun-Ether Disc over his bed. From
      this moment, his condition improved rapidly. Fourteen days later,
      he was almost normal again. In another case, a Sun-Ether Disc
      hangs over the door in the waiting room of a Naturopath. Every one
      walking in is amazed over its warmth, and the flowers are
      flourishing like in a green house, even though it is not heated
      and faces north. When asked for the reason, the owner points
      smilingly to the disc and gladly explains how it works and how to
      build one.<br>
      <br>
      On a plywood disc with a diameter of 50 cm (20-3/4 in.) are two
      coils, one on each side, wound in a mirror image, the front one
      counter-clockwise and the other clockwise, almost on top of each
      other. Both are connected through the hole in the center which has
      a diameter of 10 mm (6/8 in.). The space between each winding is
      15 mm (5/8 in.). Aluminum wire is best. To make the key rings,
      take a 4 mm (3/16 in.) thick wire, fasten it into an electric
      drill and wind the armature wire around it tightly, by allowing
      the rotating wire in the drill to do the spinning. Make sure to
      wind the links for the front counter-clockwise and for the back
      clockwise. Then separate every fourth winding and cut it to get
      the links shaped like key rings. Now attach the rings onto one
      another like a chain. Each link will lengthen the antenna and work
      like an oscillator. Fasten the chain onto the board, using nails
      or screws, but to be accurate, give the chain a light tension so
      it will not slip off. Twist the ends in the hole together, or
      better, solder them. The counter-clockwise winding for the front
      applies to people living in the northern hemisphere; in the
      southern hemisphere it might need to be reversed.<br>
      <br>
      In Korschelt's time, some made "beam-handbags" carried on a
      shoulder strap. The material had to be framed to it could not
      move, then the spiral was embroidered and fasted to the inside of
      the bag, the whole bag measuring about 20 x 20 cm (8 x 8 in.) and
      the windings being 1 cm (3/8 in.) apart. Such bags were more
      powerful than the disc. <br>
