      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pavel N. Yablotchkov</b> was born in 1847
        near Saratov, Russia. He graduated as a Military Engineer in
        1866 and spent several years in the Russian Army. In 1872 he
        came to Moscow and started his activities in the
        electrotechnical field. From 1875 he worked in Paris with
        well-known Louis Breget and his first patent in France # 110479
        (29 November 1875) was about an electromagnetic transformer.
        Then he patented and developed a lighting system (the famous
        Yablotchkov’s electrical candle). In 1887 he patented a new
        electromagnetic transformer for industrial applications, France
        # 115793 (30 November 1876). </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most interesting patent claim for
        over-unity by Pavel Yablotchkov is known as France patent #
        120684 (11 October 1877), The System of Distribution and
        Amplification of Electrical Currents by Means of Atmospheric
        Electricity. The patent describes special capacitors connected
        in series with the load, to increase output current by means of
        ionization. Experiments were produced together with well-known
        physicists (such as Dr Maskar, Dr Varren-Delaru and others) and
        they confirmed 200% efficiency of the circuit. Let’s try to
        explain the method. Figure 1 is a schematic drawing from
        Yablotchkov’s patent. The Leyden jar is not a symmetrical
        capacitor, i.e., it is different in principle from a two-plate
        flat capacitor. The inner electrode of the jar should be
        connected to a high voltage source and in this case the changes
        of&nbsp; [ … missing text in original… ]. </p>

        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" width="419" height="277"></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the opposite case it does not work and if
        you connect a high voltage source to the external cathode no
        potential changes will be detected on the inner electrode.
        Connection to ground or to a special plate (that is covered by
        many needles to increase air ionization) is necessary to collect
        the maximum electrons on the plate surface or to return the
        maximum electrons from the plate surface when changes of
        potential in the external electrode are produced by means of
        electrical induction in the Leyden jar. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a conclusion I should note that one more
        supposition about the secrets of the well-known Swiss M-L
        converter (Methernitha). The main elements of the design are
        Leyden jar capacitors, which have the external surface made of
        perforated metal. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other known fact is that great
        ionization of air is observed when the converter is in
        operation. So, the electrostatics machine can produce pulses of
        very high voltage (potential difference) but it can’t be used as
        a source of powerful current. We should use some method to
        increase the current in the circuit and Yablotchkov’s technology
        is quite a good idea for this. A large surface of external
        electrode of the Leyden jar can solve the problem. Maximum
        strong ionization allows us to get output current several times
        stronger than the weak current from the electrostatic machine.<br>

          <b>A New System of Distributing and Increasing with
            Atmospheric Electricity Currents proceeding from a Single
            Source of Electricity for the purpose of Supplying several
            Lighting Centres</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>December 1877</b><br>
          <br>
          My Invention has for its object the distribution of electric
          currents proceeding from a single source of electricity for
          the purpose of supplying at the same time a number of
          illuminating apparatus, and at the same time to strengthen
          such currents by means of atmospheric electricity.<br>
          <br>
          In order to obtain useful results from a current proceeding
          from a source of dynamic electricity instead of operating
          directly with the said currents as heretofore, I, according to
          my present Invention, cause the same to undergo a double
          transformation by firstly converting the dynamic electricity
          into statical&nbsp; electricity, and then reconverting this
          into dynamic electricity, and it is by means of the latter
          current that I obtain useful results. For the above purpose,
          instead of closing the circuit of a source of electricity by
          means of a continuous conductor as heretofore, I unite the
          conductor coming from one of the poles of the electrical
          source with one of the armatures of a condenser, composed of
          one or more Leyden jars of large surface, or constructed as
          will be presently described.<br>
          <br>
          The other conductor is connected in various ways, of which the
          principal ones are shown in the accompanying Drawings.<br>
          <br>
          At Figure 1, the one conductor a, proceeding from a
          magneto-electric machine A ( giving alternating currents ) is
          connected with the interior surfaces of several Leyden jars B,
          B, or of the condenser C, which is of a particular
          construction. The outer armatures of these condensers are
          connected to one of the charcoal points D of my electric
          candle, or with one of the ends of the slab of kaolin E (
          operating as described in the Specification of my former
          Patent, No. 1996 of 1877 ). The other charcoal point, or the
          other end of the kaolin slab is connected to the second
          conductor a1 of the electric machine.<br>
          <br>
          At Figure 2, the two conductors, a, a1, proceeding from a
          magneto-electric machine, with alternating currents, are
          connected to the inner surfaces of the condensers B,B,C,C. The
          outer armatures of these conductors are connected with the
          apparatus for producing light, of which the second charcoal
          point D. or the other end of the kaolin slab E, is connected
          with earth.<br>
          <br>
          At Figure 3 the two conductors proceeding from the said
          machine are connected with the interior armatures of the
          condensers. The outer armatures at the left hand of the
          machine A are connected with earth, while at the right hand
          they are connected to pointed prongs p, p, which allow more
          readily the escape of the electricity into the air. In this
          case the illuminating apparatus is placed between the inner
          and outer armatures.<br>
          <br>
          The interposition of the condensers not only allows the
          current to be distributed in several directions as I have
          described it, it also has the object of developing atmospheric
          electricity and of accumulating it in the condensers from
          which it is directed in the form of currents to the
          illuminating apparatus. The total quantity of electricity
          supplied to the apparatus is therefore greater than that
          supplied by the primitive current, and subsequently produces a
          stronger light that that which the latter would give if led
          directly to the illuminating apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          It will be evident that this electricity can, according as may
          be required, be supplied either in quantity or in tension.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of Leyden jars it is more convenient to use as
          condensers those of the construction shown at Figures 4 and 5.
          That shown at Figure 4 consists of plates or layers of metal
          f, f, separated by insulating slabs l,l, the metal plates,
          Nos. 1, 3, 5, &amp;c., and&nbsp; Nos. 2, 4, 6, &amp;c., being
          respectively connected with each other. Each set of plates
          acts as one of the armatures of the Leyden jars.<br>
          <br>
          For obtaining greater tension the insulating layers are
          constructed of a number of alternate insulating and conducting
          leaves or plates which are not in contact with one another, as
          shown at Figure 5.<br>
          <br>
          The form of the condensers may be varied, and several may be
          connected in quantity or in tension...<br>
