      The Gadgetman Groove is new technology proven to reduce emissions
      and increase power using the simple science of aerodynamics. By
      increasing the turbulence within the intake manifold, we are
      improving the combustion of your gasoline. The natural result is
      more power being delivered to the top of your piston resulting in
      reduced emissions, more horsepower, better torque and (in many
      cases) improved mileage as well. <br>

      Ron Hatton ("Gadgetman") says he has come up with a simple way to
      significantly improve the combustion in normally-aspirated
      gasoline engines. All he does is use a Dremel tool to cut a groove
      of specific dimensions, around 1/8 inch deep, in the throttle
      body. The modification takes about an hour and is reversible
      through epoxy. It shouldn't affect the vehicle's warranty.<br>
      <br>
      Somehow, the air turbulence that is set up by that groove has the
      effect of increasing horsepower, torque, and mileage, while
      decreasing emissions. Perhaps it is another manifestation of the
      famous Schauberger effect.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">Gadgetman

      <br>
      The mileage increase is typically between 25 and 35 percent,
      though some reports are much higher than that; and a few show
      little, if any change. So far, it seems that older cars achieve
      better improvement than newer cars, because the computerized
      controls of the newer cars usually tend to work against the
      effect. Ron said that approximately 85% of the vehicles that have
      been modified with this groove have had mileage gains in excess of
      20%. So far, the best results apparently have been found on 1996 -
      2004 Fords.<br>
      <br>
      Ron says he has filed for patents on the design as well as on the
      bits; and that he is training dealers/installers from all over the
      globe to make this modification. He himself has modified around
      200 engines.<br>
      <br>
      On Dec. 2, 2009, I had one of Ron's dealers in Salt Lake City,
      Dave Richardson, do the modification on my Dodge Caravan, 2005;
      3.3L, V6. It took him about 55 minutes. I noticed a definite kick
      in acceleration when first starting out, though that could be a
      function of the more immediate air volume coming in due to the
      grooves.<br>
      <br>
      Dave showed me his before and after dynamometer test results from
      the modification he made on his own truck. It shows a 15
      horsepower increase and 8 foot-pounds of torque increase across
      the board.<br>
      <br>
      On Dec. 5, 2009, I finished the first full tank of gas since the
      installation, and calculated that my mileage for that 392-mile
      stretch, using 16.6 gallons, came to 23.6 mpg. During that time,
      most of our travel was highway, but some (approximately 15%) was
      city driving. According to FuelEconomy.gov, my vehicle typically
      gets 16 mpg city, and 23 mpg highway. (With my recent move, I've
      misplaced the baseline data I accumulated last summer.) So our
      improvement in comparison to the average rating, was roughly in
      the region of 10% -- nothing to brag about, but still significant
      and worth while.<br>
      <br>
      On Dec. 10, I finished my second full tank, travelling 359 mile
      (@119897 miles) on 16.883 gal, for 21.26 mpg, which is lower than
      the 23 mpg rating according to the govt. site; but mileage is
      typically lower in cold temperatures; and it's been very cold here
      during the relevant time (staying below freezing most of the
      time).<br>
      Dec. 23; @119266 miles; 369 miles on 16.592 gal = 22.2 mpg.<br>
      Dec. 25; @119620 miles; 354 miles on 14.153 gal = 25.0 mpg.
      (probably early shut-off error)<br>
      <br>
      One thing that concerns me about the modification is that I don't
      have much wiggle room when I first accelerating. Most people would
      be delighted with the punch you get when you press the pedal.
      However, I'm concerned that if I'm on slick roads and I need to
      accelerate gingerly, that I won't have nearly as much control of
      speed-up, making it easier to spin-out. So for me, that is not a
      year-round benefit.<br>
      <br>
      For me, I attribute that early punch in power to the fact that a
      little movement of the throttle early on is opening it to a large
      opening due to the groove, where before the opening of the
      throttle flow was much more gradual. So I don't attribute it to
      "more horsepower" but to "more airflow". I'd have to take the car
      to a dyno with before/after to document horsepower.<br>
      <br>
      One thing that is admirable about the Gadgetman site is that it
      publishes all mileage reports, including the mediocre ones, as
      well as a few that actually saw their mileage get worse.<br>
      <br>
      At this early phase, they are still anxious to increase their
      database; and they are still making decisions about how much to
      charge for the modification; so you are likely to be able to get a
      good deal on your install. Dave did mine for free. He personally
      wants to accumulate more data before going all out on this
      venture.<br>
      <br>
      The installations come with a satisfaction guarantee. <br>
      <br>
      FROM RON HATTON, GADGETMAN Feb 28, 2011<br>
      <br>
      After much prompting, I have recorded a video that explains the
      science employed to generate the continued reports of increased
      performance. The video appears here: <br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHV-ANmN0ns"><b>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHV-ANmN0ns</b></a><br>
      <br>
      I have now modified almost 700 engines, and have learned the
      removal of the PCV valve to be a critical part of the application
      of The Gadgetman Groove. What happens is the PCV valve represents
      as a direct vacuum leak, reducing the pressure wave the groove
      creates. The crankcase remains vented, although only with passive
      vacuum rather than full dynamic vacuum. This enhances the results
      in every case. <br>
      <br>
      The price point for this modification by professionals is $350.
      Ron encourages all "G-men" to charge $100 when they first start
      out, then $250 as the demand increases and their skill level
      improves, then $350. I thought that was too high, for a task that
      takes 1 hour, but Ron pointed out a few things.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. At that price, the typical driver is going to see
      a return on investment in between 6-12 months due to the usual
      mileage improvements seen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The install lasts the duration of the vehicle.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At first, he was charging $100, but the lower
      price gives a low value impression. His sales went up and
      referrals increased when he bumped his price to $250.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The pros say that each added horse added to the
      engine's HP is worth $100 each. The average HP gain is in the
      region of 15.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. $350 is so the shops that are signing on have a
      base. The shops Ron has approached have been excited about the
      price point, and have told him they believe it to be fair.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; 6. There are start-up licensing and tooling costs for
      installers to be recouped. <br>
      <br>
      Older, carbureted engines are usually more involved and will thus
      cost more to modify.<br>
      <br>
      ADDENDUM BY GADGETMAN<br>
      <br>
      The pricing is established based on the number and style of ports
      through which the air passes. The overwhelming majority are
      single, rounded port systems. For these, the modification price is
      $350, including single barrel carbs. For dual and oval ports MPFI
      systems, as well as 2 and 4 barrel carburetors, the cost is $500.<br>
      <br>
      Most carburetors accept the modification with great ease. Best
      results to date (Feb, 2011) have been found in the Edelbrocks and
      Holley's, with rejetting advised to maximize fuel efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Only certain older carbs are virtually impossible to modify. In
      particular, Quadrajets present the greatest difficulty. This is
      due to the way the throttle assembly was engineered, leaving too
      little room to install The Gadgetman Groove.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, vehicles NOT suited for this modification are: 1)
      2007 and later Excalades-Computer acceptance issues 2) 454 TBI
      (Throttle Body Injected) General Motors-idle air passage
      interference 3) Certain (as yet undefined) 2004 and later GM
      products-a whistle is generated, making some drivers
      uncomfortable. 4) All engines with "Constant Velocity" throttles.

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] This invention generally relates to throttle bodies of
      machines, mixing valves and engines and a method of modifying
      throttle bodies. More specifically this invention relates to
      incorporation of at least one groove located inside a fluid
      passageway of the throttle body that improves fluid turbulence in
      a machine such an internal combustion engine. For example, in an
      internal combustion engine the performance is enhanced such as
      increased gas mileage, lower fuel emissions, carbon foot print
      and/or increased horse power and torque.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Many machines, such as internal combustion engines, require
      precise fluid mixtures, such as air and gasoline, in order to
      properly run. In this instance, throttle bodies are designed to
      control fluid flow, such as airflow and/or air-fuel mixtures flow,
      to the cylinders of an engine. In order to control the fluid flow
      that reaches the cylinders, the throttle body includes at least
      one throttle plate attached to a central axis or; for example, a
      central axis shaft (also known as a throttle shaft) such that the
      throttle plate is located within a fluid passageway (sometimes
      known as a throttle bore or duct), or proximal to an end of the
      fluid passageway. With rotation of the central axis, the throttle
      plate is able to selectively obstruct flow through the fluid
      passageway. More specifically, the throttle plate is able to
      rotate with respect to the fluid passageway in order to adjust the
      cross-sectional area of the fluid passageway that is not
      obstructed by the plates (the "effective area"), thus controlling
      the amount of fluid, such as airflow, that is permitted to flow
      through the fluid passageway.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In order to control the effective area, the throttle plate
      is sized and shaped to approximate the cross-sectional area of the
      fluid passageway so as to substantially or completely obstruct the
      fluid passageway when the throttle plate is perpendicular to the
      airflow (the "closed position"). Typically, the throttle plate has
      a minimal thickness in order to substantially not obstruct the
      fluid passageway when the throttle plate is angled such that a
      throttle plate is not substantially perpendicular to the airflow
      (the "open position").<br>
      <br>
      [0004] When the engine is idling, the throttle plate is therefore
      in the closed position since only a little air is needed to mix
      with the small amount of fuel being injected into the engine. On
      the other hand, if the engine is operating at a speed higher than
      idle, then more air is needed to mix with the increased amount of
      fuel being provided to the engine. At speeds higher than idle, the
      throttle plate is therefore in an open position of a varying angle
      with respect to the airflow, the angle varying with the engine's
      air requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In order to completely or substantially obstruct the fluid
      passageway when the throttle plate is the closed position, it is
      desirable for the throttle plate to be precisely sized and
      accurately located within the fluid passageway.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Throttle body spacing blocks are well known in the prior
      art and are frequently found in the automotive part after-market.
      Examples include the AFE Silver Bullet Spacer, Airaid Power Aid
      Spacer , Helix Power Tower Spacer, and Jet Power-Flow Spacers as
      discussed in the provisional patent applications incorporated by
      reference herein. <br>
      <br>
      [0007] These after-market throttle body spacing blocks typically
      claim to improve automotive performance. Generally, the throttle
      body spacing blocks separate the existing throttle body, throttle
      body injection unit and/or carburetor from the intake manifold of
      an internal combustion engine found in automobiles. This
      separation creates increased space that it is posited by the
      manufactures of the throttle body spacing blocks to increase the
      air velocity prior to entering the combustion chamber of the
      engine. Under such a supposition, the increased air velocity would
      serve to improve the efficiency of the internal fuel combustion.
      Generally, throttle body spacing blocks are known to consist
      basically of obvious structural configurations.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In addition, modifications of the internal bore of throttle
      body spacers are known such as US Patent no. 6,338,335 issued to
      Patterson, et on January 15, 2002 and entitled "Throttle body
      spacing block with continuously grooved aperture(s) for internal
      combustion engines" which incorporated by reference in its
      entirety herein. US Patent no. 6,338,335 teaches the use of a
      throttle body spacing block having a single, continuous thread
      pitch groove starting at the inlet opening and stopping at the
      outlet opening.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] One disadvantage of the throttle body spacing blocks is
      that they require the insertion of an additional element into the
      air intake system.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another disadvantage of the throttle body spacing blocks is
      that they generally do not work with the throttle body plate. It
      is believed that previous efforts created incomplete, partial,
      destructive, or no waveforms as applied primarily in the form of
      throttle body spacing blocks. This invention is believed to
      overcome these disadvantages by creating a more complete waveform
      that, it is believed, passes through the intake.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention overcomes these disadvantages by
      modification of the throttle body itself for any and all internal
      combustion engines and is not limited to automobiles. While not
      being limited to any theory, it is believed that the invention
      also overcome these disadvantages by creating a more complete
      waveform that, it is believed, passes through the intake. As there
      is need for an improved throttle body modification that can
      increase gas mileage, increase horsepower, increase torque, reduce
      carbon footprint and/or reduce emissions, it is believed that the
      present invention substantially fulfills these needs.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0034] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the aerodynamic
      design of throttle bodies are changed (or modified) to, what is
      believed, create higher vaporization of fuels, reduce emissions
      and reduce fuel consumption. While not being limited to its
      proposed theory, it is believed that the invention causes the
      throttle to be more responsive at lower speed operation. The
      preferred invention is believed to create a pressure wave at the
      throttle plate and additional turbulence such that it increases
      vaporization and blending of liquid in the system to which it is
      applied possibly like those proposed in figures 6 through 11. For
      example, it is believed that the invention causes liquids to
      vaporize (for example, fuels including but not limited to
      gasoline) enabling its use in the internal combustion engine such
      as normally aspirated gasoline engines to achieve better explosive
      properties and mileage (i.e. efficiency) and performance gains
      including torque at wider ranges than any previous modifications
      or inventions.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A standard configuration of a stock throttle body 10 (with
      the linkage omitted for visibility) is shown in Figure 1. The
      throttle body 10 includes a housing 20 having athrottle body wall
      30. The throttle body wall 30 has an outside surface 40 and inside
      surface 50 wherein the inside surface 50 defines the fluid
      passageway 60 and the fluid passage 60 has a longitudinal axis 62
      (see figure 11). Preferably the housing 20 is cylindrical, but
      maybe of any geometry that will work with fluid flow. The housing
      also includes an open end 70 and a discharge end 80 so that the
      fluid moves from the open end 70 to the discharge end 80. Further,
      the term fluid includes any liquid or vapor such as air and the
      term throttle body means any device used for metering fluids.
      Housings for throttle bodies are well known and are typically made
      of metal or other suitable materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Also as shown in Figures 1 and 2, the throttle body 10 also
      includes a throttle plate 90 located in the fluid passageway 60
      and having a front surface 100 facing the open end of the fluid
      passageway 60 and having a back surface 110 on the opposite side
      from the front surface 100. Throttle plates are well known and are
      typically made of thin metal or other suitable materials. As shown
      in this embodiment, the throttle plate 90 is coupled to the
      housing using a central axis 120. While the central axis may be
      coupled by any means to the housing such as pins, shaft or other
      mechanical or magnetic structure, preferably the central axis 120
      is a central axis shaft and attaches to the throttle plate 90 and
      is rotatably (or pivotally) connected to the housing 20. When the
      throttle plate 90 is in a closed position, it blocks the passage
      of fluid through the fluid passageway 60. Typically, when the
      throttle plate 90 is in closed position it forms a fit with a
      throttle seat 65. The throttle plate 90 also has an open position
      that varies between 0 degrees and 90 degrees with respect to
      rotation from the closed position. A throttle plate means any
      obstruction in the fluid passageway.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one
      groove 200 or 210 is created into the throttle body wall 30 as
      seen in figures 4 though 8 and 12 wherein created means cut,
      molded, machined, formed, or anything that makes a groove in
      throttle body wall 30. In one preferred embodiment shown in figure
      4, the at least one groove 200 has inferior groove placement (at
      the bottom of the housing 20). In another preferred embodiment
      shown in figure 5, the at least one groove 210 has inferior groove
      placement (at the top of the housing 20). While the invention can
      be practiced with one groove, combinations of grooves are also
      within the scope of the invention. Further, the at least one
      groove preferably includes at least one quarter of the
      circumference of the inside surface (i.e. the cylindrical
      passageway formed by the inside surface 50), but it is possible
      that such a groove need not be continuous and may be combined with
      other grooves. More preferably the at least one groove preferably
      includes at least one half of the circumference of the inside
      surface (i.e. the cylindrical passageway formed by the inside
      surface 50), and most preferably, the one half is bounded by a
      plane formed by a longitunal axis 300 of the fluid passageway and
      the central axis 120. It is, however, preferred as shown in figure
      5, to use one groove placed after the throttle plate 90 (that is
      placed toward the discharge end when the throttle plate is in the
      closed position) and is superiorly placed if the rotation of the
      throttle plate 90 is clockwise (if the rotation of the throttle
      plate is counter clockwise then inferior placement of the one
      groove would be preferred).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Preferably, the at least one groove 200 or 210 is placed
      near to the throttle plate and works cooperatively with the
      throttle plate 90 to modify the fluid flow such as enhancing a
      pressure wave or toroidal nature of the fluid flow, and, more
      preferably, the at least one groove 200 or 210 does not interfere
      with the throttle seat 65. Most preferably, the at least one
      groove is placed near the position of the throttle plate when the
      throttle plate is in idle position such as when an engine is
      idling. In a preferred embodiment, the at least one groove 200 or
      210 has a depth (y) and a width (x) that are roughly equivalent as
      shown in figure 12. In another preferred embodiment, the groove
      has the following characteristics x=y and the radius of curvature
      (z)(not depicted) is 0.8x. It is believed that the dimensions may
      be varied for x, y and z as long as the pressure wave is created
      or enhanced. Further, in a preferred embodiment the dimension of x
      is 3 millimeters, but the value of x may be varied between 2 mm
      and 4 mm. In a most preferred embodiment, the dimension x is
      one-half the thickness of the throttle body wall. Preferably, the
      groove dimensions are adjusted according to the characteristics of
      the individual application as based on the variables of
      displacement and intake air speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Preferably, the at least one groove 200 or 210 is
      perpendicular to the inside surface, more preferably at least one
      groove 200 or 210 is perpendicular to direction defined by fluid
      travel from the open end to the discharge end, but most
      preferably, the at least one groove 200 or 210 is slightly curved
      to match the throttle body plate consistent with an imaginary
      slice made through the housing in the plane formed by the throttle
      plate 90 when it is in an idle position.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In a preferred method, the at least one groove may be
      created by a hemispherical cut using a bit 300 wherein a bit means
      any tool for altering or creating shapes in structures. In another
      preferred embodiment, compound cuts may be created by a special
      bit or by making one or more additional cuts next to or within a
      previous groove.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] While not being bound by any theory suggested herein, it is
      believed that the fluid flow is modified by the at least one
      groove to create pressure waves and possibly rolling toroidal
      pressure waves and that the pressure waves maintain their
      integrity of the wave pulse as postulated in figures 6 through 11.
      It is believe that this mechanism or one like it provides a method
      to increase gas mileage, increase horsepower, increase torque,
      reduce emissions and/or reduce the carbon foot print of a machine,
      especially an internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] This invention also includes a method of creating the at
      least one groove in the throttle body side wall 30. In a preferred
      embodiment the at least one groove 90 may be cut into the throttle
      body side wall 30 using a bit 300 described in figures 13 - 15.
      Preferably the bit 300 is used with a high speed rotary tool to
      cut a groove into the throttle body wall 30 of an existing
      throttle body 10 on an engine. In the preferred embodiment, as
      throttle bodies differ from engine to engine, different bits may
      be used to create the at least one groove. Preferred embodiments
      found in figure 13-15 include one or more of the following
      elements: a shank 310, a cutting head 320, a hemisphere section
      330, a flat surface 340, a oblique angle portion 350, tapered
      shank section 360 and/or a reduced shank section 370.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The preferred embodiments shown in figures 13a, 14a, an 15a
      show bits used for a primary cut having a hemispherical portion
      terminating in a flat surface which is most preferably a 50
      percent cut at the equator of the hemisphere. This bit would be
      preferably used for the primary cut on the portion in front of the
      throttle body as seen in figure 12 thereby generating the
      principal shape for the waveform producing groove. Also,
      preferably this bit may be used for the primary cut on the portion
      in front of the throttle body as seen in figure 12 when access is
      available to the portion of the throttle body.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The preferred embodiments shown in figures 13b, 14b, and
      15b show bits used for a secondary cut having a hemispherical
      portion terminating in a flat surface which is most preferably a
      60 percent cut. This bit may be preferably used for a secondary
      cut inside the primary groove on the portion in front of the
      throttle body. It is believed that additional modification of the
      primary may enhance the wave being generated; however, other
      modifications or configurations of the groove could also be
      envisioned to enhance the wave being generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The preferred embodiments shown in figures 13c, 14c, and
      15c show bits where the cutting material is removed from the shank
      end of a spherical cutter, and where the non- cutting surface on
      the shank end is preferably at a 110[deg.] -120[deg.] oblique
      angle from shank to the equator, originating at a point on the
      shank at 50 percent of diameter. For example, figure 13c shows a
      5/16" ball - origin at 5/32" from the end of the cutting surface.
      This bit would be preferably used for the primary cut on the
      portion in back of the throttle body as seen in figure 12
      especially where access to the both sides of the throttle plate is
      prohibited by other design considerations of stock air systems.
      The use of this bit in cutting a groove which can generate the
      principle shape for the waveform producing groove.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Figure 15 shows preferred embodiments where material may be
      removed from shank so that the bit may reach the throttle body.<br>
