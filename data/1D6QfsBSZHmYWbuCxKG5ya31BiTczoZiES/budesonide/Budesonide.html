          Interview 7.2.20</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      More than 25 million people live in Taiwan, 25 million people
      practically stacked on top of each other. If they practiced social
      distancing they’d be out in the ocean floating around. There’s not
      enough room for them to do social distancing.<br>
      <br>
      But guess how many people have died to date of the pandemic in
      Taiwan?<br>
      <br>
      Seven! Only seven!<br>
      <br>
      Only seven! (Yes, I confirmed this on worldometers.com. As of
      today, August 5, the number is only seven.)<br>
      <br>
      Texas physician Dr. Richard Bartlett has had a 100 percent success
      rate with his patients, many with life-threatening co-morditities,
      but the media has been ignoring it.<br>
      <br>
      In this video, Dr. Bartlett shares the stories people who he has
      treated using a steroid called budesonide, inhaled through a
      nebulizer. Dr. Bartlett has previously referred to his treatment
      as a “silver bullet” for the coronavirus. Worth watching at least
      the first 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Budesonide: That’s bu as in blue, des as in dess,&nbsp; o as in
      oh, nide as in hide) – Budesonide<br>
      <br>
      Only seven deaths of Covid-19 in Taiwan!<br>
      <br>
      “Same situation in Japan,” says Dr Bartlett. “One hundred and
      twenty-one million people in Japan, and they’ve had less than a
      thousand people die during the whole pandemic. In Singapore, only
      12 people have died in the entire country during the whole
      pandemic.”<br>
      <br>
      What is the secret to these low death counts?<br>
      <br>
      People in those countries are using an inhaled steroid called
      budesomide, says Dr Bartlett, who calls budesomide the “silver
      bullet.”<br>
      <br>
      “It’s super cheap,” say Dr. Bartlett. “It’s about $200 for the
      entire treatment if you use cash. Many of my patients who use
      insurance pay nothing out of pocket.”<br>
      <br>
      Budesonide is an asthma medicine, says Dr Bartlett. It’s a
      respiratory anti-inflammatory, and Covid-19 is a respiratory
      inflammation disease.<br>
      <br>
      “And it works,” says Dr Bartlett. “A hundred percent of my
      (Covid-19) patients are alive.”You use a nebulizer machine.<br>
      <br>
      “People start feeling better after the first treatment,” Bartlett
      adds.<br>
      <br>
      Note: This was first posted on YouTube more than a month ago. But
      have you seen any word about this in the mainstream media?<br>
      <br>
      Every person in the entire world should be made aware of this
      simple, cheap rapid solution to the pandemic. They should know
      about Dr Bartlett’s “silver bullet.”<br>

      <br>
      Budesonide/formoterol, sold under the brand name Symbicort among
      others, is a combination medication used in the management of
      asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[2] It
      contains budesonide, a steroid and formoterol, a long-acting
      β2-agonist (LABA).[2] The product monograph does not support its
      use for sudden worsening or treatment of active bronchospasm.[2]
      However, a 2020 review of the literature does support such use.[4]
      It is used by breathing in the medication.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Common side effects include throat pain, influenza, runny nose,
      and a yeast infection of the mouth.[2] There were concerns that
      the LABA component increases the risk of death in children with
      asthma, however these concerns were removed in 2017.[5] Therefore,
      this combination is only recommended in those who are not
      controlled on an inhaled steroid alone.[2] There is tentative
      evidence that typical doses of inhaled steroids and LABAs are safe
      in pregnancy.[6] Both formoterol and budesonide are excreted in
      breast-milk.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Budesonide/formoterol was approved for medical use in the United
      States in 2006.[7][2] It is on the World Health Organization's
      List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective
      medicines needed in a health system.[8] In the United States, as
      of 2017, the wholesale cost of an inhaler is about US$30.[9] In
      the United Kingdom, the cost as of 2015, was about GB£35 for a
      unit with 120 doses.[10] In 2017, it was the 74th most commonly
      prescribed medication in the United States, with more than ten
      million prescriptions.[11][12] &nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <b>Medical uses</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Maintenance</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Budesonide/formoterol has shown efficacy to prevent asthma
      attacks.[4] It is unclear if budesonide/formoterol differs from
      fluticasone and salmeterol in chronic asthma.[13]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exacerbation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The combination is approved in the United States only as a
      maintenance medication in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD).[2] However, a 2020 review of the literature does
      support use as needed during acute worsening in those with mild
      disease, and as maintenance followed by extra doses during
      worsening.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Use for both maintenance and as needed treatment is also known as
      single maintenance and reliever therapy ( SMART) and is a
      well-established treatment.[14][15] It has been shown to reduce
      asthma exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids, hospital
      visits better than maintenance inhaled corticosteroids alone at a
      higher dose, or inhaled corticosteroid at the same or higher dose
      with a long acting bronchodilator (LABA)), with a short-acting
      bronchodilator (SABA) as a reliever.[14][15] More studies using
      budesonide/formoterol SMART in children are needed.[15]<br>

      Market<br>
      <br>
      Budesonide/formoterol formulation was introduced in Sweden in
      2000. It was approved for use in the United States in July
      2006.[7][17] It is now[when?] approved for use in at least 70
      countries, yielding global sales in excess of $1 billion in 2005,
      and now[when?] approximately $3.7 billion per annum.[citation
      needed]<br>
      <br>
      Budesonide/formoterol was approved for use in the European Union
      in April 2014.[18][19]<br>
      <br>
      There are several patents related to the drug; some of them are
      already expired.[20] It was initially marketed by AstraZeneca.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      FIELD: medicine, pharmacy. SUBSTANCE: invention relates to method
      of isolation and purification of budesonide that is highly
      effective hormonal broncholytic agent. Isolation of crude
      budesonide from cultural fluid is carried out at pH value 2-2.5
      and budesonide is extracted from precipitated mixture of steroid
      and cultural biomass with ethyl acetate in the ratio budesonide :

      carrying out a condensation reaction on a compound I as a raw

      a catalyst and a solvent during the condensation reaction.
      Compared with conventional inorganic catalysts such as
      hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid, the reaction
      yield and the enantio-selectivity can be improved. The
      post-treatment is more convenient and simple, too. Meanwhile, a
      reaction of hydroxyl on locus 11 and butyraldehyde is avoided to
      generate side products as the ketone carboxyl on the locus 11 is
      reduced first. After the condensation reaction with butyraldehyde,
      unnecessary S configuration can be separated andremoved first by
      splitting, so that the follow-up reaction and treatment costs are
      saved. The splitting effect of the steps is also relatively ideal.
      The preparation method is simple in step, high inyield, high in

      preparation method, the unstable midbody 16 alpha-hydroxyl
      prednisolone is avoided. The preparation method is easy to operate
      and control, and the total yield of the budesonide is greatly
      increased. The reaction formula is shown in the specification.<br>
