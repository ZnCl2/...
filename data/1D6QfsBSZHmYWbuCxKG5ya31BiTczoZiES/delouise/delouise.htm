      </center>
      <p>Five years ago psychic Joseph DeLouise had a dream in which the
        great Italian master Leonardo DaVinci appeared to him and
        inexplicably ‘designed’ a remarkable aircraft. </p>
      <p>Although DeLouise had no formal education beyond the fifth
        grade, the famed Chicago seer scribbled a rough sketch of the
        aircraft from the vision and today he and some associates are
        planning to build a production model of the ‘commuter airplane
        of the future’. </p>
      <p>‘We’ve built and flow a radio-controlled model and it lived up
        to all our expectations’, DeLouise told NewsReal, ‘and now we
        need to raise the funds for the full size prototype.’ </p>
      <p>Grinning from ear to ear, the man who says his life is a
        ‘psychic mission’ watched as the model plane soared overhead,
        demonstrating amazing flight stability. </p>
      <p>‘It’s almost impossible to crash this plane’, DeLouise remarked
        happily. ‘It’s so easy to learn to fly and it will someday be
        the commuter’s delight.’ </p>
      <p>Though many inventors credit special ‘inspiration’ that borders
        on psychic phenomena for their ideas, DeLouise is the first case
        on record of an acclaimed seer coming up with a productive
        invention by purely psychic means. </p>
      <p>‘At first I thought I was going crazy, which is usually the
        case when this kind of clear, real-life vision comes to me. But
        I soon realized that I was going through a psychic experience
        and not an ordinary dream as the bearded figure in my vision
        spoke to me.’ </p>
      <p>DaVinci, according to DeLouise, sketched the aircraft for the
        attentive psychic and tried to explain the various aeronautical
        principles as he sketched. </p>
      <p>‘The experience was so vivid, it was real. He would pause as he
        spoke to make sure I understood. And even though I don’t know
        flaps from landing gear, I somehow understood what he was saying
        and later I had no trouble remembering the design.’ </p>
      <p>The next day DeLouise called this reporter, who is also his
        biographer and said: </p>
      <p>‘’Tom, I had the craziest experience last night. Leonardo
        DaVinci appeared to me and showed me how to design an
        uncrashable airplane.’ </p>
      <p>As usual, I thought Joe was partially unglued, but because I
        had been amazed in the past, I didn’t scoff at him. Thus
        encouraged he began the long quiet pursuit of making a reality
        out of his vision. </p>
      <p>He arranged to have drawings made by a dentist friend who was
        also a competent pilot and aeronautical engineer. The drawings
        slowly evolved into models and finally radio-controlled,
        gasoline-driven models. </p>
      <p>“Of course a radio-controlled sale model may not have exactly
        the same flight characteristics as a full-sized prototype, but
        our model has continued to outperform all other models and this
        is encouraging,’ DeLouise said, sounding like an engineer and
        demonstrating how quickly a psychic mind catches on. </p>
      <p>The personable seer cannot hide his enthusiasm as he described
        the remarkable creation plucked from his ‘DaVinci Vision’. </p>
      <p>‘It’s going to be the most fantastic airplane in existence.
        It’s so simple and safe in its operation that anyone can learn
        to fly it in a fraction of the time it takes to learn to fly any
        standard aircraft today. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;‘I see it as the aircraft the world is waiting for and
        that’s why the spirit of DaVinci gave it to me’, DeLouise
        stressed. </p>
      <p>Practical thinking people may very well pooh-pooh the notion
        that the spirit of Leonardo really did appear to DeLouise, but,
        frankly, there is no more logical explanation. </p>
      <p>A man with little education or engineering experience designed
        an aircraft that: </p>
      <p>Utilizes full san flaps ob both its wigs to not only increase
        or decrease the lift of its wings, but also control itself. The
        flaps on this visionary plane are also ailerons and elevators.
        The endplates that connect the two wings serve as rudders and
        vertical stabilizers. </p>
      <p>Climbs and descends in an almost perfectly horizontal attitude
        (Attitude is the aeronautical term used to describe the angle of
        a plane with respect to the horizon). The placement of the wings
        makes his possible and also prevents the plane from nose-diving
        or becoming dangerously over-controlled. </p>
      <p>Remains stable in flight. It will turn without skidding and
        tend to stabilize in a level attitude no matter what happens,
        including any loss of power. </p>
      <p>Lands and takes off in a very short area, meaning less space
        will be needed for airport runways. </p>
      <p>Easily converts into passenger, cargo, crop-dusting, low-level
        military reconnaissance, amphibious glider and hang-glider
        crafts. </p>
      <p>Lifts more weight because of its ‘center of gravity’ design. </p>
      <p>Provides unparalleled visibility to the pilot and passengers. </p>
      <p>The aircraft industry is more than 70 years old and has turned
        out some remarkable flying machines --- but nothing in the
        annals of invention matches this remarkable vision that’s
        blossomed into reality. </p>
      <p>Ironically it is a genius from the past, DaVinci, who DeLouise
        credits with wanting man to soar above the ground. </p>
      <p>‘The only reason I claimed that the person in my vision was
        Leonardo’, DeLouise explained, ‘was because this was my
        immediate impression of who I was listening to and he didn’t
        make any move to correct my thinking about who he was. Yet later
        when my thinking was incorrect regarding what he was saying
        about the plane, he corrected it, even though I didn’t say a
        word’. </p>
      <p>You and I might say that carrying on a conversation with a
        bearded Italian artist from several hundred years ago about an
        airplane of the future is insanity <br>
        . <br>
        But to DeLouise the experience was almost commonplace. </p>
      <p>‘I got the impression as he was talking that he really would
        have enjoyed materializing and building the thing himself. He
        seemed so enthusiastic in the vision, and I knew his ideas would
        work because he left no doubt that he knew what he was talking
        about.’ </p>
      <p>DeLouise said he also got the impression that the great
        artist-scientist from the past selected the Italian-American
        because he knew DeLouise would not be afraid to announce the
        vision and try to make it work. </p>
      <p>‘Of course these things were only impressions --- but remember,
        that’s all a psychic deals with’, DeLouise noted. </p>
      <p>Scoffers and skeptics are welcome to ridicule the story of the
        vision, DeLouise stressed. ‘It’s up to them to figure out how I
        managed to design such a plane’. </p>

      <p>For the aeronautical buff who understands the concepts, here
        are some of the principles involved in Joe DeLouise’s ‘DaVinci
        Vision’ as outlined by an expert: </p>
      <p>‘An airplane design is a compromise between its cruising speed
        and its landing speed. Usually a fast cruising craft lands fast
        and a slow cruising plane lands slow. The use of flaps on an
        airplane is a device to allow fast airplanes to lad a little
        slower and also tae off in a shorter distance. </p>
      <p>However, flaps add to the cost and weight of an airplane and
        usually create a disturbing airflow over the tail section when
        lowered for landings. Because of this air disturbance the tail
        section must be made larger to offset this effect, and again
        more cost and weight has been added. </p>
      <p>‘This plane, on the other hand, eliminates all of these faults
        and problems by using full span flaps on both of its wings to
        not only increase or decrease the lift, but also to control and
        stabilize itself. The flaps also act as elevators and ailerons.
      </p>
      <p>‘The endplates, connecting the wings, carry the vertical
        stabilizers and rudders so the plane doesn’t require a tail the
        size of the one on a standard type plane. This unique design
        provides smooth, undisturbed airflow over all the operating
        surfaces. </p>
      <p>‘The wings are placed as follows: The rear wing is
        approximately one wing chord aft of the forward wing, with a gap
        of about two-thirds of the wing chord. </p>
      <p>‘Each wing carries an ELEFLAP (combination elevators and flaps)
        which operate in unison. They are activated by the forward or
        backward movement of the control column. When the control column
        is back, both eleflaps move downward in unison imparting an
        increase in the lift to both wings. </p>
      <p>‘The rear eleflap moves to a lesser degree than the forward
        eleflap because of its greater distance from the center of
        gravity. Since the upper flap is slightly forward of the center
        of gravity, a downward movement of the flap causes the nose of
        the craft to rise. At the same time the downward movement of the
        rear flap causes the nose of the plane to move down. Thus, the
        ratio of the eleflap’s synchronized movement controls the
        longitudinal axis of the aircraft. </p>
      <p>‘This ratio can be adjusted to give the aircraft any desired
        attitude when climbing or descending. A slight nose up attitude
        when climbing and a slight nose down attitude when descending
        seem the safest, most effective and efficient attitude. </p>
      <p>‘Conversely, when the control column is moved forward, both
        eleflaps move upward in unison causing a loss of lift to both
        wings and the airplane descends in a near level attitude. </p>
      <p>‘The compact configuration and the endplates make it
        theoretically possible to make banked turns with rudder action
        only. When turning in flight the endplates prevents the airplane
        from going into a skid and force it into a bank, thus making a
        naturally banked turn. </p>
      <p>‘The endplates being deposed from the forward wing to the rear
        wing does not mean a preponderance of area at the extremity of
        the craft as does the vertical stabilizer in a standard
        configuration. </p>
      <p>‘Although the airplane is short-coupled, its directional
        stability is extremely strong because of the placement of the
        rear wing well aft of the center of gravity, and also because of
        the placement of the vertical stabilizers and rudders on the
        endplates. <br>
        Is compactness of design provides the craft with a pendulum
        effect that tends to stay straight and level at all times. It
        most likely will be required that the pilot hold the plane into
        its turns, because as soon as controls are released there will
        be a strong tendency to stabilize. </p>
      <p>‘Despite the tendency for stabilization, maneuverability is
        greater than with standard aircraft. This has been proven in
        radio-controlled flights. </p>
      <p>‘Most of the short field takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft
        today are merely standard design vehicles with more expensive
        flaps, dropping ailerons and so forth. The chief problem with
        these standard STOL types is inadequate control at lower speeds.
        Because they must operate at high angles of attack for landings
        and takeoffs, their control surfaces operate in a disturbed
        airflow created by the wings and flaps. Consequently, their
        control surfaces must be much larger than in ordinary aircraft,
        thereby creating more weight and drag. </p>
      <p>‘Another great advantage of this design is that it employs two
        large flaps, which unlike any other aircraft, also control the
        altitude of the plane safely without need f additional drag
        producing tail surfaces. </p>
      <p>‘Additionally, the airfoils may be thin, thereby cutting down
        on the frontal area of the aircraft. This is possible because of
        the short span wings and high lift flaps. These features provide
        a high speed potential, quick takeoff and very low landing
        speed. </p>
      <p>‘The absence of the conventional fuselage and tail assembly,
        which are normally located aft of the propeller, adapts the
        design perfectly for a pusher configuration with its attendant
        efficient slipstream freedom and quietness plus safety of
        operation. The torque force is also absent, making the twist in
        a wing unnecessary, thereby saving on further drag.’ </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>A short coupled airplane with variable wing lift comprising a
        fuselage that is free of the conventional tail assembly and has
        a wing structure comprising a plurality of short span wing
        segments spaced apart longitudinally of the fuselage with the
        forwardmost wing section being located forwardly of and above
        the level of the aircraft center of gravity, and the
        rearwardmost wing section being located rearwardly of, and below
        the level of the aircraft center of gravity. The wing sections
        at their projecting ends on either side of the airplane are
        connected by vertical airfoils each equipped with a rudder. The
        wing sections along their trailing edges are each equipped, on
        either side of the fuselage, with full span, vertically
        swingable members that combine the functions of flaps and
        elevators (and are thus called eleflaps). The eleflaps and
        rudders are respectively moved in unison to elevate, lower, and
        steer the aircraft. The aircraft is driven pusher style by a
        propeller driven motor located in vertical alignment with the
        aircraft center of gravity. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is directed to powered aircraft, and more
        particularly to propeller driven airplanes. </p>
      <p>Conventionally, propeller driven airplane design calls for a
        fuselage equipped with wings having a large span relative to
        their chord, with the average ratio of span to chord being about
        7. The wings are equipped adjacent their ends with ailerons
        which are operated cooperatively so that an upward movement of
        one aileron is accompanied by a downward movement of the other
        aileron; they are operated by sideways movement of the pilot's
        control column, and are the means by which the wings are kept
        level for straight flight, or banked for a turn. The wings also
        include, inwardly of the ailerons, lift control flaps that swing
        in the same direction vertically to permit fast planes to land
        at slower speeds and to take off in shorter distances. </p>
      <p>The fuselage of conventional airplanes traditionally is
        equipped at its rear end, usually at a distance of some three
        chords behind the leading edge of the wings, with a tail
        assembly, usually including a vertical stabilizer equipped at
        its trailing edge with the rudder, and a horizontal stabilizer
        equipped at its trailing edge with an elevator. The vertical
        stabilizer provides for vertical stabilization and the rudder it
        carries is for directional steering. The horizontal stabilizer
        balances or trims the plane, that is, insures that the resultant
        of all the air forces acting on the plane passes through the
        center of gravity of the plane. The elevator is the primary
        control organ of the plane since by it the pilot alters the
        angle of incidence of the wings and hence controls the plane
        speed. </p>
      <p>The design specified for a particular airplane construction is
        fundamentally a compromise between its cruising speed and its
        landing speed. Usually a fast cruising airplane lands fast and a
        slow cruising airplane lands slow. The use of flaps on the
        airplane wings is to provide for fast planes to land at a
        reduced speed, and also to take off in a shorter distance than
        might otherwise be possible. However, such flaps add to the cost
        and weight of the airplane, and usually create a disturbing air
        flow over the aircraft tail section when lowered for landings,
        which requires an enlargement of the tail section to offset this
        effect, again adding to the cost and weight problems involved.
        Furthermore, in most standard type of airplanes, much of the
        fuselage is located aft of the aircraft center of gravity, and
        the major function of that portion of the fuselage is to carry
        the tail assembly. Thus, much of the fuselage defines wasted
        space since any significant loading up towards the tail assembly
        would make the aircraft tail heavy. </p>
      <p>A principal object of the present invention is to provide an
        airplane arrangement that climbs and descends in a level or near
        level attitude, and has stability characteristics that are
        markedly improved over those of conventional airplanes. </p>
      <p>Another principal object of the invention is to provide an
        airplane arrangement, utilizing components historically known to
        be reliable in the practice of aerodynamics, which minimizes
        controls to be handled while providing an aircraft of greatly
        improved maneuverability and stability. </p>
      <p>Another important object of the invention is to eliminate the
        need for the usual tail assembly and adapt the airplane and
        fuselage for location of baggage or cargo space at or near the
        center of gravity of the aircraft. </p>
      <p>Still other objects of the invention are to provide an airplane
        arrangement adapted for pusher propulsion with its attendant
        efficient slipstream freedom and quietness and safety of
        operation, to provide an airplane vertical airfoil arrangement
        that reduces the need to "crab" when landing in a cross wind, to
        provide a basic airplane arrangement susceptible of wide
        utilization, and to provide an aircraft that is economical of
        manufacture, convenient, economical, and safe to operate, and
        that is adapted for a wide variety of both civilian and military
        purposes, and that is also spin proof. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, the airplane fuselage is
        short coupled and has no tail assembly. The wing structure
        comprises a plurality of short span wing sections that are
        spaced apart longitudinally and vertically of the fuselage, with
        the forwardmost wing section being located forwardly of the
        craft center of gravity and adjacent the top level of the craft,
        and the rearwardmost wing section being located rearwardly of
        the center of gravity and sufficiently below the wing sections
        forward of it to be below their slipstreams. The wing sections
        along their trailing edges are each equipped, on either side of
        the fuselage, with vertically movable members that combine the
        functions of elevators and flaps, (and are thus herein called
        eleflaps), which members function not only to increase and
        decrease the wing lift, but also to control vertical movement of
        the craft. The wing sections at their ends or tips, on either
        side of the airplane, are connected together by vertical
        airfoils that are each equipped with a rudder for steering
        purposes. </p>
      <p>The eleflaps serve the functions of flaps, ailerons and
        elevators, and provide for vertical movement of the craft in a
        level or near level attitude. The vertical airfoils serve as the
        craft vertical stabilizers, and are proportioned and located to
        achieve lateral plane movement in cross winds that permits cross
        wind landing with minimal crabbing. The rudders are arranged to
        operate in unison to achieve turns in flight. </p>

      <p>However, it is to be distinctly understood that the drawing
        illustrations provided are supplied primarily to comply with the
        requirements of the Patent Laws, and that the invention is
        susceptible of the variations and modifications that will be
        obvious to those skilled in the art which are intended to be
        covered by the appended claims. </p>
      <p>Reference numeral 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 generally indicates one
        embodiment of the invention which comprises fuselage 12 equipped
        with wing structure 14 and a pusher type propeller 16 suitably
        powered by a suitable motor appropriately mounted and housed
        within the fuselage where indicated by reference numeral 18. </p>
      <p>The fuselage 12 defines forward end 20 and aft end 22 that are
        given appropriate streamlined contour. As has been pointed out
        hereinbefore, the fuselage 12 lacks the usual tail assembly; it
        includes a suitable operator's cockpit where indicated at 21,
        passenger or cargo space where indicated at 23, and suitable
        ground support wheels 25. </p>
      <p>The wing structure 14 is of special configuration and comprises
        a forward short span wing section 24 and a rearward or aft short
        span wing section 26 suitably united with the fuselage in any
        conventional manner consistent with good engineering practice.
        On either side of the aircraft, the end 28 of wing section 24 is
        joined to the end 30 of wing section 26 by vertical airfoil 32,
        and the end 34 of wing section 24 is joined to the end 36 of
        wing section 26 by vertical airfoil 38. </p>
      <p>The wing section 24 on either side of the aircraft is equipped
        with full span vertically movable eleflaps 40 and 42, while the
        wing section 26 is similarly equipped with full span vertically
        movable eleflaps 44 and 46. </p>
      <p>The vertical airfoil 32 at its trailing end 48 is equipped with
        horizontally movable rudder 50 suitably pivotally mounted for
        movement about upright axis 51, while the airfoil 38 at its
        trailing end 52 is equipped with horizontally movable rudder 54
        suitably pivotally mounted for movement about upright axis 55. </p>
      <p>The wing sections 24 and 26 may be of essentially conventional
        wing design except for the short span and other considerations
        indicated. Wing section 26 is disposed approximately one wing
        chord aft of the wing section 24, so that a gap 56 is defined by
        the wing sections 24 and 26 making up the wing structure 14.
        Wing section 26 is also at a level below that of wing section 24
        that is equivalent to approximately one half wing chord. </p>
      <p>The eleflaps 40, 42, 44 and 45 may be constructed and mounted
        in the same manner as conventional elevators or flaps. Wing
        section 24 is located forwardly of the aircraft center of
        gravity, indicated at 60 in FIG. 1-5, with the eleflaps 40 and
        42 of the wing section 26 being disposed above the center of
        gravity in the embodiment shown and mounted for pivotal swinging
        movement about pivot axes 58 (see FIGS. 3 and 4) that extend
        longitudinally of wing section 26; eleflaps 44 and 46 are
        suitably mounted for pivotal movement about axes 59 that extend
        longitudinally of wing section 26. The eleflaps 40, 42, 44, and
        46 are connected for actuation from the pilot's control column
        62 in such a manner (see, for instance, FIG. 8) that they
        operate in unison, and all eleflaps move in the same direction.
        It is also important that the aft eleflaps 44 and 46 move to a
        lesser degree than the forward eleflaps 40 and 42 because of
        their greater distance from the center of gravity 60 of the
        craft. </p>
      <p>As a general proposition, in accordance with this invention,
        the forwardmost wing section should be located so that its
        eleflaps are disposed above or forwardly of the aircraft center
        of gravity. Also, the vertical swinging movement of the
        respective eleflaps is approximately inversely proportional to
        the distance of the respective eleflap centers of movement
        forward or aft of the craft center of gravity. Thus, where the
        forwardmost eleflap is located in substantial vertical alignment
        with the craft center of gravity, such eleflap will have maximum
        vertical movement and the rearward eleflap will have a vertical
        movement inversely proportional to the distance of its axis of
        movement aft of the center of gravity. </p>
      <p>The actuation of the eleflaps 40, 42, 44 and 46 is made that
        when the pilot's control column is moved rearwardly, as
        indicated in FIG. 3, the eleflaps 40, 42, 44 and 46 are lowered
        about their respective pivotal axes. Since the forward eleflaps
        40 and 42 are substantially aligned with the craft's center of
        gravity, longitudinally of the aircraft, when such eleflaps are
        moved downwardly the result is that the forward end or nose 20
        of the aircraft is caused to rise, as indicated in FIG. 3. At
        the same time, similar movement of the eleflaps 44 and 46 tends
        to cause the forward end or nose of the aircraft to move
        downwardly. The lesser degree of movement of the rearward
        eleflaps 44 and 46 is needed because of their distance from the
        center of gravity longitudinally of the aircraft, whereby they
        provide a greater moment in effecting the attitude of the
        aircraft. </p>
      <p>Where the control column 62 is moved forwardly, as when
        descending, the forward wing section eleflaps 40 and 42 move
        upwardly thereby causing the nose of the aircraft to move
        downwardly (as indicated in FIG. 4), while the wing section
        eleflaps 40, and 46 move upwardly tending to cause the aircraft
        nose to move upwardly. </p>
      <p>It will thus be seen that there is a critical ratio of forward
        wing span eleflap movement to rearward wing span flap movement,
        in unison, relative to the craft center of gravity, which
        controls the attitude of the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
        This ratio can be set or adjusted to give the aircraft a desired
        attitude when climbing or descending. Preferably the ratio
        selected will provide a slight nose up attitude when climbing
        and slight nose down attitude when descending, from the
        standpoint of safety, efficiency and effectiveness. </p>
      <p>The further back the control column 60 is moved, the greater is
        the increase that is provided in the lift of both wing sections
        for climbing in a level or near level attitude, while when the
        control column is pushed forward, both wing sections lose lift
        and the aircraft descends in a level or near level attitude. </p>
      <p>The rudders 50 and 54 are similarly controlled by pilot
        operated foot pedals to move in unison in the same direction.
        The rudders 50 and 54 are suitably mounted for pivotal movement
        about axes 51 and 55 that are vertically disposed when the
        aircraft is in a level attitude, and the pivotal mounting
        involved may be achieved in any suitable manner consistent with
        good aerodynamics engineering practice. FIGS. 9 and 10
        illustrate diagrammatically a suitable rudder control
        arrangement. </p>
      <p>The short wing span of the aircraft 10 gives it a compact
        configuration. As a general proposition, in accordance with the
        invention the wing span may be substantially equal to or less
        than the length of the fuselage, and have a chord to span length
        ratio on the order of four to one. The wing and fuselage
        arrangement indicated also provides for the center of lift of
        the aircraft to be located one third of the distance
        (longitudinally of the craft) between the centers of lift of the
        forward and rearward wing sections (aft of the forward wing
        section center of left), and also to be located in substantial
        vertical alignment with the center of gravity 60. </p>
      <p>The general combination provided by the compact aircraft
        configuration, its vertical airfoils 32 and 38, and the rudder
        action provided permits the aircraft to make banked turns with
        rudder action only, thereby eliminating the need for ailerons
        for shorter wing span models. When the aircraft is in flight and
        the rudders 50 and 54 are actuated for turning purposes, for
        instance, a turn to the right as indicated in FIG. 5, the
        vertical air foils 32 and 38 prevent the aircraft from going
        into a skid, and the aircraft is forced into a bank, thus making
        a naturally banked turn. The air foils 32 and 38, in extending
        between the forward and rearward wing sections, do not present a
        proponderance of area at the rear portion of the aircraft, as
        does the vertical stabilizer of the usual tail assembly, while
        presenting a relative large effective area adjacent the craft
        center of gravity. </p>
      <p>In spite of the short coupled nature of the aircraft 10, its
        directional stability is very good because of the placement of
        the rearmost wing section 26 well aft of the aircraft center of
        gravity, and also because of the disposition of the wing
        structure 14 and airfoils 32 and 38 to either side of the
        aircraft at the ends of the wing sections. </p>
      <p>The result is that when the aircraft experiences wind from one
        side of same, fishtailing is avoided and application of moments
        to the fuselage is also avoided because the tail assembly is
        omitted from the aircraft 10. The two rudders 50 and 54 when
        operated provide an effective moment for steering purposes that
        is equivalent to the location of a single rudder where indicated
        by reference numeral 66 in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>In aircraft 70 of FIGS. 6 and 7, the fuselage 72 is provided
        with wing structure 74 that comprises a plurality of wing
        sections 76, 78 and 80 in which the forwardmost wing section 76
        is located forwardly of the aircraft center of gravity
        (indicated at 82) while the rearwardmost wing section 80 is
        spaced rearwardly or aft of the aircraft approximately two wing
        chords. The wing section 76 is disposed at the upper level of
        the aircraft while the wing sections 78 and 80 are disposed at
        spaced levels below the level of the section 76, as suggested in
        FIG. 7. Gap 82 separates wing sections 76 and 78 while gap 84
        separates wing sections 78 and 80. Fuselage has nose portion 85
        and tail portion 87, but no tail assembly of the conventional
        type. </p>
      <p>Wing section 76 is provided with a full span eleflap 86, wing
        section 78 is provided with a full span eleflap 88 and wing span
        section 80 is provided with a full span eleflap 90. Eleflaps 86,
        88 and 90 may be comparable in structure to conventional
        elevators and flaps and mounted and controlled in the manner
        already indicated with respect to the aircraft 10, so as to
        pivot about the respective pivot axes 89, 91 and 93. </p>
      <p>The wing sections 76, 78, 80 at their ends 92, 94 and 96 are
        connected together by vertical foil 98 while wing section ends
        100, 102 and 104 are connected together by vertical foil 106.
        Vertical foil 98 is provided with rudder 108 at its trailing
        end, mounted for pivotal movement about upright axis 109, while
        vertical foil 106 is provided with rudder 110 at its trailing
        end, mounted for pivotal movement about upright axis 111.
        Rudders 108 and 110 are mounted and operated in a manner
        comparable to rudders 50 and 54 of aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 70 is provided with suitable propeller 112 driven
        by a suitable motor (not shown) suitably mounted and housed
        within the fuselage approximately where indicated at 114,
        through suitable shafting and gearing operating in housing
        structure 116 that in the form shown extends through the wing
        section 78. </p>
      <p>The fuselage 72 is suitably arranged and constructed to define
        the usual operator's cockpit where indicated at 118, a fuel tank
        where indicated at 120, and baggage compartment where indicated
        at 122. The aircraft 70 is provided with suitable riding wheels
        124 and 126, in the form illustrated. </p>
      <p>In the aircraft 70, the rearward wing sections are spaced
        approximately one-half chord length longitudinally of the craft,
        and are spaced or staggered approximately one-third of a chord
        length vertically of the craft. </p>
      <p>The aircraft 70 is operated in the same manner as aircraft 10.
        The eleflaps 88 and 90 are operated to move vertically, relative
        to the corresponding movement of eleflap 86, in proportion to
        their distances from the center of gravity of the aircraft,
        longitudinally of the fuselage, and as described with reference
        to the aircraft 10. </p>
      <p>The vertical foils of aircraft 10 and 70 are disposed in
        vertical planes that parallel the longitudinal axis of the
        craft. These vertical foils may be of any suitable airfoil
        construction consistent with good aircraft engineering practice.
      </p>
      <p>A typical eleflap actuation arrangement 150 is shown in FIG. 8
        for the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7, wherein the pilot's control
        column 62 is shown pivotally mounted (in the craft) for pivotal
        movement about axis 152, and is pivotally connected as at 154 to
        link 156 that is in turn pivotally connected as at 158 to bell
        crank lever 160 pivotally mounted for pivotal movement about
        axis 162. Bell crank lever 160 is pivotally connected as at 164
        to link 166 that is in turn pivotally connected as at 168 to
        bell crank lever 170 pivotally mounted for pivotal movement
        about axis 172. Bell crank lever 170 is pivotally connected as
        at 174 to link 176 that is pivotally, connected as at 178 to
        crank arm 180 that is fixed to eleflap 86. Link 176 is also
        pivotally connected at the same pivot point 178 to link 180
        which in turn is pivotally connected as at 182 to crank arm 184
        that is fixed to eleflap 88. Link 180 is also connected at pivot
        182 to link 186 that is pivotally connected as at 188 to crank
        arm 190 that is fixed to eleflap 90. </p>
      <p>As eleflap 86 is disposed above the craft center of gravity 82,
        crank arms 184 and 190 are given effective lengths inversely
        proportional to their positions aft of the center of gravity,
        relative to the length of crank arm 180, whereby the degree of
        pivotal movement of the respective eleflaps 88 and 90 has the
        inversely proportional relationship to the degree of pivotal
        movement of the eleflap 86 that has been indicated. The result
        is that, assuming the position A of the pilots control column 62
        is the level flight position, moving the control column 62 to
        the B and C positions provides the corresponding positions of
        the eleflaps 86, 88, and 90 that are indicated by the
        corresponding primed letters. In the B position of control
        column 62 lift is increased, while in the C position of column
        62, lift is decreased. </p>
      <p>In practice, the location and positioning of the various
        components of eleflap control arrangement 150 is made consistent
        and compatible with good aircraft engineering design. A similar
        eleflap arrangement for the embodiment of FIGS. 1-5 is provided
        by eliminating the link 186 and the parts it controls, and
        proportioning the length of the crank arms for eleflaps 40, 42,
        44 and 46 in accordance with the principles already mentioned.
        The link corresponding to link 180 would for the embodiment of
        FIGS. 1-5, have a length consistent with the positioning of the
        forward and aft eleflaps. Of course, the eleflaps of the
        respective wing sections 24 and 26 may be suitably connected
        together for synchronous operation by a single eleflap control
        arrangement of the type indicated. </p>
      <p>Where it is found desirable to provide for operation of the
        eleflaps in the manner of ailerons, suitable alternately
        operable controls conventionally arranged may be employed. </p>
      <p>In the showings of FIGS. 9 and 10, the rudder control
        arrangement 200 involves a pair of foot operated pedal levers
        202 and 204, pivotally mounted as at 206 and 208, respectively,
        and disposed on either side of the control column 62. Lever 202
        is connected to crank arm 209 of rudder 50 by cable 210 trained
        about suitable guide pulleys 212, while lever 204 is connected
        to crank arm 213 of rudder 54 by cable 214 trained about
        suitable guide pulleys 216. Cable 218 trained about suitable
        guide pulleys 220 is connected between crank arm 222 of rudder
        50 and crank arm 224 of rudder 54. The cables 210 and 214 are
        suitably tensioned and operably mounted relative to the craft so
        that the pilot by moving levers 202 and 204 in opposite
        directions, using his feet applied to the respective pedals 226
        and 228, may simultaneously swing the rudders 50 and 54 from
        side to side to steer the craft as needed. </p>
      <p>Of course, other rudder controls providing for the indicated
        simultaneous and synchronous swinging movement of rudders 50 and
        54 may be utilized, as will be apparent to those skilled in the
        art. </p>
      <p>It will therefore be seen that the invention provides an
        aircraft of compact configuration that provides unusual
        stability in flight together with the advantages of level or
        near level attitude for both ascent and descent. The compact
        configuration of the aircraft together with the placement of the
        wing structure of same, the short spans of the wings, and the
        vertical foils, provides the aircraft with a pendulum effect in
        which the main weight of the aircraft is located adjacent or in
        vertical alignment with its center of gravity whereby the
        aircraft tends towards level attitude at all times. Even in
        making a turn, the aircraft has a strong tendency to return to
        straight and level flight and thus on release of control in
        making a turn the craft will return to straight and level
        flight. </p>
      <p>The aircraft of this invention also overcomes the main fault of
        a two-control airplane, that is, the inability of such aircraft
        to enter into a slide slip. Not only will the aircraft of this
        invention not enter into a side slip, but it moves vertically in
        a far more superior manner. </p>
      <p>Thus, the pilot by pushing his control column forward can make
        the aircraft lose altitude very rapidly without gaining any
        forward speed and while remaining in a level or near level
        attitude. </p>
      <p>The smooth unobstructed airflow past all the control surfaces
        of the aircraft of this invention make the aircraft fully
        controllable at all speeds without added weight or drag. This
        especially suits aircraft involving the invention for short
        field landing and take-off (STOL). Most STOL aircraft at the
        present time involve expensive flaps, drooping ailerons, and the
        like to facilitate landing and take-off but result in inadequate
        control at the lower speeds. Because such conventional craft
        must operate at higher angles of attack for landings and
        take-off, their control surfaces operate in a disturbed airflow
        created by the wings and flaps and therefore their control
        surfaces must be much larger than in ordinary aircraft, thereby
        creating more weight and drag. </p>
      <p>The wing section eleflaps provided by the invention safely
        control the attitude of the aircraft and without the need of
        extra drag producing tail surfaces. In addition, the eleflap
        control surfaces operate in an undisturbed air flow. As the
        arrangement of the present invention utilizes high lift eleflaps
        and short span wings, the air foils involved may be relatively
        thin thereby cutting down on the frontal area of the aircraft.
        This, in conjunction with the lack of a tail assembly, gives the
        aircraft of the invention a high speed potential, and quick
        take-off capability with low landing speeds. As altitude can be
        lost rapidly without gaining ground speed, side slips are
        unnecessary. </p>
      <p>The absence, in the arrangement of the present invention, of
        the convenional tail assembly aft of the propeller adapts the
        Applicant's aircraft arrangement perfectly for a pusher type
        propulsion configuration with its attendant efficient slip
        stream freedom and quietness and safety of operation. Due to the
        operation of pusher type propulsion in the hereindisclosed
        arrangement, torque is absent in the applicant's arrangement
        thereby eliminating the need for a twist in the wings or offset
        vertical stabilizers. </p>
      <p>The arrangement of this invention makes a large passenger or
        cargo space at or adjacent the center of gravity of the
        aircraft, thereby permitting greater loads to be carried with
        ease and in greater safety. </p>
      <p>The positioning of the rearward or aft wing sections of the
        craft relative to the forward wing sections, improves the lift
        to drag ratio of the forward wing sections due to the fact that
        low pressure areas along the upper surfacing of the rearward
        wings tend to draw air from the trailing edge of the immediately
        preceding wing section, thus straightening out the wing edge
        vortices and reducing the drag resulting from such vortices. As
        a result, the positioning of the wing sections as indicated
        provides a total wing lift that is greater than the summation of
        the lift provided by each wing section if same were considered
        functioning independently. </p>
      <p>The vertical airfoils, in having a substantial area of same
        adjacent the center of gravity of the craft, and thus the center
        of lift, provide for a lateral movement of the aircraft in
        crosswinds, which avoids or reduces crabbing needed for landing
        in crosswinds. The vertical air foils also confine air flow to
        through the gaps between the wing sections, thereby contributing
        further to wing tip vortex reduction. Also, air flow is blocked,
        by the vertical air foils, from up around the wing tips. </p>
      <p>Of course the visibility afforded the pilot from the cockpit,
        due to the pusher type propulsion employed, and the ease of
        entering and leaving the aircraft due to easier access permitted
        to the cockpit and personnel quarters of the craft, are welcome
        features of the Applicant's arrangement. </p>
      <p>The Applicant's arrangement has wide applicability for use in
        sport planes, cargo planes, crop dusting planes, executive
        planes, and has many other capabilities in the civilain field.
        Military operations are also immediately apparent. The special
        configuration of the Applicant's arrangement lends the
        Applicant's invention to embodiment in amphibious aircraft. </p>
      <p>The short wing span on the aircraft of Applicant's invention
        permits the aircraft to be much lighter in weight than
        conventional aircraft of a comparable type. </p>
      <p>The foregoing description and the drawings are given merely to
        explain and illustrate the invention and the invention is not to
        be limited thereto, except insofar as the appended claims are so
        limited, since those skilled in the art who have the disclosure
        before them will be able to make modifications and variations
        therein without departing from the scope of the invention. </p>
