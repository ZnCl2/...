      <br>
      The perpetual universal electrostatic force has long been the
      subject of research of all kinds by many scholars, in order&nbsp;
      to come to tame the static constant contained in the universal
      atmosphere. To date, none of them had managed practically.<br>
      <br>
      However, some have managed, in different ways, to capture a
      relatively infinitesimal amount of barely controllable
      electricity, remaining in&nbsp; the laboratory : a flow also very
      irregular, often obtained by extremely prohibitive means, this
      current generally does not exceed a few milliamperes, thus
      remaining practically unusable in any practical or industrial
      application.<br>
      <br>
      The invention object of this patent, completely remedies these
      drawbacks by making it convenient and extremely economical to
      obtain and use this constant electrostatic force by a new system,
      thus producing a continuous and perfectly regular electrical
      current and whose power allows its practical application and
      industry in a wholly consistent and perfect manner.<br>
      <br>
      The system works automatically and indefinitely, with absolute
      regularity and continuous, with no consumption, and no maintenance
      during the many years necessary for the destruction of the device,
      for normal breakdown caused by time alone.<br>
      <br>
      Static electricity and obtained thereby makes it useful in all
      applications of electricity, for example: medical power, in
      electroculture, operating telephones, electric clocks, recharging
      batteries, etc..<br>
      <br>
      The natural static electricity produced by this system provides
      exceptionally advantageous properties in certain applications
      (unknown properties of the current industrial electricity), for
      example: medical electricity applied to men, applied to animals,
      plants, the results are far superior to all other known
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      Its unique properties also allow in some cases carrying out
      electrical installations extremely economical, e.g. bare wire, no
      insulation, and may be in direct contact with the ground, even
      under water without suffering any loss of this electricity, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the particular characteristics in all household
      applications running, seems to avoid the dangers of electric shock
      and fire, etc..<br>
      <br>
      However, this static electricity, which naturally, as lots of
      devices covered by this patent and revealing the unknown
      properties of new electrical potential, does not hinder its
      industrial application; it is sufficient to convert the
      electricity, if only in passing as batteries, to take immediate
      known properties of common industrial flows, and this only if we
      encounter difficulties in its direct application.<br>
      <br>
      To fully understand the invention, the following description by
      way of example only an application with references to the single
      FIGURE of the accompanying drawing. The single figure shows a
      complete unit with its details, in working order.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 1 shows a portion of the device, consisting
      mainly of an electrostatic capacitor suitable light load seen in
      section; 4 cut valves electrostatic potential for raising the
      load; 4 cup valves brush electrostatic discharge; 5, an outlet to
      use circuit; 6, making a return circuit use; 7, an air sensor, 8,
      a secondary excitation capacitor, 9, a secondary excitation
      capacitor, 10, a frame connecting said condensors 8 and 9, 11, an
      insulator-fixing assembly, 12, a connection to the main condenser
      1, 13, a common device for protection against electrical surges,
      14, automatic discharge surges, ground.<br>
      <br>
      The whole forms a kind of electrostatic pump, placed in an
      atmosphere of electricity, automatically ensures its elevation
      within the natural potential of static electricity, allowing its
      distribution to any proper use and function indefinitely without
      any consumption, no maintenance or mechanical or chemical
      intervention.<br>
      <br>
      The main capacitor 1 is provided with valves brush electrostatic
      charge 3, which soon placed in a static environment, ensure their
      presence by raising the potential of that power and pass the
      burden of that capacitor 1; this electricity can then be
      distributed to any practical use by distributing electricity
      properly established and connected to the plot 5, the return is
      effected by the block 6, a neutralizer-excitation load 2
      Electrostatic valves provided by discharge 4 , ensuring, by their
      presence, the expulsion of the power contained in the neutralizer
      2. These valves are preferably arranged so that the discharge of
      electricity, and insured, and strengthens the return to the main
      charging capacitor 1 through 3 valves, thereby establishing a true
      continuous circuit excitation load.<br>
      <br>
      The atmospheric sensor-tip System 7 directly connects to dependent
      secondary capacitor 8, the latter electrically connected to
      another capacitor excitation 9; the excitation later operates by
      the power supplied directly by the main condenser 1;&nbsp;
      atmospheric electricity is conducted by a main capacitor circuit
      12, provided its path of proper safety devices 13 against surges
      and atmospheric discharges to the ground by conductor 14.<br>
      <br>
      It is understood that one can change the layout of the various
      parts of the object of this invention according to the needs of
      multiple applications in that it allows all areas of applications
      of electricity and that, alternatively, if, for example, where,
      for industrial application or another does not require the special
      qualities of atmospheric electricity, we could refrain from the
      air antenna, the unit would then only charge its own atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      It goes without saying that applications, forms, details,
      materials and dimensions of the present invention may vary without
      compromising principle.<br>

          Perpetual electrostatic force</b><br>
      </div>
      M.me Guillemette Suzanne Sophie (maiden Muller) resident in France
      (Calvados)<br>
      Filed Nov 18, 1936, Paris - Accepted May 24, 1937 - Published Sept
      6, 1937<br>
      <br>
      The universal perpetual electrostatic force has been since long
      time object of every kind of research by several scientists, with
      the goal of being able to master this perpetual static electricity
      contained in the ambient all around. To date, pretty nobody
      accomplished that. Actually, somebody managed to capture a
      relatively infinitesimal, barely controllable amount of
      electricity, still at laboratory level: with a very irregular
      flow, often obtained by extremely prohibitive means, these
      currents usually don't exceed few milliampères, being therefore of
      pretty no usage for any practical or industrial application.<br>
      <br>
      The invention object of this patent completely remedies these
      drawbacks, offering to everybody a practical and extremely cheap
      way to obtain and utilize this perpetual electrostatic force, by
      means of a new method, a kind of electrostatic ram, providing a
      voltage increase of natural static electricity, creating a
      continuous and perfectly regular electrical current whose power
      allows its practical and industrial usage in an absolutely perfect
      and constant way.<br>
      <br>
      This system works automatically and indefinitely, with absolute
      and continuous regularity, without any wear or maintenance
      required, and it will become inoperative only after very many
      years when degraded by natural consumption or weather.<br>
      <br>
      The static electricity thus obtained allows its employment in all
      electricity applications, for example: medical electro-therapy,
      electro-breeding, electro-culture, powering telephones, electric
      pendulums, recharge of accumulators, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The natural static electricity obtained with this system shows
      some exceptionally advantageous properties for certain
      applications (properties not known with usual industrial
      electricity), for example: when applied in medical electro-therapy
      to humans, animals and plants, the results obtained are ways
      superior to any other known applications.<br>
      <br>
      Its exceptional properties also allow in certain situations the
      setup of extremely cheap electrical installations, for example: by
      using bare wire without any insulation, and which can be left in
      contact with ground or water no matter, without suffering any
      loss, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, these peculiar characteristics seem to avoid risks of
      electrocution and fires in all home applications.<br>
      <br>
      However this static electricity, which in its natural state - such
      as when it comes out from the device object of this patent - shows
      said new properties unknown for common electricity, is of no
      obstacle to its industrial application: it's enough to transform
      this electricity, even just sending it to accumulators, for it to
      suddently assume the known properties of common industrial
      current, and that however just in the event one may have troubles
      with its direct usage.<br>
      <br>
      To make understand the invention well, the description follows,
      just as an example, of one embodiment with references made to the
      only included drawing.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the drawing:<br>
      <br>
      -1 shows a part of the apparatus, constituted mostly of a suitable
      electrostatic capacitor, view in cross-section;<br>
      -2 cross-section of a neutralizer/exciter of charge [or: charging
      neutralizer/exciter];<br>
      -3 cross-section of charging electrostatic film valves [original
      term: "valves pelliculaires] for potential elevation;<br>
      -4 cross-section of electrostatic discharging film valves;<br>
      -5 a connection for the utilizing circuit;<br>
      -6 a return connection for the utilizing circuit;<br>
      -7 an atmospheric collector;<br>
      -8 a secondary excitation capacitor;<br>
      -9 a secondary excitation capacitor [yes, same definition: a
      mistake ?];<br>
      -10 an armature [SIC] connecting capacitors 8 and 9;<br>
      -11 an insulating securing piece;<br>
      -12 a connection to main capacitor 1;<br>
      -13 a common protection device against electric surges;<br>
      -14 surge discharge to ground.<br>
      <br>
      The setup forms up a kind of electrostatic ram which, placed
      inside any ambient with some electricity, provides automatically
      and by itself the elevation of the natural potential of static
      electricity, allowing its distribution to every suitable
      application, and works indefinitely without any chemical or
      mechanical process.<br>
      <br>
      The main capacitor 1 is equipped with charging electrostatic film
      valves 3 which, when placed inside an environment of static
      electricity, provide with their presence the elevation of
      potential of said electricity, and let it pass to charge said
      capacitor. This electricity can then be distributed to any
      practical utilizer thru any correctly disposed distribution line
      connected at post 5; the return will be established by post 6 on a
      charge neutralizer/exciter 2, equipped with electrostatic
      discharge valves 4 providing, with their presence, the expulsion
      of electricity stored in the neutralizer 2; these valves
      preferably disposed in such a way that the electric discharging
      thus ensured strengthens up and passes again to charge the main
      capacitor 1, passing thru the valves 3, thus establishing an
      actual continuous circuit for charge excitation.<br>
      <br>
      The atmospheric collector with multiple points 7 charges up
      directly a secondary capacitor 8, this one electrically connected
      to another excitation capacitor 9; excitation of the latter is
      provided by direct supply from main capacitor 1; the atmospheric
      electricity so stimulated [urged, solicited] is brought to said
      main capacitor thru a circuit 12, equipped with suitable safety
      devices 13 against atmospherical surges, which are diverted to
      ground thru conductor 14.<br>
      <br>
      Is it well understood that one may change a bit the disposition of
      the various parts of the system object of present invention,
      depending on needs demanded by the several applications made
      possible by it in every domains of electricity application. For
      example, one variation could be, wherever for some industrial
      application or whatsoever one does not need the peculiar
      properties of atmospheric electricity, he can avoid the aerial
      collector 7; this way the device will only furnish the static
      electricity of its specific environment.<br>
      <br>
      It is intended that applications, shapes, details, materials and
      dimensions of the present invention may be varied without
      affecting its own principle.<br>
      <br>
      Summarizing:<br>
      <br>
      1- Perpetual electrostatic force, embodied as one practical and
      extremely cheap harvesting system, carrying several advantages due
      to exceptional properties of natural static electricity thus
      obtained without any modifications and without any mechanical or
      chemical process; to be employed very cheaply and advantageously
      in every electrical application, for example: electro-medical,
      electro-breeding, powering of telephones, electric clocks,
      recharging of accumulators, etc.<br>
      <br>
      2- The whole forms an apparatus, kind of electrostatic ram which,
      placed inside any electricity environment, ensures automatically
      and by its own the elevation of the natural potential of said
      electricity, creating a powerful and constant electrostatic force,
      allowing practical industrial applications. This system works
      indefinitely and at full performance without any tear, without
      employing any chemical or mechanical process, thru all the several
      years of useful life of the device, until it will eventually fail
      because of natural weather consumption.<br>
      <br>
      3- The main part consists of a capacitor, conveniently equipped
      with charging electrostatic film-valves, the latter made of
      suitable material causing a potential increase of the static
      electricity contained inside their own environment, to allow
      charging of said capacitor [said this way, these "valves"
      definitely suggest some kind of free-working pump or osmotic-like
      membranes...]<br>
      <br>
      4- A charge neutralizer/exciter ["neutralisateur-excitateur de
      charge" equipped with electrostatic discharge film-valves, the
      latter built with suitable material and ensuring the expulsion of
      electricity contained inside the neutralizer/exciter returning
      from the utilizing circuit.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      5- These electrostatic film-valves may also be made
      double-function. For example, one same valve, without any changes
      in shape or material but just in the way it's coupled or mounted,
      may acquire the capability to reverse its behavior, thus providing
      by choice either the elevation of potential or, on the contrary,
      expulsion of electricity; this way, one same valve can be employed
      providing either the capacitor function or, on the contrary, that
      of neutralizer, without any drawback. However, in some
      circumstances one may as well dispose the valves in the way such
      that their behavior is fixed and can't be reversed.<br>
      <br>
      6- The capacitor and the neutralizer/exciter are to be preferably
      mounted interleaved and very closely spaced, but at the same time
      avoiding a short circuit.<br>
      <br>
      7- The charging valves may be of such a size to form capacitors
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      8- The discharging valves may be of such a size to form the
      neutralizer themselves.<br>
      <br>
      9- The distribution of electric current thus obtained will be
      directly or indirectly provided to the utilizer by means of a
      suitable electric circuit, connected to and powered by the main
      capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      10- The return of current from utilizing applications will be
      preferably made thru a suitable electric circuit connected to the
      neutralizer/excitator; the return may also be achieved by any
      other suitable means as well as thru ground dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      11- The special properties inherent with this principle allow to
      build very cheap electrical installations; for example by using
      bare wires, without any insulator and making direct contact with
      ground or passing under water without suffering any electrical
      loss.<br>
      <br>
      12- Possibility to lose the special properties of said currents in
      favor to usual properties of industrial currents, for example
      conducting them thru accumulators.<br>
      <br>
      13- In order to add to natural static electricity the properties
      of atmospheric static electricity, an aerial collector is
      provided, preferably connected to the main capacitor, which will
      in turn power the excitation of said aerial.<br>
      <br>
      14- The aerial collector is preferably composed of at atmospheric
      intake with multiple points secured on top of an atmospheric
      capacitor [??], secured in turn on a suitable armature [SIC]
      having at his opposing side another capacitor, for excitation,
      this one directly connected to the main capacitor, which powers
      its excitation.<br>
      <br>
      15- Along the circuit connecting the atmospheric antenna to the
      main capacitor, common security devices are provided against
      overvoltages, for example an automatic horn-shaped discharger
      [Jacob's ladder], as also one plug for the utilizer circuit [not
      very clear, "ainsi qu'une prise de courant pour le circuit
      d'utilisation" - since I don't assume any power can be withdrawn
      at that point, I suspect she means rather that a ground connection
      to protect the utilizing devices can also be connected to the same
      discharger].<br>
      <br>
      16- It is well intended that the layout of various parts, the
      applications, shapes, details, materials and dimensions indicated
      in this invention may be changed without affecting its principle.<br>
