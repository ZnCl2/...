      <br>
      During the 1950's, a brilliant, inquisitive and highly innovative
      Swedish&nbsp; radiologist and surgeon, Dr. Björn E.W. Nordenström
      (second photo) became interested in streaks, spikes and coronas
      that he saw in X-ray images of lung tumors (third photo, from:
      "Exploring BCEC-Systems," Nordic Medical Publications, Stockholm
      (1998)). When Dr. Nordenström discussed his observations with
      other physicians, many of his colleagues saw nothing.&nbsp; Others
      attributed the phenomena to artifacts in the image.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Nordenström was quite familiar with negative reactions from
      his colleagues. As his accomplishments grew, he became Head of
      Diagnostic Radiology at Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.
      He also authored or co-authored more than 150 publications in
      radiology, electrobiology and pharmacology.&nbsp; He was a member
      of the Nobel Assembly from 1967 through 1986, and served as
      President of the Assembly in 1985.&nbsp; Even with these
      credentials, many of his ideas, such as needle biopsy and balloon
      catheterization were initially met with significant amounts of
      opposition by his peers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      In 1965, Dr. Nordenström began a scientific investigation into the
      subtle anomalies that he observed in lung tumor X-ray images.
      After years of very careful experimentation and analysis, he came
      to the conclusion that the streaks, spikes and coronas that could
      be seen in X-ray radiographs of lung tumors were the result of
      water movement, movement of ions and restructuring of certain
      tissues due to the influence of various electrical and
      electrochemical phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      As his research activities progressed, Dr. Nordenström proposed a
      closed loop, circulatory, self regulating model for healing that
      was much more detailed and complete than conventional wound
      healing models.&nbsp; Dr. Nordenström's model involves various
      Biologically Closed Electric Circuits (BCEC), capable of utilizing
      a number of physiological pathways and influencing structure and
      function for a variety of tissues and organs.&nbsp; In essence, he
      described another circulatory system where continuous energy
      circulation and circulating electrical currents support healing,
      metabolism, growth, regulation, immune response, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Using his BCEC theory, Dr. Nordenström developed electrochemical
      therapy (EChT), a minimally invasive electrotherapeutic technique
      for the treatment of cancer and hemangioma tumors.&nbsp; EChT
      assists the body's normal BCEC electrochemical healing processes
      by complementing and assisting the naturally occurring endogenous
      electric fields and currents that support the process of healing.<br>
      <br>
      EChT povides a low-cost, patient friendly and highly effective
      technique for the treatment of localized tumors.&nbsp; EChT is
      highly complementary and can be administered with other
      therapeutic modalities.&nbsp; EChT does not have the serious side
      effects associated with conventional therapies, and experience has
      shown that EChT does not exhibit a significant therapeutic
      resistance with repeated applications, as is often the case with
      conventional therapies.<br>
      <br>
      An extensive overview of BCEC and EChT (and how they relate to
      wound healing and other electrotherapeutic applications), and the
      more appropriate designation for EChT as NEAT- EChT, can be found
      in the book: "Electrotherapeutic Devices: Principles, Design and
      Applications" (Artech House, Boston, MA (2007)) by IABC Emeritus
      President, Dr. George O'Clock (Also, refer to
      http://www.georgeoclock.readywebsites.com). Dr. O'Clock's October
      23, 2008 University of Minnesota Electrical and Computer
      Engineering (ECE) Colloquia Presentation titled
      "Electrotherapeutic Principles: Applications in Cancer, Wound
      Healing, and Visual System Disease can be viewed at&nbsp;
      http://www.unite.umn.edu. A DVD of this colloquium presentation is
      available from the U of MN ECE Department. Dr. O'Clock appears to
      have written the first scientifically rigorous (yet accessible and
      relatively easy to understand) book on electrotherapeutic devices
      that combines essential technical, biological, legal and clinical
      background with some guidelines for treatment protocols. Two of
      the chapters discuss magnetotherapeutic principles and devices.
      This book was dedicated to Dr. Nordenström.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated in the previous paragraph, Dr. Nordenström's theories
      and clinical results are not confined to cancer. Much of what he
      has done also applies to wound healing and special branches of
      wound healing that are associated with various forms of visual
      disease (macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt's
      disease, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, neuropathy, etc.). The
      results of recent FDA guided and supervised clinical trials that
      have been successfully completed are incorporated into the
      following website: http://acuitymedicalsystems.net. This website

      <b>BIOPHYSICS OF BCEC</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Understanding BCEC requires the use of some high school math and
      physics, along with an appreciation for history.&nbsp; Over 140
      years of research in wound healing has shown that an injury site
      has a positive electric potential with respect to the surrounding
      uninjured tissue.&nbsp; Björn Nordenström has also determined that
      the electric potential at the center of most tumors is positive
      with respect to the normal tissue surrounding the tumor.&nbsp; He
      realized that a wound, or tumor, had a considerable amount of cell
      degradation (lysis) occurring at it's center, making this region
      positively charged and highly acidic.&nbsp; Therefore, in relation
      to the surrounding normal tissue, the wound or tumor site had the
      properties of a wet cell battery, producing a positive potential
      between the center and periphery of the wound or tumor.<br>
      <br>
      The positive electric potential at the center of the wound or
      tumor can produce a current in an electrically conductive
      medium.&nbsp; As the conductivity of the medium increases, the
      electrical resistance, that tends to "impede" or restrict current
      flow (impedance), decreases. <br>
      <br>
      Thomasset provides a picture (first figure, from: Journal of the
      IABC, Vol. 1, January-December, 2002) showing high frequency
      electrical currents flowing through cells, and the lower frequency
      electrical currents flowing within the interstitial fluid around
      various cells.&nbsp; If the source of the electrical potential is
      an injury site or tumor, the resulting current will be more of a
      direct current.&nbsp; In this case, most of the current will flow
      around the cells within the interstitial fluid medium, and the
      impedance will be relatively high.&nbsp; Also, if the electric
      current consists primarily of ions in motion, the size of the ion
      would also be an impedance consideration with respect to it's
      capabilities of traveling through cell membranes, or it's
      limitations if it is restricted to conductive pathways within the
      interstitial fluid medium. <br>
      <br>
      While current is flowing due to the presence of the injury site or
      tumor site potential, other electrically dependant functions are
      being influenced by the electrical potential.&nbsp; Like most
      cells, white blood cells possess a negative surface charge.&nbsp;
      From the standpoint of immune function, the positive potential at
      the center of the injury or tumor tends to assist immunological
      response by attracting white blood cells to that location.&nbsp;
      The electric field produced by the positive potential of the
      central region of the injury site or tumor also has an effect on
      capillary porosity (contraction, which closes the pores of the
      capillary), as indicated by the second figure.<br>
      <br>
      With cancer, as long as the tumor exists, lytic reactions at the
      center of the tumor site will promote the continued existence of
      the positive potential and electric field in the region of the
      tumor.&nbsp; As indicated by the second figure, with the tumor
      acting as a wet cell battery; a conductive path for the flow of a
      variety of ions (including hydrogen and phosphate ions) exists in
      various electrically conductive pathways near the tumor site,
      through interstitial fluids between cells, to porous capillaries,
      to veins and arteries and back to contracted capillaries near the
      tumor. <br>
      <br>
      The primary electrical conduction mechanism is ionic in a large
      part of the the electrically conductive pathway.&nbsp; Electron
      transfer occurs in the membranes of the capillaries that are under
      the influence of electric field induced contraction.&nbsp; Under
      the influence of the positively charged center of the tumor, the
      transport of charged ions and white blood cells continues,
      promoting various activities in the healing process.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in the second figure (from German Journal of Oncology,
      Vol. 33, 2001), a closed-loop circulating current and energy flow
      is accomplished by the transport of charged particles (ions and
      electrons), producing slowly varying electric currents in the
      human body, utilizing various conductive pathways (interstitial
      fluid, blood vessels, nerve fiber, muscle, etc.).&nbsp; The
      healing currents are slowly varying with respect to time
      (essentially, they are direct currents).&nbsp; This fact verifies
      that a Biologically Closed Electric Circuit is involved.&nbsp; A
      biologically open circuit cannot support direct
      current.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      In many of his published papers and books, Dr. Nordenström points
      out that BCEC activities have a profound influence on structure
      and function.&nbsp; The influence of BCEC on function is
      relatively easy to describe.&nbsp; Once the injury site or tumor
      site produces an electric field, immune system function is
      influenced by the attraction of white blood cells.&nbsp; Capillary
      function (porosity reduction due to electric field induced
      contraction) is influenced by the presence of the electric field
      produced by the lytic activity near the center of the site.&nbsp;
      Function is also influenced by the movement of ions to and from
      the injury or tumor site.<br>
      <br>
      Structure can also be influenced by BCEC activity.&nbsp; The photo
      marked "a" (from: Exploring BCEC-Systems, Nordic Medical
      Publications, Stockholm (1998)) shows soft tissue radiograph of
      mammary fat tissue before a 10 V source is applied.&nbsp; Over a
      10 day period, with 10 V and 1.75 mA of current, some endogenously
      developed fibrosis has disappeared (arrows in "a"), while large
      amounts of new fibrous tissue have developed (photo "b").&nbsp; In
      this case, the application of an electric potential, electric
      field and electric current have contributed to a change in the
      internal structure of the soft tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The transport of water by electroosmosis, at the tumor site, can
      influence structure and function.&nbsp; The movement of water
      around various lung tumors contributed to the structural changes
      Dr. Nordenström first noticed in his X-ray radiographs, that
      resulted in his development of BCEC theory (see Home page, third
      photo).&nbsp; As water is drawn away from the tumor by
      electroosmosis, the tumor is deprived of nutrients and liquid, and
      the tumor cells and vascular structure of the water starved region
      begin to deteriorate. <br>
      <br>
      Significant changes in cellular structure can also occur with the
      application of voltages and currents that can occur in BCEC
      systems.&nbsp; Dr. Nordenström shows significant changes in
      mammalian red blood cell morphology with the application of
      currents at the 1 mA level.&nbsp; Becker reported evidence of
      electrically induced dedifferentiation of immature red blood cells
      at current levels that were in the fraction of a nA range.&nbsp;
      O'Clock shows photos of immature red blood cell dedifferentiation
      at 1 µA, where, over a period of time, the red blood cells make
      the transition from concave and spoked, to elliptical in shape and
      finally to a flat amoeboid morphology.&nbsp; O'Clock and Leonard
      also show evidence of necrobiosis and loss of cell aggregation
      properties for lymphoma cells at current levels of 9 µA.<br>
      <br>
      One of the reasons why BCEC theory is so important is that it
      predicts the fast transport times observed with immune system
      response.&nbsp; Conventional chemotaxis models, based on
      diffusion, are much too slow.&nbsp; For example, an estimate of
      the diffusion time (T) that is required for white blood cells to
      travel 0.2 cm. from a capillary to an injury site can be obtained
      from the following diffusion equation:<br>
      <br>
      v = dL/dT = (D/L),<br>
      <br>
      where v represents an instantaneous velocity (that is a function
      of distance) for the white blood cell, L is the distance traveled
      and D is the diffusion constant.&nbsp; This relationship was taken
      from Mombach and Glazier, "Single Cell Motion in Aggregates of
      Embryonic Cells," Physics Review Letters, Vol. 76, 15 April,
      1996.&nbsp; Using a diffusion constant of 1/100,000 cm.cm./sec.
      and a distance of 0.2 cm, the estimated velocity of 0.0001
      cm/sec., from the equation shown above, would result in a
      transport time of 2000 seconds (or, approximately 33 minutes) for
      a cell traveling 0.2 cm. to an injury site.&nbsp; Using the cell
      velocity relationship involving chemotaxis coefficient, and
      attractant gradient, from Farrell, et. al. (Cell Motility and the
      Cytoskeleton, Vol. 16, 1990); the cell's chemotactic velocity is
      even slower.&nbsp; We know the immune system response is much
      faster than the velocities and resulting transport times predicted
      by these particular mathematical relationships involving standard
      diffusion and chemotaxis.&nbsp; Therefore, another
      physiological/immunological model for cell motion in healing and
      regulation is needed, to predict more realistic cell transport
      velocities and transport times.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Björn Nordenström's BCEC theory provides the right mix of
      physiological structure and function to yield a mathematical
      expression that predicts more realistic cell velocities and
      response times for the immune system.&nbsp; Referring to the
      second figure, the lytic activity at the tumor site can produce an
      electric potential of 30 mV over a distance of 1 mm.&nbsp; We can
      assume that the surface charge density of a 20 µm diameter white
      blood cell is approximately - 2 Coulombs per meter squared.&nbsp;
      Combining elecric field theory with fluid mechanics, the following
      BCEC cellular transport relationship can be derived:<br>
      <br>
      F = (Q)(E) = n(v/d)(A),<br>
      <br>
      Where F is the force on the charged cell due to the injury site
      electric field, Q is the product of cell surface charge and cell
      surface area, n is viscosity (approximately 1/1,000&nbsp;
      kg./m-sec. for a body fluid medium), A is the cross sectional area
      of the cell perpendicular to the direction of travel, v is the
      cell velocity and d is the boundary layer thickness for the 20 µm
      diameter cell traveling in a fluid medium (in this case,
      approximately 0.3 µm for laminar flow fluid dynamics).&nbsp;
      Applying these numbers to the BCEC cellular transport equation,
      the resulting velocity (v) of 0.1 cm./sec. allows the white blood
      cell to reach the injury site in approximately 2 sec.&nbsp; This
      transport time is within the range of observed immune system
      response times for tissues and organs, and is much faster (by a
      factor of approximately 1,000) than the transport times predicted
      by chemotaxis models that rely on diffusion and
      physiological/immunological concepts that are more than 150 years
      old.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

          INTO THE BODY OF LIVING BEING</b><br>
        <b> </b><b>CN1042838</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an electrode device for the
      temporary insertion of the organism, mainly for topical treatment
      of the premises or the electrical measurement of the living
      tissue, after the course of treatment or measurement, and then
      pull it out from there.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode device comprises an electrode member, the electrode
      member has a hole leading to the center thereof, can be inserted
      into a living body to be treated or measured tissue; a feeder
      part, and the remaining parts of the body member and electrically
      insulating means, for supply to the electrode member, the feeding
      member is a flexible bendable and comprising at least one cavity.<br>
      <br>
      For example, from the Swedish patent 8002772-5 although already
      known for the treatment of the electrode device in vivo biological
      tissue, but the known biometric before inserting the electrode
      device must be coupled by one or more electrodes on the ring size
      be modified to modify the size of the electrode to extend to the
      desired length.<br>
      <br>
      And, provided on said electrode means known in relatively small
      openings for supply of various agents via its central point of
      treatment cavity, and for example, the reaction was removed from
      the treatment point.<br>
      <br>
      The same aperture and cavity has also been used to treat the point
      of supply and removing agents from the treatment point of the
      reactants.<br>
      <br>
      This situation makes the simultaneous supply and removal difficult
      or impossible, for example in order to provide effective treatment
      at the point of the case of cooling.<br>
      <br>
      Object of the present invention is to provide an electrode device,
      which can be modified to more effectively the desired size, and
      better used in the treatment point, and compared with the prior
      known techniques, to improve the treatment of the electrode device
      drug delivery point and the reaction mass, the effective electrode
      greatly expanded surface.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the above object, the electrode device according to the
      beginning of the article is designed such, i.e. without
      restricting the number of openings leading to the center of the
      electrode member, which openings preferably are evenly distributed
      along the entire electrode part.<br>
      <br>
      From the following description and the drawings, claims, more
      specifically know other advantages and features of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 1 shows the various components in the application or use
        of these components may be used according to the present

      <b> </b>According to the present invention, an electrode member
      including a metal wire (or wire), the wire 3 at its end portion is
      wound spirally, preferably bifilar wound, the wire is preferably
      made of platinum made.<br>
      <br>
      The end of the wire 3a, 3b bent back (apparent from Figure 4).<br>
      <br>
      The wire electrode 2 through the electrically insulating tube, the
      insulating tube may be made for example of Teflon (trade name,
      teflon), the other end of the wire and extending through the
      cavity 4, and a loop is formed at the end portion, the wire 1 and
      the tube 2 are very flexible and can be bent, so the insertion is
      difficult or even impossible organism.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode device for insertion into a living body, a tube may
      be inserted in the tube 27 and extending to the end of the wire
      3a, 3b, for example, the sleeve 7 is constituted by a rigid pipe
      having a pointed end portion of the inclined .<br>
      <br>
      The end of the wire lumen is disposed at a distance into said
      sleeve 7, the situation in Figure 4 is clearly shown.<br>
      <br>
      Further, an apparatus having a screw threaded end portion 5 is
      inserted into the lumen of the sleeve 7 by means of the handle
      means to rotate the screw, so that the end with a threaded end
      portion 3a, 3b combine to make the 7 against the inner wall of the
      sleeve ends, so that the wire electrode 1 at its end 3a, 3b of the
      sleeve 7 is sandwiched between the screw means 5.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the assembled whole becomes a rigid whole, and therefore can
      be inserted to the desired treatment sites in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      When inserted, one end of the wire 3a, 3b in the desired position
      by the in vitro pull-annular end of the electrode wire 4 can point
      in the treatment of an effective length of the electrode member is
      adapted to the required size, leaving the ends 3a, 3b still
      sandwiched as described above, so that the effective length of the
      electrode member can be a good fit to the desired size.<br>
      <br>
      After the completion of the operation, by rotation of the screw
      device 5 to release the end 3a, 3b, let it when loosening the
      screw tip of the screw tip for terminal 3a, 3b from the end of the
      sleeve 7 launch, then, you can remove the screw device 5 and the
      casing 7.<br>
      <br>
      Is now ready for use electrode device, as shown in Figure 2 as
      electricity to treat treatment sites.<br>
      <br>
      From the viewpoint of the electrode seems to be noted that a
      relatively large effective electrode surface, and an electrode
      member and an electrically insulating tube 2 itself is very
      flexible and can be bent, so that they can be adjusted in the
      treatment of point and move around it.<br>
      <br>
      Through the tube 2, various agents can be supplied to the point of
      treatment, or removed from the treatment point, the electrode
      member by an indefinite number of generating an alternating
      openings 1, the openings are located between the bifilar wire
      around the coils.<br>
      <br>
      Required or desired, the electrode apparatus of the present
      invention can be attached, for example a pipe with an extra
      additional Teflon (trade name, teflon) made of a flexible tube 6,
      the additional pipe can be inserted into the inner cavity of the
      tube 2 .<br>
      <br>
      The additional line 6 can preferably be inserted through the tube
      2, and an electrode member into a relatively long distance at a
      position of the projecting member in the center of the electrode
      required, which can be supplied through a conduit 6 such as a
      cooling agent, and reflux can transport between the inner wall of
      the pipe wall 6 of the tube 2, thereby obtaining treatment point
      to point transportation to and from the treatment of an
      essentially lost walking a very effective barrier transport -
      cycling transport.<br>
      <br>
      When the desired use of the electrode is finished, remove the
      additional line 6, and subsequently pulling the loop 4, the
      electrode member an outwardly extended, through the tube 2 without
      damaging surrounding tissue of the living body, and then the tube
      2 out.<br>

          BIOLOGICAL TISSUE FOR SIMULATING PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALING PROCESS</b><br>
        <b> </b><b>CN1042839 </b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a device for supplying electric
      energy to biological tissue, the supply head in order to help
      support a wide variety of physiological processes, including
      healing of some pathological condition, and the variation of the
      different stages of growth, e.g., attenuation of blood flow,
      chronic pain , tissue fluid, etc., is also intended to affect the
      vitality of circumstances such as tumor tissue.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus includes at least two electrodes connected to a DC
      voltage source, wherein one of the electrodes to be placed on
      their physiological and pathological - help support the
      physiological cycle to be a biological tissue or a biological
      tissue, and the other electrode will have to be placed such that
      an biological tissue at a distance from a position such that the
      conductive loop is formed between the two electrodes, the voltage
      source is arranged to supply a current through the electrodes
      through the biological tissue.<br>
      <br>
      In the prior art, we know that the electrode can function as an
      intermediary in the tissue portion to be treated or the outside of
      the biological tissue to a different power supply designs.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of this prior art, the electrode system is connected
      to a specially designed current emitter.<br>
      <br>
      This current emitter, especially known from the Swedish patent
      7812092-0 of the kind which is described as being used to destroy
      the tumor tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Can also be used in high-frequency diathermy electrotherapy high
      power input by radiation to make tissue coagulation.<br>
      <br>
      There are also the well-known methods in applied across the
      electrodes inserted in the stimulation to promote fracture
      healing, and a method of fracture in the external circuit to apply
      a constant or alternating from the Helmholtz electromagnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      To our knowledge, these prior art methods are not to be treated in
      the tissue on the basis of the physiological requirements, and
      those requirements in a number of key areas, is so far not known.<br>
      <br>
      The main object of the present invention is to provide an
      apparatus, a current in this device may be adapted to transmit
      physiological and pathological tissue in response to the change,
      so as to achieve good results.<br>
      <br>
      The manner described for the apparatus used to achieve the above
      object is designed so that, in order to simulate the physiological
      healing process, the amplitude of said voltage source provides an
      alternating current with time, the current<br>
      <br>
      The absolute value of the magnitude of the extrema is smaller than
      the amplitude of the immediately preceding time of the absolute
      extreme values, and induce an alternating current in the process
      described above is repeated several times.<br>
      <br>
      From the following brief description of the drawings and the
      related discussion easier to understand the nature of the
      invention and its various aspects.<br>

      </b>Referring to the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      Current therapy device with different embodiments of the present
      invention depending on the pathological state of the power supply
      required to support a different or altered based on the
      requirements.<br>
      <br>
      These requirements (must be planned in advance before making
      different cure) then can be used in the present invention, in one
      embodiment, can be prepared by different functions into a certain
      program.<br>
      <br>
      By using these functions may be programmed with a wide range of
      the present invention can be applied to several different states,
      such as fracture or wound healing, rheumatoid arthritis, glaucoma,
      treatment of tumor tissue and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In the present inventors have many years of practical experience
      and treatment of cancer patients, based on analysis of the bone
      where the present invention is to help support the healing of
      tissue healing as an example, and this fundamental fracture
      healing seems always in accordance with the present invention The
      main principle is based carried.<br>
      <br>
      According to the main principle in all fractures or other tissue
      injury will produce the natural degradation of the organization,
      the organization will cause the natural degradation of
      electrochemical polarization with respect to its role in the
      damaged tissue surrounding tissue undamaged.<br>
      <br>
      This polarization is positively charged at the beginning, the size
      of the magnitude of a few hundred millivolts, and the polarization
      of the electroluminescent material forming the organization of the
      electrical power transmission system.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventors have recently applied to the main principle
      described in detail immediately below the glass tubes in a patient
      in vivo in animals and in test cases.<br>
      <br>
      The main principle includes some previously unknown facts, such as
      a new feature of blood vessels, the blood vessel wall that is
      higher than the resistivity of the conductive medium (ie, plasma).<br>
      <br>
      Through the capillary vessels with intermediate power transmission
      capacity, the role of the superposition of the electric force
      field, capillary partial contraction.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the formation of ion transport through the capillary
      endothelial cells and the leakage orifice therebetween<br>
      <br>
      Ion channels are blocked, so that ruled out the role of osmotic
      pressure and capillary leak worse on the impact and gravity.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the electric field is superimposed by delivery
      of the first of the globular protein with Peter Mi Xieer (Peter
      Mitchell) in the inner mitochondrial membrane demonstrated, and
      this can indicate the presence of endothelial cell membrane in a
      way to induce electron across the endothelial cell migration.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the electron transfer in the electrode reaction to produce
      the equivalent of the electrophoretic phenomena of biological
      phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the electric power generated in the damaged portion can
      drive ions in the blood vessels and the flow of conductive tissue
      interstitial fluid.<br>
      <br>
      This is the basic principle of the material during the healing
      process induced damage during the transport site.<br>
      <br>
      This system enables the transmission of negative ions in the
      tissue at the injury site stage accumulated positively charged,
      while the positive ion exclusion.<br>
      <br>
      At a later stage, become the site of injury relative to the
      peripheral portion becomes negatively charged, the current
      transmission systems have been identified and a special plan, the
      current transfer reversal process, so the positive ions
      accumulate, ion exclusion lesion.<br>
      <br>
      Characterized in that the loop, close to the surrounding tissue
      according to a use according to the present invention, the
      fluctuation of the potential difference is attenuated.<br>
      <br>
      For healing the injured portion of each organization requires both
      anions need cations, but these ions have to be determined by the
      order of use.<br>
      <br>
      The total amount of current to be transmitted is the key.<br>
      <br>
      This can be calculated in the tissue damage is determined based on
      the size.<br>
      <br>
      Experiment confirmed the total energy released in the injury site
      and can provide energy for the healing of injuries - a direct
      relationship between the amount of current transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Simply put, in the normal healing process, the healing of the
      injury site itself will provide the energy needed for damaged
      parts.<br>
      <br>
      If tissue damage is completely positive in nature, which is
      accumulated only in the anion, and where the cation to be
      rejected.<br>
      <br>
      For natural reasons, the healing process requires both anions need
      cations.<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown in animal experiments, the potential fluctuation
      of the site of injury slowly with time.<br>
      <br>
      Thus for a given site of injury, the transmission of ions bound to
      be affected especially conductive properties of the surrounding
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      In good conductivity, the electrical power to a given site of
      injury may be either positively charged and in the negative phase
      of the stage in a short period sufficient amount of ion transfer,
      i.e. rapidly heal the injury site.<br>
      <br>
      In poor conductivity, these processes requires a longer
      transmission time<br>
      <br>
      Rooms may also need an adjustable current source to help support
      it.<br>
      <br>
      Practical experiments we studied the erosion of the wave pattern
      of fracture healing, the graph shows the polarity, respectively,
      and the electromotive voltage during the healing time of a given
      size at the desired site of injury for transmission.<br>
      <br>
      Determine the size of the lesion site before treatment can be
      non-invasive methods, such as X-ray, X-ray computer tomography and
      magnetic resonance and so on.<br>
      <br>
      Since the release of decay little damage to provide the equivalent
      of a large voltage change injury energy, by means of determining
      the size of the lesion is possible to calculate the amount of the
      ion transfer needed for each stage of healing injuries.<br>
      <br>
      This current can be calculated, and the present invention is
      coupled to the given points of time, or when the current path by
      detecting the actual voltage rise of the invention to enable one
      to make an appropriate stage in a predetermined time period
      sufficient ion transmission level to be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      With the above disclosure as a background, the present invention
      have the following properties.<br>
      <br>
      Is preferably used, but the use of rechargeable power supply can
      be separated from the battery charging, the voltage regulation and
      the use of force to the injury site of the positive and negative
      ions are driven stage and expelled to the fracture section.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, there may be a positive voltage is applied
      satisfactorily to the accumulation of a sufficient amount of anion
      during the time adaptation.<br>
      <br>
      The accumulated value of current required for the calculation of
      near anion in determining beforehand the size of the injury site,
      the level of the current flow time of 0.1 to 10 days, preferably
      about one week, a value close to zero This undesirable after the
      start of the negative electric stage, so that reverse current or
      alternating.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, in a corresponding manner the integration time of the
      programming current is positive.<br>
      <br>
      After that, voltage fluctuations, changing voltages are attenuated
      down until the fracture part of clinical stability so far, in
      other words, until the damage part is basically healed so far.<br>
      <br>
      A voltage source is selected as a suitable example of embodiment
      of the present invention is shown in block diagram in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      This preferably comprises a DC voltage source used to charge a
      battery or AC power supply battery (not shown in detail).<br>
      <br>
      After this charge from the AC power source approach is recommended
      because it avoids interference from AC power, and other risks
      transient voltage DC voltage source.<br>
      <br>
      By the DC voltage source comprises a crystal controlled clock a
      two appropriate, is provided to control the clock<br>
      <br>
      The design of the treatment process.<br>
      <br>
      The measured real-time clock display at the appropriate one type
      of the display 3.<br>
      <br>
      At the middle of a clock, for example, through a relay (not shown
      in detail), the two current generators acting on the reed switch 6
      4 and 5 on the work to increase or decrease the connection to the
      patient from the two contacts 7 and 8 generates a current, the
      current through the tissue portion to be treated by surgical
      implantation technique of the electrodes (not shown) to be
      supplied to help support the physiological cycle of the biological
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      As a supplementary means of a crystal controlled clock or an
      alternative, of course, process control equipment may be provided
      (not shown) for the program used, so that by means of the devices
      can be previously obtained empirical data, and the treatment of
      such limits For the current time, voltage, current, or found
      during the values ??detected in an appropriate manner to the
      current generator 6 generates intervals, the degree of change of
      the initial value generating effect.<br>
      <br>
      This means in particular that can be more rapidly detected result
      of the healing process, thereby substantially accurately determine
      when the phase of the introduction of the case by changing the
      current of the healing process.<br>
      <br>
      DC voltage source further comprises a continuous or transient
      current from the generator 10 reads seized by the switching device
      6, and displayed on the display 3 of the actual voltage and
      current of the instrument.<br>
      <br>
      Charging meter 11 is continuously connected to the current
      generator 6 and its value is displayed on the display 3.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the charge meter 11 is necessary because, as
      mentioned above, the amount of charge to be supplied by the
      damaged tissue is directly related to the size of the injury
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      After a sufficient amount of current applied to the treatment site
      charging the power supply can be manually reduced to zero.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the use of a programming device, the charge
      amount can be programmed with the amount of charge applied
      contacts 7 and 8 are compared, when these values ??are equal, the
      current is reduced to zero, and / or from the current generator 6
      Automatic alternating power supply.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it should be appreciated that, as a supplement or

      supply from the biological tissue using implanted electrodes to
      detect the direction of current physiological healing process, and
      a current is emitted by the current generator 6 direction to adapt
      to the current direction.<br>

      Typically, however, the most appropriate is the beginning
      corresponds to the natural healing process from the outset with<br>
      <br>
      Damaged tissue sent to the current table to begin treatment.<br>
      <br>
      By increasing the current, respectively, via a relay control clock
      1 issued by the current generator 6 and the reduction in time can
      control the current to gradually increase and decrease, it is of
      course by means of appropriate means so that the current is
      continuously increased and decreased .<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 illustrates the current generator 6 by the contacts 7 and
      8 are added to the ends of the voltage curve as a function of
      time, because (in the resistivity of the biological tissue under
      relatively constant conditions) compared to the corresponding
      current change is substantially, easy to control the voltage
      comparator.<br>
      <br>
      Here the time axis T in FIG comprising about 3 to 4 weeks of the
      time, and can be clearly seen from the graph, the time interval
      and the end of the curve damped asymptotically tend to zero.<br>
      <br>
      The initial current is applied to the first maximum of a few
      seconds, the longest takes a few minutes, on the other hand, the
      maximum value to zero by the change is gradual or continuous,
      which lasted from 0.1 to 2 days, up to 7 ~ 10 days, and then
      continue to change the current to the negative maximum and then
      back to zero, the time required for this section is substantially
      the same as described above, i.e., (when the current or voltage is
      typically, but not necessarily so not, zero) two alternating with
      each successive distance between points is about seven days.<br>

      This invention relates to an electrode device intended to be

      Swedish Patent No. 8002772-5 discloses a prior art electrode
      device for treatment of biological tissues inside a living being.
      This known electrode device must--before introduction into the
      body--be adapted in size by adding one or more electrode rings in
      order to adapt the extension of the electrode to the size
      required.<br>
      <br>
      The known electrode device of Swedish Patent No. 8002772-5 is,
      furthermore, provided with relatively small openings for supply of
      various agents via its central channel to the point of treatment
      and for removal of, for example, reaction products from the point
      of treatment. These openings and the central channel are also
      utilized for supply to as well as removal from the point of
      treatment. This makes a simultaneous supply and removal difficult
      or impossible to perform, for example in order to provide
      efficient cooling of the point of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide an electrode
      device which is more efficiently adaptable to the size required,
      preferably in situ at the point of treatment, and which electrode
      device provides improved transportation to and from the point of
      treatment and provides an enlarged effective electrode surface
      compared to previously known techniques.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As seen in FIG. 1, the electrode part 1 according to the present
      invention includes one wire which at one end 3a, 3b thereof
      preferably is bifilar wound. The wire of electrode 1 is preferably
      made of platinum. The distal ends 3a, 3b of the wire are bent
      backwards, as is best shown in FIG. 4. The electrode wire runs
      through an electrically insulated tube 2, made of Teflon (trade
      name), for example, and the other end 4 of the wire runs through
      and projects out of the tube 2 and is terminated by a loop. The
      wire 1 as well as the tube 2 are very flexible and can be bent.
      Thus, they are difficult or impossible to introduce into a living
      being.<br>
      <br>
      In order to perform introduction of the electrode device into a
      living being, a cannula 7 comprising, for example, a stiff steel
      tube with an obliquely bevelled tip is inserted into the tube 2
      and extends to the distal ends 3a, 3b of said wire, as seen in
      FIG. 4. The distal ends 3a, 3b of the wire are arranged so as to
      extend into the channel of said cannula 7 by a certain distance,
      as is best seen in FIG. 4. Furthermore, a screw means 5 having a
      threaded tip (see FIGS. 1 and 4) is introduced into the channel of
      said cannula 7 and is turned by means of its handle 8 such that
      the threaded tip cooperates with said distal ends against the
      inner wall of said cannula 7, whereby the electrode wire 1 is
      clamped at the distal ends 3a, 3b thereof in relation to the
      cannula 7 as well as to the screw means 5.<br>
      <br>
      The assembled unit as described above has become a stiff unit due
      to the insertion of cannula 7 and screw means 5, and can, thus, be
      inserted into a living being to the desired point of treatment.
      When introduced into the living body, the distal ends 3a, 3b of
      the wire 1 are located at the desired position and the effective
      length of the electrode part 1 at the point of treatment is
      adapted to the desired size by pulling the loop-shaped end 4 of
      the electrode wire outside said living body while the distal ends
      3a, 3b are still clamped as specified above. The effective
      electrode part 1 is, thus, exactly adapted in length to the size
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      When the above described manipulation has been performed, the
      screw means 5 can be removed to free the distal ends 3a, 3b by
      unscrewing said screw means 5. When the screw needle end of screw
      means 5 is free, the screw needle end is used for pushing out the
      ends 3a, 3b from the tip of said cannula 7. The screw means 5 can,
      then, be removed as well as the cannula 7.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode device is now ready to be used, for example, for
      treatment of the point of treatment with electricity as indicated
      in FIG. 2. From the point of view of the electrode, the
      comparatively very large effective electrode surface is to be
      noted. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the electrode part 1 in
      itself as well as the electrically insulatng tube 2 are very
      flexible and pliable and they, thereby, adjust themselves to
      movements in and around the point of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Through the tube 2, various agents can be supplied to and removed
      from the point of treatment. Moreover, communication is taking
      place via an infinite number of openings 9 (see FIG. 4)
      distributed around the electrode part 1. As seen in FIG. 4, a
      continuous opening 9 is provided, which extends around the device
      along the length of the electrode part 1, which continuous opening
      9 is located between the turns of the bifilar wound wire.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode device according to the present invention can--if so
      desired or required--be supplemented with an extra additional tube
      or channel 6 (see FIGS. 1 and 3) in the shape of a flexible tube
      made from, for example, Telfon (trade name), which additional tube
      or channel 6 is inserted into the channel of said insulating
      flexible tube 2. Said additional tube or channel 6 can preferably
      be introduced throughout the whole length of tube 2 and also over
      a long distance into the electrode part 1, whereby a supply of,
      for example, cooling agents can be performed through said tube 6
      and return transportation can be carried out between the outer
      wall of said tube 6 and the inner wall of said tube 2. In this
      manner, a very effective mode of transportation--a circulating
      transportation--is obtained to and from the point of treatment
      without any essential obstacles.<br>
      <br>
      When the desired use of the electrode device is completed, the
      extra channel 6 is firstly removed, whereafter the loop 4 is
      pulled so that the electrode part 1 is straightened out towards
      the tube 2 without damaging surrounding tissues, whereafter the
      tube 2 with the electrode part 1 therein is removed by pulling it
      out.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an apparatus for supplying
      electric energy to biological tissue with a view to supporting
      different physiological processes, including various phases of
      healing, growth, modification of pathological states, for example
      deterioration in blood flow, chronic pain, fluid accumulation in
      tissue etc., and similarly with the view to influencing viability
      conditions of, for instance, tumour tissue, the apparatus
      essentially comprising at least two electrodes connected to a D.C.
      voltage source, of which one electrode is intended to be disposed
      in or on the bio-tissue which is to be supported in its
      physiological or patho-physiological cycle, and the other
      electrode is intended to be disposed in spaced-apart relationship
      from the biological tissue in such a position that electrically
      conductive circuits exist between said electrodes, the voltage
      source being arranged, via said electrodes, to supply current
      through the biotissue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is previously known in this art that power may be supplied to
      biological tissue by the intermediary of electrodes of different
      designs, in or outside that tissue portion which is to be treated.
      In this prior-art case, the electrodes are connected to a
      specially designed current emitter. This current emitter, known
      int. al. from Swedish patent No. 7812092-0 (corresponding to U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,289,135), is described as being employed for
      destruction of tumour tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Diathermy instrumentation may also be employed with great power
      input at high frequencies for obtaining tissue coagulation by
      heat.<br>
      <br>
      Methods are also known for so-called stimulation of fracture
      healing across implanted electrodes, as well as the application of
      electromagnetic, constant or variable fields from Helmholt's loops
      outside fractures. These prior-art methods have, as far as is
      known, not been based on the physiological requirements of tissue
      for healing, which, in crucial aspects, have hitherto been
      unknown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The primary object of the present invention is to propose an
      apparatus, by means of which the current emission may be adapted
      to the varying physiological and pathological reaction conditions
      of the tissue for attaining a good treatment result.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus as described by way of introduction--for attaining
      the above-indicated object--has been designed such that the
      above-mentioned voltage source, for simulating the physiological
      healing process, supplies a current whose amplitude value
      alternates with time, that each maximum amplitude value is lower
      in absolute terms than the amplitude value immediately preceding
      in time, and that the above-mentioned alternation of the current
      is caused to be effected a plurality of times.<br>

      The nature of the present invention and its aspects will be more

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Referring to the Drawings, the embodiment of the present invention
      is based--as opposed to existing treatment apparatuses-- on the
      varying requirements of support or modification of electric power
      supply as required in different pathological states. These
      requirements, which must be plotted before different treatments,
      may then be employed in the present invention, which, in one
      embodiment, may be programmed for different functions. By giving
      these functions a wide programming possibility, the present
      invention may be utilized for several states, for example fracture
      or wound healing, rheumatic arthritis, glaucoma, healing of tumour
      tissue etc.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention, which is based on the inventor's many
      years' practical experiments and treatment of patients suffering
      from cancer, may cite fracture healing as a prototype for the
      support of tissue healing, which, fundamentally, always appears to
      take place according to the major principle on which the present
      invention is based.<br>
      <br>
      According to this major principle, there will occur in each
      fracture or other tissue damage, a spontaneous degradation of
      tissue which gives rise to electrochemical polarization of the
      damaged tissue in relation to its undamaged surroundings. This
      polarization is initially electropositive of the order of
      magnitude of a few hundred millivolts and constitutes the
      electromotoric power in an electrogenic transport system for
      tissue material. This major principle has recently been employed
      by the inventor in the case described in detail and experimentally
      tested in vitro, in vivo on animals and in vivo on human patients.<br>
      <br>
      This major principle includes new, previously unknown facts, for
      example a new function of the blood vessels, whose walls have a
      high degree of resistivity in relation to the conductive media,
      namely blood plasma. The blood vessels have an electric
      transmission by the intermediary of the blood capillaries, which
      contract segmentally under the action of the superposed
      electromotoric field. Hereby, ion transports are shut in ion
      channels through the endothel cells of the blood capillaries and
      the leaking stomata therebetween. Hence, influence by diffusion,
      pressure differences and differences in osmotic pressure across
      the capillaries and the effect of gravitation will be excluded.
      The superposed electric gradient can, on the other hand, induce
      electron transfer across the endothel cells via globular proteins
      in a manner which was first demonstrated by Peter Mitchell in
      inner mitochondria membranes and is here shown to be present in
      the membranes of the endothel cells. There will thereby be
      obtained, on electron transfers, a biological equivalent to the
      electrode reactions in electrophoresis. As a result, the
      electromotoric power which is generated in the injury can drive
      ions in the blood vessels and in the interstitial, conductive
      tissue liquid. This is the basis of the material transport which
      is induced by the injury on healing.<br>
      <br>
      This transport system permits accumulation of electronegative ions
      and repulsion of electropositive ions during the electropositive
      phase of the tissue damage. In a later phase, the damage converts
      to becoming electronegative in relation to its surroundings. In
      the particular current transport system which has been identified
      and plotted, the current transport reverts, therefore, so that
      electropositive ions are accumulated and electronegative ions are
      repulsed from the damage. This cycle is characterized by a
      fluctuating, attenuating potential difference to the immediate
      surroundings which may be utilized according to the present
      invention. Every tissue injury requires, for its healing, both
      anions and cations, but these must be employed in determined
      sequences. The total current transport is of crucial importance.
      This is calculated on the basis of determination of the size of
      the tissue damage. A direct relationship has been demonstrated
      between the total quantity of energy which is released in an
      injury and the quantity of current transport this energy can
      deliver for healing the damage. In simple terms, the injury itself
      will, in a normal healing process, deliver that energy which is
      required for healing the damage.<br>
      <br>
      If the tissue damage were solely electropositive, only anions
      would be accumulated therein, while cations would be repulsed
      thence. For natural reasons, both anions and cations are needed in
      the healing process. In animal experiments, it has been
      demonstrated that the damage potential slowly fluctuates with
      time. For a given injury, the ion transports must, therefore, be
      influenced, int. al., by the conductive properties of surrounding
      tissue. In good conductivity, a given electromotoric force may, in
      a short time, transport a sufficient quantity of ions both during
      the positive and the negative phase of the injury, i.e. rapidly
      heal the injury. In poor conductivity, these transports take
      longer time and may need to be supported by a variable current
      source. An applicable fluctuation pattern in fracture healing has
      been studied experimentally on rodent fractures, this pattern
      giving polarity, voltage and current force, respectively, for the
      transports during the requisite healing time for an injury of a
      given size.<br>
      <br>
      None-invasive methods, for example X-ray, computer tomography and
      magnetic resonance may be utilized for determining the size of the
      injury before treatment. Since the degradation of a small injury
      releases energy which gives voltage changes equivalent to a large
      injury, it is possible, by means of size determination, to
      calculate the quantity of ion transport in the different phases
      which is required for healing the injury. This may be effected by
      either calculating and adapting the current time integral the
      invention is to give or by sensing the actual current passage of
      the invention and allowing the voltage to rise to a level which
      permits adequate transport of ions in suitable phases during a
      predetermined time.<br>
      <br>
      With the above disclosures as a background, the present invention
      enjoys the following properties. Using an electric battery which
      is preferably rechargeable but is separable during use from the
      mains power supply, varying voltage and current force can drive
      ions to and from the fracture with the application of both
      electropositive and electronegative phase of the injury. In one
      embodiment, there is a possibility of applying a satisfactorily
      positive voltage in order, during a reasonable time, to accumulate
      a sufficient quantity of anions. On approaching the calculated
      current figure for anion accumulation, after the preceding
      determination of the size of the injury, the current through-flow
      levels out towards the zero value during a time of from 0.1 to 10
      days, preferably approximately one week, whereafter the desired
      negative phase commences for inverting or alternation of the
      current. By such means, the flow time integral will be programmed
      in a corresponding manner to the positive. Thereafter, the voltage
      fluctuations, the varying voltage, are attenuated, until clinical
      stability is achieved in the fracture, in other words until the
      injury is substantially healed.<br>
      <br>
      A voltage source selected by way of example as being suited for
      reducing the present invention into practice is illustrated in the
      block diagram according to FIG. 1. This D.C. voltage source
      preferably includes a block 12 which generally designates mains
      chargeable accumulators or batteries (not shown in detail on the
      drawing). This disconnection from the mains is to be preferred in
      order to avoid the risk that disturbances, transient voltages etc.
      deriving from the mains power affect the D.C. voltage source.<br>
      <br>
      The D.C. voltage source includes a clock 1 suitably controlled by
      a crystal 2, the clock being arranged to control the process. The
      real time measured by the clock 1 is shown on a display 3 of
      suitable type. The clock 1 operates, by the intermediary of, for
      example, a relay (not shown in detail), two tongues 4 and 5 for
      acting on a current generator 6 to increase or reduce the current
      emitted from two patient connections 7 and 8, the current being,
      by the intermediary of electrodes (not shown on the Drawings),
      surgically implanted into the tissue portions which are to be
      treated, supplied to the biological tissue whose physiological
      cycle is to be supported.<br>
      <br>
      As a complement or alternative to the crystal-controlled clock 1,
      equipment (not shown) for controlling the process may naturally be
      provided for programming, by means of which previously obtained
      experience values, limits etc.--as well as values revealed or
      sensed from the treatment--may be caused to act upon the initial
      values generated from the current generator 6 in respect of
      current, voltage, time alternation of current, degree of
      modification etc., in an appropriate manner. This refers in
      particular to those cases where it is possible relatively
      instantaneously to sense the result of the healing process and
      thereby establish more or less exactly when the next phase in the
      healing process is to be introduced by alternation of the current.<br>
      <br>
      The D.C. voltage source further includes a meter 9 for
      continuously or instantaneously reading off the actual voltage and
      current which are retrieved by the intermediary of a switch device
      10 from the current generator 6 and are shown on the display 3. A
      charging meter 11 is continuously connected to the current
      generator 6 and its value is also shown on the display 3. This
      charging meter 11 is, in this context, essential, since--as was
      mentioned above--the volume of charge which is to be supplied to
      damaged tissue is directly related to the volume of the injury
      itself. By manual means, the current supply is reduced to zero
      when sufficient charging volume has been supplied to the treatment
      site. If--on the other hand--equipment for programming is
      employed, a preprogrammed charging volume may be compared with the
      charging volume supplied to the connections 7 and 8, and when
      these values are equal, the current is reduced to zero and/or the
      current supply is alternated automatically from the current
      generator 6.<br>
      <br>
      As a complement or alternative, it is further conceivable--before
      the current supply from the current generator is commenced--to
      utilize the electrodes implanted in the biological tissue for
      sensing the current direction of the physiological healing process
      and adapt the emission current direction generated from the
      current generator 6 in response thereto.<br>
      <br>
      However, as a rule, it is most appropriate to commence the
      treatment from the beginning, corresponding to the onset of a
      natural healing process, with the current directed from the
      injured tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Through the above-mentioned increase and decrease, respectively,
      of the current from the current generator 6 controlled by the
      clock 1 via relays, there will be obtained a time-controlled
      stepwise increase and reduction of the current, but, naturally, it
      is also possible to continually increase and reduce the current by
      suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the potential which is impressed by the current
      generator 6 across the connections 7 and 8 as a function of time,
      since the voltage is simpler to follow than the essentially
      corresponding variations of the current (in reasonably constant
      resistivity of the biological tissue). The time axis T in the
      diagram here embraces approx. 3-4 weeks and--as will be apparent
      from the curve--is damped asymptotically towards zero at the end
      of this time interval. The initial current application up to the
      first maximum takes place within a few seconds up to a few
      minutes, while, on the other hand, the change thence to zero takes
      place stepwise or continually for a long time from 0.1 to 2 days
      up to 7-10 days and continued alternation of the current to the
      negative maximum and then further to zero takes place within
      approximately the same time interval as above, i.e. the distance
      between two mutually subsequent alternation points (when the
      current or voltage is, as a rule, but not necessarily, zero), is
      approx. 7 days. The current to the electrode connections 7 and 8
      hence alternates extremely slowly. After 3-4 alternations of the
      current direction, healing will have essentially taken place, on
      condition that the total volume of charge which is supplied to the
      tissue substantially corresponds to the volume of the damage.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention should not be considered as restricted to
      that described above and shown on the drawings, many modifications
      being conceivable without departing from the spirit and scope of
      the appended claims.<br>

      An electrode device for treatment of biological tissue comprising
      an electrode unit (1, 3, 3') and a supply unit (4) electrically
      insulated against the surrounds for sup ply of electricity from a
      voltage source to the said electrode unit (1, 3, 3'). The supply
      unit (4) is designed pliable and contains at least one duct for
      one or a plurality of electrical conductors (5-7) and for
      transport and guidance of aids (12-15, etc.) to and from the
      electrode unit (1, 3, 3').<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an electrode device intended to be
      temporarily inserted into the body of a living being and
      essentially locally to treat biological body tissue therein and
      subsequently, 5 upon completion of the treatment, to be removed,
      the said device incorporating an electrode unit introducable into
      the body tissue which it is intended to treat and a supply unit
      electrically insulated against other parts of the body for the
      supply of electricity from a voltage source to the said electrode
      unit. [deg.] Various electrodes are already known, for example
      through the U.S. patents 4 103 690 and 3 348 548 and through the
      German patents 577 722, 651 428 and 1 143 937.<br>
      <br>
      Known electrode designs for the treatment of biological tissue are
      unsuitable for several reasons.<br>
      <br>
      In order, for example, to treat a tumour with direct current, the
      electrode which is to be inserted in the tumour and which is
      arranged to electrically interact with a s&lt;'&gt;econdary
      electrode which is located outside the tumour must be localized
      with great precision in the centre of the tumour. With prior art
      electrodes, it is very difficult to achieve exact positioning and
      retention of the electrode in the tumour. One of the reasons for
      this is that the tissue and the tumour may move, for instance as a
      consequence of the respiratory motions of the patient. Moreover,
      the tumour, where the point of the electrode reaches to and is to
      be inserted into the tumour, may slide aside in surrounding softer
      tissue. This means that repeated attempts frequently have to be
      made in order for an acceptable positioning of the tumour to be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Severe problems in the treatment of tissues also arise as a
      con[not] sequence of gas formation, dehydration and/or material
      deposition on -' the surfaces of the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      One of the objects of the present invention is to provide an
      electrode device which permits certain and exact insertion and
      re[not] tention as well as removal of the active electrode unit in
      a bio[not] logical tissue without being moved out of position, for
      example in a tumour. A further object of the invention is to
      provide an electrode device with the aid of which gases generated
      at the surfaces of t electrode can be sucked out and liquid and/or
      medication can supplied to the tumour.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects are obtained at the electrode device
      specified in the descriptive preamble according to the present
      invention in that said device is given the features as are evident
      fr the characterizing clause of the accompanying Claim 1.<br>
      <br>
      Other essential features of the present invention are evident fr
      the accompanying claims. One embodiment of the invention is
      described below and with reference to the accompanying drawings,
      wherein Fig. shows a cut-away view of an example of an embodiment
      of the electro device according to the invention, Fig. 2 shows a
      first stage in t introduction of the electrode device in the
      direction towards tumour, Fig. 3 shows the introduction of an aid,
      for example an anchoring device, in the tumour, Fig. 4 shows the
      electrode devi inserted _ with the &lt;'&gt;aid of the anchoring
      device an'd a stiffeni member, for example a cannula, and Fig. 5
      shows the electrode devi with the anchoring device and cannula
      removed. According to Fig. the electrode device is in the
      treatment position in the tumour and three-way cock is connected
      to the supply unit for extraction of g and/or introduction of
      liquid or medication.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of the electrode device shown in Fig. 1 compris an
      electrode unit, manufactured for example of platinum and having
      front section 1 with a pointed or narrowing cylindrical end 2 and
      one or more rear cylindrical rings 3, 3'. These parts have a
      diameter approx. 1.9 mm. The electrode unit is shown here to
      consist of thr parts to illustrate that electrode units with
      different axial lengt for tissue areas of different sizes can be
      built up from standardized front section 1 and auxiliary rings 3,
      3&lt;1&gt; since a large electrode surface is- required in order
      to enable sufficiently lar current intensities to pass through the
      tissu "e area to be treat within reasonable time.<br>
      <br>
      The front section 1 of the electrode unit, which obviously can
      used v/ithout auxiliary rings 3, 3', if for example a cancer tumor
      which is to be treated is of such a size that the length of the pa
      1 is sufficient, is attached by pressure to one end section of
      supply unit 4 which in this case consists of a tube 4. This tube 4
      is made pliable in order to be able to accompany movements in
      tissues and may be made for example of the plastic marketed under
      the trade mark Teflon. The rear rings 3 and 3' respectively are
      similarly attached by pressure to the tube 4. Attached to the
      inside of the cylindrical electrode section 1 are one or more
      electrical conductors 5, 6, 7, which are for example brazed or
      soldered. In the shown example, the conductors are three in
      number. The conductors 5-7 which in the same way as the electrode
      rings 1, 3, 3' are bright (blank) and thus uninsulated in the
      shown embodiment, are clamped between the cylindrical inner
      surfaces of the parts 3, 3' and the cylindrical jacket surface of
      the tube 4. By this means, good electrical contact is afforded
      between the electrical conductors 5-7 and the rings 3, 3'. The
      three conductors 5-7 are inserted into the interior of the tube 4
      through a hole sited within the region for the ring 3', and are
      introduced via the interior of the tube 4 to, for example, one
      terminal 8, in the shown embodiment the positive terminal, of a
      direct voltage source 9. The second terminal of the latter is in
      this case connected to a second electrode 10 which is located at a
      suitable distance from the tube in a conductive medium in the
      body.<br>
      <br>
      We have thus been able to show that the walls of the blood vessels
      function as insulators around a conductive medium - the blood
      plasma. Since a tumour is supplied by the surrounding blood
      vessels, a closed electrical circuit is obtained by this means,
      with the blood vessels acting as mutually parallel electric
      conductors. Other conductive media in the body may nevertheless be
      used, for example tissue fluid, brain fluid, gall fluid, urine,
      gland secretion, etc.<br>
      <br>
      When an electrode which is inserted in a tumour acts as a positive
      electrode, a powerful emission of protones is obtained upon
      decomposition of water, resulting in the tissue becoming highly
      acidic and in destruction of the tumour close to the electrode.
      Tumour cells possess negative surplus charges and are therefore
      retained by the positive electrode. At the same time, gas - for
      example chlorine gas and oxygen gas - is generated at the positive
      electrode and the gases deposit themselves on the surface of the
      electrode, thus impeding the process. Further biological effects
      in the electrical field have been revealed and consist of
      electro-osmosis, electroforetic transport accumulation of white
      blood corpuscles around the anode and extend formation of blood
      clots in the capillaries around the anode, a factors contributing
      to the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      If medications such as cytostatics or antibiotics are desired in
      high local concentration within a treatment area, such medicatio
      can be attracted towards the electrical field of an electrode if t
      medication is imparted an electrical polarity which permits
      electrophoretic attraction towards the electrode concerned. In
      this case, the medication can be administered in supply ducts,
      such blood paths, gland paths, etc. By means of the present
      invention, t medication can also be administered via the electrode
      duct. If t same polarity is given to the electrode as to the
      medication, this repelled in the tissue. If the opposite polarity
      is applied, the medication is retained in the vicinity of the
      electrode.<br>
      <br>
      The tube 4 has an inner cylindrical duct which is largely equal as
      large as . the cylindrical duct 11 in the front section of t
      electrode unit 1. By giving a lug 23 for the end of the tube 4,
      slightly greater extent in the direction towards the centre than
      the corresponding to the wall thickness of the tube 4 in itself,
      additional lug is obtained against which a cylindrical body or ba
      (not shown) connected with a stiff but pliable thin wire can
      inserted in the tube 4 and act as a seal to close the opening in t
      end of the electrode unit 1 if necessary. A cannula with a
      diameter of approx. 1 mm may be introduced through the tube and
      through the duct 11. The said cannula is provided with, for
      example, an oblique ground off tip 13. The cannula 12 can be
      inserted into the position shown in Fig. 1, i.e. to a position
      beyond the end 2 of the electrode unit 1 and after insertion in
      the tissue together with the electro unit will form a guide device
      for the electrode unit 1, 3. While t cannula 12 is being inserted
      in a tumour, it is possibly rotated around its longitudinal axis.
      A wire shaped anchoring device 14, 1 which in the embodiment
      example has a screw-shaped end section which is terminated with a
      sharp point 15 is introducable into t cannula 12. The end of the
      anchoring device may instead be provided with other suitable means
      for improving the anchoring in a increasing the contact are
      against the tumour, for instance with hooks or barbs.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative or a complement, the shell surface of the
      cannula 12 and/or the electrode unit 1 may be screw-shaped to
      facilitate introduction into and increase the contact surface
      against the tumour.<br>
      <br>
      The anchoring device, designated by reference numeral 16 in Figs.
      1 and 3, extends throughout the entire cannula 12 and some way
      beyond the end of the cannula facing away from the tip 13 and is
      provided with a knob 17 by means of which the screw-shaped end
      section 14 can be rotated. The electrical conductors 5-7 emanate
      through a connector 18, for example in the form of a screw socket.
      In this position of the cannula socket 19 - see Fig. 2 - the
      cannula 12 is entirely inserted in the tube 4 and in the electrode
      unit 1 and protrudes beyond the electrode unit 1.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2-5 illustrate various stages in application of the electrode
      unit' into a tumour 20 which is surrounded by body tissue 21.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2 shows how the electrode device has been passed through the
      body tissue 21 as far as the tumour 20 and the cannula 12 is here
      in its fully inserted position, whereupon the cannula socket 19
      rests against the screw socket 18. When the tip of the cannula 12
      has reached as far as the tumour 20, the anchoring device 16 will
      be in such a position that its screw-shaped end 14 lies entirely
      retracted in the cannula 12. In the next stage, the anchoring
      device 16 is anchored by means of its tip 14, which may, for
      example, be screw-shaped, in the tumour 20. For this purpose, the
      tube &lt;'&gt;4 and the cannula 12 are retained in the position
      shown in Fig. 2 and the knob 17 - see Fig. 3 - is turned in the
      entry direction of the screw-shaped tip 14 under light axial
      pressure. The tip 15 of the crew 14 first reaches the occasionally
      relatively hard tumour tissue and easily penetrates the surface of
      the rumour without essentially disturbing the 'position of the
      tumour 20. As the knob 17 continues to be turned, the screw 14 is
      drilled into the tumour 20, forming a reliable anchorage for the
      entire electrode device - see Fig. 3. When the screw has reached
      its intended position in the tumour 20 - something which in
      certain cases may require repeated attempts - which position may,
      for example, checked by X-ray fluoroscopy, the cannula socket 19
      is passed inwar in the direction towards the tumour 20, whereby
      the cannula 12 a the electrode section 1 are moved in over the
      screw 14 and the tumour cells in the threads of the latter - see
      Fig. 4. In th position, the anchoring device 16 serves as a
      guiding device for t cannula 12 and thus for the electrode unit,
      the cannula 12 also being rotatable during the movement in order
      to facilitate insertion. T electrode unit 1, 3, 3' is moved into
      the tumour 20 together with t cannula 12 and the cannula 12 serves
      during this movement as support for the pliable supply unit 4 (the
      tube) and when t electrode unit 1, 3, 3&lt;1&gt; attached to the
      tube 4 reaches the intend position in the tumour 20, both the
      cannula 12 and the anchori device 16 are withdrawn from the front
      section 1 of the electrode a out of the tube with accompanying
      tumour material, which may used to advantage for cytological
      check.<br>
      <br>
      The anchoring device 16 - either threaded or unthreaded - may
      certain cases be used as a. temporary electrode for local
      destruction of tissue around the anchoring device 16. In this
      case, the device for example provided with a thin coating of
      electrical insulation for example the plastic marketed under the
      trade mark Teflon, with the exception of the portion which is
      intended to be inserted in the tumour. The anchoring device is
      then connected either to suitably sited electrode for direct
      current treatment or to a large plate electrode applied to the
      surface of the body for application high frequency alternating
      current. When heat develops around the non-isolated part of the
      anchoring device in the tumour, local tissue destruction is
      accomplished which has a therapeutical effect an gives a
      lengthwise extending tissue cavity, into which, for example the
      cannula 12 and the electrode unit 1, 3, 3' can thus be more easily
      inserted.<br>
      <br>
      At this juncture, a cock 22 can now be inserted, as shown in Fig
      5, to the connector unit or the screw socket 18 in order to mak
      possible, for example, the introduction of fluids or medication to
      the tumour 20 through the free duct in the tube 4 via perforations
      o holes (not shown) in this tube under the electrode units 1, 3,
      3' and in or between the walls of the electrodes 1, 3, 3' and/or
      for removal of gas or fluid from the tumour 20. For example,
      physiological sodium chloride solution may be introduced in order
      to increase the conductivity of the tumour 20 around the electrode
      unit. It is also possible for example to introduce cell poison.<br>
      <br>
      The cannula 12, which for example is made of stainless steel,
      should have a good fit against the electrode unit 1 and against
      the inside of the tube 4 but must slide easily in order to be
      insertable into and removable from the electrode unit 1 and the
      tube 4 without any greater effort. The anchoring device 16, which
      for example is made of stainless steel, has a good fit in the
      cannula 12.<br>
      <br>
      The above described anchoring device 16 is made of rigid metal
      wire but it is also possible to use a flexible material, for
      instance spirally wound metal wire. Through the elaboration of the
      electrode device, a design is obtained which is soft, pliable and
      flexible and thus able to accompany tissue movements, for instance
      muscle movements, respiratory movements, etc. and can be
      introduced, for example, into a curved gall passage without being
      broken.<br>
      <br>
      In the drawings, the electrical conductors 5-7 are shown to run
      inside the tube 4 but they may obviously instead be -embedded in
      the wall of the tube A .<br>
      <br>
      The invention is primarily intended for treatment of cancer
      tu[not] mours in the human body but is naturally also usable in
      animal bodies and may similarly be used to treat other disease
      conditions in tis[not] sues.<br>
