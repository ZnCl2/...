            for Filipino Inventor<br>
          </b></big></p>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="ayco.jpg" width="151"

      <p>A scientist and inventor, Victor G. Ayco sees the crisis as an
        opportunity for the country to tap the inexhaustible potentials
        that science can offer in finding alternatives to fossil fuel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>“Many seem to anticipate a bleak future because of the prospect
        that one day the world’s fossil fuel deposits will finally run
        dry,” says Ayco, 70. “But fossil fuel is not the only source of
        energy that can run engines of cars and other machines. There
        are other inexhaustible alternatives [to fossil fuel].” <br>
      </p>
      <p>He based his radical optimism on what he regards as a vital
        clue from one of the geniuses of the 20th century — Albert
        Einstein. That clue is the theory of relativity, or E=mc², where
        E is energy, m is mass, and c is the velocity of light. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Mandaluyong-based chemical engineer says Einstein’s theory
        helped him perfect his gas-saving product, which he demonstrated
        recently before Baguio City motorists. Essentially, Einstein’s
        relativity theory, says Ayco, states that “from matter we can
        produce energy.” <br>
      </p>
      <p>His invention called “aero-nitro power injector” took 15 years
        of research and experiment. Patented on Dec. 11, 1985, the
        Aerogas Power Injector device has been marketed only recently
        through Energy Philippines Inc., a private firm, which Ayco
        co-owns with other partners. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The inventor says his device “converts ordinary nitrogen (a
        noncombustible substance) in the atmosphere into combustible
        nitro-gas, and serves as gasoline and diesel additive in gaseous
        form for efficient engine combustion.” <br>
      </p>
      <p>With efficient engine combustion, a vehicle can run more
        kilometers with less fuel and emits almost zero toxic
        pollutants. Ayco’s “aero-nitro power injector” is encased in a
        stainless steel cylinder, measuring five inches long and two
        inches in diameter, which can be attached to the intake manifold
        of any diesel or gas engine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>He says the gadget enhances engine performance, eliminates
        smoke-belching, provides stronger engine power, and saves on
        fuel. Activated chemically during fuel and air intake, the
        invention harnesses the air’s potential elements by producing up
        to 99.5 percent burning efficiency of fuel in the combustion
        chamber of an engine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ayco says he is processing how to get credits through what is
        called carbon trading because his invention prevents by 30 to 40
        percent the formation of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
        nitrogen oxides -- substances that are ruining the ozone layer.
        Using a chemical catalyst, which Ayco has refused to identify
        calling it a trade secret, the gadget converts unwanted carbons
        and other volatile elements present in the atmosphere into
        combustible gaseous form. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Since the invention helps a car attain perfect fuel burn with
        near-zero nitrous oxide emission, which gives more power to a
        vehicle, using the gadget is like converting low octane fuel
        into high octane gasoline, he says. The gadget also increases
        engine power by a maximum of 25 horsepower and increases torque
        by a maximum of 1,000 RPM (revolutions per minute).<br>

      <p align="center"><big><b>Additional Info on the Filipino Aerogas
            Power Injector device&nbsp;</b></big></p>
      <p>Based on tests by government agencies, including the
        departments of energy, science and technology and environment
        and natural resources, Ayco’s invention can increase engine
        power by 35 to 60 percent, mileage by two to four kilometers to
        a liter, and engine life span by six to 10 years. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The tests also show that the gadget can cut down maintenance
        costs by up to 50 percent, can prolong life span of spark plugs
        and glow plugs, can decrease frequency of tune-ups and oil
        changes, and can reduce carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
        emissions by 99.5 percent. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ayco also says his gadget is not bulky and easy to install
        without having to alter engine as it can just be attached to the
        engine air intake manifold. Suitable to most types of stationary
        and mobile combustion engines, the gadget can also last six to
        eight years and can be recharged after maximum use. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ayco says that two important substances used in his gas-saving
        gadget are carbon and hydrogen derived from limestone. If taken
        a step farther, these limestone-derived substances combined with
        water plus a catalyst, which again he will not disclose, can
        produce synthetic fuel, which is much cleaner and more efficient
        than fossil fuels. “My car actually runs on this synthetic
        fuel,” he says. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, Ayco and his business partners are busy
        marketing the aero-nitro power injector not only locally but
        also in Canada, Belgium and other countries. At P9,000 per unit
        and with a 10-year warranty, where payments may be returned if
        one is not satisfied with the performance, Ayco’s invention is
        making brisk sales in urban communities seeking to reduce air
        pollution. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Standard design of an engine works in two ways chemical
        process (combustion) and mechanical process (motion). The
        chemical process involves the combustion of fuel. Be it
        gasoline, diesel or bunker, this fuel is made up mainly of
        hydrogen and carbon (Hydrogen). Ordinarily, when combustion
        occurs, the fuel containing hydrocarbons is not completely
        burned. The unburned carbon stick to the chamber walls of the
        engine and the gaseous form of these carbons is emitted from the
        exhaust pipes of vehicles as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
        which are metal corrosive and air pollutants detrimental to the
        engine and the environment,” Ayco said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Aerogas Power Injector works on the chemical process by sucking
        air composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 20 percent oxygen and 3
        percents others, then converting it into active elements (
        nitrogen base elements) which react with the elements of the
        fuel (hydrocarbons ) during air intake process. When these
        elements reacted with the hydrocarbons of the fuel , 98 percent
        to 100 percent comstion is made possible. This is how the
        Aerogas Power Injector works toward a more economical and
        efficient engine performance and pollution-free Philippines,”
        Ayco added.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Aerogas Power Injector , an advanced engineering design can
        increase engine power from 60 percent , increase mileage from 2
        to 4 kilometers a liter. It cuts down maintenance costs by 50
        percent by prolonging the lifespan of spark/glow plugs, as well
        as decreasing frequency on tune-ups and change oil.<br>
