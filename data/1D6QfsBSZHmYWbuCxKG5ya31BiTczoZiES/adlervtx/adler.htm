        <p><b><font size="+1">Whirlpool Tube Puts Hole in Sea</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Imagine being able to bore a hole in the sea, anywhere at will,
        to rescue the crew of a sunken submarine or to hunt undersea
        treasure! </p>
      <p>That is the feat designed to be accomplished by an amazing
        ‘whirlpool tube’ upon which a patent has just been granted to
        Edward A. Adler, of the General Electric Company. Consisting of
        a telescopic tube open at top and bottom, and a set of
        motor-driven paddles rotating at high speed, it operates upon
        the same principle that forms a hole in the water of your
        bathtub when the stopper is pulled. </p>
      <p>When the tube is lowered into the sea through a well in a
        salvage barge and the motor is started, Adler maintains, the
        entire column of water will be set whirling. Its own centrifugal
        force will draw the water to the sides of the tube, leaving a
        hole straight down the center. A salvager may descend a ladder
        through the hole, surrounded by churning water, without getting
        wet, and under normal atmospheric pressure. There will be no
        need of a diving suit. </p>
      <p>The ‘whirlpool tube’ differs from salvage devices previously
        built or proposed in that no effort will be made to keep it
        watertight, or to make an especially close-fitting joint with a
        derelict on which the tube’s bottom rests. The force of the
        artificially created vortex will be more than adequate, Adler
        says, to expel incoming water and preserve the ‘manhole’ in the
        tube. In fact, the only purpose of the cylindrical shell is to
        overcome the difficulty of controlling a vortex in open water. </p>
      <p>Uses for this tube will be manifold, Adler foresees. Besides
        its more spectacular tasks in submarine rescues (as pictured by
        our artist on this month’s cover) and the recovery of gold from
        sunken ships, it may be employed to collect oysters, edible
        seaweed, and other marine products from the bottom of the sea. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Method and Apparatus for Hydraulic
              Prospecting</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>(22 Sept. 1931)</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Edward A. Adler</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to hydraulics, and more particularly to
        th performance of operations beneath the surface of hydraulic
        bodies. </p>
      <p>In the past sub-surface operations have been carried out mainly
        by several methods of diving. Although the method of diving is
        entirely operative, it entails the serious disadvantage, that
        even at comparatively moderate depths, the person of the diver
        is subjected to enormous pressures and chilling temperatures
        which decrease the efficiency of his activities, limit the
        period for which he may remain beneath the surface, and very
        often result in serious permanent injury to his health. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, an object of this invention is the provision of a
        simple, reliable and effective method for providing
        communication between the surface and points beneath the surface
        of an hydraulic body, in which persons engaged in operations
        beneath the surface will not be subjected to hydraulic
        pressures, together with a reliable and efficient form of
        apparatus for carrying this method into effect. </p>
      <p>In illustrating my invention in one form thereof, I have shown
        it as embodied in an apparatus particularly adapted for
        providing access from the surface of the sea to a sunken
        submarine. <br>
        In carrying my invention into effect in one form thereof, I
        cause an open ended tubular enclosing wall to be secured in
        position extending from the surface to the point beneath the
        surface where operations are to be carried on, and then cause
        the liquid within the enclosing wall to be rotated at a speed
        sufficient to cause a vortex to be formed therein, affording
        communication from the surface to the point of operations. </p>
      <p>For a better and more complete understanding of the invention,
        reference should now be made to the following specification and
        to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a view in
        elevation, partly in section, of a form of apparatus suitable
        for carrying my method into effect; </p>

      </center>
      <p>Figure 2 is an enlarged view in section of a part of the
        apparatus shown in Figure 1; </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" width="324" height="333"></p>
      </center>
      <p>and Figure 3 is a modification. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" width="228" height="333"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Referring now to the drawings, a barge 10 is provided with a
        centrally disposed opening formed therein by the cylindrical
        wall 11. As shown, the opening extends entirely through the
        barge, and is of a size sufficient to permit the sections of
        tubing 12 to be lowered into the water beneath the barge. </p>
      <p>In order that the tubular enclosing wall 12 may remain in an
        upright or vertical position substantially unaffected by the
        roll or pitch o the barge 10, the enclosing wall 12 is
        universally supported with respect to the barge 10 in the gimbal
        mounting comprising the annular rings 13, 13a and 13b. As shown
        the ring 13b is provided with a flange which is secured to the
        barge, and ring 13a is pivoted with respect to ring 13b to
        permit its rotation about a horizontal axis, whilst ring 13 is
        pivoted with respect to ring 13a to permit of rotation of ring
        13 about a transverse horizontal axis. </p>
      <p>The tubular enclosing wall 12 is supported within the annular
        ring 13 by means of clamping dogs 14, 14a, and 14b, etc., with
        which the ting is provided. </p>
      <p>As thus constructed the tings 13, 13a and 13b constitute a
        universal mounting or support between the barge 10 and the
        tubular enclosing wall 12, permitting the latter to be suspended
        from the former after the fashion of a plumb bob, substantially
        unaffected by the rolling or pitching motion of the barge. </p>
      <p>The extremities of each section of tubing 12 are provided with
        outwardly extending annular flanges 1, to permit of the sections
        being secured together by any suitable fastening means, such for
        example as by the bolts shown passing through the flanges. </p>
      <p>In order to facilitate the handling of the tubular section 12,
        cranes or derricks 16 and 17 are provided upon the barge 10, and
        serve to lift and place the sections of tubing 12, end to end to
        be fastened together and then to lower the tubular enclosing
        wall 12 through the opening in the barge into the water beneath.
      </p>
      <p>The sections of tubing 12 may be constructed of any suitable
        material and are of such dimensions as will best be suited to
        their being rapidly and easily handled. The lowermost section
        12a of the tubing, i.e., the first section to be lowered through
        the barge is provided with a suitable liquid impelling means
        such for example as the paddle wheel 18, together with a
        suitable means of rotating the same such for example as the
        electric motor 19, the stator member of which is secured to the
        tubing 12 by struts or braces 20 which may be formed integrally
        with the wall of the tubing or may be secured thereto by
        suitable fastening means. </p>
      <p>Additional motors and liquid impelling means spaced from each
        other by suitable intervals may be secured to intermediate
        sections of the tubular enclosing wall, as illustrated by the
        motor 21 and impeller 22 supported within the tube section 12b.
        The number of paddle wheels and electric driving motors will, of
        course, depend upon the depth of the point beneath the surface
        at which operations are to be carried on. </p>
      <p>The construction of the electric motors for driving the paddle
        wheels and the manner in which they are supported will best be
        understood by reference to Figure 2. As shown in that figure the
        motor is an alternating current induction motor and comprises a
        stator frame 23 upon the punchings of which a distributed
        polyphase winding 24 is wound, and a rotor member 25 which may
        be of any suitable type such for example as the wound motor, or
        the more rugged squirrel cage type. The rotor winding is fixedly
        mounted on a hollow shaft 26, which also carries the liquid
        impeller 18. </p>
      <p>The rotor member 25 of the motor is rotatably mounted with
        respect to the stator member 23 by&nbsp; upper and lower annular
        bearing blocks 27 and 28 supported by upper and lower stator end
        shields 29 and 30 respectively. Any suitable fastening means
        such as the bolts shown in the drawings may be employed to
        secure the end shields 29 and 30 tightly to the stator frames.
        The annular bearing blocks 27 and 28 may be made of any suitable
        material, but are preferably made of lignum vitae, which is a
        very hard wood particularly adapted for bearings located in
        water, such for example as the packing bearings for ship
        propeller shafts. </p>
      <p>It will be seen from the above description that the stator
        frame 23, end shields 29 and hollow shaft form a water tight
        casing for the stator and rotor windings and punchings of the
        motor, and it s desirable, though not absolutely essential, that
        water should be excluded from the current carrying windings of
        the motor. </p>
      <p>As an added precaution against the possible harmful effects due
        to the possibility of water gaining access to the rotor and
        stator, the motor is preferably designed as a low voltage high
        current motor. </p>
      <p>In order that alternating current of a suitable low potential
        may be available for supplying the motor, a step down
        transformer comprising a primary winding 31 and a secondary
        winding 32 is provided in a water tight annular shaped casing 33
        located above and secured to the upper end shield 29 of the
        motor by any suitable fastening such as the bolts illustrated in
        the drawings. The terminals of the secondary windings of the
        transformer are connected by conductors 34 to the stator winding
        24 of the motor, and as shown these conductors pass through the
        end shield 29 and are insulated therefrom by insulating bushings
        35. </p>
      <p>Alternating current of a suitable voltage and frequency is
        supplied to the primary winding 31 of the transformer from a
        suitable source of supply such for example as the alternating
        current generator 36 located on the barge 10. Alternator 36 may
        be driven by a suitable driving means such for example as the
        electric motor 37 supplied from the ships mains (not shown). </p>
      <p>The terminals of the generator 36 are connected to the primary
        winding 31 of the transformer by means of cable 37. As shown in
        the drawings, each section of the tubular enclosing wall 12 is
        provided with a section of submarine cable 37a suitably secured
        to the wall 12. As the sections 12 of the tubing are assembled,
        connections are made between the cable sections by suitably
        insulated connectors 38. </p>
      <p>One of the supporting arms 20 is hollowed and communicated with
        the surrounding liquid by means of an orifice 39 provided in the
        tubular enclosing wall 12. Water for lubricating the bearings is
        thus admitted through the orifice 39 and through tube 20 to the
        interior of the motor whence it is distributed to upper and
        lower lignum-vitae bearing blocks 27 and 28 by means of tubular
        passages 40 and 41 respectively, provided within the stator
        frame. After passing through the bearing blocks, the water is
        discharged from parts 42 and 43 located in the bottom shaft 26
        and in the lower end shield 30 respectively. </p>
      <p>The blades of paddle wheel 18 may be welded or otherwise
        suitably secured to hollow shaft 26. As shown they extend
        radially outward from the shaft toward the tubular enclosing
        wall 12; sufficient clearance being left between their
        extremities and wall 12 to permit of their being rotated with
        respect thereto. </p>
      <p>The hollow shaft 26 is preferably of a diameter sufficient to
        enable a man to pass therethroughout without coming into contact
        with it. If desired, a guard of sufficient construction may be
        provided to prevent contact with the rotating parts. To enable a
        man to descend the tubular enclosing wall 12 a ladder 44 runs
        the entire length of tubular wall 12 and through hollow shaft
        26, and is supported within the tubular enclosing wall by
        supports 45, 46, arranged at suitable intervals along the
        interior of tubular wall 12. </p>
      <p>The supports 20 for the motors, as well as the supports 45, 46,
        etc., are preferably streamlined to present the least possible
        resistance to rotary motion of water within the tube. </p>
      <p>The lowermost section of the tube may be provided with a loose
        fitting collar member 47 of a diameter slightly larger than the
        tubular member 12, and is loosely secured thereto by a suitable
        fastening means such as the chains 48 and 49. The collar 47
        serves as an extension of tubular member 12, and is particularly
        advantageous in extending the tubing 12 into engagement with
        surfaces of submerged bodies lying at an angle with the
        horizontal. It is also advantageous for maintaining a continuous
        enclosing wall between the surface and the point of operations
        despite vertical or slight swinging motion of the tubular
        enclosing wall, as will be the case when the surface is rough. </p>
      <p>In the modification of the invention shown in Figure 3, all of
        the elements are the same as those already described with
        respect to Figures 1 and 2 with the exception that the lowermost
        section of the tubular enclosing wall 12 and the ladder 44 are
        curved. The motor 19 in this section is preferably supported so
        that the liquid impeller 18 is in the straight part of the tube
        just above the point where the curve begins, In this
        modification of the invention, no particular degree of curvature
        is required but a gradual curve is more to be preferred than a
        sharp curve. </p>
      <p>With the above understanding of the parts and elements
        comprising an apparatus suitable for the practice of my
        invention, the operation and method will readily be understood..
      </p>
      <p>The barge 10 may be towed to the point where salvaging or other
        subsurface operations are to be carried in, for example to the
        point above a sunken vessel, such as submarine 50 shown in the
        drawings, and there anchored against the winds and tides and
        against rotary movement, by suitable anchoring means (not
        shown). </p>
      <p>The clamping dogs 14, 14a, 14b, etc., will then be raised to
        permit the lowermost section of tubular enclosed wall 12
        containing driving motor 19 and impeller 18 to be lowered
        through the centrally disposed opening 11 in the barge 10 by
        either of the cranes 16, 17. The clamping dogs may then be set
        to clamp the section of the tubular member while another section
        is raised by the cranes and placed upon the first or lowermost
        section and fastened thereto by bolts passing through the
        circumferential flanges 15. Electrical connections are then
        completed between the cable sections 37a by connectors 38. When
        this step is completed the clamping dogs are again raised and
        both sections of the tube are lowered a distance equal to a tube
        section and the clamping dogs are again set to retain the
        assembled sections while another section is fastened to those
        already assembled. </p>
      <p>In this manner the tube is assembled section by section until
        enough sections have been assembled to afford communication
        beneath the surface, e.g., the submarine 50. When the tube is
        finally assembled, the electrical connections between the motors
        19, 21, etc., are completed and the motor generator set 37, 36
        is started up to supply alternating current to the primary
        windings 33 of the transformers and thence to the stator
        windings 24 of the motors. The motors 19, 21, etc., are
        completed and the motor generator set 37, 36 is started up to
        supply alternating current to the primary windings 33 of the
        transformers and thence to the stator windings 24 of the motors.
        The motors 19, 21, etc., will then rotate at a speed dependent
        on the frequency of the current supplied to its stator and the
        liquid impellers, i.e., the paddle wheels 18, 22, etc., mounted
        upon the shafts of the motors will likewise be rotated the
        result of which will be to set the water within the enclosing
        wall 12 into rotation. At a critical speed, a clean vortex will
        be formed therein, communicating from the surface to a point
        beneath the lowermost liquid impeller. </p>
      <p>Any suitable means may be employed for varying the speeds of
        the motors 19, 21, but this will preferably be accomplished by
        varying the speed of the motor 37 which drives the supply
        generator 36, by any suitable methods of speed control as is
        well understood in the electrical art. In this manner the
        driving motors may be run at the speed most suitable for
        maintaining a perfect vortex between the surface of the liquid
        body and the point of operations. In practice it has been found
        that speeds between 900 rpm and 1500 rpm are most suitable for
        maintaining a vortex. </p>
      <p>After the vortex as formed and has become steady, operatives
        may then descend the ladder 44, passing through the hollow
        shafts 26 of the motors to the point of operations and caryr on
        the necessary work without being subjected to any added
        pressure, other than that due to the added column of air between
        the sub-surface point and the surface and without being
        subjected to the chilling temperature of the sea water. </p>
      <p>The collar 47 might be secured to the submarine, and after
        suitable communication hving been made with the interior of the
        submarine, as by drilling, air might be supplied to the interior
        thereof either from the air column within the vortex, or from a
        hose communicating with a source of compressed air on the barge.
      </p>
      <p>By fitting the collar 47 over the conning tower of the
        submarine or over any suitable aperture provided for the
        purpose, and then creating a vortex within the tubular enclosing
        wall in the above described manner, the conning tower hatch or
        aperture may be opened and the crew permitted to escape without
        being subjected to the enormous hydraulic pressures existing at
        the depth at which the submarine is submerged. </p>
      <p>Operations on the side of a submerged body may be carried on by
        employing the curved section of Figure 3 as the lowermost
        section o the tubular enclosing wall 12. </p>
      <p>Although the invention has been explained in connection with a
        tubular enclosing wall extending from the surface to a point of
        operation, I would have it understood, that a tubular enclosing
        was is not essential, since a vortex may be created by simply
        rotating an impeller at the point of operations. The vortex
        formed in open water is, however, not so easily controlled as
        the vortex formed within a smooth tubular enclosing wall. </p>
      <p>I would have it understood that my invention is not limited to
        the salvaging of submarines or the rescue of entrapped crews,
        since obviously any subsurface operation may be carried out by
        this method. It is also to be understood that this invention is
        not limited to subsurface operations initiated at and carried on
        from the surface since obviously similar operations may be
        initiated at and carried on from the point of operations, for
        example from a sunken or submerged submarine. </p>
      <p>Although, in accordance with the provisions of the patent
        statures, I have described my invention as embodied in concrete
        form, I would have it understood that the invention is not
        limited thereto, since modifications, alteration and equivalent
        arrangements will readily suggest themselves to skilled workers
