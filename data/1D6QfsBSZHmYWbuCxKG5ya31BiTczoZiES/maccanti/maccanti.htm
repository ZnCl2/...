      Electromagnetic device (100), particularly to be used as a
      generator, for example of mechanical energy, comprising means
      (105) for generating a magnetic field, at least one electric
      conductor (110, 115) arranged inside said magnetic field, means
      (120) for generating at least one sequence of electric pulses
      having amplitutes variable in time, said means for generating
      pulses (120) being connected to the electric conductors (110, 115)
      for applying a corresponding pulse sequence to each electric
      conductor (110, 115).<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic device, and
      particularly to an electromagnetic device suitable to be used as a
      generator, for example of mechanical energy or heat. <br>
      <br>
      A generator is in general a machine for transforming energy of a
      type into energy of a different type; generators are also commonly
      indicated with the improper expression of devices for producing
      energy, which always implicates a tranformation or a conversion of
      energy into different form. <br>
      <br>
      Known generators, which differ because of the nature of the used
      energy, because of the nature of the produced energy and in the
      way they work, have several drawbacks. Most of traditional
      generators, such as thermoelectric generators (which generate
      electric energy exploiting thermic energy produced by a fuel) or
      nuclear generators (which generate electric energy exploiting the
      energy released by fission of nuclear fuels), need to be fed with
      a source of energy (such as oil, gas, coal, uranium) available in
      nature in scarce quantity and therefore expensive. Moreover, the
      energy conversion process used in these generators produces
      polluting exhaust or waste which is dangerous and difficult to be
      disposed. <br>
      <br>
      Several known generators, including generators using clean (not
      polluting) and renewable (not subject to exhaustion) sources of
      energy, such as hydroelectric generators (exploiting hydraulic
      energy, for example from rivers), geothermal generators
      (exploiting thermal energy of natural steam within the earth),
      eaolian generators (exploiting energy of wind) and solar
      generators (exploiting energy sent out by the sun as radiant
      energy), need complex machineries and equipment. Generally, they
      are used in plants (power stations) producing energy on an
      industrial scale; the energy is then delivered to the final users
      by means of delivery networks (typically electric networks). This
      process however implies relevant losses of energy during the
      transfer. In addition, these power stations and related delivery
      networks involve high construction and management expenses and
      they often disfigure the landscape. <br>
      <br>
      Generators for personal use, such as motor vehicle internal
      combustion engines and home heat generators (boilers), use fuels
      (petrol, diesel fuel or gas) which are expensive and polluting;
      electric motors (for example motors used in appliances) use on the
      contrary energy provided by the electric delivery network, with
      the above mentioned drawbacks, or small batteries (exploiting a
      chemical reaction) which provide a reduced power, have a short
      life, and are difficult to dispose once they are flat. <br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to overcome the above
      drawbacks. This object is achieved by means of an electromagnetic
      device as set out in the first claim. <br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic device of the present invention exploits a
      practically unlimited source of energy and it is thus very cheap;
      it produces no harmful waste and therefore it is safe and not
      polluting. <br>
      <br>
      This electromagnetic device is very easy to manufacture and it
      employs very cheap components; it is suitable in particular for
      domestic use, since it is noiseless and small, even if it is not
      excluded its use for producing energy on an industrial scale. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the electromagnetic device according to the present
      invention does not need to be connected to an external electric
      network and it is therefore particularly practical. <br>
      <br>
      Further features and advantages of the electromagnetic device
      according to the present invention will appear in the following
      description of several preferred embodiments of the same, given
      purely by way of a non-restrictive indication, with reference to
      the attached drawings where: <br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig3b.jpg" alt=""> </div>
      <br>
      With reference in particular to Fig.1, an electromagnetic device
      100 according to the present invention includes a permanent magnet
      105 (made up for example of an iron-cobalt alloy), whose North and
      South poles are denoted by the letters N and S, respectively. The
      permanent magnet 105 generates a magnetic field in the surrounding
      space; this field is schematically depicted by its lines of force
      which come out from the North pole and enter the South pole.
      However, the electromagnetic device in this embodiment of the
      present invention lends itself to be implemented even with an
      electromagnet or different equivalent means for generating a
      magnetic field, or even without the magnet 105, for example
      exploiting the universal magnetic field. <br>
      <br>
      Two electric conductors 110 and 115 are wound around the magnet
      105 and they are parallel and arranged in the shape of solenoid,
      with a number of turns (for example several hundreds) variable
      according to the application and the structure of the
      electromagnetic device 100. Alternately, the conductors 110 and
      115 are arranged with a different shape and possibly they are not
      parallel, or they are not wound around the magnet 105 but they are
      close to the same, in any case in a region where the strength of
      the magnetic field generated by the magnet 105 is not negligible.
      <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the electromagnetic device 100 includes a unit 120
      for generating electric (voltage or current) pulse sequences, i.e.
      wave forms where the time during which the electric quantity
      maintains a high (absolute) value is far shorter. e.g. less than
      1/10, than the time during which it maintains a null (or anyway
      low) value. Particularly, the unit 120 has two output terminals
      125 and 130 connected to a terminal of the windings 110 and 115,
      respectively; a third output terminal 135 is connected to the
      other terminal of the windings 110 and 115 and is a reference
      terminal (earth) of the whole device. <br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the unit 120
      generates a first voltage pulse sequence at its output terminals
      125 and 135; the time interval (in the following indicated as
      'period') between two contiguous pulses (considering negligible
      their length) is fixed, and has a value related to the application
      and the structure of the electromagnetic device 100. Tests have
      been carried out with different fixed values of the period up to a
      minimum value about 10<sup>-12</sup>s, but the present invention
      lends itself to be implemented also with not fixed periods. The
      voltage pulses generated at the output terminals 125 and 135 have
      an amplitude (with regard to a reference value of the earth
      terminal) which takes alternatively a 'low' type value V<sub>L</sub>
      and a high type value V<sub>H</sub>, where the difference between
      the amplitude of a high type pulse and the amplitude of an
      immediately preceding low type pulse is greater or equal to a
      predetermined minimum value, preferably 50V. <br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the amplitude of these voltage pulses changes
      continuously, and it is preferably random. For example, the
      amplitude of the voltage pulses takes discrete values spaced from
      each other by a multiple of 1V in a range of defined values, e.g.
      from a minimum value of 380V to a maximum value of 450V, as in the
      sequences depicted in the first time diagram of Fig.2 (denoted
      with the letter a). The voltage pulse sequence is, in turn,
      constituted by several pulses of the same type (which means that
      the amplitude differs less than 50V), alternated to several pulses
      of the other type, eventually in number which is not fixed in
      time, for example random (e.g. V<sub>L</sub> - V<sub>L</sub> - V<sub>H</sub>
      - V<sub>H</sub> - V<sub>H</sub> - V<sub>L</sub> - V<sub>L</sub> -
      V<sub>L</sub> - V<sub>H</sub> - V<sub>H</sub> - ...) <br>
      <br>
      The unit 120 generates in addition a second voltage pulse sequence
      at its output terminals 130 and 135, with a period equal to the
      period of the first sequence generated at the output terminals 125
      and 135. The voltage pulses of the second sequence are shifted,
      with respect to the corresponding pulses of the first sequence, of
      a time interval which is fixed and shorter than this period.
      However, the present invention lends itself to be implemented with
      periods of the two pulse sequence which are not equal from each
      other and with a shifting of different and even not fixed length.
      The voltage pulses of the second sequence have an amplitude which
      is multiple of the amplitude of the corresponding pulses of the
      first sequence; particularly, the amplitude of these voltage
      pulses takes a 'multiplied low' type value V<sub>LM</sub> and a
      'multiplied high' type value V<sub>HM</sub> corresponding to a low
      type pulse V<sub>L</sub> and a high type pulse V<sub>H</sub> of
      the first sequence, respectively. Preferably, the amplitude of
      each pulse of the second sequence is equal to 2.5 times the
      amplitude of the corresponding pulse of the first sequence, as
      depicted in the second time diagram of Fig.2 (denoted with the
      letter b); in alternative embodiments, a different and even not
      fixed multiplicative factor is used. <br>
      <br>
      The first and second voltage pulse sequences described above are
      applied to the winding 110 and 115, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In a alternative embodiment of the present invention, the
      electromagnetic device 100 has a single winding and a total
      voltage pulse sequence corresponding to the superimposition of the
      first and second sequence, as depicted in the third time diagram
      of Fig.2 (denoted with the letter c), is applied to its terminals.
      It should be noted that the use of two different windings is
      particularly useful when the period of the pulse sequences is very
      short, since it avoids interference phenomena between consecutive
      pulses of the first and second sequence. As described in detail
      above with reference to the pulses of the first and second
      sequence, the present invention lends to be implemented even with
      a total pulse sequence different from the depicted sequence. <br>
      <br>
      For example, in alternative embodiments, the different type pulses
      follow one another in the total sequence in any order, there are
      only one, two. three or more than four pulse types with different
      amplitude, the total sequence includes two or more consecutive
      pulses of one same type, and so on. <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, it should be noted that the electromagnetic device 100
      of the present invention lends itself to be implemented even with
      a single winding 110 and only the described first pulse sequence
      applied to this winding. <br>
      <br>
      In a different embodiment of the present invention, the
      electromagnetic device 100 includes several winding pairs (or
      several single windings as described above), and pulse sequences
      similar to the ones described above are applied thereto;
      advantageously, it is possible to increase the period of the pulse
      sequences applied to the different windings by using several
      windings, obtaining the same performance of the electromagnetic
      device 100. These pulse sequence can be arranged in several
      manners; for example, the pulse sequences are of the same type or
      different type, they have pulse amplitude values which are equal
      or different, they have equal or different period, they are phased
      or shifted between one another, either of a time interval which is
      multiple of a period or of a different value. <br>
      <br>
      Preferably, as shown in the drawing, the windings 110 and 115 are
      wound around the magnet 105 in a way that the current flowing
      therethrough and corresponding to the described voltage pulses
      generates a magnetic field which is substantially parallel and
      concordant with the magnetic field generated by the magnet 105,
      according to the right hand rule; however, the present invention
      lands itself to be implemented even with a different arrangement
      of the windings 110, 115. <br>
      <br>
      The pulses applied to the windings 110 and 115 perturb the
      magnetic field generated by the magnet 105 and produce a total
      magnetic field having an amplitude which is <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">extremely higher</span> than the
      amplitude of the magnetic field generated by the magnet 105. <br>
      <br>
      Experimental test have shown that the resulting magnetic field has
      an amplitude far higher <span style="font-weight: bold;">(e.g.
        several thousands times)</span> than the field produced by the
      magnet 105 and that <span style="font-weight: bold;">the energy
        generated by the electromagnetic device 100 is extremely higher
        than the energy absorbed by the unit</span> 120 for generating
      the pulse sequences. <br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic device of the present invention is suitable to
      be used in different applications, for example for producing
      thermal, electric, mechanical energy, and so on. <br>
      <br>
      An example of motor for transforming the energy provided by the
      electromagnetic device of the present invention into mechanical
      energy (particularly kinetic energy) is depicted in Fig.3a. The
      motor 300 includes a stationary element (stator) 302 and a moving
      element (rotor) 304 joined together by means of bearings (which
      are not shown in the drawing) in a way that the only possible
      relative movement is a rotation around a common axis 306. A short
      circuit electric conductor 307 is wound longitudinally in the
      shape of a spiral on the rotor 304. The stator 302 includes a
      permanent magnet in the shape of a hollow cylinder with the North
      (N) and South (S) poles arranged at the longitudinal ends;
      preferably, the magnet of the stator 302 is split longitudinally
      into several portions 308-322 (eight in this example) in order to
      reduce stray currents.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Fig.3b (elements in common with Fig.3a are
      denoted with the same reference numbers) a detailed exploded view
      of the structure of the magnet 308 is shown (similar
      considerations apply to the other magnets 310-322). <br>
      <br>
      Grooves (or slots) which accomodate an electric conductor 324
      (324-338 in Fig.3a), for example a copper wire with a
      cross-section of 1mm, are drawn on the surface of the magnet 308;
      the electric conductor 324 is wound around the magnet 308 in the
      shape of a spiral spreading out longitudinally in both directions
      and forming for example a hundred of turns. <br>
      <br>
      Further grooves accomodate another electric conductor 340,
      insulated from the winding 324; the conductor 340 is likewise
      wound longitudinally around the magnet 308 in the shape of a
      spiral forming for example a hundred of turns. <br>
      <br>
      A transversal hollow 356, preferably perpendicular to the common
      axis 306 and therefore also to the lines of force of the field
      generated by the magnet 308, is provided in the magnet 308. The
      hollow 356 accomodates at least one electromagnetic unit 358
      including a hollow cylindric stator 360 of ferromagnetic material
      on which an electric conductor 362 wound longitudunally as a
      spiral is arranged. A rotor 378 rotationally movable (with regard
      to the stator 360) around a common axis, is accomodated inside the
      stator 360; an electric conductor 380, likewise wound in the shape
      of a spiral, is provided on the rotor 378 and it is connected to
      the outside by means of wiping contacts, e.g. brushes. The winding
      362 (primary winding) defines a number of turns, e.g. 100, smaller
      than the number defined by the winding 380 (secondary winding),
      e.g. 250. The secondary winding 380 and the winding 340 are
      parallel connected, with a terminal in common and the other
      terminal connected to the earth terminal; the primary winding 362
      and the winding 324 are likewise parallel connected, with a
      terminal in common and the other terminal connected to the earth
      terminal. <br>
      <br>
      Referring back to Fig.3a, each winding 324-338 is parallel
      connected to the winding opposite to the axis 306; particularly,
      the not grounded terminal of the winding 324 (on the magnet 308)
      is connected to the corresponding terminal of the winding 322 (on
      the magnet 316), and the winding 326-334, 328-336 and 330-338 are
      likewise connected. Preferably, a capacitive element 381,
      typically a capacitor having a capacity smaller than 40nF, is
      connected in series to a pair of windings, e.g. the pair 324-332,
      and it is useful to increase the starting couple in load
      operation. The motor 300 further includes a signal processing
      electronic unit 382 (e.g. an ORION type processor for power audio
      signal processing) having a number of output terminals equal to
      the number of winding pairs 324-338 (four in this example) and a
      further output terminal connected to the earth terminal; each
      output terminal of the unit 382 is connected to the not grounded
      terminal of a corresponding pair of the windings 324-338. The
      signal processing unit 382 is operated, by means of control
      signals, by a logic unit 383, e.g. a DSP (Digital Signal
      Processing) electronic card, possibly connected to a Personal
      Computer (PC). <br>
      <br>
      The motor 300 comprises a further electromagnetic unit 384
      including a hollow cylindric stator 386 of ferromagnetic material
      in which an electric conductor 388, wound longitudinally as a
      spiral, is arranged. A rotor 390 rotationally movable (with regard
      to the stator 386) around a common axis is accomodated inside the
      stator 386; an electric conductor 392 likewise wound in the shape
      of a spiral is provided on the rotor 390 and it is connected to
      the outside by means of wiping contacts, e.g. brushes. The winding
      388 (primary winding) defines a low number of turns, e.g. a
      hundred, while the winding 392 (secondary winding) defines a high
      number of turns, e.g. a thousand. A terminal of the secondary
      winding 392 is connected to the earth terminal, while the other
      terminal is connected to an input terminal of the unit 382. The
      primary winding 388 is parallel connected, by means of an
      electromagnetic switch 394 or any equivalent means (operated by
      the logic unit 383), to an electric generator 396, e.g. a storage
      battery which provides a voltage of 12V at its positive (+) and
      negative (-) terminals and which has an ampere-hour capacity of
      1,9Ah. <br>
      <br>
      Particularly, a terminal of the primary winding 388 is connected
      to the earth terminal, while the other terminal is connected
      (through the switch 394) to the positive terminal of the electric
      generator 396; the negative terminal of the electric generator 396
      is connected to the earth terminal. <br>
      <br>
      The logic unit 383 periodically switches on the switch 394 for a
      short time interval in order to apply a base pulse sequence to the
      primary winding 388. The length of this period is inversely
      proportional (with the same performance of the motor 300) to the
      number of winding pairs 324-338 arranged on the stator 302; in
      this example, the switch 394 is on every 10<sup>-6</sup>s, for a
      time interval lasting about 10<sup>-7</sup>s. The fast variation
      of the current applied to the primary winding 388 produces a
      magnetic field with a variable amplitude; the corresponding
      variations of flux linkage through the secondary winding 392
      generates a sequence of multiplied base pulses at the ends of the
      winding 392, whose amplitude (defining the minimum low type value
      V<sub>L</sub>) is related to the ratio of the number of turns of
      the windings 392 and 388. This sequence of multiplied base pulses,
      having a fixed amplitude (e.g. 380V), is provided to the input
      terminal of the signal processing unit 382. Preferably, at least
      one further electromagnetic unit (which is not shown in the
      drawing), similar to the unit 358 described with reference to
      Fig.3b, or other equivalent means for generating a magnetic field
      having a direction preferably perpendicular to the axis of the
      rotor 390, is provided in the stator 386. An induced current
      having opposite directions corresponding to each leading and
      trailing edge of the base pulses is generated in the winding 390.
      The described induced current flows in the winding 390 which is
      inside the magnetic field created by the further electromagnetic
      unit; the winding 390 is then subject to a force alternatively
      rotating clockwise and counterclockwise the rotor 390.
      Advantageously, with the described structure it is possible to
      obtain a voltage pulse sequence having a very short period;
      alternatively, the same pulse sequence is obtained with
      conventional means. <br>
      <br>
      The signal processing unit 382 (operated by the logic unit 383)
      changes the amplitude of each received voltage pulse, generating
      voltage pulses having an amplitude between the input minimum value
      and a set maximum value, e.g. 450V (defining the maximum high type
      value V<sub>H</sub>). Particularly, a low type voltage pulse V<sub>L</sub>
      having an amplitude with a random value higher or equal to 380V is
      provided at a certain moment to a first output terminal connected
      to the winding pair 324-332; a high type voltage pulse V<sub>H</sub>
      having an amplitude with a random value lower or equal to 450V and
      at least 50V higher than the amplitude of the preceding pulse is
      provided at the next period to this terminal, and so on as
      described above in detail. A similar voltage pulse sequence but
      with different values is provided to a second output terminal
      connected to the adjacent winding pair 326-334; this pulse
      sequence is one period shifted with regard to the one applied to
      the winding pair 324-332, so that when a low type pulse V<sub>L</sub>
      is on the first output terminal a high type pulse V<sub>H</sub> is
      on the second output terminal, and vice versa. In a similar
      manner, a pulse sequence, shifted with regard to the one applied
      to the winding pair 326-334, is provided to a third output
      terminal connected to the winding pair 328-336 and a pulse
      sequence, shifted with regard to the preceding one, is provided to
      a fourth output terminal connected to the winding pair 330-338. <br>
      <br>
      An example of the pulse sequences generated by the signal
      processing unit is: <br>
      <br>
      1/ 380V 448V 381V 447V 383V 450V 382V ... <br>
      2/ 449V 380V 450V 381V 448V 382V 447V ... <br>
      3/ 384V 449V 383V 448V 380V 446V 383V ... <br>
      4/ 450V 382V 448V 385V 449V 381V 446V ... <br>
      <br>
      As can be seen, the amplitude of the voltage pulses applied in a
      certain moment to the several winding pairs 324-338 changes
      spatially likewise the amplitude of the voltage pulses applied to
      each winding pairs changes in time. <br>
      <br>
      This preferred embodiment (with the low and high type voltage
      pulses alternated spatially and in time and with an amplitude not
      less than 380V and random) allows obtaining a regular motion
      without leaps of the rotor 304. However, the motor 300 lends
      itself to be operated even with different pulse sequences, and
      described above. <br>
      <br>
      The pulse sequence applied to each winding 324-338 is applied at
      the same time also to the primary winding 362 of the corresponding
      electromagnetic unit 358 (see Fig.3b), and to the similar windings
      which are not shown in the drawings. <br>
      <br>
      As described with reference to the electromagnetic unit 384, a
      pulse corresponding to each voltage pulse applied to the primary
      winding 362 and having an amplitude multiple of the input pulse,
      according to the ratio of the number of turns of the windings 362
      and 380, is generated on the secondary winding 380 with some delay
      (about 10<sup>-13</sup>s). In this example, each pulse on the
      secondary winding 380 has an amplitude equal to 2,5 times the
      amplitude of the corresponding input pulse. The pulse sequence
      generated in this way on the secondary winding 380 is applied to
      the winding 340 and it is slightly shifted, or delayed, with
      respect to the input pulse sequence (directly applied to the
      winding 324). <br>
      <br>
      The pulses applied to the windings on the magnets 308-322 produce,
      as described above, a very high amplitude variation of the
      magnetic field generating a corresponding variation of flux
      linkeage through the winding 307; an induced electromotive force
      results on the same and it causes a current flow. At the same
      time, the pulses applied to the winding 362 and the other similar
      windings produce a magnetic field having a direction perpendicular
      to the common axis 306. The induced current described above flows
      in the winding 307 which is inside the magnetic field created by
      these windings and it is then subject to an electromagnetic force
      having a direction given by the left hand rule. This force rotates
      the rotor 304 and the shorter the pulse period is the higher the
      rotation speed is. It should be appreciated that it is possible to
      modify readily the rotation direction of the rotor 304 by changing
      the direction of the current in the windings by means of switches
      (which are not shown in the drawings). <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Test results have shown that a very high shaft horsepower
        (e.g. 20kW), with an idle speed about 3,000 rpm (revolutions per
        minute), is obtained by absorbing a negligible power from the
        electric generator 396 (e.g. 0,07A per 12V, that is 0,84W).</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      In a different embodiment, the motor shaft is coupled to an
      alternator or a direct-current generator (not shown in the
      drawing) for producing electric energy. Preferably, a very small
      part of the produced energy is used for recharging the generator
      396. <br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the motor described above lends itself to
      be constructed in alternative manners, for example by arranging
      the short circuit winding on the stator and the permanent magnets
      with the related windings (connected to the signal processing unit
      by means of wiping brushes) on the rotor, or by using a different
      number of conductors wound around the permanent magnets (up to a
      single winding with a single permanent magnet), or by arranging
      the electromagnetic units inside the mangets on the stator not
      perpendicularly to the common axis, or by feeding the winding on
      the rotor with a direct current, or by replacing the same winding
      with conductive bars joined at their ends by two connecting rings,
      or by implementing the pulse generation unit with a custom
      electronic circuit, and so on. <br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the motor 300 further includes position
      sensors (not shown in the drawings) detecting the rotation speed
      of the rotor 304 (and possibly the one of the rotors 378 and 390
      as well). The sensed values are provided to the logic unit 383
      which consequently modifies the operation of the motor 300.
      Particularly, if the rotation speed is higher then a predetermined
      value, the logic unit 383 increases the period of the pulse
      sequences, whilst if the speed is lower than the value it reduces
      this period; when the rotation speed is not regular, the logic
      unit 383 increases the minimum amplitude value of the voltage
      pulses. <br>
      <br>
      The motor 300 in operation warms up owing to the energy
      transformation process; it has benn verified by tests that if the
      temperature inside the stator 302 raises up to a critical value,
      about 100<sup>0</sup>, the motion of the rotor 304 stops and it
      starts again as soon as the temperature falls under this critical
      value. The temperature of the motor 300 increases by going on
      feeding the same with the voltage pulses described above (even
      without motion of the rotor 304), so that this feature can be
      advantageously used when the device is intended to be used as
      thermal generator. On the contrary, when the device works as a
      motor it need to be cooled, for example by self ventilation, where
      cool air is conveyed onto the inner surface of the stator 302 by
      means of a fan fastened to the motor shaft. <br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the motor 300 works in a controlled
      atmosphere. Particularly, the stator 302 and the rotor 304 are
      enclosed in a container (not shown in the drawing) at a pressure
      lower than the atmospheric pressure, e.g. lower than 100mbar
      (preferably 70mbar). In this situation, it has been shown that the
      eat productioon is practically negligible and that the yield of
      the motor 300 improves considerably. <br>
      <br>
      The structure described above lends itself to be used with simple
      changes as electric generator as well. It is enough to replace the
      rotor 304 with a stationary electric conductor (induced
      conductor), typically wound longitudinally in the shape of a coil,
      which is then connected to an external load circuit. <br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, in this case the electromagnetic units (358 in
      Fig.3b) accomodated in the transversal hollows provided in the
      permanent magnets and the further windings (340 in Fig.3b)
      arranged around the permanent magnets are not used. In a preferred
      embodiment, each pulse sequence generated by the signal processing
      unit (382 in Fig.3a) and applied to a pair of opposite windings
      (324-338 in Fig.3a), arranged around the permanent magnets, is
      constituted by one or more pulses of a same type alternated to one
      or more pulses of a different type, wherein the number of
      consecutive pulses of the same type is random. In practice, the
      signal processing unit provides random the different type of
      generated pulses to its output terminals. <br>
      <br>
      In a manner similar to the one described in the preceding case,
      the pulse sequences cause a variation of magnetic flux linkage
      through this coil and an induced electromotive force with a very
      high power (e.g. some tens kW) results at the ends of the coil
      itself. Test results have shown that the voltage value at the ends
      of the induced windings is related to the difference between the
      amplitude of the low type pulse V<sub>L</sub><sub>H</sub>; for
      example, a difference of about 60V has been used in order to get
      220V voltage. Moreover, it should be noted that the electric
      generator described above does not wArm up, so that it is
      preferably used at atmospheric pressure without any cooling
      system. <br>
      <br>
      A person skilled in the art will of course be able to make many
      modifications and alterations to the electromagnetic device
      described above in order to satisfy local and specific
      requirements, all such changes remaining, however, within the
      scope of protection of the invention as defined by the following
      claims. <br>
