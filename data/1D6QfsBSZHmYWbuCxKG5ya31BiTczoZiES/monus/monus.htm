      <p>I was not searching for perpetual motion. If you think so, I
        must disappoint you. </p>
      <p>As an electrical engineer down to earth, and a long time
        research worker, I was very well aware, that there could be no
        such thing as perpetuum mobile. You can’t cheat the laws of
        nature. </p>
      <p>You can build a new type of prime mover, a new motor, or any
        mechanical device with one condition: the driving energy must
        come from somewhere. I will discuss the energy sources in
        Chapter 11 of this book. </p>
      <p>We cannot produce energy. We can only transform it from one
        form to another. How well we can transform is called efficiency.
        I have been looking for new and more efficient transformation
        possibilities. How I succeed, will now be presented to you. </p>
      <p>If you have an inquiring mind, and you will use my results and
        create more and practical machines, after first working them out
        on paper. All are unique, and working perfectly. In exposition I
        will be very critical of myself. If you will follow my guiding
        principles, you must succeed. In case of failure, look for cause
        in yourself. </p>
      <p>For some explanations I must use mathematics. I have tried to
        curb it to a minimum. If you are not mathematically inclined,
        please skip over the calculations. This will not affect you
        final work. A practically minded person can succeed as well
        without it. </p>
      <p>Finally I will be very happy if I will; hear from you. </p>
      <p>And now to work! </p>

      <p>The idea of getting something for nothing is as old as man’s
        discovery of the basic rules of elementary mechanics. The
        invisible magnetic forces, which had provoked the inquiring
        minds, played a substantial role in this heretofore
        unsuccessful, fruitless hunt. When an ordinary horse-shoe or bar
        magnet can catch a piece of iron, and hold it with astonishing
        force, the question is obvious, could not the same force provide
        useful work which will cost nothing beyond the price of the
        magnet? </p>
      <p>I cannot give you a straight answer. It could be an
        irresponsible talk, and eventually the upcoming generation could
        ridicule me. Moreover I cannot discredit my own work, which
        results I now want to submit to you. However, I owe to you some
        explanations before we start on the dilettante’s esoteric, but
        for the physicist or engineer, quite clear world of magnetism. </p>
      <p>Magnetism is a natural phenomenon which is governed by the
        known, or perhaps some as yet unknown, natural laws. First of
        these is the basic and universal law of conservation of energy.
        The energy conservation law is the pillar of the universe.
        Energy cannot be created and cannot be destroyed. No person has
        ever succeeded in doing it and no person ever will. The one
        thing we can do is transform energy from one state to another.
        This is what I did when I created my motors. </p>
      <p>It is a well known scientific fact that the permanent magnets
        are storehouses of energy, what we put in by magnetization. At
        least we must be able to recover part of this energy if the
        conservation law is to be upheld. </p>
      <p>I must warn you to be very critical of learning devices which
        are described elsewhere or even patented. The inventor can
        mislead you, perhaps not willingly, but by his own credulity or
        misunderstanding. This has been my experience. I have studied,
        rebuilt and tested dozens of inventions which turned out to be
        worthless. I want to spare you from any frustration or what is
        worse, wasting money and time. </p>
      <p>I would like to suggest that you not try to start with the most
        advanced forms of my motors. Although they have been running at
        my laboratory a long time, they are far from finished. They need
        a lot of experience and knowledge of electro-mechanics in design
        work and a well-equipped workshop for electronic impulse
        techniques. A good example is my timer-device, which will be
        difficult to build and correctly adjust without a good
        storage-oscilloscope. </p>
      <p>You need not use the same building materials I did. Any
        non-magnetic material will work, perhaps even wood. Balsa wood,
        the building material of airplane model builders will serve very
        well. You can use any type of magnets depending on your
        financial limitations. This question will be dealt with in
        detail in Chapter 2. </p>
      <p>I am of the opinion that the best way to start is to build the
        simplest form of my motors, i.e., the single-sided double action
        linear motor. It is also the cheapest. After you become
        thoroughly familiar with its working principles and rules, you
        can go further. Who knows, you may get ideas and create
        something new and quite different from my motors. The principle
        is given by me, the remainder depends on your ingenuity. </p>
      <p>If you need more information, please look up the bibliography
        at the end of this book. I am convinced it will help you. </p>
      <p>Finally please excuse my form of expression. My choice of words
        was a difficult one. This booklet was intended for use by a wide
        range of readers, by experts as well as by hobbyists. The expert
        will be able to read beyond the lines. The hobbyist or
        amateur-scientist on the other hand will be able to understand
        it without difficulty. </p>

      <p>In everyday language matter is either magnetic or non-magnetic.
        Magnetism is a property possessed by certain materials. Actually
        all materials react in some slight degree to a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>Characteristic of magnetic behavior of materials is its
        permeability and coercivity. The first is the measure, how much
        better a given material is than air as a path for magnetic lines
        of force. Its symbol in mathematical formulas is u (the Greek
        letter of Mu). The second, the coercivity, is the measure of the
        resistance of the material against demagnetizing forces. Higher
        coercivity materials need higher demagnetizing force. </p>
      <p>The magnets are divided into two different classes: permanent
        magnets, which are magnetic materials so strongly magnetized
        that they retain the magnetism indefinitely, and electromagnets,
        which are temporary magnets consisting of a solenoid with an
        iron core and a magnetic field exist only while current flows
        through the solenoid. You will work with both of these magnets.
      </p>
      <p>The areas of a magnet where the magnetism seems most
        concentrated are called Poles. The north-seeking end of the bar
        magnet is called the North pole of the magnet (N) and the other
        end is called the South pole (S). Regarding the magnetic forces,
        like poles repel, unlike poles attract each other. Either pole
        attracts unmagnetized magnetic material. </p>
      <p>A magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field. This is a region of
        space where the effects of magnetism can be detected. </p>
      <p>Characteristic of each magnet is the strength of field which it
        generates, or field intensity, H. Another characteristic of the
        magnetic flux (Greek letter Phi), and flux density B which is
        the number of lines of force per unit area. </p>
      <p>Mathemathically the above characteristics can be written, </p>
      <p><img src="eq1-2.jpg" height="46" width="147"></p>
      <p>(1) B = Phi / A </p>
      <p>and </p>
      <p>(2) Phi = B.A </p>
      <p>where A is the area of the region. Please keep in mind these
        simple correlations. </p>
      <p>Another important characteristic of a magnet is the magnetic
        induction or flux which remains in a magnetic circuit after the
        removal of an applied magnetization force. This is the so-called
        remanence, its symbol is Bd. </p>
      <p>The magnetization force or magneto-motive force (mmf) which is
        analogous to the electro motive force of electric circuits (emf)
        of magnets is given in Ampere-turns. The symbol of
        magneto-motive force is M and abbreviation (mmf). You must
        remember that each permanent magnet could be replaced by its
        counterpart, an electromagnet with an adequate coil, that is to
        say Ampere-turns, which produce the same flux phi as the
        permanent magnet. Some times this is a very important
        simplification of calculations. </p>
      <p>In mentioning the analogy of magnetic and electric circuits,
        each magnetic circuit has a resistance against the magnetic
        flux, like the resistance of an electric conductor against
        current flow. Here it is called reluctance. Its symbol is R and
        is mathematically expressed: </p>
      <p><img src="eq3.jpg" height="34" width="183"></p>
      <p>(3) R = M / Phi </p>
      <p>When a volume of magnetic material is magnetized, energy is
        expended. When the magnetizing force is removed a portion of the
        energy is returned to the source of energy. Part of the energy,
        because of molecular friction in magnetized material is
        converted to heat. This heat is a waste of power and is termed
        hysteresis loss. For a magnetic material, the curve showing two
        values of magnetizing flux density B, as a function of magnetic
        force, or in other words, of magnetic strength H, one value when
        the magnetizing force is increasing and the other when it is
        decreasing, is called the hysteresis loop of the material. The
        hysteresis curve in other words represents the magnetic history
        of material. A typical hysteresis loop of a magnetic material is
        on Figure 1. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig1.jpg" height="263" width="275"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The most important part of this B-H loop is the left hand upper
        quadrant. The line O-B gives a picture of residual magnetism, or
        retentivity. For permanent magnets the manufacturers normally
        enclose this part of loop which can tell the consumer what he
        can expect from a given magnet. </p>
      <p>The two pole magnetism phenomenon shows that there must exist
        some symmetry in field form and consequently a symmetrical
        energy distribution in each magnet. </p>
      <p>The energy that we put into one magnet by magnetization, </p>
      <p>(4) </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq4.jpg" height="31" width="151"></p>
      </center>
      <p>where V is the volume of the magnet, B is the flux density M<sub>r</sub>
        the permeability of material and M<sub>o</sub> is the
        permeability of air. </p>
      <p>All permanent magnets or permanent magnet systems, relative to
        the stored energy in the system, have a symmetry point or better
        yet a symmetry wall, where the polarization of domains changes
        by 180°. This must not necessarily be identical with the
        symmetry axis or point of the system. This fact has a very
        important consequence. Because the symmetrical energy
        distribution of magnetic forces (attractive or repulsive)
        depending on this symmetrical energy distribution to introduce a
        magnetic material object to the field, will produce as much work
        as will be required to remove that object from the field. There
        can be no energy gain, no matter if one magnet, or a system of
        multiple magnets mutually positioned in whatever manner is
        involved. Therefore by calculations of movement of any
        ferromagnetic material of arbitrary shape in a magnetic field,
        the effect of the energy of the whole system must be considered.
        This point is where most mistakes occur for many investors and
        hobbyists who think that an unsymmetrical positioning of magnets
        can produce perpetual motion. This mistake is sometimes made by
        the Patent Offices also granting patents for equipment which
        cannot work. </p>
      <p>The force exerted by one magnet to another divided by a gap of
        area A<sub>g</sub> is: </p>
      <p>(5) </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq5.jpg" height="43" width="173"></p>
      </center>
      <p>For a given magnet or system of magnets (a magnetic track), we
        can plot the curve of this force in a diagram. He force curves
        give us a proper view of how this magnet can perform usable
        work. Such curves are depicted for a bar magnet in Figure 2.
        They are the so-called force-distance diagrams which give us a
        perfect image if driving power along the considered magnet. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig2.jpg" height="234" width="393"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Figure 2 shows that the force distribution to the zero force
        point is symmetrical along the whole magnet. The shaded areas
        under the force curves are proportional to the energy
        distribution along the magnet. If a magnetic object will enter
        into this system field from one pole side with a kinetic energy
        To, after passing the field, it will possess the same energy as
        when entering. This is no energy gain. On the contrary, the
        energy will be less if the frictional forces will be considered.
      </p>
      <p>It will be very edifying to look at an example, where there is
        no one single magnet, but a certain magnetic rack, composed of
        multiple magnets positioned with progressively increasing gaps
        in between them. See Figure 3: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3 ~</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig3.jpg" height="211" width="339"></p>
      </center>
      <p>From Figure 3 it is apparent that the zero point in this case
        is shifted to the left. It is no longer in the symmetry axis of
        the system if geometrical symmetry is considered. The maximum
        values of the magnetic forces are different. Nevertheless the
        shaded areas, which represent the energy on both sides from the
        zero force point are the same in magnitude. Consequently there
        is again no net energy gain by any magnetic object passing
        through the field. </p>
      <p>The same is valid for a mechanism which may work by shading the
        magnetic field. It could be done by ferromagnetic materials only
        which must be introduced and again removed from a certain field.
      </p>
      <p>How we can overcome the above difficulties we will discuss by
        constructing my motors. </p>

      <p><b>(A) Magnets:</b> </p>
      <p>The magnets are divided into two main groups: permanent magnets
        and electromagnets. Building my motors, you will work with both
        sorts. The electromagnets will be discussed in Chapter 6. </p>
      <p>The permanent magnets can be divided into three main groups:
        metal, powder and ferrite groups. </p>
      <p>In the first group fall the hard steel and cast alloy magnets.
        They are sold under different commercial names: Alnico,
        Permaloy, Cunife, Martensitic Steel, etc. The common
        characteristic of these metal magnets is the very high cost. The
        cast alloys must be ground to size while the hard steels are
        readily machined. They have high field intensity and are able to
        produce high flux. Their disadvantage is that they are very
        sensitive to external demagnetizing forces. Under mechanical
        influences like shaking oir hammering, they rapidly loose their
        magnetization. They need a soft iron keeper across their poles,
        or they will very soon dissipate the stored energy to the
        surroundings. Improperly polarized external magnetic fields
        could destroy them in a matter of seconds. Briefly, they are
        suitable, clean, but expensive and need expert handling. I very
        seldom use metal magnets for my experiments. My main use of them
        was for field adjustments and removing loads from my permanent
        magnet tracks. Of the second group, the most important are the
        rate-earth magnets. If you need very high power and small size
        you must use them. They are the smallest size giants among all
        the magnets produced today. They offer performances that some
        years ago engineers and technicians would never have dreamt.
        They are almost immune to self demagnetization and have an
        unusually high energy output. Hey are specified mainly for rotor
        applications, especially where the rotor must run upwards on a
        slope. </p>
      <p>Of the rare-earth magnets the most common used and known are
        the Cobalt-rare earth magnets, such as the Crucible Magnetics
        Srucore-12 series. They are available in ring, disk, square or
        arc forms. Their price high and for higher performances they are
        indispensable. Unfortunately, experimentation in magnetics is a
        costly business. </p>
      <p>The low energy plastic bonded iron powder magnets include first
        the rubber flexible magnets. They can successfully replace the
        Barium-ferrite ceramic magnets which will be discussed later.
        They are cheap, easily workable and can be bent into any shape.
        The energy stored in a volume unit is comparable with those of
        Barium-ferrite magnets. They are suitably stable, not sensitive
        to external fields and other demagnetization effects like rough
        mechanical handling. </p>
      <p>The only disadvantage of flexible rubber magnets is that they
        are produced as flats of a maximum thickness of 0.250 inches,
        magnetized through thickness. For higher energy requirements,
        therefore, they must be put as layers for the necessary
        thickness. My permanent magnet tracks need a magnetization
        through the width. Nevertheless, lately I use this type of
        magnets almost exclusively. </p>
      <p>The work horses of permanent magnet tracks are the ferrite
        magnets. The most commonly used are the Barium-ferrite ceramic
        magnets. They are readily available, reliable and cheap. You can
        buy them in almost any desired form. You will mostly need
        rectangular and ring magnets with holes. </p>
      <p>The Barium-ferrite ceramic magnets are very stable and are
        almost immune to demagnetizing forces, also. They have good
        power output and are easily mounted. Coupling up makes possible
        construction of any desired track size. Their only disadvantage
        is brittleness. They must be handled with care. </p>
      <p>The Barium-ferrite ceramic magnets are produced as isotropic
        which means that their magnetic properties are the same value
        along their axes in all directions. They can also be
        anisotropic, which means they have better magnetic
        characteristics along one axis than any other. It is obvious
        that for permanent magnet tracks the anisotropic magnets are
        better because they have a certain flux concentration in one
        direction inherently. Another interesting properly of
        Barium-ferrite magnets is that they have an almost straight line
        demagnetization characteristics. </p>
      <p>In designing and building permanent magnet motors, the
        selection of proper type of magnet is important. You can save or
        lose money for no reason at all. At the end of this book you
        will find sources where you can buy any kind of magnet for your
        construction. </p>
      <p><b>(B) Other Construction Material:</b> </p>
      <p>For connecting, supporting and holding your magnets you will
        need different magnetic and non-magnetic materials. </p>
      <p>The magnetic materials are the so-called soft magnetic
        materials which become magnetic only after contact with a
        permanent magnet or magnet field. Ordinarily cold-drawn steel is
        generally used because of its low cost and general availability.
        You will use mainly flats and strips. Here the only requirement
        you must comply with is that the material must be well cleaned.
        The surfaces that will be in contact with magnets must be well
        sanded. You must not forget: better contact, better performance.
        Other than contact surfaces must be protected against corrosion
        by covering with a suitable paint. </p>
      <p>I suggest that prior to cutting or machining soft magnetic
        materials that you will use for electro-magnets as core
        material, that you heat it up to cherry-red and let it cool down
        slowly. With this heat treatment, the steel will be softer and
        better usable as core material. </p>
      <p>For fastening, brass material and screws must be used
        exclusively to avoid unnecessary flux leakages. A steel screw
        flux leakages. A steel screw through a hole in ceramic magnets
        is like a shorted electric circuit. You must absolutely avoid
        them. </p>
      <p>Covering materials for tracks, plastics must be used. One 1/8
        inch plexiglass sheet will do it. You can use material other
        than Plexiglas but the friction relations will be changed.
        Nonmagnetic metal sheets, like aluminum, brass, etc., are more
        expensive and have the disadvantage of slightly weakening the
        magnetic flux and are expensive. Plastic material is more
        transparent for magnetic flux. </p>
      <p>For rotor (roller) coverage you can use a plexiglass tube of 1
        and 1/8 inch ID, although covering is not absolutely necessary.
        The ceramic magnet rings have a hard and ideally smooth surface.
        If properly adjusted they will run well without any cover also.
      </p>
      <p>Brackets, feet, supports could be made from any non-magnetic
        material. The best again are plexiglass or aluminum. Plexiglass
        could be very easily glued together and aluminum can be bent
        into any shape. </p>
      <p>The beauty of my advanced types of permanent magnet motors is
        that they can be built from any non-magnetic material. Except
        for the shaft, electromagnet and ceramic magnets, the whole
        motor could be built from wood. If Balsa will be used, your
        motor will be bantam weight. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Permanent Magnet Linear Motor</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This motor is a single sided double action motor. The
        propulsion is primarily from the interaction of the fields of
        the moving magnet and the track. The theory of how it works will
        be discussed in the next chapter. This chapter will give
        instructions on how to build it. See Figure 4. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig4.jpg" height="674" width="422"></center>
      <p>The permanent magnet track 1 of the motor is built from ceramic
        Barium-ferrite permanent magnets such as Indiana General Index
        1-F-1201. You will need 31 x 5 totaling 155 pieces. Each magnet
        measures 1 x 3/4 x 3/16 inch thick. </p>
      <p>The magnets will be set up in blocks of 5 pieces, N pole facing
        S pole. It is impossible to set them up differently because the
        magnet will automatically jump to the correct direction. Two
        flat bars, 3/4 x 1/4 inch, from cold drawn steel will be cut to
        3 inch lengths. After thoroughly sanding all surfaces, the
        medians of the flat bars will be divided and marked by 1 inch
        distances. The first mark starts from 1/2 inch from one end of
        bars. The markings will be 3/16 inch clearance holes. </p>
      <p>The five magnet blocks will now be sandwiched between the two
        flats all oriented in the same manner, so that one of the flats
        of soft iron will be a N magnetic pole. For fastening use 3/16 x
        1 and 3/4 inch length brass bolts. Because like manner oriented
        magnet blocks repel each other, the setting is difficult. The
        best way is to start with the two end blocks and after fastening
        with bolts to push one block after the other into the gap. Be
        careful, if you reverse only one of the blocks, what can happen
        very easily is, because the reversed polarity blocks attract
        each other, your track will not work. After fastening all blocks
        with bolts, the driving part of your track is ready. One flat
        will now be the N pole and the other an S pole. </p>
      <p>Three inches from both ends of flats holes will be drilled and
        threaded for 5/16 inch bolts. They will carry the track on
        brackets. The bolts will pass through 1 inch long spacers and
        wing nuts. </p>
      <p>The track top will be covered by a 1/8 inch thick and 36-1/2 x
        3 inch plexiglass sheet. One end of the sheet will be flush with
        the end of the track. The other end extends beyond the track by
        5-1/2 inches. Beneath the track a similar sheet 31 x 3 inch with
        both ends flush with the track end will be fastened. For
        fastening you can use small 4-40 x 1 inch brass screws. The
        track carrying brackets will be cut from 1/8 inch thick aluminum
        sheet. Sizes see Figure 4, labels 4 and 5. If you do not have a
        piece of aluminum sheet at hand, a piece of plastic or wood will
        do also. Of course, you must comply with the sizes as given in
        Figure 4. The two brackets on front, labeled 4, must have a two
        inch long split for the holding bolts, enabling the adjustments
        of track towards the horizontal plane. </p>
      <p>As base plate a 41 x 6 x 1/2 inch plywood can serve. The
        brackets of the track could be fastened by wood screws to the
        base plate. </p>
      <p>If you desire a better appearance of your work, you can paint
        your base plate and brackets. </p>
      <p>The rotor (roller) will be constructed from three pieces of
        ceramic magnet rings, such as Indiana General Index 1-F-1403.
        Each one is one inch in diameter and 1/4 inch thick at its
        center point having a hole of 3/8 inch diameter pushed through
        their central holes. The roller must be clean and well adjusted
        to avoid wobbling on the track. It must run smooth and
        noiselessly. Noisy running means poor alignment, the roller has
        some eccentricity. Remember that any other similar circular
        motion requires power, and this will be taken from the kinetic
        energy of the rings. Therefore, there are losses which, if of
        substantial magnitude, can disturb the proper functioning of
        your motor. </p>
      <p>If you want to avoid this kind of trouble, you can press the
        three tings, after previously adjusting on its shaft, into a
        plastic tube of 1-1/8 inch ID and 1-1/4 inch OD. The ends of the
        tube can be cut by both ends about 1/8 inch longer and covered
        with a round piece of plexiglass sheet. </p>
      <p>Although the above measures are not absolutely necessary, the
        motor will work well using uncovered roller also. If you still
        want to use a covered roller, it will be necessary to finish off
        the far end of the track with a small plexiglass plate
        positioned high enough so that it will not prevent the free
        passage of the roller beyond the track, but it will prevent it
        from falling off the track. The tube cover therefore represents
        a gap between the track end and the roller magnets which in turn
        weakens the attractive force between them. What can happen if
        this is the case, you will learn in the next chapter. </p>
      <p>If you are less pretentious, you can build a simple track using
        flexible rubber magnets like 3M Plastiform Brand, or other
        products. See Figure 5. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 5</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig5.jpg" height="711" width="428"></center>
      <p>Two pieces of soft iron strips, labeled 2 in Figure 5,
        measuring 1/2 x 3/4 x 26 inch length, will be cut to size. On
        the one end of both flats will be a part of 1/4 inch width in
        depth of 2-1/4 inch cut off. After assembling this will form a
        fork, one inch width, for catching the roller. </p>
      <p>In between the two flats will be sandwiched two strips of
        permanent rubber magnets of two feet length. Thus each of the
        rubber magnets measures 1/2 x 1/4 x 24 inches in length. The
        magnets are magnetized through its thickness. Both together will
        form a square cross-section bar of 1/2 by 1/2 inch size. One bar
        surface will be polarized as N pole and the other as S pole.
        After setting the magnets between the flats, the whole track
        will be held together merely be magnetic forces; no fasteners
        will be needed. </p>
      <p>The top of the track could be covered by a 1/8 inch thick
        plexiglass sheet, labeled 6 in Figure 5, of 2 x 29 inch in size.
        One end of this glass cover will be set flush with the far end
        of the track. The other end extends beyond the track about 3
        inches. The bottom cover of size 24 x 2 inches, will be set
        flush with the far end of the track. The other one will extend
        about 1/4 inch beyond the rubber magnet over the fork part of
        the track. For fastening the covers to the track, small screws
        (brass) 4-40 one inch long, may be used. </p>
      <p>The positioning of the track carrying bolts and bracket sizes,
        you may find in Figure 5. </p>
      <p>The roller is the same three ring magnet as was described for
        the 31 inch track. </p>
      <p>Despite its simplicity and low cost, this small motor will
        perform well, of course with less power than the 31 inch ceramic
        magnet track. </p>
      <p>After finishing the assembly work, the surfaces of glass coves
        must be cleaned thoroughly using a good plastic cleanser. </p>
      <p>The finished motors must be set horizontal on a suitable
        tabletop and they will be ready for running. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Chapter 4</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">How It Works</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>It is a well-known fact that the purely magnetic forces cannot
        be used to provide continuous motion. A permanent magnet can
        perform work only: </p>
      <p>(a) if mechanical work will be used for replacing the magnet to
        repeat the cycle; </p>
      <p>(b) If an external force field will interact to restore the
        initial state; </p>
      <p>(c) If electromagnetic force will be used which will change the
        permanent magnet field conditions. </p>
      <p>The first condition is generally known. This is for example
        what we do when we lift a piece of iron from the table by a
        permanent magnet. Classical examples are the permanent magnet
        chucks. </p>
      <p>The second condition is widely used in DC permanent magnet
        motors or in AC reluctance or hysteresis motors. </p>
      <p>The third condition is somewhat less known. The most common
        example is a permanent-electro chuck. </p>
      <p>The impossibility of creating continuous motion by using purely
        magnetic forces was already discussed in Chapter 1. The cause is
        the symmetry law. How can we overcome the symmetry law and
        create uni- or bi-directional motion merely by using permanent
        magnets? </p>
      <p>The aforesaid symmetry law and energy conservation law enables
        us to use these phenomena under certain circumstances, for
        generating unidirectional or bi-directional motion. </p>
      <p>To understand the function of the Permanent Magnet Linear
        Motor, we may discuss the force-distance characteristic curves
        of the track. They are similar to Figure 2 and are depicted in
        Figure 6 for our track. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 6</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig6.jpg" height="648" width="371"></center>
      <p><b>Figure 7</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig7.jpg" height="239" width="365"></center>
      <p>The roller is placed at the launching point of track A and held
        there. At this point the roller has a potential energy,
        represented by pulling power P between track-roller separated by
        a gap g of area A (square meter); Equation (5b). </p>
      <p>(5b) </p>
      <center><img src="eq5b.jpg" height="42" width="178"></center>
      <p>From the force distance curves in Figure 6, it is apparent that
        this force is symmetrical to the symmetry axis of the track. </p>
      <p>After releasing, influenced by the track’s attractive power,
        the roller will start rolling toward the track. Since both the
        magnetic force on the roller and the roller’s weight constrain
        the roller to remain on the plexiglass cover. The horizontal
        propulsion on the roller comes from the interaction of its
        magnetic field with the change in the magnetic field through
        which it passes. </p>
      <p>The work done moving the roller along the first half of the
        track is: </p>
      <p>(6) W<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub> s<sub>1</sub> </p>
      <p>This work will be equal to the work done along the second half
        of the track where the roller, because of the change of the
        direction of magnetic forces, will be decelerated: </p>
      <p>W<sub>1</sub> = W<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>(7) P<sub>1</sub> s<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub> s<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>The roller will be accelerated from starting point A toward the
        end of track B, and it continues to accelerate propelled by the
        track forces toward the midpoint C. As the roller approaches
        this point, the propelling force diminishes and finally
        vanishes. However, the roller does not stop at the point C,
        where the field because of the momentum it possesses.
        Overshooting the point C, the roller continues toward the far
        end of the track and gradually decelerates. Its potential energy
        at point A was changed by its acceleration to kinetic energy.
        From point C it started changing back again to potential energy.
        To point D it arrives possessing kinetic energy gained in
        section A-C, less the energy losses by rolling friction on the
        track surface E<sub>r</sub>, and by introduction E<sub>i</sub>.
        Thus, </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq8.jpg" height="29" width="256"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Suppose that the plexiglass covering of the track extended
        beyond the point D. Then the roller because of its momentum will
        overshoot the track end a t D, and continue to move toward point
        E until its kinetic energy vanishes. It will come to stop when:
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq9.jpg" height="33" width="260"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If the losses E<sub>r</sub> and E<sub>i</sub> are significant,
        then the roller will stop at a distance beyond the point D,
        equal to distance A-B on the launching pad. After stopping, it
        will start moving back towards the neutral point C and the cycle
        will be repeated. The roller will oscillate to and fro over the
        track until the energy will be exhausted by the losses. </p>
      <p>If the rigid support at point D will be removed by cutting the
        glass over flush with the track end, the roller, when reaching
        this end will drop because of its own weight. It will lose
        potential energy in the earth’s gravitational field, E<sub>h</sub>
        = mgh, which will be transformed to kinetic energy T<sub>h</sub>.
        Thus its kinetic energy beneath the track at point D' will be: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq10.jpg" height="30" width="262"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Now there are two possibilities: </p>
      <p>(1) The momentum of the roller beneath the track at point D
        will be larger than the pulling power of the track and it will
        fall down from the track. </p>
      <p>(2) The momentum of the roller will be smaller than the pulling
        power of the track and the roller will be held only the
        plexiglass sheet beneath the track. In section D'-C', it will be
        accelerated back toward the launching end, arriving to the point
        B' with kinetic energy: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq11.jpg" height="26" width="253"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If the energy, i.e., the momentum of the roller is sufficient,
        it will run around the end B' and crash into the launching
        section where the motion will cease. See Figure 7. </p>
      <p>The frictional resistance beneath the track is less than that
        on the top of the track. The frictional resistance P<sub>c</sub>
        of a rolling cylinder: </p>
      <p>P<sub>c</sub> <sub>Top</sub> = k / r .G </p>
      <p>depends besides the radius of cylinder <i>r</i> and the
        friction coefficient <i>k</i> as well as on the weight of
        cylinder G. Therefore: </p>
      <p><img src="11x.jpg" height="87" width="204"></p>
      <p>where <u>P</u> is component of the magnetic forces, vertical
        to the track surface. </p>
      <p>The system as described is working as a single-sided,
        double-action permanent magnet linear motor, with interrupted
        cycle. The picture of the experimental model is Figure 8: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 8</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig8.jpg" height="97" width="388"></center>
      <p>This type of permanent magnet linear motor was built by me in
        different forms and lengths and with different types of magnets.
        All are working perfectly, without any trouble. The correct
        leveling and the correct setting of starting point A are
        important to its operation. If the gap between point A-B is too
        small, the roller cannot pick up sufficient energy and will be
        returned from point D without dropping below the track. The same
        thing will happen if the track is not leveled correctly. </p>
      <p>You can perform many experiments with this simple motor. A very
        interesting one is the following: </p>
      <p>The track will be leveled. The roller after releasing from
        launching point A will run around the track and crash into the
        space beneath point B. Now to the track will be given a slight
        elevation by adjusting the front brackets. The roller must now
        overcome a small slope. It must always be started from the same
        distance from point B. To ensure this condition, a piece of
        small wood or plexiglass bar could be put across the launching
        pad of the motor at point A and fastened by a piece of masking
        tape. The roller could be started from this wooden bar, thus
        always the same distance from B. To ensure this condition, a
        piece of small wood or plexiglass bar could be put across the
        launching pad of the rotor at point A and fastened by a piece of
        masking tape. The roller could be started from this wooden bar,
        thus always the same distance from B. The elevation will be
        slightly raised each time. At one point the slope will be too
        high and the roller will not be able to overcome it. It will be
        returned from Point D without dropping below track. You will
        allow the roller to run down until it will overshoot point B.
        Before it will come to a stop, you will catch it and quickly put
        it back to the starting mark and release it. The second time the
        roller will overrun the slope without difficulty and on the
        bottom surface will return to point B. You can repeat this
        experiment many times and you will notice that if the roller is
        launched after running back, it will possess more energy than at
        the first time. I discovered this fact by experiment action. </p>
      <p>The explanation of this seemingly peculiar phenomenon is
        straightforward. The energy conservation law teaches us that
        energy could not be lost. At the start, the roller possesses a
        certain intrinsic magnetic energy. It is inherent with its
        magnetization. By running over the magnetic track, which has a
        larger field strength, i.e., higher energy content than the
        roller, the roller will be further magnetized. It will pick up
        energy from the track. In engineering language, its working
        point on the magnetization curve will be steadily changed. A
        good analogy is the magnetization of a steel bar by rubbing with
        a permanent magnet. </p>
      <p>After removing the roller from the field of the track, the
        energy gained by induction will not be dissipated instantly.
        There is a certain relaxation effect. A short time delay is
        needed until the magnet will return to its quasi-steady
        magnetization level. Consequently, in a short time the field of
        the roller, i.e., the flux that it produces, will be stronger
        than it was before passing the track field. Because the
        attractive power (Equation 5) depends on the square of the flux
        density, the second time a larger force will interact with the
        track field, the acceleration of the roller will be greater.
        With increased acceleration, the momentum of the roller will be
        increased also. Thus, the roller will possess more kinetic
        energy to overrun the slope. </p>
      <p>I have no knowledge that this phenomenon was utilized elsewhere
        before this time. Perhaps you will develop some new
        applications. Think about it! </p>
      <p>This single-sided, double-action permanent magnet motor has
        perplexed not only ordinary people, but professors of physics
        and engineers as well. At first glance, it resembles something
        bordering on the impossible. </p>
      <p>This principle and model can serve as a basis for manufacturing
        dozens of different toys, where unidirectional or bi-directional
        motion is required. It is simple to build, clean, safe and needs
        no external power source. It is the first known successful
        permanent magnet motor. </p>
      <p>It is an excellent teaching aid for schools. </p>
      <p>Further, it can serve as a carrier for short distances. The
        distance could be extended by cascading stages as you will learn
        in Chapter 8. </p>

      </center>
      <p>From the point of view of physics, the question now is: can we
        increase the kinetic energy of the roller so much as to overcome
        the attractive forces of the track and escape from its field? In
        the previous chapter, we mentioned that if the kinetic energy of
        the roller at point D' will be larger than the attractive force
        of the track, it will drop down from the track. By applying a
        propelling force, the kinetic energy of the roller is the
        function of its mass and the square of its velocity. By using
        modern magnetic materials such as Barium-ferrite or rare-earth
        magnets, the magnetic forces could be substantially increased.
        In this case, the mass of the roller could also be increased.
        The result would be that by using the earth’s gravity as an
        external force, the roller will run down from the track and out
        of the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>By proper matching of the components, the rotor can gain
        potential energy which can be used for removing it from the
        track. To overcome higher elevations, progressively larger
        accelerations are required in the initial launch to get the
        roller to the far end of the track. Besides stronger track
        field, it is necessary to shift the equilibrium point of the
        track away from the midpoint, toward the far end of the track.
        Thus, the roller will be accelerated for a longer time. The
        shifting of the equilibrium point can be done by adding an
        auxiliary track which is mounted over the far end of the main
        track (double-sided motor), where deceleration of the roller
        will take place without this track. See Figure 9. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 9</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig9.jpg" height="256" width="488"></center>
      <p>The added auxiliary track, as is apparent from Figure 9, will
        shift the equilibrium point by a distance Ds from C1 to C2,
        toward the track’s far end. The consequence is that the roller
        can accelerate for a longer time on the main track and its
        momentum will be greater. Thus it can climb a slope and gain
        larger potential energy in the earth’s gravitational field, Eh.
        After rounding the far end of the track at D, it will return to
        the launching end, rolling along the track’s bottom surface. It
        will gain speed during its descent and at point B’ will fall
        from the track and run out from the track field. </p>
      <p>This system equipped with an auxiliary track is equivalent to a
        double-sided, double-action linear motor with an interrupted
        working cycle. </p>
      <p>You can build it in the same manner as the single-sided,
        single-action motor. The dimensions of the tilted plane motor
        can be seen in Figure 10. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 10</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig10.jpg" height="306" width="445"></center>
      <p>For the main track, use two soft iron strips of 36 x 1 x 1/4
        inch sizes. They will be divided for 46 magnets per 3/4 inch
        distances. The first hole will be 3/8 inch from end of flats.
        The magnets in five piece blocks will be sandwiched now with its
        width parallel with the strips. For a total of 46 blocks per 5
        pieces, you will need 230 magnets held in place by means of 3/16
        x 2 inch brass screws. </p>
      <p>The auxiliary track will be built sandwiching 18 blocks of the
        same magnets between two soft iron strips 1 x 1/2 x 14 inch
        lengths. You will need a total of 70 magnets. The polarity of
        both tracks must be the same as was described by the
        single-sided motor. When the auxiliary track is positioned over
        the main track, they must repel each other. </p>
      <p>For the base plate you can use a 3/4 inch thick plywood plate
        48 x 10 inches in size. The brackets could be built from 3.8
        inch thick plexiglass sheet or from plywood. The auxiliary track
        must be adjustable at both ends, the main track by the far end.
        You must be able to change the elevation. In positioning, care
        must be taken to put the auxiliary track’s median exactly
        parallel with the median of the main track. </p>
      <p>As a roller, 3 pieces of cobalt rare-earth magnets of type
        Crucore T-250 will be used. The rare-earth magnet rings will be
        pushed through a plexiglass ring machined to size as it is given
        in Figure 10. The rare earth magnets are very brittle. They must
        be handled very carefully, otherwise they will break merely by
        slight forcing through the plexiglass. The ends of the ring
        could be closed by two plexiglass covers which will be glued in
        position. </p>
      <p>This tilted plane motor can be operated the same way as the
        single-sided motor. The auxiliary track must be adjusted by
        trial and error method. You must set it as low as possible,
        without locking the roller. Remember, the attractive force of
        the track changes with the square of the distance. A parallel
        setting with the main track may not necessarily be the best. It
        must be adjusted until the best acceleration will be obtained. </p>
      <p>My motor made to indicated size, is able to overcome a slope
        one inch per foot. The performance depends on the roller
        magnets, the smoothness of the surfaces, but mainly from correct
        adjusting of mutual positions of the tracks. </p>
      <p>There is a possibility to use Barium-ferrite rollers from the
        single-sided motor. The performance will be, of course,
        substantially changed. </p>
      <p>My motor was built and used for roller speed measurements. For
        this purpose, it was fitted apart with magnetic switches at two
        inches distance. The time data was transferred to a small
        computer and evaluated. The track performance was calculated for
        the acceleration and roller weight and track elevation. For
        simplifying the measurements, the motor was completed with an
        automatic roller return mechanism. This consisted of a
        plexiglass catcher covered with two small pieces of plastic foam
        to protect the plexiglass from the impact of the falling roller.
        A motor attached to the catcher rotates it upward so that the
        roller is deposited on the launch site again. The whole journey
        up the tilted track and down along the underside is repeated.
        This motion is perpetual as long as the motor redeposits the
        roller on the launch site. The photo of the motor is seen in
        Figure 11: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 11</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig11.jpg" height="146" width="397"></center>
      <p>Now we can pose a logical question: Can one build a device of
        this sort in which the roller will continually roll around the
        track without any assistance from an outside agent? Is it
        possible that once the roller is launched it climbs the tilted
        track, returns along the underside and then, because of its
        descent, has sufficient energy to round the bottom side to
        repeat the cycle? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Hard-core physicist will say a straight no! It was my
        opinion also, but today I cannot give you a straight answer.
        This is a toy of force vectors. The motor is a complex energy
        system where not only the magnetic, but also the inertial and
        gravitational forces are also involved in the operation. The
        first and the last are working as a simple exchange mechanism.
        But in the third, the inertia is form dependent also. This fact
        and other possibilities regarding the new and rapidly growing
        science and materials of the permanent magnet industry are
        urging us to be cautious with our statements. I leave this
        puzzle up to you. A few years ago my motors, prior to the
        discovery of ferrite ceramic magnets, belonged to the realm of
        impossibility. In the next chapter you will earn more about the
        removing one load from a magnetic track. Here I must warn you,
        be careful before you make any decision. You must always
        differentiate between power and energy. The energy must come
        from somewhere. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">How Can We Remove A Magnetic Load From A
              Permanent Magnet Track?</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>If a magnetic motor of the linear sort is to be employed in
        transporting material, the load probably would have to be
        removed from the track at some point. There are several ways in
        which this could be done: </p>
      <p>(a) by using external mechanical force; <br>
        (b) by using an external magnetic field; <br>
        (c) by using the rotor’s inertia and the earth’s gravitational
        forces; <br>
        (d) by using electromagnetic forces. </p>
      <p>To remove a roller or a load from a permanent magnet field
        using external mechanical force is straight forward. It needs no
        further explanation. </p>
      <p>Using a permanent magnet field to remove a load from a
        permanent magnet track is possible only to transfer the load to
        this, i.e., to the removing field. If we want to remove it
        without being caught by this external magnetic field, it is
        necessary to use an additional external force field of
        non-magnetic origin. This could be the earth’s gravitational
        field. The principle is depicted in Figure 12. It works as
        follows: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 12 ~ Removing a rotor from a permanent magnet track
          by using an auxiliary permanent magnet and the earth’s
          gravitational field.</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig12.jpg" height="307" width="392"></p>
      </center>
      The kinetic energy of the rotor, passing the track end is:
      <p>T= 1/2&nbsp; M.v<sup>2</sup>, </p>
      <p>And the force of inertia </p>
      <p>F<sub>i</sub> = M.v, </p>
      <p>Where v is the linear velocity and M mass of the rotor. Suppose
        this to be F<sub>i</sub> &gt; Fm. The rotor will continue in its
        linear motion decelerated by the force of the magnetic track F<sub>m</sub>.
        When F<sub>i</sub> becomes zero, the velocity v of the rotor in
        non-presence of other forces also becomes zero. Now under the
        influence of the track forces Fm, the rotor wants to move back
        toward the track 1. But the rotor 3 is under the influence of
        the earth’s gravitational force G also. If F &gt; G the track
        will pull back the rotor. This will fall beneath the track and
        will be accelerated backwards, as was described in Chapter 4. If
        we want to remove the rotor from the field of the track, it is
        evident that F<sub>i</sub> &gt; F<sub>m</sub>. This is possible
        only if we raise the rotor velocity <i>v</i>. The velocity is
        limited by the rotor and track masses, by the interacting
        magnetic forces, by the friction and eventually by the elevation
        of the track. Thus, the only possibility is, in these given
        parameters, to decrease Fm. It would be realized by adding an
        additional magnetic field Fm, which is polarized in such a way
        that it will counteract the track forces and result in a
        magnetic force F<sub>r</sub> = F<sub>m</sub> = F'<sub>m</sub>.
        This could be provided by a properly positioned permanent magnet
        2 of required flux density as is shown in Figure 12. The
        positioning of the auxiliary magnet 2 will be dependent on the
        desired path of the rotor after removal; See Figure 13. </p>

      </center>
      <p>This method is possible only if the rotor will lose potential
        energy G.h will increase its kinetic energy. If the track-rotor
        combination of masses and magnetizations will give the rotor a
        higher speed, i.e., more kinetic energy, we can remove it from
        the track field by merely using the earth’s gravitational force.
        The only criterion is that the magnetic field gradient on the
        end of the track must be modified in such a way that it will be
        lower than the normal non-modified field. The simplest physical
        realization of this method is depicted in Figure 14. </p>
      <p>The permanent magnet track will be extended by a soft-iron
        wedge, which will form an inclined plane. The width of the wedge
        must be as wide as the track or slightly wider. The length must
        be calculated in such a way that for the path of the rotor the
        value of G will be larger than that of the Fm. The magnetic
        field lines, because of the lower reluctance of the iron, will
        be more dense in iron than in the air. The flux will be shunted
        on the track end. Because of the decreasing mass distribution of
        the wedge, the field gradient of the magnetic forces induced in
        the iron will be changed in relation of the angle. If the angle
        is correctly calculated, the rotor driven down by the earth’s
        gravitational force on the inclined plane will gain kinetic
        energy, i.e., speed up and roll out from the magnetic field of
        the track. Here again the potential energy of the rotor G.h will
        be changed to kinetic energy. The removal from the field will be
        done at the expense of potential energy. </p>
      <p>This is a very simple way to remove a rotor (load) from a
        permanent magnet track, but it must be emphasized that it will
        work only if it is allowed to overcome the magnetic forces. </p>
      <p>An improved method invented by me for removing a rotor (load)
        from a permanent magnet track is in Figure 15. By this method
        part of the magnetic force field of the track is combined with
        the earth’s gravitational field and by way of a tilting plane
        and lever action kicks away the rotor from the track field. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The mechanism is arranged as follows; see Figure 16. </p>
      <p>The end of the permanent magnet track 6 is outfitted with a
        tilting plane 1 from non-magnetic material (plastic, brass,
        aluminum, etc.). This plane is firmly connected to shaft 3
        supported by two brackets 7 in such a way that the holes 2 in
        the brackets serve as bearings for the said shaft which can turn
        freely in these bearings. </p>
      <p>The shaft 3 is longer than the width of the track and is bent
        90 degrees in such a way that it forms a U-shape. Both ends of
        this shaft are outfitted by counterweights 4. The plane 1 is
        positioned to the track end in such a way that the shaft 3 is
        level or slightly lower than the upper surface of the track. The
        mechanism works as follows, see Figure 17. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 17 ~ Functioning of the Tilted Plane Rotor Remover</b>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig17.jpg" height="342" width="400"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The inclined plane 1 in absence of rotor 5 is held by the two
        counterweights 4 in a horizontal position. Acting on a rotor are
        F<sub>m</sub>&nbsp; the m.m.f. of the track, Fi the inertial
        force and G the earth’s gravity. The friction forces are
        neglected. Now the relation of forces are G &gt; F<sub>i</sub>
        &gt; F<sub>m</sub>. The rotor driven by the inertial force will
        enter the tilting plane 1 and will move away from the track end.
        At the beginning the tilted plane 1 is G &lt; ( G' x C ). The
        rotor will move further away from the track and come to a
        distance where ( G + F<sub>m</sub> ) &gt;&nbsp; ( G' x l ).
        Consequently by the lever action, the tilting plane will start
        to tilt downwards. This movement will be supported by the mmf of
        the track also which will pull the rotor toward the track end. </p>
      <p>The tilting angle and consequently the influence of G on the
        rotor will increase. It will lose potential energy and gain
        kinetic energy until the tilting plane and the rotor reach the
        base supporting plane where the force situation will be changed.
        The gravitational force G will be eliminated by the
        counteraction of the supporting base plane. The magnetic force
        Fm will be weaker than the action of the gravitational force on
        the two counterweights 4 by lever arm 1 and the angle. Thus, F<sub>m</sub>
        &lt; G<sub>x</sub> 1 x cos angle. The counterweights
        consequently will start to move downwards and by lever action
        will overcome at the already weakened mmf of the track and the
        friction forces. The tilting plane by its edge will kick away
        the rotor from the force field of the magnetic track. The
        mechanism will work like some height multiplier. The mmf will
        help to get the rotor out from its range equal to a higher
        potential energy lost in the earth’s gravitational field, which
        corresponds to its actual height loss h. It is necessary to
        remark that the described mechanism is inherently a toy of force
        vectors, and its parameters must be carefully computed,
        otherwise it will not work. Shifting the counterweights 4 along
        the shaft arm 3, i.e., changing the lever arm 1, gives us a
        certain possibility of adjustments, but not necessarily enough
        to correct malfunctioning. This experimental mechanism was built
        and tested by me and found working smoothly. The conditions to
        assure proper functioning of all the above mechanisms are: </p>
      <p>(a) The roller must possess enough kinetic energy to overshoot
        the track end by such a distance that the gravitational pull on
        the roller will be higher than the attractive force of the
        track. The movement on an inclined plane must be considered. The
        plane angle to the horizontal will substantially influence the
        forward component of the inertial force. </p>
      <p>(b) The mass of the roller (or of any moving load) must be
        adequate to fulfill conditions in (a). </p>
      <p>(c) The potential energy lost by dropping the roller heights
        must be larger than the kinetic energy that the roller would be
        able to gain from the magnetic field moving backwards from its
        momentum position toward the track end. This is a very important
        rule. You will learn it by experience. It is the key to your
        success. If a sufficient height loss can be allowed, the removal
        of the load is no problem. </p>
      <p>Another possibility of removing a rotor (load) from a permanent
        magnet track is using electromagnetic forces. This is the most
        sophisticated and convenient way. It gives us a means for
        adjusting the kinetic energy of the rotor by and after removal
        from the track as required. Although from the point of view of
        energetics, it is not the most economical and efficient way, its
        usefulness and advantages cannot be doubted. This method, which
        I invented, tested and used is as follows, see Figure 18: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 18 ~ Removing the Rotor from a Permanent Magnet Track
          by Using Electromagnetic Forces</b> </p>

      <p>The permanent magnet track 1 described and built according to
        Figure 1 is outfitted at its end by a magnetic switch 3 and a
        properly dimensioned electromagnet 4 which could be positioned
        as a part of the track, or could be placed a certain distance
        away from the track end, according to the purpose and form of
        the track. The magnetically operated switch (reed, magnetic
        pickup, or a Hall-effect switch) 2 and the coil of the
        electromagnet 4 are connected to a power supply and time 5. It
        works as follows: </p>
      <p>The decelerating field moving rotor 2 at the track end 1 at the
        moment when it passes the magnetic switch 3, sends out an
        electric impulse to the power supply-timer 5 and starts it. The
        triggered timer sends out a current impulse from the power
        supply, whose amplitude and duration is set exactly by the
        timer. This current impulse excited the coil of the
        electromagnet 4. The electromagnetic field of the excited coil
        counteracts with the field of the track, of the current flow
        direction is correctly set. This will cause a momentary
        weakening of the track field. The rotor, driven by inertia, will
        be able to pass the field. By properly setting the amplitude and
        duration of the current impulse, we can adjust the mmf acting
        upon the rotor and set its speed as required. </p>
      <p>Adjusting the speed of the roller is sometimes necessary. In
        motors where the roller is running on a circular track, without
        speed adjustment, it can roll out o the track and away. The same
        can happen with the oscillating motor also. </p>
      <p>The coil sizes and building steps will be discussed for the
        referred motors. The driving electronics, schemes and function
        require a separate Chapter 10. </p>
      <p>Conclusions of the rotor removal modes obviously indicate that
        to introduce a roller onto a track is more easily accomplished
        than to remove it from the track. About this subject, you cannot
        find too many references in classic literature, including the
        patent literature. I am virtually a pioneer in this discipline.
        My suggestions are not necessarily the only ones, but they
        proved to be valid and could serve as a starting point for you.
        Maybe you will be able to find other and better methods for your
        purposes. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that for any practical use,
        the permanent magnet motors, especially the linear motors, must
        be individually calculated and specifically designed. The same
        is true for method of removal. The purpose will dictate the
        method. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Oscillating Permanent Magnet Motor</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The self-oscillating induction linear motor is common in
        industrial uses. Oscillatory motion is widely required by
        textile, machine-tool and other industries. They are mostly the
        back-to-back induction motors, or the older type mechanically
        switched motors, using all of those purely electromagnetic
        forces. An AC linear induction motor has self-starting
        properties. My permanent magnet oscillating motor is inherently
        not self-starting, but it could give more economical
        performance. </p>
      <p>My type of permanent magnet oscillating motor differs from any
        currently known motors in that it makes use of the direct
        magnetic pull. </p>
      <p>The best analogy of the oscillating principle of these motors
        is a piece of iron weight, sized between two coil springs. See
        Figure 19: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 19 ~ Analogy of the Oscillating Motor</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig19.jpg" height="124" width="290"></center>
      <p>If the oscillation of the system depicted in Figure 19 is
        started by pulling the iron weight 1 to any side and released,
        the weigh will oscillate with progressive damping. A switched
        electromagnet 4 will be positioned near the oscillating weight.
        The electromagnet will be switched to a current source always at
        the moment when the iron weight approaches the electromagnet.
        The electromagnet will be energized with a short current impulse
        and the induced field will pull the iron weight toward the
        electromagnet. This pulling force will act only for a short time
        and supply to the oscillating weight a small amount of energy,
        just enough to replace the losses by material and air
        resistance. The system will oscillate with sustained amplitude
        forever, supposing the coil be supplied with electrical energy.,
        this is the basic principle of most electrically excited
        oscillatory motions. </p>
      <p>In my motor the spring is replaced by the magnetic field of a
        permanent magnet track. See Figure 20. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 20 ~ Principle of Permanent Magnet Oscillating Motor</b>

        <p><img src="fig20.jpg" height="279" width="413"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A permanent magnet track 1, similar to those of previously
        described linear motors, is covered by a plexiglass sheet 6. At
        one end of the track is placed an electromagnet 2, which is
        connected to an electronic timer and power supply 5. The time is
        triggered by a magnetic switch 3, which is operated by the
        magnetic field of the roller 4. Whenever the roller passes the
        switch, the magnetic field at the site is altered momentarily.
        After a short time delay the timer allows direct current to flow
        through the electromagnet 2 just as the roller approaches the
        end of the track. The field of the track and the friction of the
        roller on the track surface both are slowing the roller’s
        movement at this end. However, the field of the electromagnet,
        due to the current impulse, pulls the roller toward the
        electromagnet. The field of the track acts as the springs in the
        Figure 19. Were this additional field generated temporarily by
        the electromagnet not present, the roller would merely roll back
        and forth with dampening amplitude, until it lost all the energy
        in its motion and would stop. The purpose of the electromagnet
        is to supply some additional energy on each cycle. The current
        pulse height and duration is adjustable by the timer. The amount
        of this current is adjusted so that the energy it supplies the
        roller matches the loss of energy the roller experiences during
        the cycle. The result: the roller cycles indefinitely. </p>
      <p>You can build this permanent magnet oscillating motor as
        follows: See Figure 21. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 21</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig21.jpg" height="631" width="449"></center>
      <p>Two soft iron strips 1 x 1/4 cross section will be cut into 12
        and 1/2 inch lengths. After sanding, the strips will be marked
        for 16 holes of 1/16 inch clearance diameter. The first hole is
        set 3/8 inch from one end of the strips. The holes of one of the
        strips will be on one side counter-sunk, for heads of flat-head
        brass screws, 3/16 x 2 inch length. Two pieces of wooden bars,
        one of 1 x 1 inch and the other 2-1/2 x 1 inch cross-sections,
        will be cut to 12-1/2 inch lengths. They will be fastened to a
        23 x 7 x 3/4 inch plywood base plate, as marked in Figure 21.
        For the 12-1/2 inch long track, you will use a total of 80 flat
        ceramic magnets. The magnets will be set up as blocks of 5
        pieces and sandwiched between the strips in the same way as was
        described for the single-sided linear motor. One of the strips
        will be polarized again as N pole and the other as S pole. The
        strips with the magnets will be positioned upon the 2-1/1 inch
        wooden bar and by the brass wood screws fixed it to the 1 x 1
        inch bar as depicted in Figure 21, cross-section A-A'. </p>
      <p>The electromagnet is of soft iron construction made from two
        pieces of 2-1/2 x 2 x 1/2 inch thick soft iron flat bars. All
        sides of the two plates must be sanded and one surface 2-1/2 x 2
        inch which will be the top surface, must be polished. The core
        between the two plates, a 1-1/4 x 3/4 x 1 inch length iron
        block, must also be sanded and the two ends adjacent to the end
        plates polished. The contact surfaces of the core on the side
        plates must be polished also. Remember, any air gap, even the
        smallest, represents higher resistance for the magnetic flux,
        i.e., higher reluctance and obviously unnecessary losses. All
        three pieces of the electromagnet will be screwed together with
        a 3/8 x 20-3/4 inch long flat head machine screw. Two small
        holes of 1/6 inch diameter will now be drilled to one of the
        side plates for passing the magnet wires. The positioning of
        these holes is seen in Figure 21. One must be right by the core
        and the other one on the upper corner of the side plate. Before
        starting to wind, the core must be covered by one layer of
        electrical plastic tape. The side surfaces which will be in
        contact with the coil wires, in view in contact with the coil
        wires, in view of the low voltage used for excitation, must not
        be covered. The electromagnet is an unusual construction, where
        the iron material itself will serve as coil form. This has an
        advantage that the direct contact of coil wires with the iron
        walls of the magnet, the coil will be better cooled. Although
        relatively small currents are used, the warming up of the magnet
        will be moderate also. </p>
      <p>The coil of the electromagnet consists of 2000 turns of #28
        enameled magnet wires. After finishing the winding, the coil
        could be covered with one or two layers of electrical plastic
        tape. Leave enough long lead wires which could be soldered
        directly to the banana jack terminal after positioning the
        magnet to the track. The resistance of the finished coil will be
        about 60 ohms. </p>
      <p>The electromagnet must be positioned 1/2 inch from the track
        end. It could be held in place by means of four small plexiglass
        bars fastened to the base plate by small brass wood screws. They
        will form a small cage into which will fit the electromagnet. </p>
      <p>After covering the track surface and the electromagnet by a 1/8
        inch thick plexiglass sheet, the whole construction will be held
        firmly together. The ends of the cover glass will be curved
        slightly upwards by means of two wooden blocks to prevent the
        eventual runoff of the roller. </p>
      <p>On the cover glass about 2-3/8 inch from the electromagnet end
        of the of the track and about 1/2 inch of side, a magnetic reed
        switch, such as Radio Shack 275-802 or equivalent, will be
        positioned, by drilling two small holes for the lead wires of
        the switch. The lead wires must be soldered to the switch and
        after pushing through the small holes in the cover glass, the
        switch will be held in place by twisting the lead wires right
        below the switch. </p>
      <p>A piece of 1/8 inch thick plexiglass with 4 banana jacks will
        be a convenient supplement to the system. It could be fastened
        to the base plate, and the lead wires from the coil and magnetic
        switch to be soldered to the banana jacks. For the roller, the
        same 3 ring barium-ferrite magnets will be used. The roller must
        be prepared as it was described for the single sided linear
        motor. </p>
      <p>The Timer-Power supply is described and discussed in Chapter
        10. The timers are the same for all my motors, therefore it
        could be connected to the motor at the corresponding banana
        jacks. Coil leads to the output posts for the coil, and switch
        leads to the switch posts, by proper extension leads with banana
        plugs. After plugging in to a 120 V AC wall receptacle, the
        timer is ready for turning on. The motor could be set
        horizontally and started. </p>
      <p>You can start it by putting the roller on the glass cover at
        the end opposite the electromagnet and releasing it. The track
        will pull it instantly toward it zero force point. After
        overshooting the zero point the roller will pass the magnetic
        switch. A short flash on the timer’s indicator light will show
        that the system is working. The energized electromagnet will
        pull the roller off from the tack and the cycling will be
        started. </p>
      <p>The timer must be adjusted correctly. It was a built-in 10-turn
        potentiometer, which controls the pulse length and current in
        the coil of the electromagnet. If the current --- and
        consequently the field of the electromagnet --- is too small,
        then the roller’s motion soon damps out. If the field is too
        large, the roller is pulled so vigorously by the electromagnet
        that it shoots off the track. </p>
      <p>This type of oscillating permanent magnet motor was constructed
        and built by me for special purposes, such as for the measuring
        of the rolling friction of the roller on the track surface.
        Photo of the motor, see Figure 22. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 22</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig22.jpg" height="137" width="421"></center>
      <p>Obviously the motor in the presented form is not too efficient.
        The same system for technical applications could be constructed
        as a pendulum with a small air gap. This will improve the
        efficiency substantially. Remember, however, the system is not
        self-starting. </p>
      <p>I have not yet contemplated the technical applications of this
        type of permanent magnet motor. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Circular Track Motor, Cascading the
              Stages</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The permanent magnet track could be built in any shape. The
        roller will always follow the track median and will be held
        there by magnetic forces. The track could be provided in normal
        mode when the roller runs on the top surface, or inverted mode
        when the bottom surface is used as driver and guiding path. Or
        it could also be a combination of both. On the bottom surface as
        was discussed in Chapter 4, the friction is less than that on
        the top surface. The roller is hung up by the magnetic forces.
        Such an inverted motor will be more efficient than a normal mode
        which is understandable in view of the reduced friction. If the
        dimensioning of the magnets and roller is correct, we can keep
        the friction forces to a minimum value on the inverted motor. As
        a matter of fact, there the friction forces will be inversely
        proportional to the weight of the roller, so far as the track
        forces will be able to keep the roller hanging safely on the
        track. This arrangement gives to the projectors of high speed
        railroad some ideas worth thinking about. </p>
      <p>Until the present, I have not built such an inverted track. I
        have studied the performances and characteristics of my normal
        circular motors only. </p>
      <p>This circular motor is the most astonishing and amusing of all
        my motors. The rollers accelerates by an invisible force, whips
        around a curved track, is set free once again, and then with a
        sudden jerk is recaptured by the invisible force. Its path is
        only about 2/3 of the way over the magnetic track. About 1/3 is
        running along a free surface where there are no magnets. This is
        to the casual observer quite mesmerizing and mysterious.
        Although it is no mystery, if we realize that the empty space,
        though substantially distant from track ends, is filed with a
        magnetic force field which in turn influences the roller’s
        movement. To direct the roller’s path as desired is a matter of
        arrangement of the magnetic force lines, or, if you like, the
        forward component of the force field vector. Because the
        magnetization and weight of the rollers are different, one short
        part of the track is adjustable to balance these differences. </p>
      <p>My first circular motor had a 12 foot long oval shaped track
        with one 180 degree circular return bend. This track was too
        long for transporting and handling. I have shortened it piece by
        piece. My present small track has about one foot diameter and
        about two feet length. This is a very handy size to transport
        and demonstrate. If you want to study its function, this size is
        also sufficient. </p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is no limit to the track length. By cascading
        the stages, you can build any desired length and shape. You can
        cascade about four permanent magnet sections each ending with an
        electromagnet for releasing the roller to the next stage. We
        will discuss the rules and possibilities of cascading further. </p>
      <p>Before we discuss the function of a permanent magnet circular
        motor, here are the parameters and the instructions to build it.
      </p>
      <p>You must start with the building and assembling of the circular
        section. See Figure 23. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 23</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig23.jpg" height="667" width="473"></center>
      <p>From a 17 x 8-1/2 x 1 inch thick plywood cut out half a circle
        with a 7 inch radius, labeled 4 in Figure 23. Two strips from a
        #19 soft iron sheet, one 22 x 1 inch and the other 19 x 1 inch
        will be divided on its medians for 22 holes. The divisions on
        the 22 holes. The divisions on the 22 inch long strip will be
        per 1 inch, whereas on the 19 inch long strip, about 7/8 inch.
        The 22 inch long strip will be the outer side of the track and
        serve as flux concentrator, while the 19 inch long strip will be
        the inner side of the circular track. </p>
      <p>You will need a total of 110 pieces of flat permanent magnets
        for the circular section such as Indox 1-F-1201, 5 per block
        sandwiched between the two strips. They will be polarized in
        such a way that the outer strip will be the N pole and the inner
        strip will be the S pole. Before sandwiching the magnet blocks
        the strips must be bent to half-circle form. Because inserting
        the magnetic blocks to these circular strips is difficult, the
        best way is to start with the two end blocks and a middle block,
        press the track into the plywood form and fasten it with 3/16 x
        2 inch brass wood screws. Inserting the other blocks will be
        quite easy. The upper side of the track must be exactly in level
        with the upper face of the plywood support. This arrangement
        represents the circular section of the motor. </p>
      <p>After finishing and checking all magnets for correct polarity,
        the circular section will be mounted upon a 25 x 18 x ½ inch
        thick plywood base plate by using four legs 1 x 1 x 1 inch of
        wood or plexiglass. See Figure 23. </p>
      <p>The straight section (labeled 3) consists of 11 blocks if flat
        magnets, per 5 pieces in each block, which are sandwiched
        between two soft iron strips, 1 x ¼ x 8-1/2 inch in length. The
        divisions on strips will be per 7/8 inch for 3/16 inch diameter
        holes. The section will be supported by a 1 x 1 inch square
        wooden bar, 8-1/2 inch in length by means of 3/16 x 2 inch brass
        wood screws. After finishing, it will be provided on both ends
        with two legs 1 x 1 x 1 inch. One leg by the starting end will
        be rigidly fixed to the supporting wooden bar, while the second
        one will hold the section in line with the circular track,
        serving also as holder for a 1/4 x 2-1/2 inch long brass bolt
        which will act as a pivot, labeled 10, for turning the section
        toward or from the middle point of the tracks. This straight
        section will be mounted about ½ inch distant from the circular
        section end. The positioning or adjusting of the straight
        section is necessary for smooth running of the roller, otherwise
        centrifugal force can turn over and stop it. </p>
      <p>The electromagnet, labeled 6, is of the same construction as it
        was described for the oscillating motor (see Figure 21). The
        electromagnet will be positioned to the exit end of the circular
        section, with a gap of about ½ inch. The upper side of the
        electromagnet will be level with the surface of the circular
        section. After fastening it in position similarly as was done
        with the oscillating motor, the whole surface of the motor will
        be covered by a 1/8 inch thick and 24 x 17 inch size plexiglass
        sheet. At the opposite end from the permanent magnet track,
        where there is no support for the cover, it will be propped up
        by two legs of 1 x 1 x 2 inch and screwed down to the base plate
        by brass wood screws. </p>
      <p>The magnetic switch, such as Radio Shack 49-485, with contacts
        closed when the magnet engages, will be positioned about 4
        inches in from the end of he circular section, behind the
        electromagnet and about 1/2 inch away from the flux concentrator
        strip. He best positioning must be found by trial and error
        setting of the timer, which supplies the current to the coil of
        the electromagnet, from the field strengths of the track and
        roller magnets, the speed of the roller passing the switch. For
        my track the best setting was as is marked in Figure 23. The
        setting must be done with care. By setting the switch too close
        to the track, it will be excited from the track field and the
        contacts will be closed. This inhibits the functioning of the
        motor. The timer will be blocked in the absence of current
        pulse, and the roller will not be removed from the track but
        will be driven back by the magnetic field toward the neutral
        point. </p>
      <p>The roller is the same 3-ring ceramic permanent magnets as for
        the previous motors. The leads of the magnetic switch and the
        soil of the electromagnet will be soldered to the small terminal
        9 with banana jacks. </p>
      <p>Before the motor is connected to the timer, the surface of the
        cover glass must be well cleaned with some good plastic
        cleanser. </p>
      <p>The cleaned and completed motor will be put on a possible
        horizontal table. The timer leads will be connected to the
        terminal, and the timer power supply plugged into a 120 V AC
        wall socket. </p>
      <p>To start the motor, the roller must be put about 3 inches from
        the starting end of the linear section, upon the glass cover and
        released. If the roller after the releasing will suddenly turn
        on its vertical axis, the polarization is wrong. The start must
        be repeated by putting the roller with the correct polarity upon
        the glass cover. The released roller will be pulled instantly
        toward the linear section of the track. It will accelerate onto
        the track and toward the equilibrium point, and it will continue
        past the last blacks of magnets in the section. Once it passes
        the last block, it jumps over the narrow gap between the linear
        and curved section. There it will be again accelerated and
        pulled onto the circular track. Again it accelerates toward the
        equilibrium point of the section, overshoots it, and emerges
        from the other end of the section. Before it has a chance to be
        pulled back onto the circular section, it rolls over the
        electromagnet, triggered by the magnetic switch on the track.
        The pulse of DC creates a temporary magnetic field that pulls
        the roller toward the electromagnet, eliminating for a short
        time the track’s backward forces. The electromagnet works in a
        figurative sense, like a gate, which opens for releasing the
        roller from the track field. The pull of the electromagnet also
        supplies fresh energy t the roller, adjusting its speed to the
        requested level. </p>
      <p>The roller overshoots the electromagnet, whose field vanishes
        as the pulse supplied it turns off. The roller continues to roll
        out over the plane of plexiglass cover. The magnetic field of
        the linear section guides it towards the initial starting point.
        As it moves closer to the initial linear track, it is
        accelerated onto the track again. The whole cycle is repeated. </p>
      <p>For correct operation of the motor, the timer must be
        appropriately set and connected to the motor. If the field
        direction of the electromagnet will be opposite as is required,
        it will not support the roller’s forward movement, but on the
        contrary, will retard it. The roller will be shot back onto the
        circular track. In this case, the leads of magnets must be
        inverted. </p>
      <p>If the timer is not correctly set and the energizing impulse is
        too long, the roller will gain excess kinetic energy from the
        field of the electromagnet and its velocity will be too high.
        The higher centrifugal force in this case will overcome the
        track’s magnetic forces and the roller will run off the track.
        If the impulse is too short, the roller will not be released
        from the track and will run backwards from the magnetic end. The
        correct adjustments need time and patience. It could be adjusted
        at the built in ten-turn potentiometer of the timer. The
        adjusting of the pulse length must be made until the roller runs
        smoothly from the electromagnetic field and turns toward the
        starting point. If you have access to a good storage
        oscilloscope, this can help you very substantially. On the scope
        display screen you can see and measure the exact length and form
        of the gating impulse. After correct setting, mark the
        potentiometer for the future. If the timer was once well
        adjusted, the difference in case of changing the motor position
        or roller is only very slight. </p>
      <p>It will probably be necessary to adjust the straight section of
        the track also. This is so if the roller will jerk around its
        vertical axis before entering the accelerating field or will
        turn over and stay caught on the end of linear section. If this
        is the fall, the linear section must be pushed either toward the
        middle of the track or away from it, until the roller will enter
        the field smoothly. </p>
      <p>There is a further possibility however, the influence of the
        horizontal setting of the cover glass. If all of your efforts
        will not succeed and the roller will still run off the cover
        glass, the corner of the motor, which is opposite to the linear
        section, must be slightly elevated. The roller will be forced to
        run up a small slope and its speed will be reduced. Sometimes it
        helps to slightly prop up the foot of the linear section. They
        are all only emergency measures; if the timer is properly set,
        all of these steps will not be necessary. </p>
      <p>Eventually, you must learn how to operate this motor without
        trouble as I did it. If you will, I am sure you will be an
        expert very soon. </p>
      <p>This small motor can drive tow or more rollers also. However,
        more rollers need a longer track which is obvious. It is really
        an astonishing spectacle how the roller chase each other.
        Inevitable in weight and magnetization the rollers differ. As a
        consequence, one roller will run faster than the other one, and
        in a short time, will catch the slower one. Here is an open
        field for your experimentation. This small size portable track
        will give you many possibilities to study its working
        principles. The photo of this small circular track motor is in
        Figure 24. </p>

      If you want to build a longer track there is no technical limit.
      The limitations are only your access to proper space and the
      financial costs. You can build a track of any length, any shape
      and any desired power.
      <p>The length of the track could be extended by cascading stages.
        One stage can consist as much as four permanent magnet sections,
        followed by an electromagnet for gating the roller. The
        cascading of permanent magnet sections need some explanations.
        See Figure 25. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 25</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig25.jpg" height="563" width="397"></center>
      <p>You can put two, three or even four sections of permanent
        magnet tracks together in series. The length of the individual
        section is determined by the strength of the field produced by
        the section, i.e., sizes and numbers of magnets in blacks.
        Another factor is the size and weight of the roller (or if you
        use different load, the mass of this load). For starting your
        experiments, you can use linear sections of tracks, as was
        described for single sided linear motors, and for circular
        sections as was described above. Each of the stages must be
        followed by an electromagnet. You can use the same type as was
        described for the oscillating motor. The magnets could be driven
        by one timer, which is completed by a sequencer. Each magnet can
        also be driven by its own timer which is obviously a more
        expensive solution. The positioning of the magnetic switches is
        the same as was already described above. </p>

        magnet tracks together in series. The length of the individual
        section is determined by the strength of the field produced by
        the section, i.e., sizes and numbers of magnets in blocks. </p>

        magnetic switches is the same as was already described above. </p>
      <p>The cascading of stages has two main rules: </p>
      <p>(1) The gaps between the individual stages must be
        progressively narrower, see Figure 25. The first gap which is
        the widest must be followed by a narrower gap. Thus A &gt; B
        &gt; C &gt; D. </p>
      <p>(2) The field intensity of each section must be more or less
        the same or progressively higher as that of the previous
        section. </p>
      <p>The rules can be explained as follows; see Figure 26: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 26</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig26.jpg" height="250" width="411"></center>
      <p>In gap g between two permanent magnet track sections I and II
        by examining the force-distance curves, it will be apparent that
        they form a well A-O-B, with a deep point O. Point O is a
        neutral force point. The roller arriving at point A must possess
        sufficient kinetic energy to overrun the force barrier
        represented by curve A-O. In this gap section it will lose
        energy. In the section from neutral point to the track II, Point
        AB it will gain energy again and be accelerated. While running
        the tracks, the roller suffers energy losses by friction and
        induction. If the field strength of each section is equal, the
        roller arrives at each gap possessing less kinetic energy as it
        had at the previous gap. Consequently it will only be able to
        override a smaller force barrier as the previous one. By equal
        field strength of both track sections, this force barrier
        represented with curve A-O, depends on the gap width, g.
        Narrower gap means higher neutral point O and shorter slope A-O.
        After passing the neutral point O the pulling force of the next
        section, represented by curve O-B, will accelerate the roller
        toward the neutral point of the next section. </p>
      <p>By combination of field intensities and gap width, the roller
        can be driven over several sections for longer distances. By
        using one long single section, the driving distance will be much
        shorter. This is a very important fact. My first track similar
        to the one stage track in Figure 25 was 12 feet long. Sometimes
        it is necessary to shift the neutral point slightly to some
        direction, usually to the forward direction. In addition to the
        method already discussed, when using double sided motor, there
        is another possibility, shunting a certain section of the track
        with a piece of soft iron bar or plate. How shunting influences
        the positioning of the neutral point is shown in Figure 27. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 27</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig27.jpg" height="196" width="347"></center>
      <p>As a rule, shifting the neutral point by shunting a part of
        track by a soft iron bar, the following is true: The neutral
        point of the system will always be shifted toward the opposite
        direction from the shunted half. </p>
      <p>This is a point where most inventors make mistakes. They think
        if a part of the magnetic track is shunted, the rotor or roller
        will run toward this shunted part; however, the opposite is
        true. This fact is a straight consequence of the symmetry law?
        Confusing? </p>
      <p>Here must be mentioned yet the possibilities for diminution of
        rolling friction. The case of an inverted track was already
        discussed. If we cannot use an inverted track, the question is,
        does some other way exist to reduce the rolling friction of a
        roller running one the upper surface of a permanent magnet
        track? </p>
      <p>In Chapter 4 it was mentioned that the rolling friction
        depends, besides the surface conditions, on the weight of the
        roller and the magnitude of the vertical component of magnetic
        forces. The weight of the roller cannot be changed. The
        magnitude of the vertical component of the magnetic forces which
        held the roller on track, could be altered by changing the
        distance of the roller from the track surface. The force changes
        by the square of distance. The answer is downward curved track,
        covered by a rigid supporting plate, in our case with a sheet of
        plexiglass. See Figure 28. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 28</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig28.jpg" height="118" width="352"></center>
      <p>By using a curved track, the vertical component of the track
        force at end A diminishes. Its numerical value will be lowest if
        a symmetrical curvature is considered over the neutral point C.
        After passing the neutral point this component again increases
        and will have the original value at exit point B. This method
        was used by some inventors experimenting with permanent magnet
        tracks, without any explanations or misleading ones, if any. </p>
      <p>You now have an overall view of how you can build a circular
        track motor and at the same some ideas of further possibilities.
        The modifications and uses have no limit. You can drive a train
        around a curved track using the principle and rails; or you can
        use it for driving toy automobiles over a flat table, controlled
        and driven by invisible forces. You can build a cheap track of
        any shape by using flexible rubber or plastic magnets. Whatever
        your decision, there is an open gate for the exploitation of
        your ingenuity. Could this principle be a part of the
        transportation of the future? Why not? The principle and theory,
        supported by successful experiments and models, are given. </p>
      <p>Before finishing this chapter, I would like to tell you
        something about the efficiency of this type of motor. </p>
      <p>Direct measuring the efficiency is very difficult. The motor
        does not perform any other work in a physical sense as in its
        overcoming of the frictional forces and the losses by induction.
        They are very substantial if we take into account the small
        diameter of the roller and the ration of the rolling surface to
        the weight of the roller. Regarding the strong magnetic field of
        the track, the vertical component of these forces will be strong
        also This force must be added to the earth’s gravitational force
        because both together will give us the weight, which must be
        considered for friction. The magnetic forces are usually larger
        than the gravitational pull. Consequently, they will increase
        the resistance of friction substantially. These parameters give
        us a dim picture regarding the efficiency. </p>
      <p>But we must look at the other parameters. The only external
        power that we must use is the gating impulse at the end of the
        stages for removing the roller from the track field. This
        impulse is always the same magnitude, i.e., the same power,
        regardless how long the stage is. This fact emphasizes the
        importance of a possible long stage. </p>
      <p>The removing impulse of the described small circular track
        motor is by 30 V, 0.5 A current and 0.2 second of duration. This
        gives us a power consumption of about 3 watts. The pulse form is
        a square wave. That is all the energy that need be supplied the
        roller to escape from the magnetic field, regardless if the
        track is two feet or 20 feet long. </p>
      <p>It is really astonishing, is it not? No other type of linear
        motor has similar characteristics. Herein lies hidden the
        efficiency of my motor. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Wheel as a Rotor</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Studying the circular motor the question is straight forward:
        Could a wheel be used as a rotor? The circular track could after
        all be positioned around it as a stator. Will this motor work?
        What would be the characteristics of such an arrangement? </p>
      <p>I am sure that after reading the previous chapters, you
        realized that a motor employing purely permanent magnets belongs
        to the dream world of would-be inventors. No working model has
        until now been heard of. There must always be an external energy
        source which supplies energy to the motor. </p>
      <p>My work was inspired by the work of Japanese engineers of the
        firm of Kure-Teko. They were already working for some time on a
        new type of electric motor, a DC motor, with a permanent magnet
        aided working cycle. They nicknamed the motor as Magnetic Wankel
        because the motor’s working principles resemble those of a
        Wankel type rotary engine. This motor design was already
        discussed in popular magazines. You can find it, for example, in
        the June issue of the 1970 <i>Popular Science Magazine</i>. </p>
      <p>The motor has a permanent magnet stator (track) with a 60° gap
        and a permanent magnet motor. The magnets are working in a
        repulsion configuration. The stator is not a circle but a
        section of a spiral, its radius gradually expanding in the
        direction of the rotation. Thus the rotor’s eccentric inner
        curve encloses a wedge shaped space between it and the spinning
        rotor. The rotor will move toward gradually weakening force
        field. Now we know the magnetic forced is changing with the
        square of the distance. Nevertheless, not even the Japanese
        engineers were able to overcome the well known symmetry law. The
        change in spacing of the stator magnets around the rotor,
        although it aids the rotor in its movement, results in no net
        energy gain from the stator’s permanent magnets. You already
        know why! Thus, it was necessary to use some external energy
        source to enable the rotor’s continuous motion. The Japanese
        engineers put an electromagnet into the 60° gap which is
        switched at the instant when the rotor is in position where it
        needs a kick to overcome the stator’s repulsion force and to
        enter the repulsing field. Scientific explanation of the working
        principle of this Japanese motor was not yet published. Because
        the working principle of the Japanese motor was directly tied to
        my research of permanent magnet aided motion, I have decided to
        investigate it thoroughly from the standpoint of electrodynamics
        and energetics. </p>
      <p>The questions were: </p>
      <p>(1) What is the basis of the Japanese engineers’ claim of high
        efficiency of the system? </p>
      <p>(2) What is the demagnetization rate of the ceramic magnets
        used working in repulsion mode and in the high centrifugal field
        of the rotor? </p>
      <p>The advantage of pigmy weight of the motor against a comparable
        conventional made electromotor of the same performance further
        reducing the expensive copper material costs, was clearly
        evident to me. </p>
      <p>I was convinced that this type of motor is not just an
        engineer’s plaything. My opinion was supported by my earlier
        experiments with linear motors. </p>
      <p>I had built three experimental models: </p>
      <p>(a) The first was a true copy of my circular track motor with a
        balanced single magnet rotor working in attraction mode,
        arranged on a plastic wheel as rotor. </p>
      <p>(b) The second was a two-magnet rotor arranged on a wheel
        working in repulsion mode, or in attraction. </p>
      <p>(c) The third model was a wheel as rotor equipped with five
        permanent magnets on its circumference with a moderately
        eccentric stator. The magnets are working in repulsion mode. </p>
      <p>In the models a and b, the driving electronics and the
        electromagnets used are the same as was described by the
        circular and oscillating motor. </p>
      <p>Model c is equipped with a more sophisticated driver system
        which is still under investigation. It is far from finished. My
        goal was pushing down the losses to the minimum. This project is
        still in progress. This motor is not ready yet for amateur
        building. Nevertheless, I will give to you a review of what the
        result is up to now, even though the research is not finished.
        If you want to be engaged in experimentation with this type of
        motor, you can use my experiences and this can save you some
        frustration and money. </p>
      <p>My first model needs no detailed description. It is merely a
        version of my circular track motor. The difference is that the
        rotor is not running on the track surface, but is fastened on
        the circumference of a horizontally mounted plastic wheel which
        can turn around a vertical shaft. The wheel is balanced by a
        nonmagnetic counterweight (a piece of plastic block). You can
        reproduce it very easily. </p>
      <p>I want to present to you a detailed description of my second
        model. This is also very easy to build. It is a universal model
        which can serve for many experiments. The positioning and
        polarization of the magnets is readily changeable. </p>
      <p>You can build it as follows (See Figure 29): </p>
      <p><b>Figure 29</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig29.jpg" height="333" width="542"></center>
      <p>A 1/2 inch thick plexiglass sheet will be cut to 17 x 17
        inches, label 2. Two corners will be cut of, as given in Figure
        29, and provided with two brackets of 1 x 1 inch plexiglass bar,
        label 5. Exactly in the middle of sheet and 8-5/8 inch from the
        bottom of the sheet will be put a marking with a center punch.
        This marking will be the center of a 7-1/2 inch radius circle.
        The circle will be divided, starting from the upper middle
        point, by one inch intervals, both to the right and left hand
        sides from this middle point. The markings will be drilled for
        3/16 inch holes for fastening the stator magnets. A total of 44
        holes concentric to the middle of the 7-1/2 inch radius circle,
        will be drilled. </p>
      <p>After completing the drilling a 4 inch diameter hole will be
        cut in the plate, right in the middle of the circle. The motor
        shaft will pass through this hole. A 3/4 inch thick 20 x 12 inch
        plywood sheet will serve as a base plate for the motor, label 4.
        The rotor wheel is a 3/8 inch thick plexiglass. It will be cut
        at first by a jig or band saw to rough size and machined to an
        exact diameter of 13 inches. After machining, a circle of 6-1/8
        inch radius will be drawn from the center and divided into one
        inch intervals, marked and drilled for 3/16 inch holes. This
        will total 38 holes for fastening the rotor magnets. The center
        of the wheel will be drilled for a 3/8 inch diameter aluminum
        rod 6-1/2 inch in length. The ends of the shaft will be turned
        down to cones and the cones polished. High polish is important
        to achieve minimum friction. The shaft will turn in its Teflon
        bearings on its conic ends. That is a common method for
        diminishing friction. The shaft is held in the wheel center by
        two plexiglass bushings machined from a piece of 2 inch diameter
        plexiglass rod. The bushings have 3/8 inch diameter center holes
        for the shaft and a 6-32 threaded radial hole for a set screw.
        The bushings will be glued to the wheel from both sides. The
        teflon bearings will be held by two brackets, label 3, from 3/4
        inch thick plexiglass. The bottom ends of brackets are mounted
        on two 1 x 1 in cross-section plexiglass bars which are glued to
        the brackets and have two holes for woodscrews for fastening to
        the base plate. The upper ends of the brackets have a 1/2 inch
        diameter hole, its center 8-5/8 inch up from the bottom, for
        carrying the Teflon bearing bolts. The Teflon bearing bolts are
        machined from a 3/4 inch diameter Teflon rod. The rods are
        turned down to 1/2 inch diameter in 2 inch lengths and provided
        by 1/2 x 13 American standard coarse thread. The ends of the
        Teflon bolts will be machined flat and drilled with a
        countersink to about 1/4 inch in depth, for receiving the conic
        shaft ends. The Teflon bolts are held and adjusted in brackets
        by two 1/2 x 13 size brass nuts. See Detail A in Figure 29. </p>
      <p>The driving electromagnet is the same as in Figure 21. It will
        be fastened exactly at the middle line of the wheel by means of
        small plexiglass bars. The cage of bars must hold the
        electromagnet firmly, otherwise it will clink as the motor runs.
      </p>
      <p>The whole assembly will be arranged on the base plate as is
        indicated in Figure 29 and completed with a small terminal
        strip, label 10, containing four banana jacks. The leads for the
        magnetic switch must be cut long enough to make possible proper
        positioning of the magnetic switch. The marked positioning of
        this switch is only informational, the correct location must be
        found experimentally. I will come back to this problem in
        discussing the operation of the motor. </p>
      <p>The setting of the rotor magnets: The rotor will employ two
        blocks of ceramic magnets, 3 pieces per block. In mounting the
        blocks to the wheel, it is no matter which pole faces toward the
        wheel. It could be either the N pole or the S pole. The magnet
        blocks will be fastened to the wheel by using 3/16 x 1-1/2 inch
        brass bolts. The only rule for setting of rotor magnets that you
        must follow is that both of the blocks must be polarized in the
        same directions. If the one is N pole faced toward the wheel,
        the second must be faced exactly the same way. </p>
      <p>At first you may set only one block and on the opposite side of
        the wheel put a piece of plastic material of the same weight as
        the magnet block, as a counterbalance. </p>
      <p>And now you must choose between two possibilities: attractive
        or repulsive working mode? If you decision is to use attractive
        work mode, the stator magnets must be set in such a way that
        they will attract the rotor magnets. The stator magnets will be
        fastened to support with 3/16 inch brass screws also, label 2.
        Setting the 3 piece magnet blocks you can start from the right
        hand magnet side. Set up 5 or 6 blocks and lay down the motor
        with its wheel in horizontal position. Turn the wheel with its
        magnet toward the stator magnets and observe if there is
        attraction present. If you cannot achieve attraction, reface the
        stator magnets. Set all of the blocks the same way. You must
        again take care not to reverse the polarization of any block
        because as by the linear motor, only one wrongly polarized block
        can disturb the course of the symmetry curve and ruin your work.
      </p>
      <p>If you have approximately a quadrant ready with the motor still
        in horizontal position, turn the rotor magnet about 3 inches
        away from the stator end and release it. The rotor will be
        instantly pulled toward the stator and accelerated. Passing the
        neutral point of the already set stator, it will overshoot the
        opposite end of the stator and the electromagnet by a certain
        distance. Mark it and continue with the setting of additional
        blocks. After setting two or three new blocks, repeat the
        experiment. Observe that by releasing the rotor magnet always
        from the same 3 inches distance, when the distance of
        overshooting will be the greatest? This way you can find the
        optimal length of your stator. </p>
      <p>After finding this optimal length, you can set the second block
        of rotor magnets after removing the counterbalance and restore
        the motor and its wheel to vertical position. </p>
      <p>Connect the banana jacks to the corresponding binding posts of
        a timer-power supply the same way as it was described by the
        circular motor. Plug in the timer to a 120 V AC wall receptacle.
        Put the magnetic switch at your left hand behind the stator
        plate, label 2, and hold it there in position. With your right
        hand now turn the wheel clockwise and watch the signal light of
        the timer. When you observe a flash at the moment when the rotor
        magnet approaches the switch, the system is working. In the same
        time you must electromagnet. If you experience not a pulling,
        but a pushing impulse, the leads of the electromagnet must be
        reversed. The magnetic switch must be positioned far out from
        the field of the electromagnet because if it is too close, the
        field of he electromagnet could influence the switch and by
        magnetic feedback, will close and stay closed. In fact, the
        magnetic switch needs a powerful impulse merely for closing.
        After it is closed, a relatively weak field can hold it in this
        position. If this happens, the switch must be replaced. The
        proper location sometimes requires time and patience. The switch
        can be fastened by a piece of electric plastic tape into proper
        position. Now rotate the wheel clockwise with a powerful push.
        If the wheel started after releasing speeding up with steady
        flashing of the timer’s signal light, the system is working
        properly. You can now set the speed of rotation by the 10-turn
        potentiometer until the motor turns with its highest speed. </p>
      <p>You must try to relocate the switch and change the timer’s
        setting until yu find optimal working conditions. </p>
      <p>If you perceive friction while turning the wheel, you must
        adjust the bearing bolts and check to see if some of the magnets
        are not loose and rubbing the rotor of the stator. Although the
        experts say that Teflon needs no lubricant, I can recommend the
        use of a good silicon oil. Please use a few drops. It will
        substantially reduce the friction of the shaft in Teflon
        bearings. If silicon oil is not available, some drops of
        Mobil-One will do. The lowest possible friction is essential for
        the correct operation of the motor. </p>
      <p>You can modify the positioning of the stator or rotor magnets
        at will. You can shift the ends, change the length, change the
        number of magnets in the blocks, etc. See which mode of
        operation is better: attraction or repulsion? If you change the
        mode of operation, do not forget changing the current flow
        direction in the electromagnet. When the track is set for
        attraction, the electromagnet must be set for attraction also.
        If you choose repulsion mode, the electromagnet must be set for
        repulsion. </p>
      <p>Two important things to remember: these systems are inherently
        not self-starting systems, and the inertial momentum of the
        wheel plays a substantial part in the working principle. The
        comparable Japanese motor must be started by using a regular
        starter motor. Obviously the motor has better efficiency with a
        higher RPM. In the described motor you will probably be limited
        by the mechanical properties of the magnetic switch. The upper
        limit is normally in the thousands of RPM. At average, that is
        about 1000 RPM, the mini-switch will work perfectly. For higher
        RPM or for multiple pole rotor solid state switch, the so-called
        Hall Effect switch must be used. </p>
      <p>This motor is of a foolproof construction. It has a negative
        torque-current characteristic. It can run with constant RPM only
        of the load and the torque of the motor are in equilibrium.
        Under a higher load the motor will slowly wind down and stall.
        If it is not running it takes no current. Thus by overloading it
        cannot overheat and burn. Of course, it must be mechanically
        started. </p>
      <p>What is the performance of this motor? If everything is
        correctly made and set, the motor will take at no load condition
        about 18-22 watts. If it will be driven by higher energy input,
        it must be loaded by some braking equipment, such as the
        Pony-brake, which can also be used at the same time for
        measuring the output power. Do not expect high efficiency. The
        air resistance, the so-called ventilation losses, and the losses
        by induction will decrease the efficiency. </p>
      <p>Probably you will propound the question, will the motor work
        without the stator magnets? Of course it will, but with changed
        performance. For the first instant it will change to the better.
        Therefore, what is the importance of this stator if instead of
        improving of this stator if instead of improving it worsens the
        performance. Here we come to the root of the matter. At a low
        RPM the stator will work as a brake. But if its length and
        neutral point setting is correct and the neutral and magnetic
        mass of the rotor is properly chosen at a higher RPM it will
        support the rotation as dies the Japanese motor. The question
        is, from where comes this energy? It is taken from the spin
        energy of the unpaired electrons in magnets. To explain this
        energy exchange mechanism is not a simple matter. This belongs
        to the relativistic and quantum physics and certainly goes
        beyond the concepts and purposes of this booklet. If you are
        interested, you can find some explanations by studying Dirac’s
        concept of exchange energy and the inter-atomic alignment of
        spins. The topic will be subject of further investigation. </p>
      <p>For easier understanding, the stator can push r pull the rotor
        in a section as much as 300° . For removing, if the working mode
        is attractive, or for kicking to the field, if the working mode
        is repulsive, only a short impulse is necessary. Remember what
        was said by cascading the permanent magnet track stages. The
        main losses of conventional electric motors are heat losses,
        which are composed of coil losses by Joule’s heat, I^2R, and by
        hysteresis losses in ferromagnetic materials. In pulsed systems
        these losses have a minimal value. The electromagnets come in
        small sizes, what is obvious is that a coil of the same field
        strength could be dimensioned far smaller with a pulsed current
        than for a steady current. If an electromagnet coil is rated for
        steady current of one ampere, it can carry a pulse current of
        100 A, provided the mark to space ratio is 1:10<sup>4</sup>. The
        I<sup>2</sup>R loss in the coil will be the same in both cases,
        but during the pulse the magnetic field will be 1000 times as
        great. This is a significant advantage of pulsed systems. The
        magnetization of the rotor magnet is changing steadily during
        the work cycle. It is working under recoil conditions. It will
        possess a higher magnetization rate upon entering the field of
        the electromagnet that by entering the stator field. Remember
        the experiment described with single-sided double action linear
        motor. Here there is no demagnetization effect as by
        conventional permanent magnet motors. On the contrary, here
        there is a magnetization effect, which renews the original field
        strength of the rotor magnets. The magnetic induction depends
        besides other factors, also from the mutual speed of magnetized
        and magnetizing objects. This is also a factor of the working
        principle. Make no mistake, all of these factors can only
        improve the efficiency of the motor, which can approach a ratio
        of one, but can never surpass it. Higher efficiency than one
        means that you can get more energy out than you put in, which is
        impossible because of the energy conservation law. Such a
        machine would be a perpetual mobile which is nonsense. </p>
      <p>It is something else if we can use energy that is free, but it
        must come from somewhere. </p>
      <p>My latest model is a motor where the losses are kept at a very
        low level. Of course, for not so low what is possible by
        contemporary technics. Nevertheless, at a very low friction
        suspension with a small but very efficiently pulsed
        electromagnet where the ferromagnetic material is only 1-1/2 cm3
        in volume and with a sophisticated electronics system, my motor
        needs an unbelievably low 80 milliwatts power to sustain a 1400
        RPM. The average electrical noise, mostly from 60 cycle power
        lines, is sometimes and at some locations as high as 2 watts.
        This is all the energy that my latest motor needs. It can pick
        it up and use it. Of course, it will not generate power, but
        will perform gallantly under no load conditions. It is a very
        fascinating demonstration and teaching aid. </p>
      <p>This motor is in the very early stage of development with many
        properties at present not quite clear. Further investigation is
        called for. After finishing my research work, it will be
        published in a separate book. </p>
      <p>Have I proposed perpetual motion?&nbsp; Of course not. But
        today I am able to build a motor which can run for centuries to
        the delight of its owners. The service will not bother me. It
        could be the business of my very distant descendants. The
        possibilities are here. </p>
      <p>As a summary: The described permanent magnet motors have the
        following curiosities: </p>
      <p>(1) The efficiency of the system could be very high,
        approaching in some cases one. </p>
      <p>(2) They could be built of any material, even from wood. </p>
      <p>(3) The only iron material used is a small piece of
        electromagnet core, which can be replaced by a ferrite core
        also. </p>
      <p>What do you think, are these motors worth further development?
        Think about it! </p>
      <p>The photo of the latest model is shown in Figure 30. </p>

      </center>
      <p>All of the described motors which use an electromagnet for
        gating the rotor (roller), need a driver circuit which just as
        the rotor sensing switch closes, sends out a current impulse of
        precise amplitude and duration to energize the electromagnet. He
        correct functioning of the driver circuit is essential. If the
        current pulse in the electromagnet is too short, the roller will
        be returned from the track and toward the neutral point of the
        track. If it will be too long, the roller’s speed will be too
        high and will run off the track. </p>
      <p>The duty of the timer is to set the length and the height of
        the driving pulse as is necessary, depending on the parameters
        of track and roller. My design is a universal timer which fits
        to all motors and its construction is as simple as possible. If
        you are not electronically minded, some of your radio-amateur
        friends can help you. The performance of the timer-power supply
        may exceed the normally required power that the motor needs for
        its work, but the reserve it has is always advantageous if
        somebody want so to build some device other than as described.
        Besides the said properties, I also emphasize the ease of
        construction. </p>
      <p>If you are qualified in electronics, you can alter the
        following simple scheme and build timers and drivers according
        to your imagination and needs. As an alternate possibility, you
        can use mechanical switching devices as will be further
        discussed. </p>
      <p>The timer-power supply of my construction is divided into two
        parts: The timer itself with the power switching transistor and
        the power supply which provides the necessary voltages and
        current for the timer and its switching part. The schematic
        diagram of the timer-power supply is in Figure 31. The parts
        list is below: </p>

      <p>The timer part of the driver is a mechanically triggered
        monostable, employing a 555 IC time. Figure 31, upper diagram.
        The 555 timer is triggered by a magnetic mini reed switch M.S.
        Prior to the actuation of the switch by the magnetic field of
        the passing roller, the capacitor C<sub>4</sub> is charged to 15
        V through R<sub>6</sub>. The potentiometer R<sub>6</sub> is a
        10-turn type, its setting determines the output pulse width. By
        the closing of the magnetic switch M.S., C<sub>4</sub>
        discharges rapidly through R<sub>3</sub>, creating a short
        negative spike. The resultant negative spike is then passed
        through C<sub>1</sub> to the 555 as a trigger pulse. This fires
        the monostable, generating an output pulse of width T = 1.1 x R<sub>6</sub>
        x C<sub>4</sub>. Upon release of magnetic switch M.S., C<sub>4</sub>
        recharges to +15 V, and the circuit awaits the next switch
        actuation. </p>
      <p>The time constant and circuit arrangement of the trigger
        circuitry are chosen for a single trigger and output pulse, for
        each switch closing only. Furthermore, the circuit will not
        trigger on switch release and will produce only one pulse
        regardless of how long M.S. is closed. The circuitry will also
        retrigger as fast as M.S. can reactivate. </p>
      <p>The output pulse through voltage divider R4-R5 is passed to a
        power transistor Q1 which functions as a booster amplifier.
        Transistor Q1 will be on when the timer output is high. The
        2N6055 NPN Darlington transistor can handle up to 5 Amps current
        and 60 V. With this circuit the timers positive voltage V should
        be +15 V to ensure adequate base drive for Q1. The coil of the
        electromagnet L1 is directly connected to the collector circuit
        of Q1 and to the +36 V power supply. Because of the inductive
        load L1, the circuit uses a reverse clamping diode D1 to protect
        the circuit. Parallel with coil L1 is connected an LED of green
        color for indicating the action of the circuit. LED flashes when
        the coil L1 is energized. He resistor RL keeps the current of
        the diode at a permissible level. </p>
      <p>The power supply employs a transformer T<sub>1</sub> whose
        secondary current is rectified by heavy-duty bridge IC<sub>2</sub>
        and filtered by capacitors C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> connected
        in series. This is necessary because the no-load voltage of the
        36 V power supply will be higher than 35 V which is the
        operating voltage of a single capacitor. </p>
      <p>T<sub>1</sub> is center tapped and from the center is taken the
        current of about 17.5 V, rectified bvy full bridge rectifier IC<sub>2</sub>,
        and stabilized to +15 V for timer circuitry by IC<sub>4</sub>. </p>
      <p>For building both circuits, two 4-1/2 x 2-1/4 inch perforated
        boards are used. The transformer and both filter capacitors
        C5-C6 are directly mounted on the base plate of the cabinet. The
        10-turn potentiometer is a printed circuit type for screwdriver
        setting. It is accessible through a 1/4 inch hole in the left
        side of the cabinet cover. The picture of the Timer-power supply
        as assembled is Figure 32. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 32 ~ Assembled Timer-Power Supply</b> </p>

      <p>For checking the function of the finished circuits, the
        magnetic M.S., could be replaced by a pushbutton switch NO of
        any type. After connecting the Timer to the 120 V AC power line,
        the line switch SW1 in ON position, by pushing the push-button
        switch, which replaces M.S., a short flash of LED must be
        observed. </p>
      <p>This is the signal that the circuitry is working. A storage
        oscilloscope will be connected to the banana jacks for the coil
        output. The scope trigger mode will be set to single shot and
        store. By pushing the pushbutton switch, the driving pulse will
        trigger the scope and the pulse form and width will be stored on
        the scope’s display tube and can be easily measured. Starting
        with the lowest resistance value of the 10-turn pot R<sub>6</sub>
        and the corresponding shortest pulse duration, it is possible to
        plot the timer characteristics: pot meter turns vs pulse length,
        for the entire 1-turn range. This will be a very valuable help
        for further experiments. </p>
      <p>How to operate the Timer-Power supply in connection with the
        proper motor was discussed by the description of the motors. </p>
      <p>The discussed driver circuitry is sturdy and if properly built,
        reliable. It needs no special operating instructions. </p>
      <p>The Timer-Power supply is not the only possibility for driving
        the plastic wheel motor. If you are unpretentious and do not
        require accurate measurements, you can build more simple driving
        systems for the wheel. Some alternate drivers are shown in
        Figure 33. </p>
      <p>A simple relay-type driver consists of a 35 V DC power supply
        (battery or any other type) able to deliver about 1 A current,
        and a DC relay, which has a coil rated about 12 V or less. The
        current of the coil could be adjusted by a proper resistor R.
        The relay will be directly driven by the magnetic switch M.S.
        The parts are connected according to the schematic in Figure 33.
        This type of driver will give you a square wave pulse, whose
        length will be controlled by the RPM of the motor. With regard
        to the relay, it cannot be used for higher RPM. To connect the
        driver to the coil of the electromagnet the rules are the same
        as discussed earlier. It must be realized that this type of
        driver will not be too quiet and will have only a short
        lifetime. </p>
      <p>The switching contacts of the relay, because of the heavy
        sparking, will be burnt out in a short time. It is possible to
        reduce the sparking by connecting from an automobile ignition
        system parallel with the contacts. This can extend the lifetime
        of the contacts. </p>
      <p>The improvement of efficiency of relay type driving system can
        be achieved by connecting the electromagnet and a capacitor as a
        parallel-resonant circuit. The resonance must be calculated for
        a chosen RPM, therefore repetitive frequency of driving pulses
        respective its higher harmonics. The schematic of a tuned driver
        is in Figure 33. You can also try a series resonant circuit. In
        both cases, when changing the capacitors, the RPM of the motor
        must be noted. The procedure is similar to that of the AC
        induction motors for improving the power factor. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig33.jpg" height="532" width="406"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Another simple arrangement for pulsed driving is a mechanical
        switch driven by the motor. See Figure 33. They are really two
        sweep-contacts driven by the motor shaft. The shaft of the motor
        will be provided by a plastic cylinder about one inch long and
        one inch diameter. The cylinder consists of one, two, or as many
        copper stripes in a groove as the number of rotor magnet blocks.
        The surface of the stripes must be flush with the cylinder
        surface to ensure a smooth vibrationless operation. They must be
        firmly glued to the cylinder body. The width of the stripes
        determines the pulse width. The slipping contact strips are held
        on a bracket from plastics. The bracket length is adjusted to
        the shaft height. The fastening of the plastic cylinder position
        is provided by a small set-screw. This makes it possible to
        position the cylinder for the best ROM. </p>
      <p>If you built an electronic Timer-Power supply, I recommend that
        you build a simple relay type also. With the two drivers it is
        possible to perform a very interesting experiment, as follows: </p>
      <p>First, you may hook up the electronic driver to the motor as
        was previously discussed. Between the coil of the electromagnet
        and output jacks of the driver connect a watt-meter. Start the
        motor and at the maximum RPM measure the input power. Mark it
        and now change the electronic driver to the relay type system
        without any capacitor. The watt-meter must be connected again
        for measuring the input power. At the same RPM as before with
        the electronic driver, measure the input power again.&nbsp;
        Compare it with the previous measurement. </p>
      <p>You will be astonished! The measured power input, without
        otherwise changing the mechanical conditions of the motor, such
        as RPM and friction, will be about 1/3 as was measured with the
        electronic timer. Please don’t misunderstand, you must measure
        in both cases the input power from drivers to the coil of the
        electromagnet of the motor, not to the power supplies. By using
        the relay driver, the contacts must be sparking intensively. Now
        bypass the contacts of the relay with a high voltage capacitor
        as above. The sparking will diminish. Measure again the input
        power to the coil. The result will be almost the same as was
        measured using the electronic driver. </p>
      <p>What happens here? At the present time I have no satisfactory
        explanation. This astonishing phenomenon needs further
        investigation, by using tighter controls than those available to
        me. What the connection between the sparks and energy input is,
        we don’t know yet. </p>
      <p>You can find many other ways of driving, using transistors as
        drivers, thyristors, or for very small performances, Hall
        switches or direct magnetic reed switches. It all depends on
        your motor sizes. </p>
      <p>The efficiency is a function of the mass size and load, i.e.,
        friction, and from the construction. There is no limit to
        asserting your imagination. The basic paths I have paved for
        you! </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Possible Energy Resources</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>My previously described motors are not perpetual motion
        machines. They need an external energy source. This source can
        be supplied: (1) from power lines, 120 or 220 V AC; (2) from any
        type of battery, dry cells or rechargeable, which can supply the
        requested voltage and current; (3) from solar cells; (4) from
        thermal energy converter; or (5) in some areas, from the
        surrounding by induction (motors with minimal mechanical
        losses). </p>
      <p>Energy from the power line is obvious. It must be transformed
        to required voltage, rectified from AC to DC, and processed by
        the driver circuitry. It is what any power supply can do. </p>
      <p>Using batteries is the cleanest but also the most expensive
        way. The lifetime of the normal dry cell is short. They need
        frequent replacement. If you will use batteries, the power
        supply part of the timer will be unnecessary. You can connect
        the batteries directly to the +15 V (+12 V will do it also), and
        36 V terminals of the timer. By changing the wire sizes and
        ampere turns of the coil of the electromagnet, it is possible to
        use voltage lower than 36 V. The coil must be dimensioned in
        accordance with the voltage and power demand of your motor. </p>
      <p>By a scheduled longer experimentation, rechargeable batteries
        are not a bad solution, and in soeminstances are more
        economical. </p>
      <p>For accurate measurements, batteries are inferior as a power
        line eliminator but obviously safer. </p>
      <p>The solar cell represents a free energy source. A small solar
        power supply with storage batteries can realize your dream
        toward a free energy source, and can drive your motor
        permanently. </p>
      <p>In the planning of a solar power supply, the factor of power
        demand is important. It must be capable of delivering the peak
        current demand. If you want to build your motor for example for
        driving a fan for uninterrupted day and night operation, the
        solar cells must be dimensioned for twice the motor power
        demand. Thus, by day it will drive the motor and charge the
        storage system. At night, however, the motor will use the energy
        stored in the batteries. </p>
      <p>The solar power supply consists of a solar panel composed of
        individual solar cells, the charging circuitry and the storage
        batteries. Te schematic of a simple system is in Figure 34. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 34 ~ A Simple Solar Power Supply</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig34.jpg" height="195" width="376"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The solar panel supplies energy to the motor M through the
        diode D1. This diode is an important part of the charging
        system. It is possible, because of full charge or low
        illumination, that the battery voltage would exceed the charging
        source voltage. Without the diode in the circuit, the battery
        would then discharge into the solar source. This is avoided
        because in the event of high battery voltage, the diode is
        reverse biased, the anode becoming more negative than the
        cathode. The diode will block the reverse current. </p>
      <p>The common characteristics of my motors are that if they are
        not running, they represent an open circuit for the power
        supply. They take no current from the supply which is thus
        automatically disconnected. This type of motor is foolproof
        because in the light of its negative current-torque
        characteristics, it cannot bur out. If it is overloaded it will
        simply stall and the power supply is automatically disconnected.
        When not running there is no current flow in the coil of the
        driving magnet. This is true for relay type drivers also. </p>
      <p>The silicon solar cells come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
        They could be assembled and connected in various series and
        parallel combinations to obtain desired voltage and current
        capability. Cells as large as 4 inch diameter are available
        capable of delivering 2 amps at 0.42 V. Hence, quite a large
        group of cells must be wired in series to obtain a reasonable
        output voltage. Cells in parallel increase the current
        capability. I might suggest that after assembling the cells, you
        should cover them with a sheet of glass. The life of the cells
        will be substantially extended without substantial changes in
        performance. The cleaning of the panel will be easier also. </p>
      <p>A solar panel could be built into the base plate of the motor.
        If it will be covered by an opaque sheet of white plastic, the
        performance of the cells will be decreased only about 20%, but
        the cells will be concealed from the viewer who will admire your
        creation, working seemingly without any energy supply. </p>
      <p>If you want to build a solar power supply of any kind, consult
        the bibliography at the end of this booklet. There you will find
        excellent sources of information. </p>
      <p>Some manufacturers are producing today watches and clocks which
        can run years without any care of energy supply. They are using
        thermal energy which is supplied by the body heat of the wearer
        or in the case of clocks, the temperature differences inside and
        outside of the building. This too is a good idea for supplying
        free energy to your motor. </p>
      <p>It is possible to convert thermal energy directly into
        electrical energy by means of thermocouples, with no machinery
        and nonmoving parts. A thermocouple is made by joining alternate
        lengths of electrical conductors or semi-conductors of different
        kinds, and heating one junction and cooling the other. This
        produces a potential difference and generates current, i.e.,
        electric energy. Thermocouples of unlike metals have voltages of
        20-60 microvolts per degree, and semiconductors may have
        voltages of 1 mv per degree. The thermocouples are arranged in
        series and parallel in so-called thermo-electric modules. The
        modules can be used thermoelectric generators. Modules are built
        in all possible sizes and performances, by many manufacturers
        and laboratories. The sources are listed at the end of this
        book. </p>
      <p>In this section I would like to describe an exotic and slightly
        known thermal energy converter which eventually could be a
        candidate for free energy. This is an energy converter I
        discovered some years ago using water. It is probably the
        simplest generator of electricity in the world. For building it
        you need a piece of rag, water and two electrodes for collecting
        the electricity. The schematic of the Water Energy Converter is
        in Figure 35. The direct energy converter using water works as
        follows: </p>
      <p>When water diffuses through a porous media and evaporates from
        the surface, the material cools. If a metal electrode is
        attached to the end undergoing evaporation, a thermal gradient
        occurs between the electrode and water. Because the water and
        the electrode are dissimilar conductors, the thermal gradient
        creates a Seebeck emf. When the system absorbs energy from the
        surrounding by means of convection or radiation heat transfer,
        the energy is converted to electric current. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 35 ~ Scheme of the Water Energy Converter</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig35.jpg" height="193" width="390"></center>
      <p>The produced is not too great. The converter is more of a
        curiosity. The value of the current and voltage is dependent on
        the area of the absorbing surface, but the energy is abslyutely
        free. The rag electricity generator is, and probably will be,
        the world’s cheapest thermal energy converter for a long time.
        The performance could be substantially increased by using as
        porous material a good lamp wick fabric which prepared before
        using by chlorophyll extract. If you are interested, write me
        please. I will be delighted to send you at nominal cost more
        detailed information with my theoretical explanation. </p>
      <p>The picture of a 3-stage water energy converter is in Figure
        36. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 36 ~ Water Energy Converter</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig36.jpg" height="340" width="360"></center>
      <p>Another energy source which is also free is the omnipresent
        electromagnetic radiation produced mainly by the 60 Hz house
        current power lines. Its intensity is dependent on the location
        and it has a value of from a few microwatts to as much as 3-5
        watts, if in the vicinity of high voltage power lines. The
        phenomenon is well known to the builder and maintenance men of
        MOSFET and CMOS devices. It is the curse of the CMOS input
        burglar alarms and of any fine current measurement devices in
        the range of millivolt potentials. </p>
      <p>The construction of good electronics equipment to pick up these
        powers is not an easy task. It is absolutely not a hobby job. It
        needs sophisticated electronic measuring equipment and not easy
        to obtain parts such as tunnel diodes, extremely small forward
        resistance rectifiers, etc. </p>
      <p>I have such a circuitry in my latest model motor which is
        currently under investigation. Sometimes it performs well and
        sometimes not. It depends on the location of the motor. It is
        tuned to the 60 Hz radiation which has a very limited range. The
        motor was running continuously in my laboratory for 3 months
        during the summer. Once in the fall it stalled. It was necessary
        to charge the system directly from a power line after it’s
        stalling. It would be a help of the pickup coil (antenna) were
        directional and aimed toward the direction of most intensive
        radiation. Unfortunately, my antenna is built in at the base
        plate of the motor and therefore could not be rotated. If you
        want to experiment with similar systems, think twice. You must
        realize that such an experimentation needs a lot of knowledge of
        electronics and radio technics. It is a very time-consuming and
        costly equipment, and the results are always uncertain. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, you must realize that both of my latest energy
        sources are intended exclusively for experimentation but no way
        for power production. You should be happy if you can overcome
        the frictional and other losses in your motor. </p>
      <p>There are many other more or less esoteric energy sources which
        are probably available in certain ranges, considering the fact
        that the pulsed motors need less energy than the conventional
        permanent magnet direct current motors. Such energy sources are,
        for example, the atmospheric electricity and the radiant energy
        from the outer space. They are truly neglected by the scientific
        establishment which does not mean that they are not worth
        investigating. There are again no limits to your imagination. </p>

      </center>
      <p>I come to the end of my book, wherein is presented part of my
        work aimed toward the investigation of permanent magnet
        generated and aided motions. The described motors are byproducts
        of this research. They were built and served for proof of the
        theoretical speculations. </p>
      <p>With this publication, my work is far from finished. My
        intention is to continue in investigation, especially is to
        continue in investigation, especially the interactions of
        rotation generated inertial fields, respective the changing of
        momentum of inertia if such a thing is present. According to the
        linear vector theory of inertial fields, it may be possible. </p>
      <p>I am working alone without any funding or financial help, using
        my free time and my own financial resources. Experimentation
        with permanent magnet devices is not quite a cheap business. It
        calls for a lot of sacrifice. </p>
      <p>Despite these facts, I do not consider my achievements as my
        sole property. They belong to all mankind! My goal was to arouse
        the interest of as many people as possible, to start a new
        engineering discipline, the perma-energetics. </p>
      <p>The future belongs to the efficient. Nobody can change this
        trend of development! What seems to be today impossible, could
        tomorrow be a reality. History teaches us that, no matter
        whether somebody likes it or not! </p>
      <p>If my present work can only slightly improve the energy
        situation of the world and at the same time inspire others to
        work, my endeavor was not wasted! This was the purpose of my
        present publication and the publication of Prof. Dr Jearl Walker
        in the 1982 March issue of the Scientific American. </p>
      <p>You can start where I have finished. Nevertheless I must warn
        you, if you intend to patent something of the motors described
        in this book, it will hardly be possible. Probably you will not
        fulfill the requirement of the prior art. But if you will build
        something new by using the principles presented in your way to
        get a patent. You will be able to patent your new ideas. </p>
      <p>Finally I would like to clear up the question of
        responsibilities. I give you no warranty that your work will
        succeed. Your work is solely at your own risk. I take no
        responsibility, in any respect, for failure or accident that you
        can meet with my motors. I do not guarantee you a success. This
        depends on you. </p>
      <p>My motors were demonstrated to many experts, and publicly as
        well, under the sponsorship of the Cleveland State University
        Chapter of the prestigious American Society of Mechanical
        Engineers. </p>
