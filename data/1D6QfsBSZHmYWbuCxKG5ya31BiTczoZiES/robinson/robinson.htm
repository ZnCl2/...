Patented




          Design Is the Latest Fuel-Saving Product from National
          Fuelsaver Corporation</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      </div>
      <br>
      WASHINGTON, June 27 -- A new design that will enable a gasoline
      engine to be as fuel efficient as a diesel engine has just been
      awarded patent number 6,907,859 from the U.S. Patent Office,
      according to a spokesperson from National Fuelsaver Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      "Every consumer dreams of getting more miles to the gallon,"
      comments Joe Robinson, Technical Director of National Fuelsaver
      Corp, "but until today a gasoline engine could never compete with
      the fuel efficiency of a diesel engine. Our latest design closes
      the miles-per-gallon gap."<br>
      <br>
      The newly patented design shows how to manufacture a gasoline
      engine with the 16 to 1 power stroke of a diesel engine, while
      retaining the 8 to 1 compression ratio of a gasoline engine. The
      higher power stroke ratio delivers 8% more miles per gallon, while
      the retaining of the compression ratio guarantees the engine's
      safe performance.<br>
      <br>
      When this latest design is combined with the company's "Platinum
      Gas Saver," a low-cost automotive accessory that has racked up
      half a million sales since it appeared on the market, a gasoline
      vehicle can be as fuel efficient as the equivalent diesel vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      The Gas Saver adds microscopic quantities of platinum to the air
      and fuel that enters the engine. The platinum is the catalyst
      which enables the non- burning fuel to burn inside the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Without the Gas Saver, the typical gasoline engine will burn only
      68% of each gallon. With the Gas Saver, the engine will burn 90%
      of each gallon, a 22% increase.<br>
      <br>
      "Obviously, when 22% more of each gallon burns inside your engine,
      22% fewer gallons are required to drive the same distance,"
      explains Mr. Robinson. "The savings to the driver is substantial."<br>
      <br>
      After a five year study of the Gas Saver, Federal Consumer
      Protection concluded: "Independent testing shows greater fuel
      savings with the Gas Saver than the 22% claimed by the developer."<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the fuel savings, the Gas Saver's platinum cleans
      out the abrasive carbon to extend engine life and raises octane
      levels, making the higher priced gasoline unnecessary for most
      vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Although consumers will have to wait until the company's new
      engine design comes to market, the Gas Saver -- which accounts for
      most of the fuel savings -- can be easily installed on most
      gasoline vehicles today. For further information call

          CORP. ASKS: THE CLEAN AIR ACT: TO BE OR NOX TO BE?</span><br
          style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      BOSTON, Feb. 17 /PRNewswire/ -- The Clean Air Act, legislated to
      reduce NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions from diesel engines and
      signed into law by President Bush, just went into effect January
      1, 1998. NOx is produced when nitrogen and oxygen from the air are
      brought together at the high temperatures of combustion chambers.
      Lowering flame temperatures by retarding the timing will decrease
      NOx, but will increase soot emissions which is not an acceptable
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      The only known way to reduce NOx and soot emissions simultaneously
      from diesel engines is to add microscopic quantities of platinum
      and rhodium to the air and fuel entering the combustion chambers.
      The platinum burns the soot to CO2 while the rhodium reduces the
      NOx back to nitrogen and oxygen. This is identical to the
      chemistry of the catalytic converter in a gasoline vehicle where
      the platinum of the catalytic converter burns the CO to CO2, and
      the rhodium reduces the NOx back to nitrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      But, you cannot use a catalytic converter with diesel because the
      unburnt fuel is not a vapor like CO. Soot is a solid. The moment
      the soot would begin to enter a catalytic converter, the
      passageways of the converter would get clogged, and the engine
      will stop functioning.<br>
      <br>
      The simple technology of adding platinum and rhodium to the air
      and fuel entering an engine was developed by National Fuelsaver
      Corp. of Boston and is described in U.S. patent 5,085,841 and in
      SAE paper 891634. It applies the platinum and rhodium chemistry of
      catalytic converters to the combustion chambers of both gasoline
      and diesel engines. In 1979, National Fuelsaver began marketing
      their Platinum Gasaver which adds platinum, rhodium and rhenium to
      the air and fuel entering a gasoline engine.<br>
      <br>
      The platinum catalyzes the CO to burn inside the engine,
      converting this pollutant into 22% more miles per gallon, while
      cleaning out the carbon for longer engine life. The rhodium
      reduces the NOx and the rhenium raises the octane of the gasoline,
      making premium fuel unnecessary.<br>
      <br>
      The vested interests have fought the proliferation of this
      technology since 1977 because it reduces fuel consumption
      significantly. Since diesel combustion is the one area where there
      is no fuel savings with this platinum technology, it will be
      interesting to see if the vested interests allow the Clean Air Act
      to be or NOx to be.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A catalyst
      mixture of platinum, rhodium, and rhenium is employed in the
      combustion of gaseous, liquid and/or solid fuel in combustion
      chambers such as diesel and gasoline engines, for reduction of
      pollution emitted from the combustion chambers. The platinum
      serves as a catalyst with carbon and carbon monoxide to produce
      carbon dioxide, the rhodium serves for reducing oxides of nitrogen
      to nitrogen gas and oxygen gas, and the rhenium serves as a
      catalytic promoter for the catalytic functions of the platinum and
      the rhodium. The rhodium also promotes the catalytic action of the
      platinum. The catalytic mixture is introduced into a flame zone of
      a combustion chamber in any convenient manner, such as by use of
      an air draft. The composition of the mixture is as follows,
      namely, 1-9 milligrams of platinum, 0.3-3 milligrams rhodium, and
      0.3-3 milligrams rhenium for treating 24 kilograms of fuel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for reduction of
      pollution emitted from combustion chambers. More specifically the
      invention relates to a method for reduction of pollution emitted
      from combustion chambers as in diesel and gasoline engines in
      motor vehicles and chambers in which combustion of gaseous, liquid
      and/or solid fuel takes place. The reduction of pollution is
      achieved by rhodium, platinum and rhenium as catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      It is well established that the major pollutants produced by
      combustion chambers are soot (carbon), carbon monoxide, and oxides
      of nitrogen hereinafter referred to as NO.sub.x.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years attempts were made to reduce pollution in various
      ways by using platinum-group catalysts but the results were only
      partially successful. In addition rhenium was used in order to
      increase the octane number in gasoline instead of using lead.<br>
      <br>
      It became apparent that as combustion temperatures rose, soot and
      CO decreased but at the same time NO.sub.x increased, the latter
      being an undesirable result. On the other hand, if the combustion
      temperature is decreased, the NO.sub.x indeed drops, but the
      amount of soot and CO increases, and simultaneously the efficiency
      of the fuel utilization drops.<br>
      <br>
      Attempts were made to use platinum as a catalyst for oxidizing the
      undesired carbon and the CO to CO.sub.2 in combustion chambers.
      (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,295,816). This patent discloses use of the
      entire Platinum group for oxidation purposes, but refers primarily
      to platinum. Over the last decade platinum has been used as a
      homogeneous catalyst to oxidize C+CO to CO.sub.2 in both engines
      and furnaces.<br>
      <br>
      However, the problem remained as to how to reduce the NO.sub.x
      chemically to the gases N.sub.2 and O.sub.2, this being an
      exothermic reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is to oxidize the carbon and
      the carbon monoxide to CO.sub.2 and simultaneously to reduce the
      NO.sub.x to N.sub.2 and O.sub.2 without one process being at the
      expense of the other.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention the catalyst mixture is
      comprised of platinum, rhodium and rhenium. Wherein the platinum
      serves for oxidizing the carbon and CO to CO.sub.2, the rhodium
      serves for reducing the NO.sub.x to N.sub.2 and O.sub.2, and the
      rhenium serves as a catalytic promoter for the catalysts platinum
      and rhodium. The rhodium also promotes the catalytic action of the
      platinum.<br>
      <br>
      The rhenium enables the platinum and rhodium to fulfill their role
      optimally. A defined ratio must be maintained among the catalysts
      and between the quantities of catalysts and fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The site at which said simultaneous oxidation and reduction takes
      place is the combustion chamber to which the catalysts are
      transported by various means. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos.
      4,295,816 and 4,475,483.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for reducing the
      pollution emitted from combustion chambers by the addition of the
      catalysts-platinum, rhodium and rhenium to the combustion chamber
      in specific proportions and in a specific ratio to the amount of
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The introduction of the above mixture of catalysts into the
      combustion chamber leads to a simultaneous oxidation and
      reduction; Oxidation of carbon and CO to CO.sub.2, and reduction
      of the NO.sub.x to N.sub.2 and O.sub.2.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention the following amounts of
      catalysts should be used; 1-9 mg platinum, 0.3-3 mg rhodium and
      0.3-4 mg rhenium per 24-2400 kg fuel. Optimally the following
      quantities should be used: 3.2 mg platinum, 1 mg rhodium, and 1 mg
      rhenium per 240 kg fuel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The catalysts may be introduced into the flame zone of the
      combustion chamber in any manner such as by transporting the
      catalysts by air to the combustion chamber as described in the
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,295,816.<br>
      <br>
      The combustion chamber may be of any type such as engines or
      furnaces.<br>
      <br>
      The reduction of pollution by simultaneous oxidation and reduction
      can occur only when the specific proportions among the components
      of the system are maintained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation of the catalyst
        mixture:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A mixture of 160 gr. platinum, 50 gr. rhodium and 50 gr. rhenium
      suffices to reduce pollution in 12 million liter fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture is prepared as follows:<br>
      <br>
      400 gr. H.sub.2 PtCl.sub.6.6H.sub.2 O (CPA) in water<br>
      <br>
      120 gr. Rdcl.sub.2 in water<br>
      <br>
      50 gr. rhenium in perrhenic acid in a total of 114 liters of
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      In order to reduce pollution in engines or furnaces by means of
      the equipment and method described in the above-mentioned U.S.
      patents, the catalytic mixture described above is divided into
      6000 vials wherein each vial contains 19 ml liquid. Each such vial
      can reduce the pollution of 2000 liters of fuel in combustion
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      Up to the present, for reduction of pollution in combustion
      chambers 500 gr. of H.sub.2 PtCl.sub.6.6H.sub.2 O (CPA) has been
      used, without any addition of rhodium.<br>
      <br>
      Although the U.S. Pat. No. 4,295,816 relates to the platinum-group
      metals for the reduction of pollution, it does so only with regard
      to the oxidation process of the carbon and the CO to CO.sub.2 and
      does not relate to the rhodium and its function in the reduction
      of the NO.sub.x.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a reduction of the CO and NO.sub.x pollution in
      diesel engines in a motor vehicle. Prior to the injection of the
      catalytic mixture, the pollution level was measured as NO.sub.x
      1000 ppm and CO 350 ppm. Subsequent to the injection of the
      catalytic mixture, a significant reduction was noted in the
      NO.sub.x level which dropped to 500 ppm and the CO level which
      dropped to 200 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows the decrease in pollution in two motor vehicles as a
      result of the injection of the catalysts mixture wherein the
      pollution was examined with regard to NO.sub.x and opacity. In one
      vehicle opacity declined from 73% to 8% and in the other from 50%
      to 5%. In the first vehicle the NO.sub.x dropped from 1600 ppm to
      300 ppm, and in the second vehicle from 2000 ppm to 200 ppm. It
      should be noted that in the first vehicle the decrease in
      pollution was examined after 1845 miles after injection, and in
      the second--after 3203 miles.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the decrease in pollution in three additional motor
      vehicles. The pollution test was conducted in the first vehicle
      6538 miles after injection, and in the second vehicle--4925 miles
      after injection, and in the third vehicle--1311 miles after
      injection. In the first vehicle opacity decreased from 84% to 9%
      and the NO.sub.x decreased from 800 ppm to 250 ppm. In the second
      vehicle opacity decreased from 30% to 9% and the NO.sub.x from 600
      ppm to 100 ppm, and in the third vehicle opacity decreased from
      72% to 7% and the NO.sub.x from 800 ppm to 300 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 refers to the decrease in pollution examined 66 6538 and
      9302 miles respectively after the injection and immediately after
      another injection. After 66 and 6538 miles the NO.sub.x dropped
      from 800 ppm to 300 ppm and 250 ppm respectively, and the opacity
      dropped from 84% to 4% and 9% respectively. 9302 miles after
      injection a dramatic increase in pollution was noted due to the
      fact that no more of the catalytic mixture remained. A second
      injection and reexamination indicated an immediate and sharp drop
      in the pollution level. The NO.sub.x dropped from 1200 ppm to 380
      ppm and opacity from 78% to 25%.<br>

      You see them at your local auto parts store or advertised on late
      night television. We're talking about devices or chemicals that
      claim to improve your fuel economy and save you hundreds of
      dollars in the process. And with gas prices above $4 a gallon in
      some parts of the country, why not invest in a system that will
      save money?<br>
      <br>
      There are scores of touted fuel savers on the market, all with
      claims to save you big loot on your gasoline bills. They go by
      catchy names like "Auto Miser," "Cyclone-Z," "Magna Flash Ignition
      Control System," "Platinum Fuel Saver," "Fuel Genie," and "Tornado
      Fuel Saver." There's even one device called the "Pre-Ignition
      Catalytic Converter (PICC)" that, in the company's words, "will
      increase the mileage of all personal vehicles to over 100 miles
      per gallon (city or highway). There are testimonials on the
      homepage for this device from an owner of a 2006 Mazda3 who is
      excited to now get 121 mpg after installing the PICC system.
      Another claims his Ford cargo van gets 43 mpg. By the way, before
      you spend several thousand dollars for the PICC, you must first
      buy the Hydrogen Assist Fuel Cell (HAFC) for just over $1,000.<br>
      <br>
      Prices range widely for these gizmos, from a few dollars for fuel
      additives that purport to save fuel, to several hundred dollars
      for more advanced systems.<br>
      <br>
      But do these devices really work?<br>
      <br>
      For answers, we sought expert opinion. The federal government's
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has tested nearly 100 "fuel
      savers" over the years and found no significant improvement in
      fuel economy with any additive or device, according to tests
      posted on its website, www.epa.gov<br>
      <br>
      Consumer Reports (CR), an independent, consumer-oriented testing
      firm, also evaluated myriad devices. We spoke with David Champion,
      senior director of CR's Auto Test Center, who said: "you can do
      more to improve fuel economy by the way you maintain and drive
      your vehicle then any of these ‘gas savers' will ever achieve."
      Champion singled out the Platinum Gas Saver as typical of
      marketing hype.<br>
      <br>
      The Platinum Gas Saver ($248 for two) is marketed by the National
      Fuelsaver Corp. and its ads claim up to 22 percent gains in
      economy. National Fuelsaver says that the product adds microscopic
      amounts on platinum to the air and fuel going to the engine,
      making the vehicle burn fuel more efficiently.<br>
      <br>
      National Fuelsaver says the device may take up to 1,800 miles
      before it is fully effective, and you may have to advance engine
      timing or install new oxygen sensors for the system to work
      properly. According to CR, these actions alone may improve economy
      without purchasing any additional equipment.<br>
      <br>
      In tests, Consumer Reports saw no improvement in economy after 500
      miles of testing. They even replaced all four oxygen sensors in
      one of the test vehicles to the tune of $748, even though the
      vehicle was new and did not need sensor replacement. "Magnets,
      atomizers, vortex generators - none of them work, said Champion.<br>
      <br>
      In fairness to the many companies that may have products with
      promise that may have not yet been tested, including the PICC and
      HAFC, do your own research.<br>
      <br>
      We did find one product that made us more aware of our "fuelish"
      ways behind the wheel. It's called the Scan Gauge II Automotive
      Computer, and uses the OBD-II port found on every vehicle built
      since 1996 to monitor various engine parameters.<br>
      <br>
      The Scan Gauge II retails for $169.99 and is extremely easy to
      install. Find a suitable location on your dash or console (away
      from airbags!) for the small, 5-inch wide, 1-inch deep unit. Route
      the supplied cable to the OBD-II port (usually under the dash),
      and perform simple calibrations by inputting information such as
      the capacity of the gas tank, vehicle weight, and so forth - all
      data that can be found in your owner's manual.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to displaying engine speed, vehicle speed and reading
      and resetting "check engine light" fault codes that may develop,
      the Scan Gauge II is a full trip computer with readouts for things
      like fuel economy, gallons of gas used and distance to empty. It
      can also display battery voltage, coolant temperature, air intake
      temperature and other important measurements.<br>
      <br>
      On a trip to Richmond, Virginia from Maryland, I installed the
      Scan Gauge in a 1997 Volvo 960. On the trip south, I averaged 26.3
      mpg at an average speed of 62 mph. I disconnected the unit for the
      return trip and averaged 22 mpg at about 70 mph. Using the unit
      was fun, as four parameters can be displayed at one time, and
      proved to me that perhaps the biggest fuel saver of all is
      sensible driving - when you are aware of what you are doing, you
      can do something about it. I kept my speed near the limit, and
      saved more than four miles per gallon and possibly a ticket in the
      process. If your vehicle is not equipped from the factory with a
      trip computer, the Scan Gauge II or similar trip computer is a
      worthy, money-saving device. (www.scangauge.com)<br>
