      <br>
      In 1975, Honda was granted the U.S. Patent 3878826 for
      instructions on how to manufacture an engine with a third
      manifold. The patent was secured because the CVCC engine for the
      Honda Civic has a second intake manifold. This technology is now
      being put to reduce fuel consumption by National Fuelsaver Corp.
      based in Boston.<br>
      <br>
      An internal combustion engine commonly has only two manifolds -
      the intake and the exhaust manifold. These manifolds facilitate
      the entry of fuel to the engine as well as provide the exit of
      exhaust gases.<br>
      <br>
      According to the abstract of the patented three-manifold engine:
      “A four-cycle internal combustion engine has eight cylinders each
      provided with a main combustion chamber and an auxiliary
      combustion chamber connected by a torch nozzle. A carburetor has a
      Venturi throat supplying rich mixture to each of the auxiliary
      chambers and other carburetor throats supplying a lean mixture to
      each of the main chambers. Although the effective cross sectional
      area of the Venturi throat for the rich mixture need not be larger
      than the effective cross sectional area of a single torch nozzle
      when the engine has four cylinders or six cylinders, an eight
      cylinder engine requires that the Venturi throat for the rich
      mixture be smaller than 1.4 times as large in effective cross
      sectional area as each of the torch nozzles.”<br>
      <br>
      According to the National Fuelsaver Corp., the third manifold can
      be used to increase the gas mileage of an engine by injecting
      platinum vapor into the combustion chamber. The platinum particles
      allow fuels to be burned almost completely. Conventional engines
      only burns about 70 percent of the fuel introduced into the
      combustion chamber. With the new patented technology, an
      additional 22 percent of the fuel can be burned.<br>
      <br>
      According to the abstract of the patented gas saving technology:
      “An Elevated Expansion-Ratio Internal Combustion Engine has a
      substantially standard repeating four-stroke sequence for each
      cylinder, and the Engine includes for each cylinder: an intake
      valve, a combustion-gas exhaust valve, and a vapor return valve. A
      return manifold for vapor connects from the return valves of
      respective ones of the cylinders back into a passage ahead of a
      beginning portion of an intake manifold. Substantially during a
      predetermined part of each compression stroke in the sequence of
      strokes, the return valve opens after a closing of the intake
      valve, and thereafter closes at a time within the compression
      stroke corresponding to a predetermined position of the piston in
      the cylinder.”<br>
      <br>
      According to the developer of the gas saving technology, the use
      of platinum is already used on catalytic converters. What they
      just did is bring the platinum to the engine so that the unburned
      fuel will not be wasted. <br>
      <br>
      According to Jack Leopold, the West Coast distributor for National
      Fuelsaver Corp., “The Gasaver injects a platinum vapor directly
      into the engine where the catalytic action of the platinum
      promotes faster and more complete combustion - with 15 to 25
      percent savings in gasoline.” Joel Robinson, the inventor of
      Gasaver, added that, “We're not doing anything new chemically;
      we're simply changing the location of where the process occurs.”<br>
      <br>
      With the increasing price of gasoline, a product such as that
      would surely be welcomed by many fuel-concerned individuals. With
      the money saved on fuel consumption, they can spend on upgrading
      the body parts of their daily drivers.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 80px;"><br>
      National Fuelsaver Corp. has just completed testing a prototype
      engine implementing only 1/3 of the fuel saving features described
      in their US Patent 6907859.<br>
      <br>
      The EPA Federal Test Procedure has already measured a 15.2%
      increase in miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      No other technology or combination of technologies has shown even
      a 5% improvement in miles per gallon in the last 60 years.<br>
      <br>
      This is the second fuel saving technology developed by National
      Fuelsaver Corp. to be confirmed by the federal government.<br>
      <br>
      The first is their low cost automotive accessory, the Platinum Gas
      Saver. Over half a million of their Gas Savers have been sold
      since Consumer Protection concluded: "Independent testing shows
      greater fuel savings with the Gas Saver than the 22% claimed by
      the developer."<br>
      <br>
      With a simple connection to a vacuum line, the Gas Saver adds
      platinum vapor to the air and fuel entering the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Since platinum enables non-burning fuel to burn, the Gas Saver's
      platinum enables your engine to burn 90% of each gallon instead of
      the average 68% of each gallon, a 22% increase.<br>
      <br>
      Obviously, burning 22% more of each gallon inside the engine
      translates directly into 22% more miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the Gas Saver has received patents for raising octane
      and for extending engine life by cleaning out the abrasive carbon.<br>

      BOSTON, June 3 /PRNewswire/ -- The Robinson Engine Head, developed
      by National Fuelsaver Corp., gives the driver three benefits. It
      delivers 48% more miles per gallon. It reduces global warming
      emissions by 30% and it increases the horsepower of a 2 liter
      engine to that of a 3 liter engine. Don't buy a new car without
      one.<br>
      <br>
      In the last 60 years no engine modification until now has shown
      more than a 1% improvement in miles per gallon on the U.S.
      Government Official Test known as the EPA Federal Test Procedure.<br>
      <br>
      The Robinson Engine Head, which is a simple modification of the
      standard engine head at the manufacturing level, has now
      demonstrated on the EPA Federal Test Procedure a 48% increase in
      miles per gallon and a 30% reduction in Global Warming emissions.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, in order to get more horsepower at the wheels, it was
      necessary to build a bigger engine which would consume more fuel
      and do more harm to the environment.<br>
      <br>
      The Robinson Engine Head takes a totally different approach.
      Robinson measured that the standard engine itself consumes 77
      units of horsepower for every 100 units of fuel. This leaves only
      23 units of horsepower at the wheels.<br>
      <br>
      The Robinson Engine Head reduces the engine's requirements by 11
      units to 66 units of horsepower. This reduction in the horsepower
      requirement of the engine increases the horsepower at the wheels
      by 11 units from 23 to 34 units of horsepower<br>
      <br>
      By reducing the engine's requirements for horsepower, the Robinson
      Engine Head gives the driver 48% (11/23) more miles per gallon,
      reduces global warming emissions by 30% and increases the
      horsepower of a two liter engine to the horsepower of a three
      liter engine.<br>
      <br>
      Although the Robinson Engine Head design is not yet in production,
      National Fuelsaver's after-market Platinum Gas Saver is available
      and is guaranteed to increase gas mileage by 22%.<br>
      <br>
      After a five year study, the government concluded: "Independent
      testing shows greater fuel savings with the Gas Saver than the 22%
      claimed by the developer."<br>
      <br>
      With a simple connection to a vacuum line, the Gas Saver adds
      platinum vapor economically to the air and fuel entering the
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      Since platinum enables non-burning fuel to burn, the Gas Saver's
      platinum increases the percentage of fuel burning inside the
      engine from 68% of each gallon to 90% of each gallon, a 22%
      increase.<br>
      <br>
      Since unburnt fuel leaving an engine is pollution, this 22% of
      each gallon normally burns when it reaches the platinum surfaces
      of the catalytic converter.<br>
      <br>
      Since the converter burns this 22% of your fuel outside of the
      engine, the heat and energy produced from this fuel cannot give
      you more miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      But when the air and fuel carry the Gas Saver's platinum into the
      engine, 22% more of each gallon burns inside the engine so that
      22% fewer gallons are required to drive the same distance.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the fuel savings, the Gas Saver has received
      patents for cleaning out the abrasive carbon and raising octane,
      making the premium fuels unnecessary for most vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      Joe Robinson, the developer, commented: "Since the government
      concluded its study, we have sold over a half million Gas Savers.
      To our surprise, more people buy the Gas Saver because it extends
      engine life by cleaning out the carbon than buy it to increase gas
      mileage or to raise octane."<br>

OF




        THE INVENTION </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      This invention relates to internal combustion engines and, more
      particularly, to the provision of an improved expansion cycle
      stroke characteristic in an internal combustion engine. <br>
      <br>
      A form of the internal combustion engine, generally used for
      powering automobiles, operates in accordance with the Otto cycle,
      and may be referred to herein as a gasoline engine, as
      distinguished from a diesel engine. The gasoline engine employs
      one or more cylinders, each cylinder having a piston movable
      therein with reciprocating motion for the driving of a crankshaft
      of the engine. Output power of the engine, for the driving of a
      load, is obtained from the rotating crankshaft. In the four-stroke
      form of the gasoline engine, the movement of a piston in its
      cylinder is characterized by four strokes, which occur in a
      repeating sequence, the sequence of the four strokes being; an
      induction stroke, a compression stroke, a power (or expansion)
      stroke, and an exhaust stroke. During the induction stroke, the
      piston moves away from the head of the cylinder to produce a
      vacuum which draws in a mixture of air and fuel vapors via an
      intake valve generally located in the head of the cylinder. During
      the compression stroke, the piston moves towards the cylinder head
      to compress the air-fuel mixture. Approximately at the beginning
      of the power stroke, there is ignition of the air-fuel mixture
      and, during the power stroke, the expanding gases produced by the
      combustion of the fuel drive the piston away from the cylinder
      head. During the exhaust stroke, the piston moves towards the
      cylinder head to drive the exhaust gases out of the cylinder via
      an exhaust valve generally located in the cylinder head. In the
      usual construction of such an engine, an intake manifold is
      provided for bringing air and fuel from a carburetor or
      fuel-injection assembly to the intake ports of the cylinders, and
      an exhaust manifold is provided for removal of combustion gases
      via exhaust ports of the cylinders. <br>
      <br>
      It is useful to compare operation of the gasoline engine with the
      diesel engine. In the case of the gasoline engine, both fuel and
      air are present in the cylinder during the compression stroke. The
      temperature produced in the gases within the cylinder is below the
      ignition temperature of the air-fuel mixture so as to avoid
      premature ignition of the air-fuel mixture. Ignition is produced
      by an electric spark of a spark plug, mounted within the cylinder
      head. In a modem engine, activation of the spark plug at an
      optimum moment, relative to the time of occurrence of the power
      stroke, is provided by a computer. In the case of the diesel
      engine, only the air is present in the cylinder during the
      compression stroke. The geometry of the piston within the cylinder
      of the diesel engine differs somewhat from the corresponding
      geometry of the gasoline engine such that the compression stroke
      of the diesel engine provides significantly more compression of
      the gases within the cylinder (a compression ratio of
      approximately 15:1) than occurs in the gasoline engine (a
      compression ratio of approximately 8:1). As a result, in the
      diesel engine, the temperature of the air is raised by the
      compression stroke to a temperature high enough to ignite fuel.
      Accordingly, in the diesel engine, the fuel is injected into the
      cylinder at approximately the beginning of the power stroke, and
      is ignited by the high air temperature. <br>
      <br>
      It is observed furthermore, that in the usual construction of a
      gasoline engine and of a diesel engine, the ratio of the expansion
      of the volume of cylinder gases, final volume divided by initial
      volume of the power stroke, is equal to the ratio of the
      compression of the volume of the cylinder gases, initial volume
      divided by final volume of the compression stroke. By way of
      example for a gasoline engine, compression and expansion is
      characterized by a ratio of approximately 8:1, and for a diesel
      engine, compression and expansion is characterized by a ratio of
      approximately 15:1. The expansion of the cylinder gases in the
      power stroke is accompanied by a reduction in the temperature of
      the cylinder gases. Well-known theoretical considerations show
      that an important consideration in determining the efficiency of
      the engine is the ratio of the gas temperature at the beginning of
      the power stroke to the gas temperature at the end of the power
      stroke. A greater temperature ratio is obtained in the case of the
      diesel engine than for the gasoline engine. This is one of the
      reasons that the diesel engine can operate more efficiently than
      the gasoline engine. <br>
      <br>
      Based on the foregoing theoretical consideration, it appears that
      there would be an advantage to the construction of a gasoline
      engine with a higher, or elevated, expansion ratio of the power
      stroke without a corresponding increase in the compression ratio
      of the compression stroke. By maintaining the relatively low value
      of the compression ratio in the compression stroke, the
      temperature of the cylinder gases would be maintained at a
      sufficiently low value so as to avoid premature ignition, as in
      present-day gasoline engines, while greater efficiency would be
      obtained as in present-day diesel engines. A further advantage of
      such an engine would be the avoidance of needless excess
      compression during the compression stroke, a matter which can be
      appreciated by one attempting to start an engine by hand. <br>
      <br>
      Such a construction of an elevated expansion-ratio engine would be
      advantageous for the form of the internal combustion engine,
      generally used for powering automobiles, that operates in
      accordance with the Otto cycle, as well as other "mixed " cycle
      four stroke-repeating internal combustion engines. Such a
      construction of an elevated expansion-ratio engine would be
      advantageous also for a diesel engine wherein an expansion ratio
      in the power stroke of 20:1, by way of example, could be obtained
      for still greater efficiency while the compression ratio of the
      compression stroke would be maintained at 15:1. However, attempts
      to build such an engine have not met with commercial success. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span> <br>
      <br>
      The foregoing need for construction of an engine embodying an
      elevated expansion ratio is met, and other advantages are provided
      by an engine, constructed in accordance with the invention,
      wherein a third manifold, to be referred to as a return manifold,
      connects with a return port in each of the cylinders to remove a
      portion of the gases present in each of the cylinders during their
      respective compression strokes for reinsertion into a stream of
      air-fuel mixture provided by the carburetor or fuel-injection
      assembly. The cylinder head of each of the engine cylinders is
      provided with three ports, namely, an intake port with an
      associated intake valve, an exhaust port with an associated
      exhaust valve, and a return port with an associated return valve.
      An intake manifold of the engine connects via the intake ports and
      the intake valves with respective ones of the engine cylinders, an
      exhaust manifold of the engine connects via the exhaust ports and
      the exhaust valves with respective ones of of the engine
      cylinders, and the return manifold connects via the return ports
      and the return valves with respective ones of the engine
      cylinders. <br>
      <br>
      An engine with three ports and an associated three valves per
      cylinder head plus three manifolds connecting with respective ones
      of the ports is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. of Date et al,
      3,878,826, issued Apr. 22, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as "Date
      "). In the Date patent, the third manifold is connected between a
      carburetor and the cylinders to serve as an auxiliary intake
      manifold while, in the present invention, the third (return)
      manifold connects between the carburetor, or fuel injection
      assembly, and the cylinders to extract a portion of the gases
      (air-fuel mix) present in the cylinders during their respective
      compression strokes to be returned to the carburetor, or the fuel
      injection assembly. In the case of the present invention applied
      to a diesel engine, a portion of the air present in the respective
      cylinders during their compression strokes is returned by the
      third manifold to the source of the compressed air. <br>
      <br>
      The return manifold comprises a relatively large central chamber
      with a set of arms extending from the central chamber to the
      return ports in respective ones of the cylinders. An exit passage
      of the central chamber communicates returned air-fuel mix to a
      location at the carburetor or fuel injection assembly, in the case
      of the gasoline engine, at which location the returning air-fuel
      mix combines with the air-fuel mix provided by the carburetor or
      fuel injection assembly, this location being ahead of the entrance
      to the intake manifold. In the case of a diesel engine, the exit
      passage of the central chamber communicates air to a location at
      the inlet to the source of compressed air. In accordance with a
      further feature of the present invention, the engine includes also
      a set of discharge valves located at the in board ends of the
      manifold arms adjacent to the central chamber of the return
      manifold. For each arm of the return manifold, the return valve
      (located at a cylinder head) serves to close off an outboard end
      of the manifold arm, and the discharge valve serves to close off
      the inboard end of the manifold arm. Thereby, each arm of the
      return manifold, in cooperation with its associated return valve
      and discharge valve, can serve as a holding tank for returned
      air-fuel mix (in the case of the gasoline engine) or returned air
      (in the case of the diesel engine). <br>
      <br>
      The operation of the return valves is synchronized with the
      operation of the intake valves. Such synchronization can be
      accomplished by driving the return valve of an individual one of
      the cylinders by an additional cam on a camshaft which operates
      either one or both of the intake and exhaust valves of the
      cylinder, or by use of a further camshaft. The return valve is
      open during a portion of the compression stroke of its cylinder.
      During an open state of the return valve, the corresponding
      discharge valve is closed, and the interior space of the cylinder
      connects via the return port to the interior space of the
      corresponding holding tank. This effectively enlarges the interior
      size of the cylinder during the portion of the compression stroke
      when the return valve is open. The volume of the holding tank is
      essentially equal to the volume of the cylinder at the point in
      time wherein the piston has moved approximately half way along the
      compression stroke. Therefore, at this point in time, half of the
      charge of the cylinder, namely the air fuel mix (of the gasoline
      engine) or the air (of the diesel engine) is located in the
      cylinder and the other half of the charge is located in the
      holding tank. <br>
      <br>
      Thereupon, the return valve is closed, and the compression stroke
      continues with only half of the charge being present in the
      cylinder. The withdrawn charge is held within the holding tank
      until a later moment when it can be discharged into the central
      chamber of the return manifold. The discharging is accomplished by
      an opening of the discharge valve. In the practice of the
      invention, the discharging of the returned charges of the various
      holding tanks is accomplished in a manner which encourages a
      relatively smooth flow of the returned charges from the return
      manifold into the inlet to the carburetor or the fuel-injection
      assembly. The smooth flow of the returned air or air-fuel mix
      ensures that subsequent metering of the air or air-fuel mix can be
      accomplished in a normal manner without disruption by the process
      of extracting air or air-fuel mix from the cylinders. <br>
      <br>
      The invention can be practiced without major modifications of the
      standard engine. Thus, with respect to increasing the expansion
      ratio during the power stroke of the engine, this can be
      accomplished by using a taller piston while retaining the interior
      length of the cylinder, so that the expansion ratio is increased
      from the value of approximately 8:1 to a value of approximately
      15:1. <br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a well-known relationship in the physics of
      gases, the product of the pressure of a gas times the volume of
      the container of the gas is proportional to the product of the
      temperature of the gas times the number of moles of the gas in the
      container. In the above noted practice of the invention, wherein
      half of the charge of the cylinder is removed during the
      compression stroke, and wherein the length of the piston has been
      increased for an increased expansion ratio, the pressure and
      temperature of the gas at the end of the compression stroke is
      reduced to lower values than that which would be present if no
      modification had been made to the length of the piston for
      identically sized engines in identical vehicles traveling on the
      same road at the same speed. Thereby, the invention enables the
      engine to operate with the high-efficiency associated with the
      higher expansion ratio while retaining the pressure, the
      temperature and the ignition characteristics of the charge in the
      cylinder to be substantially the same as that of an unmodified
      engine. <br>
      <br>
      In modern engines, a computer is employed for regulating the
      air-fuel ratio as well as the total amount of air drawn into the
      cylinders based on such factors as the mass density and
      temperature of environmental air, engine speed, requested
      vehicular speed, and the concentration of oxygen in the exhaust
      gases. Since this invention retains the temperatures and pressures
      of the air or air-fuel mix in the compression stroke, the
      vehicular computer can control the quantities of air and fuel
      admitted to the engine in a fashion similar to that of an
      unmodified engine with minimal changes in programming. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 shows a diagrammatic view of a piston 10 within its
      cylinder 12. The piston 10 is driven by a crankshaft 14 and
      connecting rod 16 with reciprocating motion, wherein the motion of
      the piston 10 is characterized by a repeating sequence of four
      strokes, as described above. During the induction stroke and the
      power (or expansion) stroke, the distance between the piston 10
      and a head 18 of the cylinder 12 increases to provide for an
      increase in the volume of cylinder available for containing gases
      within the cylinder. During the compression and the exhaust
      strokes, the distance between the piston 10 and the head 18
      decreases to provide for a decrease in the volume of the cylinder
      available for the containment of gases within the cylinder. The
      invention provides for the changing of the geometry of the piston
      10 relative to the cylinder 12 by increasing the length of the
      piston 10 to provide for a taller piston 10A as indicated in
      dashed line. Typically, in the construction of the cylinder head
      18, the interior of the head 18 may be provided with a complex
      shape to enhance combustion within the cylinder 12; however, for
      an understanding of the present invention, the interior of the
      cylinder head 18 may be represented by the more simple shape of a
      right circular cylinder as shown in FIG. 1. <br>
      <br>
      By way of example in the construction of the piston 10, 10A within
      its cylinder 12, in the ease of a gasoline engine operating with
      the four-stroke process, when the piston in the cylinder is at top
      dead center, there is 1 cm (centimeter) between piston-top and the
      head. If the length of a stroke is 7 cm, then bottom dead center
      is 8 cm from piston to head, this resulting in a compression
      stroke with 8:1 compression ratio and a power stroke expansion
      ratio of 8:1. The diesel engine four-stroke cycle differs from
      this pattern only by having a higher compression ratio and a
      correspondingly higher expansion ratio. <br>
      <br>
      Now, continuing with this example to show the preferred embodiment
      of the invention, the piston 10A is made to be 0.5 cm taller. This
      changes the geometric ratios from a ratio of (8 cm to 1 cm), with
      corresponding compression and expansion ratios of 8:1, to a ratio
      of (7.5 cm to 0.5 cm) with a corresponding expansion ratio of 15:1
      in the power stroke. The invention prevents the compression ratio
      of the compression stroke from rising above 8:1 by use of the
      return valve (described above and to be described hereinafter)
      which releases some of the gases (or vapor) in the cylinder during
      the beginning of the compression stroke. The result is that the
      compression stroke retains its compression ratio of approximately
      8:1 (assuming that the return valve closes when the piston
      position is half way through the compression stroke) while the
      expansion stroke has the aforementioned expansion ratio of 15:1.
      By this usage of different ratios of the compression and the
      expansion strokes, the invention may be said to change the
      engine's operational aspect ratio of expansion ratio to
      compression ratio from today's regular industrial standard of 1:1
      to an elevated level of about 2:1 in gasoline engines. <br>
      <br>
      In the case of the diesel engine, wherein the elevated temperature
      produced by the relatively high compression of the air is
      responsible for ignition of the fuel, the improvement in the
      aspect ratio in diesel engines may be less that 2:1. However in
      the cases of both the gasoline engine and the diesel engine, if
      the invention results in an "elevated " aspect ratio of greater
      than 1:1. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 also shows an intake valve 20, an exhaust valve 22 and a
      return valve 24 located in the cylinder head 18, these three
      valves being present in both the gasoline and the diesel forms of
      an engine 26 constructed with the piston 10A and the cylinder 12.
      Three camshafts 28, 30 and 32 are provided for operation of the
      valves 22, 24 and 26, respectively. It is understood that the
      three camshafts are provided by way of example, and that, by way
      of further example, a single camshaft with two cams thereon may be
      employed for operation of two of the foregoing valves, or possibly
      a single camshaft with three cams thereon may be employed for
      operation of all three of the valves. The intake valve 20 is
      operative to close and to open an intake port 34 of the head 18.
      The exhaust valve 22 is operative to close and to open an exhaust
      port 36 of the head 18. The return valve 24 is operative to close
      and to open a return port 38 of the head 18. Also shown in FIG. 1
      is a spark plug 40 for ignition of gases in the cylinder 12 in the
      case of the gasoline engine and, as an alternative form of
      construction, FIG. 1 also shows a fuel injector 42 for injecting
      fuel into the heated air at the beginning of the power stroke for
      the case of the diesel engine. Additional cylinders 12 of the
      engine 26 are indicated in phantom. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows a simplified view of the cylinder 12 and its
      connection with a return manifold 44. In the cylinder 12, the
      piston 10A is being driven during a compression stroke from its
      position at bottom dead center towards the cylinder head 18, and
      is shown in FIG. 2 at the halfway point. The return manifold 44
      comprises a central chamber 46 with a plurality of arms 48
      extending from the central chamber 46 to respective ones of the
      cylinders 12 of the engine 26. An outlet passage 50 is provided on
      the central chamber 46 for directing return gases from the return
      manifold 44, in the case of the gasoline engine, to the location
      at the carburetor or fuel injection assembly (not shown in FIG. 2)
      in which the return gases join the stream of the air-fuel mix
      heading toward an inlet of the intake manifold (not shown in FIG.
      2). Arrows show the direction of gas flow within the central
      chamber 46. <br>
      <br>
      Each of the arms 48 has the same construction, which construction
      in shown for one of the arms 48 in the figure. The arm 48 has
      sufficient internal volume to serve as a holding tank 52 for a
      quantity of the cylinder gases passed from the cylinder 12 into
      the arm 48 during a portion of the compression stroke of the
      piston 10A. One end of the holding tank 52, at the outboard end of
      the arm 48, connects via the return valve 24 and the return port
      38 to the cylinder 12. The other end of the holding tank 52, at
      the inboard end of the arm 48, connects via a discharge valve 54
      to the central chamber 46. <br>
      <br>
      In the operation of the arm 48, prior to inception of the
      compression stroke, the discharge valve 54 closes to prevent any
      flow of vapor or gases between the holding tank 52 and the central
      chamber 46. The return valve 24 is opened, at the commencement of
      the compression stroke, to provide for communication between the
      interior space of the cylinder 12 and the interior space of the
      holding tank 52. Then, during the compression stroke, as the
      piston 10A advances towards the head 18, the piston 10A pushes
      gases from the cylinder 12 via the return port 38 into the holding
      tank 52. Since these gases cannot escape from the holding tank 52,
      because of the closure of the discharge valve 54, pressure of the
      gases builds up in both the interior space of the cylinder 12 and
      in the interior space of the holding tank 52. <br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the interior volume of
      the holding tank 52 is equal to one-half of the interior volume of
      the cylinder 12 when the piston 10A is at bottom dead center. When
      the piston advances to a position half way toward the cylinder
      head 18, the position shown in FIG. 2, the volume of the cylinder
      located between the piston and the head is equal to the volume of
      the holding tank 52. Therefore, for the situation depicted in FIG.
      2, half of the gases originally present in the cylinder 12 has
      been moved to the holding tank 52. In the operation of the
      compression stroke, as the piston 10A passes the halfway point,
      the return valve 24 closes to prevent further egress of the gases
      from the cylinder 12. It is recalled that the piston 10A of the
      modified cylinder is taller than the piston 10 (as described above
      in FIG. 1) of the unmodified cylinder. The removal of the
      foregoing quantity of engine gases from the cylinder 12 into the
      holding tank 52 compensates for the greater height of the piston
      10A so as to produce, at the end of the compression stroke, a
      pressure and temperature in the cylinder gases which is
      substantially the same as that which is found in the operation of
      the unmodified cylinder. <br>
      <br>
      By way of review of the preferred embodiment of the invention, it
      is noted that the modification of the engine 26 provided in FIG. 1
      considers the situation wherein the piston is at top dead center,
      and the piston height is raised sufficiently so as to half the
      cylinder space with the piston at top dead center. Reducing the
      volume of the compressed gas by a factor of two raises the
      pressure and temperature of the gas well above the values of
      pressure and temperature found in the unmodified engine. The
      removal of half of the engine gases by means of the holding tank
      52, as described in FIG. 2, restores the values of pressure and
      temperature to those of the unmodified engine. <br>
      <br>
      However, for alternative embodiments of the invention, it is
      recognized that one may wish to lower the pressure and temperature
      of the compression stroke in the modified engine (FIG. 1) to
      values below that found in the unmodified engine so as to be able,
      by way of example, to operate the modified engine with a lower
      octane fuel. This can be accomplished, in accordance with the
      invention, by employing the holding tank 52 to remove more than 50
      percent of the engine gases, for example, to remove 60 percent of
      the engine gases. Removal of the 60 percent of the engine gases is
      accomplished by enlarging the holding tank 52 from the size
      disclosed with reference to FIG. 2. Alternatively, if the engine
      had been operating on low octane fuel, and it is desired to
      operate the modified engine on higher octane fuel, then one would
      reduce the size of the holding tank 52 to remove less than 50
      percent of the engine gases, possibly to remove only 45 percent of
      the engine gases. <br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to alter the amount of the gases removed by
      the holding tank 52 by closing the return valve 24 earlier during
      the compression stroke, this reducing the amount of gases
      transferred from the cylinder 12 into the holding tank 52.
      Alternatively, one may delay the closing of the return valve 24
      during the compression stroke, this increasing the amount of gases
      transferred from the cylinder 12 into the holding tank 52. In each
      of the foregoing cases, it is apparent that the invention has made
      it possible to transfer a precisely determined fraction of the
      cylinder gases into the holding tank 52, thereby to compensate for
      changes in the height of the piston as well as to accomplish
      further changes compensating for fuel octane. <br>
      <br>
      By way of further example in the case of a diesel engine, wherein
      it is desired to alter the expansion ratio of the power stroke
      from a value of 16:1 to the value of 20:1, this can be
      accomplished with a relatively small change in the piston height,
      as compared to the changes disclosed above the reference to FIG.
      1. It is recalled that, in the case of the embodiment of FIG. 1,
      the expansion ratio of the power stroke was changed from a value
      of 8:1 to a value of 15:1 by modification of the engine, while in
      the case of the present example of the diesel engine, a relatively
      small change in the expansion ratio of the power stroke is
      provided, namely, from the aforementioned value of 16:1 to the
      value of 20:1. In order to restore the values of temperature and
      pressure that were originally present in the compression stroke
      prior to the modification of the height of the piston, the holding
      tank 52 would be employed to remove a portion of the cylinder
      gases. However, the amount of the cylinder gases to be removed in
      this example of the diesel engine is smaller than that disclosed
      above with reference to the embodiment of FIG. 1. This is
      accomplished most readily by employing a holding tank 52 of
      smaller size, relative to the size of the cylinder, than that
      disclosed in the description of FIG. 2. <br>
      <br>
      In accordance with a further feature of the invention, that
      central chamber 46 of the return manifold 44 is provided with a
      mesh 56 extending across the chamber 46 at a location between the
      outlet passage 50 and the set of arms 48. By way of example, the
      mesh 56 may divide the internal space of the chamber 46 into two
      equal portions. The mesh 56, which may be constructed as a wire
      screen with apertures therein, functions as an acoustic baffle, as
      does a corresponding structure in a muffler, to reduce pulsations
      in the speed and pressure of gases applied to the central chamber
      46 by respective ones of the arms 48. In terms of an
      electrical-circuit analogy to the operation of the return manifold
      44, gas, escaping from a holding tank 52 by its corresponding
      discharge valve 54 into the central chamber 46, experiences a
      certain amount of resistance to the flow of the gas through the
      discharge valve 54, depending on the interior dimensions of the
      discharge valve 54. <br>
      <br>
      The central chamber 46 has a substantially larger interior volume
      than does any one of the holding tanks 52. The volume of the
      central chamber 46 is sufficiently large to store the quantities
      of gas expelled from a plurality of the holding tanks 52, just as
      a capacitor of an electrical low-pass filter is able to store the
      charge from a pulsating current to provide a relatively in a value
      of voltage. The mesh 56, by introduction of resistance to the flow
      of gases across the chamber 46, may be viewed, in terms of the
      analogous electrical circuit, as dividing the chamber 46 into two
      sections, each of which may be regarded as a capacitor of the
      foregoing low-pass filter, with the two capacitors coupled via an
      electrical resistor. The outlet passage 50 also introduces an
      amount of resistance to the flow of the return gas, depending on
      the interior dimensions of the outlet passage 50. Accordingly, the
      return manifold 44 is operative to reduce pulsations of returned
      gases from the respective cylinders 12 to a steady stream of gas,
      ready to be combined with the air-fuel mixture of a carburetor or
      fuel injection assembly of the engine, in the case of the gasoline
      engine, or with air from the source of compressed air, in the case
      of the diesel engine. <br>
      <br>
      As described above with reference to FIG. 1, the camshafts 28, 30
      and 32 provide synchronization among the valves of the respective
      cylinders 12 of the engine 26. As is well-known in the
      construction of engines, the camshafts are driven by mechanical
      timing apparatus connecting with the crankshaft 14. It is
      understood that, in certain modern engines operated by computer,
      it may be possible to alter the timing between respective ones of
      the valves in a cylinder 12. When such altering of the timing is
      provided, it is based on such factors as engine speed and the
      request for greater engine torque by a person operating the
      vehicle, as when the driver steps on the accelerator pedal. With
      respect to the operation of the discharge valve 54, a mechanical
      linkage with a cam on one of the camshafts 28, 30 or 32 may be
      employed to drive the valve 54, or a separate camshaft (not shown)
      may be employed to drive the valve 54, or a motorized valve (the
      discharge valve 54 in combination with an electric motor drive)
      driven by the engine computer may be employed to drive the valve
      54. Thereby, the timing of the operation of the discharge valve 54
      in each of the respective ones of the manifold arms 48 can be set
      to compensate for pulsations in the magnitude of the vacuum found
      in the intake manifold (to be described hereinafter) during
      operation of the engine 26. Thus, in accordance with a further
      feature of the invention, the timing of the operation of the
      discharge valve 54 may be employed in conjunction with the
      aforementioned pulsationsfiltering operation of the return
      manifold 44 to ensure a steady stream of the flow of the intake
      fuel-air mixture (gasoline engine) or the intake air (diesel
      engine) to the intake manifold. <br>

      FIG. 3 presents a timing diagram showing the various strokes
      during the piston travel with the reciprocating motion in the
      cylinder. Also shown are the open and close positions of the
      valves with reference to the piston travel. Horizontal axes
      represent the time. At the top of the diagram, the piston travel
      is shown as a sinusoidal movement between the top of the stroke
      and the bottom of the stroke, identified in the figure. The
      midpoint of a stroke is also identified. The strokes are
      identified as the induction stroke, wherein the piston travels
      from the top dead center position, adjacent the cylinder head, to
      the bottom dead center position, the compression stroke wherein
      the piston travels from the bottom dead center to the top dead
      center positions, this being followed by the expansion (or power)
      stroke wherein the piston travels from the top dead center
      position to the bottom dead center position, and the exhaust
      stroke wherein the piston travels from the bottom dead center
      position to the top dead center position. The intake valve is
      shown open during the induction stroke and closed during the other
      three strokes. The exhaust valve is shown open during the exhaust
      stroke and closed during the other three strokes. The return valve
      is shown open during the first half of the compression stroke, and
      closed for the second half of the compression stroke as well as
      during the other three strokes. The discharge valve is shown open
      during the exhaust stroke and closed during the other three
      strokes. The open status of the discharge valve is presented by
      way of example for convenience in operating the discharge valve
      from the same cam as is used in operation of the exhaust valve. It
      is understood that, in the event that a separate timing mechanisms
      employed for operation of the discharge valve, the discharge valve
      may be opened, by way of example, during a different interval of
      time, such as an open interval beginning at approximately the
      midpoint of the expansion stroke and terminating at approximately
      the midpoint or at the end of the exhaust stroke. <br>

      FIG. 4 presents a diagrammatic view of the engine 26, and shows
      interconnection of an intake manifold 58 between intake valves 20
      of the respective cylinders 12 of the engine 26 and a housing 60
      which may contain either a carburetor or a fuel injector assembly.
      The engine 26 further comprises an exhaust manifold 62 connecting
      with exhaust valves 22 of the respective cylinders 12. Also shown
      in FIG. 4 is the return manifold 44 of the engine 26, the return
      manifold 44 connecting between the housing 60 of the carburetor or
      the fuel-injector assembly and the return valves 24 of the
      respective cylinders 12. The arms 48 of the return manifold 44
      connect via the discharge valves 54 to the central chamber 46 of
      the return manifold 44. As described above, synchronization of the
      discharge valves 54 with the operation of other components of the
      engine 26 may be accomplished by either a mechanical connection,
      as by an additional camshaft, or by an electrical connection to a
      computer 64 which operates to control various functions of the
      engine 26. <br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 shows a diagrammatic view of the engine 26 wherein a part
      of the engine construction is similar to that of the engine of the
      Date patent, the figure showing further, in schematic form, a
      modification of the head 18 to accommodate an additional pivoting
      valve-lifter rocker-arm 66 operated by a camshaft 68 for opening
      and closing the discharge valve 54. In the engine 26, a cylinder
      12 is shown with its piston 10A, the piston 10A defining with the
      head 18 a combustion chamber 70. In the view of FIG. 5, the
      exhaust valve 22 is positioned behind the intake valve 20 and,
      accordingly, is not visible, but is shown in FIG. 4. The intake
      manifold 58 connects between the housing 60 and the intake valve
      20, and the exhaust manifold 62 connects between an exhaust pipe
      72, at the base of the housing 60, and the exhaust valve 22. An
      auxiliary chamber 74 is formed within the head 18 and branches off
      from the combustion chamber 70 to receive the spark plug 40, and
      to communicate with the return port 38 and the return valve 24.
      The return port 38 is at the junction of the return manifold 44
      and the auxiliary chamber 74. The configuration of the housing 60
      provides for support of an air cleaner 76, provides for a location
      at 78, indicated in phantom, for the venturi of a carburetor and,
      by way of alternative embodiment, provides for a location at 80,
      indicated in phantom, for a fuel injection assembly. The outlet
      passage 50 of the return manifold 44 extends along the interior of
      the housing 60 to combine a stream of the return air-fuel mix with
      an air fuel mixture provided by the carburetor or by the
      fuel-injection assembly. The combined streams of the air fuel
      mixture then enter into the intake manifold 58 to feed the
      combustion within the cylinder 12. Thereby, an engine constructed
      in accordance with the invention is able to recirculate the
      portion of the air-fuel mixture, withdrawn from the cylinder via
      the return manifold, back to the cylinder via the intake manifold.
