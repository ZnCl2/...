      <b><br>
      </b>Scientists in Scotland said they've found a way to cut
      greenhouse gas emissions by curbing cow and sheep flatulence.<br>
      <br>
      The Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen said 60 percent of
      global methane formation is due to agricultural activities, with
      just under half of that produced by ruminants such as cows and
      sheep, the Scottish government said Wednesday in a release.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers said the average cow contributes as much to global
      warming as a family car that travels 12,000 miles, The Daily
      Telegraph reported.<br>
      <br>
      The scientists found that adding fumaric acid to animal feed can
      inhibit the production of methane that occurs naturally as part of
      the animal's digestive process. Tests of the feed additive on
      lambs showed methane production can be cut by up to 70 percent.
      The feed also resulted in lambs gaining weight faster.<br>

      Intensively farmed meat and dairy are a blight, but so are fields
      of soya and maize. There is another way...<br>
      <br>
      Much has been made of the methane emissions of livestock, but
      these are lower in biodiverse pasture systems that include wild
      plants such as angelica, common fumitory, shepherd’s purse and
      bird’s-foot trefoil because they contain fumaric acid – a compound
      that, when added to the diet of lambs at the Rowett Institute in
      Aberdeen, reduced emissions of methane by 70%.<br>
      <br>
      In the vegan equation, by contrast, the carbon cost of ploughing
      is rarely considered. Since the industrial revolution, according
      to a 2017 report in the science journal Nature, up to 70% of the
      carbon in our cultivated soils has been lost to the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      So there’s a huge responsibility here: unless you’re sourcing your
      vegan products specifically from organic, “no-dig” systems, you
      are actively participating in the destruction of soil biota,
      promoting a system that deprives other species, including small
      mammals, birds and reptiles, of the conditions for life, and
      significantly contributing to climate change...<br>

      <b>Field of the invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the reduction of methane
      production in ruminants and/or improved meat and/or milk
      production. In particular the present invention relates to the use
      of encapsulated organic acid(s), especially fumaric acid to
      decrease methane production in ruminants. There is also provided a
      ruminant feed composition which comprises encapsulated fatty
      acid(s), especially fumaric acid for use in decreasing methane
      production by ruminants. Such uses and compositions may also or
      alternatively lead to increased body mass and/or milk production
      by the ruminants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Methane is an important greenhouse gas, contributing approximately
      18% to the overall radiative forcing [1] and to global warming.
      This has been recognised globally and the Kyoto Protocol has
      global reductions for methane set at 5.2% below the 1990 level for
      the period 2008-2012[I]. Within the UK, the government has set
      even stricter reductions and is committed to reducing methane
      emissions to 12.5% below 1990 levels by the same period[2].<br>
      <br>
      In Scotland, the largest source of methane is agriculture;
      contributing approximately 57%, which accounts for 17% of all the
      UK's agricultural emissions[3]. Pretty et al [4] estimated the
      financial damage to the UK over the period 1990-1996 from methane
      emissions to be [pound]280M per annum. Therefore, the cost to
      Scotland could be estimated at [pound]47.6M.<br>
      <br>
      With the European Union discussing methods for taxing emissions of
      greenhouse gases, a technology that decreased methane in the
      agricultural sector would be in great demand.<br>
      <br>
      The reason behind decreasing methane so far has been environmental
      but there are other benefits. For the feed industry, methane
      production (methanogenesis) in the rumen represents a loss of
      energy in the growing animals. It is estimated that between 5 and
      15% of dietary energy is lost as methane by eructation in
      ruminants[5]. Therefore, if this loss were prevented, the animals
      would require less feed.<br>
      <br>
      Several compounds have been studied as potential feed additives
      for ruminants as a method of reducing methane production in the
      rumen[6], such as medium chain fatty acids[7, 8], oxaloacetate and
      butyrate enhancers[9], sodium fumarate[10, 11], oils[12, 13],
      organic acids [9, 14, 15] and fumaric acid[16]. Initial trials
      have shown that fumaric acid would act as an alternative hydrogen
      acceptor and prevent H2 reaching the methanogenic archaea, refer
      to Figure 1. Figure 1 shows how a methanogen could divert reducing
      equivalents, including hydrogen (illustrated by [2H] in Figure 1)
      produced by carbohydrate oxidation and generate methane and water.
      Alternatively, if fumaric acid (fumarate) or an alternative
      organic acid were added, then the reduction of fumarate to
      succinate could be increased, taking the reducing equivalents away
      from the methanogens and generating more carbon flow to
      propionate. This would lead to a decrease in methane produced by
      the methanogenic archaea. [17] However, there was evidence of a
      decrease in rumen pH associated with addition of free acids.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to obviate and/or
      mitigate at least one of the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      In a first aspect there is provided a feed composition for
      ruminants comprising at least one encapsulated organic acid and/or
      salt thereof.<br>
      <br>
      By feed composition is meant a composition, which is eaten by a
      ruminant and digested in the gastrointestinal tract. It is to be
      understood that said at least one encapsulated organic acid is
      generally provided in addition to or in combination with other
      conventional feed components. Conventional feed components may
      include a selection of the following: cereals such as corn, milo,
      wheat, barley, rye, oat, wheat flour, unpolished rice, millet,
      soybean, soybean flour, cassava, etc., oil meals such as soybean
      meal, dehulled soybean meal, rapeseed oil meal, peanut oil meal,
      linseed oil meal, sesame oil meal, coconut oil meal, sunflower oil
      meal, safflower oil meal, palm kerned oil meal, kapok oil mean,
      etc.; feeds of animal origin such as fish meal, fish solubles,
      meat scrap, meat-and-bone meal, blood meal, feather meal, silkworm
      cocoon oil meal, skimmed milk, whey, animal oils (e.g. beef oil,
      lard oil, bone oil, etc.), brewers' yeast, torula yeast, etc.;
      mineral feeds such as sodium chloride, calcium sources (e.g.
      calcium carbonate, limestone powder, oyster shell, etc.) and
      phosphorous sources (e.g. dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium
      phosphate, etc.); vitamins, amino acids and minerals. However,
      this is understood not to include animals grazing on grass, or
      eating roughage alone, when seed feed composition is provided
      separately.<br>
      <br>
      The feed, if necessary, may contain a variety of additives such as
      an antibiotic, preservative, enzyme, anti-fungal agent,
      antioxidant, colorant, sweetener, perfume, binder and so on. In
      the feed, cereals are contained generally in a proportion of about
      30 to 80% by weight and preferably about 40 to 80% by weight.<br>
      <br>
      The feed is frequently given with a roughage. The roughage is
      primarily composed of cellulosic materials such as plant stems and
      leaves, e.g. alfalfa meal, timothy hay, introduced grass, native
      grass, green roughage, straw, tree leaves, etc., brans such as
      rice bran, barley bran, wheat bran, etc. and crude fibers (e.g.
      factory byproducts such as gluten food, gluten meal, starch meal,
      molasses, soy sauce byprodcuts, brewery's byproducts, beat pulp,
      bagasse, soybean curd cake, malt sprouts, mandarin orange peels,
      mandarin orange juice cake, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The feed compositions according to the present invention comprise
      an encapsulated organic acid, or salt thereof. The organic acid
      may be pyruvic acid, acrylic acid, aspartic acid, malic acid,
      citric acid or tartric acid but is preferably fumaric acid.
      Suitable salts include, for example, salts with alkali or alkaline
      earth metals, e.g. potassium, sodium, calcium, barium, magnesium,
      and ammonium. The present invention also includes the use of
      mixtures of said organic acid and/or any of said salts and may
      therefore include the use of one or more acids in combination with
      one or more salts.<br>
      <br>
      Typically the amount of said at least one organic acid, especially
      fumaric acid, and/or salt(s) thereof, will be from about 1% - 20%
      w/total weight of feed composition, such as 10% - 20%, preferably
      7.5% - 15%. It is envisaged that a total amount of approximately
      10 g to 250 g per day may be ingested by a sheep/goat or up to
      about 100 g to 2.5 kg for cattle.<br>
      <br>
      The feed composition of the present invention can be manufactured
      by conventional means. For example, said at least one encapsulated
      organic acid may be blended with the other feed components and
      moulded, if appropriate, into granules, pellets, cakes and the
      like. Alternatively the feed composition comprising encapsulated
      organic acid and/or salt thereof may be formulated into granules,
      pellets, cakes and the like and optionally mixed with other feed
      components.<br>
      <br>
      Said at least one organic acid or salt thereof is/are encapsulated
      such that upon mechanical, chemical or enzymic disruption of the
      feed composition, as occurs due to, for example, chewing and/or
      mixing in the rumen, said organic acid or salt thereof generally
      remains coated and/or otherwise associated with a suitable
      encapsulating agent. It is intended that said organic acid or salt
      thereof should be substantially encapsulated when entering the
      rumen. It is to be understood therefore that the term
      "encapsulated" does not refer merely to combining with
      conventional feed components and, for example, forming into
      pellets or cakes. Thus, said at least one organic acid and/or salt
      thereof, is first encapsulated within a suitable encapsulating
      agent and thereafter mixed with said other feed additives. The
      term "encapsulated" is understood to relate to compositions which
      generally comprise an inner organic acid and/or salt thereof core
      and an outer encapsulating agent layer, as well as compositions in
      which the organic acid and/or salt thereof may be distributed
      within an encapsulating matrix, emulsion, body, substrate or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably said at least one organic acid and/or salt thereof may
      be encapsulated within a material which is poorly, or slowly
      soluble/broken down/digested in the rumen. In this manner, said at
      least one organic acid and/or salt may be released into the rumen
      over an extended period of time, such as 2-24 hours, e.g. 4 to 8
      hours. Thus, in a further aspect, there is provided a slow release
      ruminant feed component, said component comprising at least one
      organic acid and/or salt thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Slow release is intended to cover compositions which release said
      organic acid and/or salt thereof, over a number of hours, 2-24
      hours (e.g. 4 to 8 hours) and/or release said organic acid and/or
      salt thereof in such a manner that the pH of the rumen does not
      fall below pH 6.<br>
      <br>
      In this manner, it is possible to ensure that low concentrations
      of said organic acid and/or salt thereof are present in the rumen,
      over a period of time. Typically said organic acid and/or salt
      thereof may be encapsulated in a lipid coating, such as a mono-,
      di- and/or tri-glyceride, oils, such as hydrogenated or partially
      hydrogenated vegetable oil, coconut oil, palm oil, waxes, organic
      esters or combinations thereof. Alternatively, said organic acid
      and/or salt thereof may be coated in a natural or synthetic
      polymer that is capable of allowing slow release of said organic
      acid and/or salt thereof, into the rumen. Examples of suitable
      polymers include hydroxyalkyl carboxylate polyester, cellulose or
      amylose based polyers, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone
      and polyhydroxyalkamoate.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly suitable encapsulating agents and formulations are
      described in US6,312,741, to which the skilled reader is directed.
      Preferred compositions of the present invention comprise an
      encapsulating agent in an amount of about 10% - 50% w/total weight
      of the composition and 90% - 50% w/total weight of the composition
      organic acid and/or salt thereof. Particularly preferred
      compositions are marketed under the trademark Bakesure(R), such as
      Bakeshure 451 and Bakeshure 470, which have the following
      compositions:<br>
      <br>
      Bakeshure&lt;(R)&gt; 451<br>
      Fumaric acid 83% to 87%<br>
      Coated with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br>
      Coating content 13% to 17%.<br>
      Bakeshure (R) 470<br>
      Fumaric acid 61% to 65%.<br>
      Coated with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br>
      Coating content 35% to 39%.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the present inventors have observed that
      encapsulating said at least one organic acid or salt thereof does
      not lead to such an undesirable pH drop in the rumen, as observed
      when using unencapsulated organic acid, such as fumaric acid and
      leads to more consistent inhibition of methane formation.
      Additionally, more feed comprising the encapsulated organic acid
      or salt thereof (e.g. fumaric acid) is ingested by a ruminant.
      Without wishing to be bound by theory, increased feeding may be
      due to the lesser reduction in pH in the rumen and/or the feed
      being more palatable to the ruminant.<br>
      <br>
      It is envisaged that the feed compositions according to the
      present invention can result in decreased methane production
      and/or increased/improved productivity, such as increased and/or
      better quality milk and/or meat production. Specifically, the
      altered fatty acid composition of milk and meat may promote
      improved health in man.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in a further aspect, there is provided use of an organic
      acid and/or salt thereof, especially fumaric acid and/or salt
      thereof in the manufacture of an encapsulated and/or slow release
      formulation for reducing methane production and/or
      increasing/improving the quality of milk and/or meat produced by
      said ruminant.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect there is provided a method of reducing methane
      production and/or increasing/improving the quality of milk and/or
      meat produced by a ruminant comprising the step of feeding to a
      ruminant an encapsulated or slow release organic acid and/or salt
      thereof.<br>
      <br>

      mixed thoroughly with the EL feed in the feed tray before being
      given to the animals and water was freely available.<br>
      <br>
      Week 2 - Addition of Additives Via the Cannula<br>
      <br>
      75 g of each additive was added to a sample bottle and
      approximately 200 ml rumen fluid added. A rod was used to mix the
      additive with the rumen fluid. The rumen fluid was then poured
      back into the sheep rumen using the cannula.<br>
      <br>
      Animals were fed 400 g of ewe lamb feed (EL) or, 475 g EL feed
      only if in the control group on the morning of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      Each period of the Latin square consisted of feeding each
      supplement then extraction of a 20 mL rumen fluid sample via a
      cannula at the following times: -pre-feeding, 1/2 hour after
      feeding and then again at 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs and 7 hrs post
      feeding. At each sampling time, an estimation of the feed
      remaining was recorded. The sheep were not fed again until after
      the last samples were taken.<br>
      <br>
      A 3 day rest period between Latin Squares was incorporated into
      the experiment, where the animals received 1000 g ewe lamb feed
      over two servings, a.m. and p.m. for one day and 1200 g ewe lamb
      feed over two servings, a.m. and p.m. for the remaining two days.<br>
      <br>
      Upon transfer of samples to the laboratory, the rumen fluid was
      strained through a double layer of gauze into a sterile universal
      bottle. 4 mL of each sample was transferred to a reaction tube
      containing 1 mL 20% orthophoshoric acid containing 20 mM 2-ethyl
      butyric acid and stored for VFA analysis. The pH of the remaining
      sample was then recorded.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Encapsulation of Fumaric Acid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1.5 g of the selected oil was melted in an 800W Hinari (Lifestyle)
      microwave oven on FULL power for 2 minutes and stirred. The
      mixture was returned to the microwave for a further 30 seconds
      until the liquid was clear. 8.5 g Sigma-Aldrich fumaric acid was
      placed in an IKA AlO electric mill. The melted oil was drizzled
      over the fumaric acid powder, and the fumaric acid (85%) and oil
      (15%) mixture were blended for approximately 30 seconds. A
      stainless steel spatula was used to remove any powder stuck to the
      sides or lid and the process repeated 2 or 3 times until the
      fumaric acid had been thoroughly mixed with the oil.<br>

      <b>Analytical Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Gas Analysis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Total gas was measured using a 100 mL glass syringe connected to a
      0.5 x 16 mm needle, which was injected through the stoppers into
      the headspace. A gas sample (1 mL) was removed from each bottle
      and analysed for methane, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide by
      gas chromatography using a PYE Unicam GCV. The column used was a 4
      mm x 3 m glass column packed with Porapak Q mesh 60-80 (Waters
      Associates Inc., Milford, MA, USA). Detector temperature:
      150[deg.]C, injector temperature was: 85[deg.]C and the carrier
      gas (argon) flow rate was 30 mL/min; a katherometer detector was
      used. Peaks were identified by comparison with gas standards of
      known composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Volatile Fatty Acid Analysis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sample fluid (4 mL) was added to 1 mL of an acid solution
      containing 20% orthophosphoric acid containing 20 mM 2-ethyl
      butyric acid as the standard. Samples were centrifuged at 14 000
      rpm (20 000 - 24 000 x g) for 15 minutes at 4&lt;0&gt;C using a
      Sorvall RC-SB refrigerated superspeed centrifuge. Volatile fatty
      acids were determined using a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II Gas
      Chromatograph in accordance with the method described by Stewart
      and Duncan[18].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Statistical Analyses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Differences between the groups for each experiment were calculated
      using a single variation ANOVA in an Excel worksheet. P values
      were described as either: - Not Significant (NS), P &gt; 0.05
      Significant (*), P between 0.01 and 0.05 Very Significant (**), P

      <br>
      See above for methods. Results are shown in Table 1. Methane
      production decreased in the presence of sodium fumarate and
      fumaric acid. Although it appears sodium fumarate has reduced
      methane production by twofold compared to fumaric acid, the
      concentration of sodium fumarate was twice that of the fumaric
      acid. Therefore, the difference between the effect of sodium
      fumarate and fumaric acid upon methane production is small. If it
      were assumed that the concentration of fumaric acid is directly
      linked to methane production then methane would be decreased by
      15.3% for a 0.4 M solution. This can be compared with a 14.2%
      reduction in methane produced by a 0.4 M solution of sodium
      fumarate. Table 1. The Effect of Free Fumaric Acid and the Salt

      production was less in the complete addition and timed addition

      due to the small volumes of gas produced over 6 hours. Propionate

      <br>
      The percentage of methane depletion observed at 54.6 mg EFA and
      46.4 mg FA was slightly higher in fumaric acid samples (7.9%) than
      in encapsulated fumaric acid samples (7.2%). This may have been
      due to the effects of the vegetable oil layer surrounding the
      encapsulated fumaric acid. Unexpectedly, at low concentrations of
      EFA (11.8 mg and 17.6 mg), methane production increased and
      volatile fatty acid generation decreased when compared with the
      control. Again, this could be due to unknown effects introduced by
      the vegetable oil, which are overcome at higher concentrations. A
      greater increase in propionate production was observed in samples
      containing fumaric acid, 46.4 mg (61.1%) than EFA, 54.6 mg (42%).
      It is possible that not all the encapsulated fumaric acid had
      dissolved and was still being released into the in vitro system at
      the end of the 24 hour period.<br>

      <b>Example 4: The Effect of Encapsulated Fumaric Acid and Fumaric

      Results are shown in Figures 2, 3 &amp; 4, Tables 4 &amp; 5 and

      <br>
      Total volatile fatty acid concentration increased slightly with
      addition of encapsulated fumaric acid and fumaric acid, see Figure
      2. No significant differences between the experimental groups were
      observed for acetic acid, iso-butyric acid, butyric acid,
      iso-valeric acid, valeric acid and caprioic acid. However, there
      were significant differences between the experimental groups for
      propionic acid concentration and propionic acid production rate,
      see Figures 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, fumaric acid appeared to inhibit propionic acid
      production, but after 4 hours this effect disappeared and the
      propionic acid concentration and production rate remained just
      slightly above that of the EFA groups.<br>
      <br>
      Encapsulated fumaric acid also increased propionic acid
      concentration and production rate, but the increase was more
      stable than that seen in fumaric acid groups.<br>

      After 24 hours, there was a significant difference in the

      certainly not inhibited propionic acid production.<br>

      After 24 hours, samples containing fumaric acid had converted
      69.1% to propionic acid whereas those containing encapsulated
      fumaric acid showed a 58.6% conversion. This could mean that the
      encapsulation layer of the fumaric acid is still protecting the
      fumaric acid from being dissolved or the pathway is being
      inhibited slightly by the presence of the vegetable oil layer.<br>
      <br>
      Although methane was not measured, the total potential number of
      [mu]moles methane that could be captured by EFA was 330 [mu]moles
      and 340 [mu]moles by fumaric acid.<br>

      <b>Example 5: The Effect of Encapsulated Fumaric Acid and Fumaric
        Acid on the pH of Unbuffered Rumen Fluid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      See above for methods. Results are shown in Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      Encapsulated fumaric acid followed the pH of the control
      relatively well and only caused a slight drop in pH compared to
      fumaric acid, which caused a drop of 0.74 pH units after only half
      an hour. The difference in pH was most likely due to the effect of
      the vegetable coating; preventing the fumaric acid dissolving
      immediately and slowing down the drop in pH. Example 6: The Effect
      of Fumaric Acid, Bakeshure&lt;(R)&gt; 451 and Bakeshure&lt;(R)&gt;
      470 on the pH and Volatile Fatty Acid Concentration of Sheep Rumen
      Fluid In Vivo.<br>
      <br>
      See Sections above for methods. pH results are shown in Figures 6
      and 7. Estimation of remaining feed is described in Figure 8.
      Volatile fatty acid results are illustrated in Figures 9 and 10.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 shows little variance in pH throughout the sampling
      period. Statistical analyses showed no significant differences
      between the groups throughout the sampling period (P -value &gt;
      0.05). This is unexpected as fumaric acid caused a drop in pH in
      in vitro experiments, see Example 5. The lack of pH drop can
      however, be partially explained by the results described in Figure
      8. At the end of the sampling period there was always at least 25%
      of the feed containing fumaric acid remaining in the feed box
      whereas all the other feeds were gone by the end of the day. There
      could be various reasons why the sheep did not eat the fumaric
      acid, e.g. palatability, a regulation effect or a physical effect
      (e.g. the fumaric acid irritated the mouth or nose). However, as
      the fumaric acid was not eaten completely the pH drop was not
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 7 illustrates the pH in the rumen after the additives were
      added via the cannula. The decrease in pH associated with fumaric
      acid is clearly illustrated after half an hour post-feeding. On
      average, the lowest pH recorded as a result of fumaric acid was
      4.40. The two Bakeshure products did not cause such a drastic drop
      in pH; Bakeshure&lt;(R)&gt; 451 reached a low of 5.78 and
      Bakeshure&lt;(R)&gt; 470 reached a low of 6.19.<br>
      <br>
      Statistical analyses revealed no significant differences between
      the groups pre- feed (P- value = 0.810) but half an hour after
      feeding the difference was extremely significant (P-value =
      0.000). One hour after feeding the difference between the groups
      was significant (P-value = 0.042) and thereafter there were no
      significant differences between the groups (P-value &gt;0.05).<br>
      <br>
      Although statistically, there was no significant difference
      between the groups (P-value &gt; 0.05), Figure 9 shows that upon
      average the diet containing fumaric acid produced the lowest
      levels of propionic acid at each sampling time. This follows on
      from the estimation of remaining feed results, as the animals were
      not eating, lower levels of fatty acids would be expected. Both
      Bakeshure products were initially lower than the control but after
      2 hours had risen above. The concentration of propionic acid then
      remained constant (approximately 18 - 20 mM) until the end of the
      sampling period. This seems to corroborate the theory that the
      Bakeshure products are broken down slowly and there is no sudden
      release of fumaric acid and hence no sudden conversion to
      propionic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Statistically, there were no significant differences between the
      groups (P-value &gt; 0.05). Comparing the control and two
      Bakeshure products in Figures 9 and 10, the results are very
      similar. However, fumaric acid appears different in each graph. In
      Figure 10, two hours after feeding the concentration of propionic
      acid increased until it was higher than any other group. This
      could be due to the effect of pH on bacterial metabolism, as the
      increase in propionic acid coincides with an increase in pH, see
      Figure 6.<br>
      <br>
      Bakeshure(R) 470 appears to produce less propionic acid than the
      control at least for the first two hours. This could be due to an
      increased delay in the release of fumaric acid compared to the
      Bakeshure(R) 451 release; as Bakeshure(R) 470 has a thicker layer
      of oil (35% to 39% compared to 13% to 17% partially hydrogenated
      vegetable oil respectively) it should release fumaric acid at a
      slower rate than Bakeshure(R) 451. Therefore, propionic acid
      concentration could have stayed constant for longer than the time
      sampled as fumaric acid was steadily released. In addition to
      this, there will be less fumaric acid proportionally in
      Bakeshure(R) 470 compared to Bakeshure(R) 451 , so less propionic
      acid will be produced as a consequence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several compounds have been studied as potential feed additives
      for ruminants as a method of reducing methane production in the
      rumen[6], such as medium chain fatty acids[7, 8], oxaloacetate and
      butyrate enhancers[9], sodium fumarate[10, 11], oils[12, 13],
      organic acids [9, 14, 15] and fumaric acid[16]. Initial trials
      have shown that fumaric acid would act as an alternative hydrogen
      acceptor and prevent H2 reaching the methano genie archaea[17].
      However, there was evidence of a decrease in rumen pH associated
      with addition of free acids. Therefore a method of supplying
      fumaric acid had to be found that decreased methane production but
      did not adversely affect rumen pH.<br>
      <br>
      Encapsulated fumaric acid (an ingredient in tortilla flour) used
      in vitro was found to decrease the drop in rumen pH with no large,
      adverse effects upon propionic acid and methane production.
      Propionic acid production dropped by 4% in encapsulated fumaric
      acid samples compared to fumaric acid samples. Methane generation
      in samples containing encapsulated fumaric acid was 0.8% higher
      than those samples containing fumaric acid.<br>
      <br>
      No drop in rumen pH was observed in sheep fed 75 g fumaric acid in
      400 g Ewe Lamb feed. In addition, the two Bakeshure(R) products
      did not greatly affect rumen pH when fed in the diet. However,
      when the additives were introduced to the sheep via the cannula,
      fumaric acid caused a drop in rumen pH to 4.40 compared to 5.78
      from Bakeshure(R) 451 and 6.19 by Bakeshure(R) 470. The difference
      between the two sets of data may be due to the fact that the sheep
      were reluctant to eat fumaric acid and often left approximately
      25% of the feed at the end of the day. Palatability, a regulation
      effect or a physical effect (e.g. the fumaric acid irritated the
      mouth or nose) are all reasons why the sheep may have been
      reluctant to eat the acid.<br>
      <br>
      An encapsulated fumaric acid product would therefore have at least
      two advantages over fumaric acid: -<br>
      <br>
      1) Increased palatability,<br>
      2) No dangerous drop in rumen pH.<br>
      3) No increase in Na&lt;+&gt; uptake, causing electrolyte
      imbalance.<br>
      <br>
      Example 7: Effect of encapsulated fumaric acid on growth, feed
      intake and methane production in lambs.<br>
      <br>
      One hundred and twenty Welsh Mule Cross lambs (5 - 6 months old;
      average weight 26 kg; range 16.5 kg - 39 kg) were randomly
      allocated to one of the following three diets; Control (17 g
      partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (PHVO)/kg concentrate),
      fumaric acid (100 FA and 17 g PHVO/kg concentrate), EFA (117 g EF
      A/kg concentrate). Lambs were fed ad libitum and presented with
      unlimited amounts of straw and fresh water. The growth trial
      lasted for 56 d, during which lamb weight, feed intake and methane
      production were recorded. Gaseous emissions were measured using a
      tunnel system (Lockyer et al., 1995). The methane concentration of
      the sampled air was taken alternately at 4-min intervals from the
      air leaving or entering the tunnel and evaluated using a gas
      chromatograph. Data were compared by analysis of variance for live
      weight gain, empty body weight at slaughter and killing out
      percentage, blocked by pen.<br>
      <br>
      Treatments had no significant effect on live weight gain (Table 6)
      over 56 d. However, when the first 22 d were considered, animals
      receiving EFA had a significantly higher rate of gain (P&lt;0.05)
      whereas those receiving FA had a significantly lower rate of
      weight gain (P&lt;0.05). Both FA and EFA decreased feed intake,
      with the effect more pronounced in the FA group. As a result of
      the increase in weight gain and reduction in intake, the
      efficiency of feed conversion was higher when EFA was added to the
      diet. On a numerical basis, there was a 20% boost in efficiency of
      the EFA supplemented animals compared to the control group.<br>
      <br>
      Table 6. Daily live weight gain, concentrate intake, feed
      conversion, empty body weight and killing out percentage in lambs
      fed non-supplemented diets or diets supplemented withfumaric acid
      or encapsulated fumaric acid.<br>

      <br>
      Given that approximately 10% of the animals' gross energy is
      estimated to be lost via methane, this increase in efficiency
      seems rather high. However, other authors have reported that
      organic acids such as FA might improve rumen function (Martin,
      1998) and stimulate fibrolytic activity in the rumen (Lopez et
      al., 1999). The empty body weight at slaughter was similar between
      the groups thus there was no effect of the treatments on the
      killing out percentage, which averaged around 50%.<br>

      <br>
      Both fumaric acid treatments significantly decreased methane
      formation (Table 7) with EFA (75% decrease in methane) being
      significantly (P&lt;0.05) more effective than FA (50% decrease in
      methane). Based on a 100% conversion of fumaric acid to
      propionate, 150 g fumaric acid would decrease methane production
      by 7 L. Table 7 reveals that the actual decrease in methane (EFA,
      17.9 L; FA, 11.7 L) is far greater than can be predicted
      stoichiometrically. The reason for this difference is unclear and
      requires further investigation, however it is possible that the
      effect of the FA is cumulative, effectively starving the ruminal
      methanogens of the H2 they require for methanogenesis and
      decreasing their numbers and activity over a period of time.<br>
      <br>
      The 75% decrease in methane described in this study is the largest
      reported in the literature to date and as well as having an impact
      on the environment whereby greenhouse gas emissions are abated
      there are significant implications for the farming industry with
      increased efficiency of feed conversion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 8: In Vitro Batch Fermentations</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Short-term (24-hour) incubations were carried out with rumen fluid
      withdrawn from three rumen cannulated sheep. Rumen fluid was
      withdrawn, via a cannula, 2 hours after the morning feed and
      strained through two layers of gauze. Strained rumen fluid was
      taken from each sample, pooled and maintained under O2-free CO2.
      Rumen fluid was anaerobically transferred to the buffer described
      by Menke and Steingass [19] containing per litre: 475 mL distilled
      water, 0.12 mL trace elements solution (13.2 g CaCl2.2H2O, 10 g
      MnCl2.4H2O, 1 g CoCl2.6H2O and 0.8 g FeCl2.6H2O per litre), 237 mL
      of buffer solution (35 g NaHCO3 and 4 g (NH4)HCO3 per litre), 237
      mL of main elements solution (5.7 g Na2-HPO4, 6.2 g KH2-PO4 and
      0.6 g MgSO4.7H2O per litre), 1.22 mL 0.1 % (w/v) resazurin
      solution (100 mg/100 mL distilled water) and 47.5 mL freshly
      prepared reducing solution (336 mg Na2S.9H2O and 2 mL IM NaOH made
      up to 47.5 mL with distilled water). The final ratio of the buffer
      :rumen fluid was 2:1. After mixing, 50 mL of buffered rumen fluid
      was anaerobically dispensed to a 120 mL Wheaton bottle containing
      400 mg of general purpose (GP) diet, see Appendix III, previously
      ground to pass through a 1 mm mesh screen. The bottles were sealed
      (under CO2 atmosphere) with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminium
      crimp caps then incubated at 39 [deg.]C for 24 hours in a Grant
      OLS 200 water bath.<br>

      <b>Effect of Fumaric Acid Encapsulated in a High Melting Point
        Coconut Oil and Palm Oil on Methane and VFA Production</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sigma-Aldrich fumaric acid coated in coconut oil (melting point
      20-28 &lt;0&gt;C) and palm oil (melting point 30-40 [deg.]C) was
      prepared described herein. 54.6 mg fumaric acid coated in either
      coconut oil or palm oil was added to Wheaton bottles containing
      400 mg general purpose feed in triplicate. 8.2 mg of coconut oil
      or palm oil was added to Wheaton bottles containing 400 mg general
      purpose feed in triplicate. For comparison 46.4 mg fumaric acid
      and 54.6 mg Bakeshure 451 were also set up. Another three bottles
      were set up containing 400 mg general purpose feed only
      (controls).<br>
      <br>
      After 24 hours of incubation, analyses of methane, hydrogen,
      carbon dioxide, nitrogen and volatile fatty acids were carried
      out.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Different encapsulation treatments and ingredients produced
      different effects on methane formation from ruminal fluid in vitro
      (Figure 11). Statistical analysis of the results in Figure 11
      showed a very significant difference (P- value 0.0018). Based on
      the control producing 23.17 mL methane, the following changes were
      observed: - Fumaric acid (FA) -11% decrease in methane production,
      Bakeshure 451 -19% decrease in methane production, Coconut oil -4%
      increase in methane production, FA + coconut oil -12% decrease in
      methane production, Palm oil -4% decrease in methane production,
      FA + palm oil -20% decrease in methane production. Bakeshure 451
      decreased methane production by approximately double that of
      fumaric acid alone. Coconut oil alone did not decrease methane
      production but increased it by 4% in. Fumaric acid coated in
      coconut oil decreased methane by approximately the same percentage
      as fumaric acid alone. Fumaric acid coated in palm oil decreased
      methane by approximately the same percentage as the Bakeshure 451.
      As palm oil by itself caused only a slight decrease in methane and
      fumaric acid alone decreases methane by half the amount of the
      combined sample, it can be noted that encapsulation of fumaric
      acid with palm oil decreases methane production further than
      non-coated fumaric acid.<br>
      <br>
      Volatile fatty acid production was affected in a manner consistent
      with effects on methane formation (Table 8).<br>

      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Coating fumaric acid with high melting point oils produced the
      same effect on methane production: methane decreased by 20%, in
      comparison with Bakeshure 451, which gave a 19% decrease. Coconut
      oil on its own did not appear to decrease methane production. This
      is surprising as Machm[upsilon]ller et al 1998[2O] found methane
      generation was decreased 43% when 26 g coconut oil/kg feed was
      incubated with rumen fluid. In the experiment reported here, the
      equivalent of 20.5 g coconut oil/kg feed was used but methane
      production increased by 4%.<br>
      <br>
      Fumaric acid encapsulated in either coconut oil or palm oil
      increased propionate concentrations to the same level as fumaric
      acid alone. Bakeshure 451, however, was consistently below that of
      fumaric acid. This shows that Bakeshure 451 is not the optimum
      product for decreasing methane and increasing propionate
      production, but by can be improved upon by changing the fat layer.
      The experiment reported here illustrates that other fats and
      different coating methods can replace or improve upon the method
      of preparation and chemical composition of Bakeshure. Furthermore,
      microscopic analysis indicated that the encapsulated fumaric acid
      particles used in encapsulation experiments was smaller than
      Bakeshure 451 particles. Thus, the size of particle appears not to
      be critical to the effectiveness of inhibition of methane
      formation from ruminal digesta in vitro. Appendices<br>
