      </div>
      An alternator having a rotor which extends obliquely with respect
      to its axis of rotation between at least a pair of pole pieces
      having power windings disposed therein with the turns of the
      windings facing the pivotal axis of the rotor. Upon driving the
      rotor in rotation, the rotor due to its oblique configuration
      causes the flux extending with respect to the pole pieces to
      reciprocate with respect to the pivotal axis and the power
      windings, thereby producing two cycles of alternating current for
      each rotation of the rotor. The form of the rotor can
      substantially correspond to a portion of a cylinder having
      oppositely disposed face portions extending obliquely with respect
      to the central axis of the of the cylinder which is substantially
      coincident with the pivotal axis of the rotor. The periphery of
      the rotor thereby generates a cylindrical figure of revolution as
      the rotor is rotated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to the field of electrical power generation
      and more particularly to alternating current generators or
      alternators. The invention also relates to alternators in which
      the lateral axis of the rotor is disposed at an oblique angle with
      respect to the axis of rotation of the rotor. The oblique angle
      results in the rotor having its angular momentum distributed with
      respect to two separate axes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Notwithstanding the increased interest in energy conservation over
      the last decade, no substantial advance has been made in
      increasing the efficiency of electrical generating apparatus.
      Rather, the art has made incremental advances, but in general
      produces electrical energy with apparatus having approximately the
      same efficiencies as those used several decades ago.<br>
      <br>
      For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,321,652, issued to Opel on May 23,
      1967, teaches a reduction in windage losses which is achieved by
      employing a solid rotor having no windings thereon. The rotor
      incorporates two poles, separated by an area of non-magnetic
      material. The field coils are coupled to the rotor poles by means
      of an air gap. The stator windings undergo the same fluctuations
      in magnetic field as if windings were present on the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      U S. Pat. No. 3,571,639, issued to Tiltins on Mar. 23, 1971,
      discloses a solid rotor which is made up of alternating magnetic
      and non-magnetic sections, interleaved by extending finger-like
      members, and with a magnetic section in the center. This
      construction provides a two-section alternator capable of
      increasing the alternator output power for a given shaft speed.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 3,398,386, which issued to Summerlin on Aug. 20,
      1968, also teaches a rotor for a synchro device in which the rotor
      is without windings and without poles. Rather, the rotor has one
      face inclined obliquely to the axis of the rotor in order that a
      point on the stator windings receives magnetic flux in varying
      strength, depending upon the width of the rotor opposite that
      point.<br>
      <br>
      Yet another approach is offered by Imris in U.S. Pat. No.
      3,760,205 which issued on Sept. 18, 1973. In this patent, the
      rotor is shaped as a helically-wound flat band which receives
      magnetic flux through air gaps coupled to the poles of the field
      magnet. As the rotor rotates, a varying length of the rotor band
      is coupled to the field source, thus varying the reluctance of the
      rotor and hence the field strength impressed upon the stator
      windings.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it can be seen that the prior art of alternator
      constructions despite years of effort has not achieved changes in
      alternator construction based upon new principles which could
      dramatically increase the conversion efficiency of the alternator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an
      alternator operating at significantly higher efficiences than
      those known to the art.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of this invention is to provide an alternator
      capable of producing a higher-frequency output per shaft
      revolution per pole set than is known to the art.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide an alternator which
      can derive useful work from the reactive power which usually
      contributes only to the losses in present alternating current
      generating systems.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects are achieved in the present invention by
      providing an alternator with a stator element carrying a
      combination of field windings and power windings and a rotor which
      reciprocates the magnetic field across said power windings with
      substantially simple harmonic motion.<br>
      <br>
      One embodiment of the invention employes a rotor fabricated from a
      stack of laminated disks, pressed upon an arbor which is obliquely
      disposed with respect to the intended axis of rotation, and
      integrally machined in order to provide the assembly with a
      peripheral contour equivalent to that of a cylinder. The stator is
      formed of two salient pole projections, each having a concave pole
      face whose radius is slightly greater than the radius of the
      rotor. The rotor thereby defines an air gap of continuous
      dimension when rotated. The rotor is in series with the two pole
      pieces to complete the magnetic circuit. As the rotor is rotated,
      the zone at which the flux is coupled to the pole pieces varies in
      position along the length of each pole face. The magnetic flux is
      swept forward and then backward across the power windings during
      each revolution, thereby inducing a voltage therein. Since the
      magnetic flux reverses its direction of motion, but never its
      intrinsic polarity, there is a generation of force at the point of
      reversal which acts in concert with the force provided by the
      prime mover. Thus, an alternator constructed according to the
      present invention will produce a given volume of output power for
      a significantly reduced volume of input power.<br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1 and 7 show a preferred embodiment of the alternator 20 of
      the invention. The alternator comprises a stator assembly 22 and a
      rotor assembly 30 disposed within a housing 12. The housing is
      supported by a base member 14.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2 it can be seen that the stator assembly 22 has the
      general form of a hollow cylinder. The stator assembly is formed
      of a highly permeable material and is provided with two pole
      pieces 23 which extend radially inwardly and terminate in concave
      faces 23a.<br>
      <br>
      The stator assembly 22 carries two sets of windings. Field
      windings 24 may be carried on the stator body in a convenient
      location, for example, at the top portion 22a and the bottom
      portion 22b of the stator iron as shown in FIG. 2. The
      constructional details of such windings are well-known to the art.<br>
      <br>
      Power windings 26 are also carried by the stator assembly with one
      or more windings on each pole piece 23. (FIGS. 2 and 7). The
      windings 26 are located in slots 28 extending in to the face 23a
      of each pole piece 23. The slots should be of sufficient depth to
      insure that the windings 26 disposed in them do not protrude into
      the air gap 42 (FIGS. 3 and 7). It should be noted that the
      embodiment of the invention, i.e., alternator 20, comprises one
      pair of pole pieces 23; however the alternator of the invention
      can be constructed in embodiments containing multiple pairs of
      poles.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor assembly 30 can best be seen in FIGS. 2, 3, and 6. A
      shaft 32 carries a rotor 34 within the hollow cylinder defined by
      the stator body. The shaft is journaled on suitable bearings 38
      (FIG. 3) mounted in each of the opposite ends 12a of the casing
      28. A prime mover (not shown), is connected to shaft 32 to provide
      a driving torque. The rotor 34 is fabricated from material having
      high permeability, preferably, electrical steel, such as a stack
      of silicon steel laminations to reduce or minimize eddy currents.
      The rotor 34 is secured to shaft 32 by an arbor 36a.
      Counterweights 40 can be mounted on the shaft 32 to provide a
      balanced mechanical structure.<br>
      <br>
      The form of the rotor 34 as shown in FIG. 3, is a section of a
      cylinder having a diameter D and an axis A, which is cut by two
      parallel planes "B" and "C". In the preferred embodiment, angle
      "a" is 45 DEG. FIG. 3 shows the rotor at the beginning of a cycle
      of rotation when the rotor is seen as if on edge. FIG. 4 shows the
      rotor viewed 90 DEG from the position of FIG. 3. In this position,
      the face 34a of the rotor can be seen to be elliptical. FIG. 5
      shows the rotor after a movement of 180 DEG from the position
      shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      The areas on the rotor edge 35 and a portion of the faces of the
      pole pieces 23 are referred to as coupling zones 37 and pole face
      flux zones 39, respectively (FIGS. 3-6, 10C and 10D). The pole
      face flux zones oscillate along the length of each pole face with
      simple harmonic motion as the rotor assembly is revolved. Thus,
      the position of the upper pole flux zone 39 as shown in FIG. 3 is
      located at the right-hand end of the pole face, while the same
      zone as shown in FIG. 4 is located at the center of symmetry of
      the power winding. In FIG. 5, this zone has travelled to the
      left-hand end of the pole face. Thus, as the rotor stack turns
      through the next 180 DEG, the pole face flux zones 39 return to
      the position shown FIG. 3. These zones execute harmonic motion
      with respect to<br>
      <br>
      Operation of the alternator according to the present invention
      requires the presence of a d.c. excitation current in the field
      windings 24 and the application of a torque to shaft 32. The
      current flowing in the field windings 26 produces a stationary
      magnetic field in the stator iron 22 with the lines of flux
      tending to flow in the magnetic circuit by following the path of
      least reluctance, as illustrated by arrows F in FIG. 6 and as
      shown in FIG. 7. Flux will flow through the stator 22 to the flux
      zone 39 of pole pieces 23. From there, flux will pass across the
      air gap 42 to the flux zone 37 of the rotor 34, returning across
      the air gap 42 to the pole piece of opposite polarity, and then
      back to the stator. Thus, the rotor magnetically couples the two
      pole faces 23a, by providing a low-reluctance path between the
      pole pieces. Since the peripheral portions of the rotor are
      parallel to the pole faces, a maximum flow of flux will be
      obtained across the entire thickness of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      A more detailed understanding of the operation of this invention
      can be gained from FIGS. 8A-8F. FIGS. 8A-8F are each a schematic
      representation of a cross-section of a face 23a of a pole piece
      face and the opposing rotor edge portion 35 of the rotor 34, taken
      at different points during one cycle of rotation of the rotor.
      FIG. 8A depicts a point in the rotor cycle at which the flux zone
      39 is located midway between the conductors of power winding
      segments 26a and 26b. As noted above, the rotor geometry results
      in the flux zones being moved reciprocally back and forth across
      the faces of the pole pieces. As shown in FIG. 8A, the rotor edge
      (and thus, the flux zone 39) is being accelerated in the direction
      of arrow M, toward power winding segment 26a.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8B depicts the situation after 90 DEG of rotor rotation in
      the direction of the arrow. Here, the flux zone has moved to
      overlap power winding segment 26a with rate of change of flux
      becoming zero. Accordingly, the voltage becomes practically zero.
      This is the location at which the point of reversal in direction
      of the flux zone takes place. FIG. 8C shows the situation after
      another 45 DEG of rotation. The pole face flux zone has returned
      part way toward the midpoint of the power winding in a direction
      extending toward power winding segment 26b.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8D depicts the condition at 90 DEG of rotation with the pole
      face flux zone 39 at the midpoint between winding segments 26a and
      26b.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 8E there is shown the condition after another 45 DEG of
      rotation.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 8F, the pole flux zone is at an extreme point of movement
      relative to the pole piece face and including power winding
      segment 26(b). No directional arrow is shown since the zone is
      momentarily at rest with respect to the pole piece face. In this
      way, a full cycle is completed.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 9A-9I graphically shows the operation of the alternator of
      the invention in terms of the relevant mechanical and electrical
      parameters. Each graphic function shown in FIGS. 9A-9I relate by
      degree markings to points in a single cycle of rotation of the
      rotor. The velocity of the pole face flux zones with respect to a
      point on the pole face is plotted at FIG. 9A. As a result of
      geometry of the rotor, the velocity is sinusoidal in form.<br>
      <br>
      Flux (.phi.) is plotted in FIG. 9B. As shown, the relative flux
      concentration alternates from zero to a maximum value twice each
      cycle without undergoing a reversal of its magnetic polarity. The
      flux does not vary sinusoidally, but exhibits a complex harmonic
      variation which can be expressed mathematically as a Fourier
      series as follows:<br>
      .phi.=.phi.m(1+2/3 cos 2 wt-2/15 cos 4 wt+2/3 cos 6 wt+. . . )
      where .phi.m is the maximum flux.<br>
      <br>
      The expression above reveals an important advantage of the present
      invention. As shown by the appearance of the number "1" in the
      flux equation, the flux carries a component analagous to a "direct
      current component" of a complex electrical waveform, caused by the
      fact that the flux never reverses polarity. Under these
      conditions, the iron domains within the pole pieces will not
      exhibit major hysteresis loops usually associated with oscillating
      flux. Thus, the present invention drastically reduces hysteresis
      losses which are particular to all flux-reversing systems. In
      addition, cooling requirements of the alternator are likewise
      reduced since smaller quantites of heat are generated by the
      reduced hysteresis losses in the pole pieces.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage induced in the power windings is proportional to the
      rate of change of flux and may be calculated by the equation
      V=-d.phi./dt. Since the flux does not vary sinusoidally, the
      voltage will have a non-sinusoidal waveform. Differentiation of
      the Fourier series shown above results in an expression for the
      instantaneous voltage:<br>
      <br>
      V=.phi.m (4/3 sin 2 wt-8/15 sin 4 wt+12/35 sin 6 wt+. . . ).<br>
      <br>
      This function is plotted in FIG. 9C. Note that the induced voltage
      oscillates through a complete cycle for every 180 DEG of rotation
      of the rotor. Thus, the induced voltage has twice the frequency of
      the harmonic velocity of the flux and the angular velocity of the
      shaft. This fact has an important consequence, as the prior art
      teaches that a two-pole alternator can generate only one cycle of
      current for each revolution of the rotor. Thus, the prior art
      requires that a two-pole alternator must operate at 3600 r.p.m. in
      order to generate 60 cycle alternating current. By means of the
      alternator of the invention, a two-pole machine can produce 60
      cycle alternating current at 1800 r.p.m.<br>
      <br>
      The alternator of the invention also results in a reduction of
      iron-related losses which are proportional to rotor speed as well
      as loses stemming from mechanical friction and windage.
      Additionally, a reduction in shaft speed can offer increased
      reliability and longer life due to the reduction of wear in
      mechanical parts.<br>
      <br>
      In an inductive circuit, such as that of the power windings of an
      alternator, it is well-known that a certain component of the
      current flows in a reactive relationship to the induced voltage.
      This "produces" a "reactive power component" referred to as
      "volt-amperes reactive", or "VAR" power. The average value of
      reactive power is zero, and it can make no contribution to the
      consumed power such as a resistive load. However, due to the fact
      that the flux changes its direction mechanically, the energy
      stored stored in the VAR component can be transformed into useful
      mechanical work, and assist the prime mover in rotating the rotor
      shaft. The prime mover must perform work to turn the rotor shaft
      and generate electricity. This phenomenon is the specific
      consequence of the more general Lenz' Law to an alternator.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum power transfer theorem states that: "maximum power
      transfer between source and load occurs when the load impedance is
      the conjugate of the source impedance, and under these conditions,
      the source can transfer only 50 percent of the converted power to
      the load. In an alternator, the true EMF resides as a spatial
      vector referred to as a "motional" electric field. The total power
      dissipated in the source windings can be measured directly only in
      terms of the mechanical torque supplied to the generator's drive
      shaft as would be expected according to the dictates of the Lenz
      Law. The alternator's electrical phase angle, which is a "space"
      angle, is a measurement of the angular position of the conductors
      in space relative to the position of the generator's magnetic
      field poles when compared to the induced voltage. The oscillating
      VAR component is transformed into a mechanical tortional vibration
      residing in the generator's armature mass and drive shaft. This
      fact indicates that the alternator attempts to return the reactive
      power to its own source, the prime mover, on alternate quarter
      cycles. In an attempt to maximize the delivery of power to the
      load in accordance with the maximum power transfer theorem, the
      load impedance can be made conjugate to the power impedance by the
      addition of capacitance.<br>
      <br>
      The maximum power transfer theorem describes the condition
      necessary to ensure optimal transmission of power from source to
      load. This theorem can be applied to power transmission theory,
      however, its main utilization is in the field of radio and
      telephone communications. The alternator of the invention utilizes
      a reverse power transfer concept, which was developed solely for
      alternating power applications, particularly those of a single
      phase nature, which involve specially designed elliptical rotor
      geometries.<br>
      <br>
      The basis of this concept can best be grasped by referring to FIG.
      10C. This drawing shows an oval rotor 34 pictured within its
      cylindrical surface of revolution. At the instant depicted , the
      rotor 34 is so positioned that the flux is centered on each pole
      face, and is passing through the axis of symmetry of the
      lamination stack. As rotation proceeds, from left to right, the
      flux in the left pole face is moved in a downward direction, and
      begins to induce a voltage in 23a, the flux in the right pole face
      is moved in an upward direction and begins to induce a voltage in
      23b. Assume for simplicity and by way of example, that the coils
      are connected in additive series, and that their output is short
      circuited. This will ensure that the windings are the only active
      components in the circuit, and that the power produced in them
      will be substantially reactive.<br>
      <br>
      As current starts to build within the coils, an opposing force due
      to the Lenz reaction will attempt to thrust the flux in a
      direction opposite to that of its motion. This thrust will be
      parallel to the axis of rotation of shaft 32, and in an opposite
      sense for each pole. The action of these forces upon the
      lamination stack will be analogous to that of followers in the
      groove of a cylindrical cam. Hence, these lateral thrusts will be
      converted into torques which oppose the effort of the prime mover
      for one quarter cycle.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 10A, a resisting force is shown by an arrow and identified
      by the letter R as being applied to point P1 on the rotor. Another
      arrow marked -L represents the torque created by this resisting
      force R. The arrow marked +L represents the effort exerted by the
      prime mover. The system is in dynamic equilibrium as shown in FIG.
      10A where torque -L is equal and opposite to torque +L.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 10B, the arrow marked -L again represents the torque
      created by the resisting force R now applied to point P2. The
      arrow marked +L again represents the effort exerted by the prime
      mover. Since torque +L and torque -L are in the same direction,
      the system now accelerates.<br>
      <br>
      If the resisting force R is moved from P1 to P2, the sense of -L
      is reversed. Note that the disk has not been rotated, but the
      point of contact has been moved through an angle .phi.. If the
      disk had been rotated and the resisting force remained fixed in
      space, the relative results would be the same, i.e., an assisting
      torque would suddenly appear after turning through the angle
      .theta..<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 10D, the drive shaft 32 has rotated 90 mechanical degrees,
      and the lamination stack has traversed a space angle of 90 degrees
      relative to the pole faces. At the instant depicted, the harmonic
      velocity of the surface of the lamination stack relative to the
      pole faces is exactly zero, but about to reverse. At this point in
      time, the reactive current in each winding is just reaching its
      maximum value because it is 90 degrees out of phase with the
      induced voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, as each edge of the lamination stack begins to accelerate
      in the opposite direction, relative to the pole faces, magnetic
      forces produced by the current in each winding now attract the
      flux, and develop thrusts which operate in the same direction as
      that of the motion. Due to the cam-like design of the lamination
      stack, these actions give rise to torques which now assist the
      effort of the prime mover for the next quarter cycle.<br>
      <br>
      This exchange of energy between the magnetic field of the inductor
      and the mass of the rotor 34 constitutes a form of resonance,
      which hereinafter is referred to as energy resonance, and which is
      the underlying principle in the concept of reverse power transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 9A-9I, the relationships between the
      various mechanical power constituents and the magnetic flux can be
      studied. It should be noted that the velocity (v) shown in FIG. 9A
      is a sine function, and is in phase with the flux shown in FIG. 9B
      (.phi.) for 1/2 a cycle and then 180 degrees out of phase with the
      flux for the next 1/2 cycle. Since the force (F) is a cosine
      function, the product of the velocity and the force produce a
      sinusodial wave of mechanical power (Pm) shown in FIG. 9F which
      oscillates at twice the frequency of the velocity. It must be
      understood that this wave function is representative of the
      mechanical power relative to the magnetic pole faces only. The
      power on the shaft as seen by the prime mover is a far more
      complex function.<br>
      <br>
      The constituents of the electrical power can now be examined.
      Notice that the voltage (V) shown in FIG. 9C is twice the
      frequency of the velocity. Because of the inductive nature of the
      power circuit of the alternator being operated into a short
      circuit in the example referred to above when coils are connected
      in additive series, the current (I) lags the voltage by 90
      degrees. The product of the voltage and the current yields a
      negative sine function with twice the frequency of the mechanical
      power. It must be understood that the (RR) curve of FIG. 9I is
      representative of the reverse power transfer function, and as
      such, it can be interpreted as electrical power or mechanical
      power depending upon which side of the conversion boundry the
      observer chooses to focus his attention.<br>
      <br>
      It is here assumed that the curve of (PR) FIG. 9I represents the
      reverse power function on the mechanical side of the conversion
      boundry. This places both power waves in the mechanical domain and
      it immediately becomes clear that a "beat" will be established
      between the two frequencies. (FIGS. 9F and 9I).<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 9A-9I, it will be seen that for the first
      quarter cycle, the mechanical power (Pm) is 180 degrees out of
      phase with the reverse power (RR). This is indicative of power
      flowing from the prime mover through the conversion barrier and
      into the magnetic fields of the power coils. The average values of
      these two wave fragments cancel, and result in nearly zero power
      in the first quadrant of the resultant power curve seen in FIG. 9G
      when the system is in equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      Just after 90 degrees, the reverse power function in FIG. 9I
      starts to go positive, and is now in phase with the second 90
      degree portion of the mechanical power curve. This is indicative
      of power being returned to the prime mover from the magnetic
      fields of the power coils; however, this action coincides with the
      positive acceleration cycle of the lamination stack. Hence, the
      average values of these wave fragments reinforce, resulting in the
      high amplitude of the second quadrant of the resultant power curve
      seen in FIG. 9G. This curve is a second harmonic periodic
      function, and as such can cycle repeatedly.<br>
      <br>
      If it were not for various losses which absorb most of the
      reflected power, this type of hetrodyne wave amplification could
      cause the system to accelerate to destruction if operated in the
      short circuit mode, as suggested in this example, i.e., pure
      mechanical resonance; however, with losses being numerous and
      rather high in electro-mechanical equipment, the net result is not
      acceleration, but rather a dimunition of the drive torque demanded
      by the alternator from the prime mover. This is a typical example
      of applied energy resonance. In actual practice, alternators are
      not short circuited, but are used to deliver power to useful
      loads.<br>
      <br>
      Applying a resistive load to the output of the alternator of the
      invention causes a phase shift to occur between the mechanical
      power wave, and the reverse power wave, such that only a portion
      of the stored inductive energy is fed back from the alternator's
      power coils to the rotor's momentum; however, if the losses in the
      alternator have been accurately anticipated, they can be greatly
      compensated for by choosing the proper ratio of reactance to the
      intended kilowatt load. This implies that the efficiency of the
      alternator of the invention is directly proportional to the Q
      ratio in this energy resonant system.<br>
      <br>
      Should the inductance of the power coils be frequency resonated as
      suggested by the maximum energy transfer theorem by the
      introduction of the proper capacitance to the external circuit,
      the current will immediately fall into phase with the induced
      voltage, with the overall result that the reverse power transfer
      wave will degenerate into a sine squared function in phase with
      the mechanical power. This will destroy the bi-directional power
      coupling of the system by critically dampening the energy
      resonance. The result would then be that the alternator of the
      invention would behave similarly to a conventional alternator.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, immediately upon a reversal after the condition shown
      in FIG. 8B, the flux zone has begun movement to the right toward
      the condition shown in FIG. 8C. The flux is increasing and
      therefore the induced voltage has changed direction. The inductive
      current component, however, continues to flow in the same
      direction that it did in FIGS. 8A and 8B. Thus, the force
      associated with the inductive current continues to be exerted and
      this thrust is now in cooperation, not opposition, to the movement
      of the rotor. Therefore, this force no longer produces a torque in
      opposition to that exerted by the prime mover, but one that
      assists the prime mover in turning the rotor. Since this
      phenomenon occurs for a portion of each cycle, immediately
      following a reversal in direction of the flux zone'e harmonic
      motion, a prime mover when driving the alternator of the invention
      will have to exert considerably less effort to turn the rotor
      shaft than does a prime mover driving a conventional alternator.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the alternator of the invention exhibits a
      dramatically increased efficiency of operation, there being a
      larger ratio of power-out to power-in. The net effect of this
      phenomenon can be estimated theoretically by taking the ratio of
      the electrical power available to the mechanical power normally
      needed to turn the rotor shaft.<br>
      <br>
      A demonstration of the existence and efficacy of the phenomenon
      described herein emerges from an examination of Tables 1 and 2.
      Table 1 shows test data for a standard, commercially available
      alternator while Table 2 shows test data for an alternator
      produced according to the teachings of the present invention. Each
      alternator produces power at 60 hertz. Each device was tested
      using the IEEE Standard Test Procedure for Synchronous Machines, S
      #115-1983. Those familiar with the art will recognize the
      definitions and procedures.<br>
      <br>
      [ TABLE 1 ]<br>
      [ TABLE 2 ]<br>
      <br>
      The tests were conducted by driving each alternator at its
      operating speed (3600 r.p.m. and 1800 r.p.m., respectively),
      applying a given d.c. voltage to the field winding, and employing
      several standard loading techniques. Total input power was
      measured, and losses were segregated into friction and windage
      losses, iron losses, and stray copper losses, according to the
      cited Standard. Finally, the resistive load wattage was measured.
      With this data, "Actual Input Power" can be calculated after
      subtracting the purely mechanical losses of friction and windage.
      It follows directly that this "Actual Input Power" must appear
      either as a loss (iron losses or stray copper losses) or as power
      delivered to the resistive load. The accuracy of the procedure can
      be determined by comparing the total of all losses and delivered
      power with the "Actual Input Power."<br>
      <br>
      In Table 1 and Table 2, the values of the columns are defined
      below with all power values in watts:<br>
      A--voltage applied to field windings<br>
      B--total input power of prime mover<br>
      C--friction and windage loss at 3600 RPM<br>
      D--actual input power to alternator (B-C)<br>
      E--iron losses<br>
      F--stray copper losses<br>
      G--resistive load wattage<br>
      H--total converted power (E+F+G)<br>
      I--percent account of input energy (H/D.times.100)<br>
      J--apparent excess power-(D-H)<br>
      K--VAR power<br>
      L--total input register-(H-K)<br>
      <br>
      An inspection of Table 1, the data obtained from testing a
      conventional prior art alternator, reveals that this test
      procedure thoroughly explains the workings of a standard device.
      Although power determinations are difficult at low levels of field
      voltage, when one arrives at normal working levels of field
      voltage, one can consistently account for the allocation or
      consumption of more than 95% of input power in terms of the stated
      categories. This is shown by column I, "Percent Account of Input
      Energy" .<br>
      <br>
      Table 2 which is based upon operating data relating to the
      invention, validates the theoretical presentation above by
      demonstrating that an alternator according to the invention
      performs in a radically different manner from a conventional prior
      art alternator. Specifically, the explanation for the data
      contained in Table 2 is that the reactive power stored in the
      power windings is contributing to the power required to turn the
      rotor. The data for Table 2 were gathered in the same manner as
      that for Table 1, using the cited Standard. The first point that
      can be made is that 60-cycle power was produced from this
      alternator at 1800 r.p.m., rather than the 3600 r.p.m. that
      conventional teaching would mandate.<br>
      <br>
      As with the standard alternator, actual input power (column D) was
      measured, and iron losses (column E), stray copper losses (column
      F), and resistive load wattage (column G) for the alternator of
      the invention were measured as shown in Table 2. It was found that
      when one added the loss categories to the resistive load wattage
      (column G) to obtain a "Total Converted Power" (column H), that
      total exceeded the "Actual Input Power" (column D). Thus for every
      level of field voltage tested, the amount obtained for "Total
      Converted Power" (column H) exceeds the "Actual Input Power"
      (column D), as reflected in column J labeled "Apparent Excess
      Power." Of course, this "excess" power must be derived from some
      source, and the answer is that some of the reactive power stored
      in the alternator's power winding is being applied to the rotor,
      as explained above, thereby reducing the work performed by the
      prime mover. The amount of power so derived is reflected in column
      K labeled "VAR Power".<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of determining accuracy of the test measurements, the
      "Actual Input Power" (column D) is added to the absolute value of
      the "VAR Power" (column K) and the "Apparent Excess Power" (column
      J) to obtain a "Total Input Register" (column L), which is then
      compared with the "Total Converted Power" value (column H) to
      determine the amount of energy actually accounted for. It can be
      seen that the percent account of input energy (column I) is well
      over 90%, which is testimony of the accuracy of the measurements
      shown in Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      The alternator of the invention can be operated as a synchronous
      alternating current motor. When the power windings, i.e. stator
      windings are connected to an alternating current source, there is
      a reaction between the armature currents and the air-gap field
      which results in a torque when the alternating current source is
      single phase. The torque tends to drive the rotor one way and then
      the other. Accordingly the rotor will not run; however if the
      rotor is driven externally into synchronism with any source of
      mechanical power, a torque will then be produced that is constant
      in value and is continually in one direction. This torque will
      keep the motor running at synchronous speed, even under load.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of a single phase source of alternating current
      connected to a single phase motor embodiment of the invention,
      when the stator windings are energized and the rotor is
      stationary, a constantly reversing torque is produced. Thus, the
      rotor will not start; however, if the rotor is externally driven
      to synchronous speed, current flowing in the rotor will then react
      with the field flux to produce an average torque which is always
      in one direction. Since the current in the rotor changes as the
      rotor turns, the instantaneous torque is not constant as in a
      polyphase motor but pulsates.<br>
