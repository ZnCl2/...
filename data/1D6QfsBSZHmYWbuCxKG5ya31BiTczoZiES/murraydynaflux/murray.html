      This technology and information can and will quite literally
      change the world overnight. Jim Murray needs your help to get his
      energy paradigm shifting information out to the public.<br>

      <br>
      The modern world operates almost exclusively on the power of
      electricity in one way or another, and electricity is commercially
      produced by electro-magnetic machinery called generators. In
      essence, a generator is nothing more than a series of coils
      arranged to rotate through a magnetic field. The cutting action
      provided by the magnetic flux as it passes through the conductors
      which comprise the windings, induces a voltage within the coils.
      This potential provides the impetus for a current to flow when a
      closed path is provided. However, here in lies an interesting
      problem. <br>
      <br>
      The student of physics will be well acquainted with a law known as
      "Lenz Law," which dictates that "a current carrying conductor
      undergoing motion within a magnetic field will experience a force
      which tends to oppose the motion which produced the current
      itself." Accordingly, every generator on earth attempts to run as
      a motor in a direction which provides resistance to the prime
      mover. <br>
      <br>
      This interesting phenomenon has become the very basis which now
      relates electrodynamics to the subject of thermodynamics, and
      which firmly cements the belief that power must always be
      conserved during an energy conversion process. However, a great
      deal of information exists which contradicts this cherished
      belief.<br>
      <br>
      In October of 1988, I was granted patent # 4,780,632 for an
      Alternator Having Improved Efficiency. The device was called a
      DynaFlux machine, because of the unique manner in which the
      magnetic flux was forced to undergo motion due to the machine's
      unusual armature design. Effectively, magnetic flux is forced to
      move along a path parallel to the axis of rotation, rather than
      perpendicular to it. As a result of this innovation, the Lenz
      reaction develops an opposing force that tends to apply an axial
      thrust to the rotor, rather than an opposing torque.<br>
      <br>
      The net result is that the Dynaflux Alternator has the ability to
      provide conversion efficiencies unheard of in Electrical
      Engineering. However, despite its incredible potential, this
      discovery has met with nothing but closed mindedness, rejection
      and resistance; proof positive that mankind enjoys wallowing in
      the misery it creates for itself. It is not difficult to
      understand why Tesla kept so much knowledge to himself. Perhaps
      our planet is not yet ready to receive a cheap, inexhaustible
      supply of electrical power. It would be interesting to hear other
      points of view.<br>

      An alternator having a rotor which extends obliquely with respect
      to its axis of rotation between at least a pair of pole pieces
      having power windings disposed therein with the turns of the
      windings facing the pivotal axis of the rotor. Upon driving the
      rotor in rotation, the rotor due to its oblique configuration
      causes the flux extending with respect to the pole pieces to
      reciprocate with respect to the pivotal axis and the power
      windings, thereby producing two cycles of alternating current for
      each rotation of the rotor. The form of the rotor can
      substantially correspond to a portion of a cylinder having
      oppositely disposed face portions extending obliquely with respect
      to the central axis of the of the cylinder which is substantially
      coincident with the pivotal axis of the rotor. The periphery of
      the rotor thereby generates a cylindrical figure of revolution as
      the rotor is rotated.<br>

      A Back Torque reducing electrodynamic generator machine is
      disclosed. Some embodiments include a multi-pole stator comprising
      field windings and power windings and a rotor having a flux path
      element. For some embodiments, the flux path element is attached
      to a rotor shaft at an oblique angle to the longitudinal axis of
      the shaft. The flux path element has a shape that provides a
      uniform constant air gap between it and the stator poles when the
      shaft is rotated.<br>

      A Back EMF reducing DC motor system and method of operation are
      disclosed. The disclosed system and method are designed to exploit
      Transformer Voltage properties and include a rotor element shaped
      to periodically move a flux zone along a stator face. Incoming DC
      motor power from an external source may be appropriately
      conditioned and applied to a power supply, Storage Capacitors may
      also communicate with the power supply. A controller receives
      power from the power supply and communicates with the DC motor. A
      position sensor or other indicator may also communicate DC motor
      operational conditions to the controller. A recapture storage
      device may receive recaptured power from the DC motor via the
      controller. The recaptured power may he used to power an external
      load, or to reduce the input power necessary to operate the DC
      motor. <br>
