      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The disclosed inventions relate to the field of controllers
      for direct current ("DC") electric motors, and more particularly
      to controllers for DC motors having a toroidal stator winding and
      external electronic commutation to drive a rotor by interaction
      with a rotating magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] As described in this inventor's prior patents, conventional
      geometry motors are affected by Speed Voltage Back EMF that is
      parasitic in nature and, among other things, degrades the source
      potential supplied to the motor. This inventor has implemented
      novel geometries to reduce Speed Voltage Back EMF, such as those
      disclosed in co-pending application serial number 13/562,233,
      titled "Multi-Pole Switched Reluctance D.C. Motor with a Constant
      Air Gap and Recovery of Inductive Field Energy," which is hereby
      incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In most conventional DC motors, the energizing current to
      the motor is delivered via some type of commutation in
      communication with the motor coils. Typically, commutation may be
      accomplished by a mechanical commutator (e.g., commutator bars and
      carbon brushes), or by electronic commutation (e.g., an
      electronically controlled switching circuit). In most existing
      devices the commutator operates in conjunction with the rotor,
      either by being physically coupled to the rotor by a common shaft
      (e.g., mechanical commutation), or electronically by relying on
      information relating to the position of the rotor (e.g.,
      electronic commutation).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Many drawbacks and limitations are present in existing DC
      motors. In addition to the above-mentioned degradation of source
      potential, existing designs are inconvenient for applications
      desiring a constant torque output with an unvarying input current.
      Likewise, existing designs do not lend themselves easily to
      creating an output horsepower that increases with the rotational
      speed of the rotor. Other drawbacks of traditional designs also
      exist. [0005] In addition, traditional controllers do not
      typically provide the ability to control the energizing and
      de-energizing of field coils in a manner that enables the creation
      of a rotating magnetic field. Further, traditional controllers do
      not typically provide for the recapture of energy due to the
      collapse of the magnetic field upon de-energizing and isolation of
      a field coil. Other drawbacks of traditional controller designs
      also exist.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] One advantage of the presently disclosed system and method
      is that it addresses the drawbacks of traditional systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Accordingly, another advantage of some embodiments of the
      disclosed invention is that they provide a controller for a
      toroidal DC motor that reduces Back EMF and, therefore, minimizes
      the degradation of source potential. In addition, embodiments of
      the disclosed invention provide a controller for a motor that
      provides constant torque at constant current irrespective of the
      speed of the rotor. Likewise, some embodiments of the disclosed
      inventions provide controllers for motors that output horsepower
      that increases with the rotational speed of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In addition, embodiments of the disclosed controller also
      provide for automatic and customizable control of the associated
      motor's internal functions and operational characteristics, such
      as current limits, current switching, motor RPM, motor torque, and
      direction of power flow. Other advantages and features of the
      disclosed invention also exist and may be apparent to those of
      skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Exemplary non-limiting embodiments are disclosed herein,
      however, it should be appreciated that other appropriate
      embodiments are encompassed by the present disclosure, the
      possible variations being too numerous to illustrate. It is
      understood that one skilled in the art would recognize that other
      potential arrangements are capable of supporting the principles
      disclosed herein. Other aspects and advantages of the presently
      disclosed systems and methods will now be discussed with reference
      to the drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

      <b> <br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] In the following detailed description, reference is made to
      the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which
      are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the
      invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in
      sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice
      the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments
      may be utilized and that various changes may be made without
      departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The
      following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a
      limiting sense.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The operation of a DC Motor of standard design requires
      that sets of magnetic field producing coils be
      electro-mechanically, or electronically switched, so as to secure
      an output torque and continuous rotary motion. This is typically
      achieved by timing the switching of the coils, such that the coil
      windings spend a maximum amount of time beneath the magnetic poles
      of the motor such that the electromagnetic force (F) described by
      the Lenz force relationship,<br>
      <br>
      [0018] F = Bel, [0019] (where B is the magnetic field, I is the
      length of the conductor, and I is the current) can be fully
      exploited. However in the invention herein disclosed, two opposing
      magnetic fields are created within the toroidal windings of the
      stator, and come together at two points (i.e., 180 mechanical
      degrees apart) where they exit the confines of the stator iron,
      traverse the air gap, and enter the rotor structure which is
      positioned across a diameter of the toroid. Accordingly, the
      reluctance forces associated with this rotor structure will cause
      the rotor to align itself with the flux lines, producing a torque,
      and providing a closed path for the flux, to travel through the
      rotor, cross the air gap on the other side, and return to the
      stator, thus, allowing each flux line to return to its associated
      coil group. This is discussed in more detail with reference to
      FIG. 3 below. Thus, a very large value of restoring torque may
      exist within the motor, rotor, and drive shaft whether rotation
      ensues or not. Rotation is a secondary feature of this
      arrangement, and is determined by the switching frequency of the
      windings. Therefore, when rotation is desired, a switching
      sequence is initiated which turns off and isolates one coil in one
      coil group, while simultaneously turning on one coil in the other
      complementary coil group. This action will advance the position of
      the rotor by 360/n degrees, where n is the total number of coils
      arranged around the periphery of the toroidal stator. The
      switching sequence is repeated for the next adjacent set of coils
      in each group and rotation may be sustained at a speed related to
      the rate of switching.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The areas where the rotating flux field dynamically
      interacts with the windings are at the two positions where the
      flux exits out of the stator and enters the rotor, and exists out
      of the rotor and enters the stator. Therefore, depending upon the
      arc length required by the physical dimensions of the rotor, a
      certain number of windings are electronically eliminated from the
      overall circuit within these two regions, thereby providing a
      "Dead Zone," or an isolated segment at each end of the rotor's
      immediate position, thereby insuring that speed-related Back EMF
      will be kept to an absolute minimum.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Therefore, a motor operating in accordance with this
      scheme, will sustain a rotating field of flux 80, and a rotating
      Dead Zone 70, which possess the same angular velocity, but not
      necessarily the same phase relationship. Depending upon the load
      applied to the motor, the Dead Zone 70 may be advanced or retarded
      with respect to the rotor's position, in order to minimize any
      flux coupling between the rotating field and the DC windings.
      Additional features and aspects of a toroidal motor system are
      disclosed in greater detail in concurrently filed, related
      application serial no. xx/xxx,xxx, titled "Toroidal Motor Design
      Having Back EMF Reduction."<br>
      <br>
      [0022] FIG. 1 is an overview of a DC toroid motor system in
      accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed inventions. As
      shown, some embodiments may comprise a DC toroid motor 10 further
      comprising an appropriate power supply 20. Of course, the
      particular power supply 20 may vary in accordance with factors
      such as the intended use of the motor 10, the environment motor 10
      is intended to operate in, the desired electric inputs, the
      desired torque outputs, the desired RPM, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Some non-electronically controlled embodiments of motor 10
      may comprise a commutator 30 assembly. As shown, some embodiments
      may comprise a commutator 30 that is located apart from the
      rotor/stator assembly 40. Further, in embodiments where commutator
      30 comprises an electro-mechanical device, a powered driver 32 may
      also be included. Powered driver 32 may comprise any suitable
      motor, or other prime mover, capable of imparting the desired
      rotational motion to commutator 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Some embodiments also may comprise a number of conductors
      42 in electrical communication with stator coils and commutator 30
      contacts. For clarity, the figures only illustrate a single
      conductor 42, but, of course, as many conductors 42 as desired may
      be implemented. In addition, any suitable connection mechanisms
      may also be implemented, such as ribbon cables, multi-conductor
      cables, modular connectors, connection busses, or the like.
      Likewise, any suitable conductors 42 are possible and may vary
      with the intended use, power, speed, number of coils, or
      environment considerations. Likewise, any suitable connection
      scheme for conductors 42 (e.g., a connection bus) may be
      implemented. Controller 90 and energy recapture 100 are discussed
      below and may also be provided in some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 2 shows a close-up view of some embodiments of the
      rotor/stator assembly 40. As shown, conductors 42 carry input
      power from the contacts 38 to the toroidal stator 44 and may be
      connected to the stator coils in any suitable configuration as
      discussed in more detail below (again, for clarity, only one
      conductor 42 is shown). As shown, toroidal stator 44 is generally
      annular in shape and arranged to allow rotor 46 to rotate within
      the center space of the toroid. [0026] As shown in FIG. 2 some
      embodiments of rotor 46 may comprise an un-excited (e.g.,
      coil-less) rotor 46. For some embodiments rotor 46 may be
      generally rectangular with ends shaped to conform to a curvature
      that generally matches the curvature of the inner circle of the
      toroid stator 44 to ensure a constant air gap, and allow free
      rotation. Other embodiments may include coils (not shown) on rotor
      46 in order to, among other things, provide a mechanism for
      increasing motor 10 torque output.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Other shapes and configurations for rotor 46 are also
      possible. For example, rotor 46 may comprise a disc of varying
      magnetic permeability. A portion of such a disc may include a
      relatively high permeability material that provides a preferential
      flux path through the rotor 46. Other shapes and configurations
      for rotor 46 are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In some embodiments, it may be preferable to couple motor
      10 with other machines, instruments, or devices, therefore, output
      coupler 48 may be provided on a shaft coupled to rotor 46. Output
      coupler 48 may comprise one or more pulleys, gears, shafts, or
      other couplers.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A variety of connection schemes for stator coils 50 are
      possible. For example, a series connection for stator coils 50 may
      be implemented, meaning that each coil is connected to the next in
      a series fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In addition, the motor 10 may be configured for parallel
      connection of stator coils 50 in accordance with some embodiments.
      Parallel connection in the present disclosure means that each
      stator coil 50 is independently connected to a DC power supply
      (e.g., supply 20) so that it may be independently energized to
      create a resultant magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Control of the switching of the various power cycles for
      the coils 50 may be achieved in any suitable manner. For example,
      controller 90 may contain an electronic control circuit that gives
      separate, customizable control over the energizing of each coil 50
      as described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Further, in accordance with the disclosure herein, the
      magnetic field flux lines 80 (and Dead Zones 70) may be controlled
      using controller 90 so that at any given time a portion of the
      stator coils are energized with one polarity (e.g., positive) and
      the other, complementary, portion are energized with the opposite
      polarity (e.g., negative). Likewise, by disconnecting and
      isolating a member, or members, of a specific coil group, a
      rotating Dead Zone 70 may be created in accordance with the
      principles outlined herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The switching performed by controller 90 is performed so
      that no current is allowed to flow through the coil 50 windings
      which lie between each group of "active" coils. This selective
      form of switching, then creates a series of "inactive and isolated
      coils" which constitute two Dead Zones 70 located 180 mechanical
      degrees apart on the stator 44, and which rotate in synchronism
      with the rotor 46. These traveling Dead Zones 70 then represent
      windows for the flux 80 to pass through with minimal, if any,
      inducing of a Back EMF Voltage, or a Back Torque, either of which
      could reduce motor 10 performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As with any magnetic field, the flux lines 80 created by
      the energized coil 50 windings will travel from one pole to the
      other (e.g., North to South). Rotor 46, which for some embodiments
      may comprise steel or some other magnetically responsive material,
      provides a preferred path for the flux lines to travel through,
      and complete the magnetic circuit, but in so doing, will align the
      rotor 46 so that the end faces of the rotor line up with the Dead
      Zones 70 created in the coil 50 windings. This is illustrated in
      FIG. 3 which shows a schematic diagram of a toroid stator and
      rotor assembly 40 and a representation of the rotating magnetic
      flux lines 80 and Dead Zones 70. As shown, rotor 46 may be
      generally rectangular with ends shaped to conform to a curvature
      that generally matches the curvature of the inner circle of the
      toroid stator 44 to ensure a constant air gap 76, and allow free
      rotation. At the instant depicted in FIG. 3, active coils 50 on
      the "left half of the toroid stator 44 generate magnetic flux
      lines 80 that cross air gap 76, enter the rotor 46 through Dead
      Zone 70a, traverse the rotor 46, and exit the rotor 46 and cross
      air gap 76 through Dead Zone 70b to complete the magnetic circuit.
      Likewise, active coils 50 on the "right half of the toroid stator
      44 traverse a corresponding route on the other side of the toroid
      stator 44.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In the above-described manner, the Back EMF due to rotation
      of the rotor 46 in the presence of the stator 44 magnetic field is
      reduced by controlling the characteristics of the rotor 46 and
      coil 50 interactions. Creation of the Dead Zones 70 insures that
      no current is present in the adjacent coil 50, and consequently
      minimal, or no, Back EMF Voltage or magnetic field is generated in
      that coil 50, when rotor 46 is adjacent to the coil 50. [0036]
      Such an arrangement creates a motor 10 that delivers constant
      torque at varying rotor 46 speeds. Furthermore, the torque is
      adjustable by changing the input current, and, thus, the magnitude
      of the resultant stator 44 magnetic field. At a given current
      setting the motor 10 output torque will remain relatively constant
      irrespective of speed. Further, motor 10 output horsepower (HP),
      can be determined from:<br>
      <br>
      [0037] HP = (Torque x speed)/K, where K is constant that depends
      upon the units used.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] It is apparent that for embodiments of motor 10 that the HP
      increases as RPM increases, and output torque will stay constant
      for a given current (and magnetic field strength), thus,
      horsepower can be varied with the speed of the rotor 46 which is
      determined by the switching frequency, or by changing the current
      at a given speed. Other advantages also exist.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] For some embodiments, parallel configuration of the
      toroidal stator coils 50 enables fine tuning and customization of
      the resultant magnetic field, the Dead Zones 70, and the relative
      motion of both. In such a manner, it is possible to customize or
      adapt the motor 10 operative characteristics to suit the intended
      use, environment, or other parameters. Such control parameters may
      employ high speed adjustments made by micro-processors imbedded
      within the electronic control circuitry of controller 90.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Turning now to FIG. 4, additional detail of controller 90
      is disclosed. FIG. 4 is a schematic system overview diagram of a
      controller 90 in accordance with some embodiments. As shown, the
      embodiments of controller 90 may comprise 4 main elements: low
      voltage power supplies 404, high voltage power supplies 406, a
      system controller 402, and coil switches 400.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As disclosed herein, toroid motor 10 comprises multiple
      coils 50 which are sequentially turned on and off, so as to
      produce a rotating magnetic flux field 80. In some embodiments, a
      first group of multiple coils 50 are turned on as group, causing
      all to have the same magnetic polarity (e.g., North). This first
      group of multiple coils 50 may have a second, complimentary, group
      of multiple coils 50 containing an equivalent number of coils 50
      as the first group, yet connected to create the opposite magnetic
      polarity (e.g., South), and located on an opposite side of the
      stator 40. This "equal and opposite" arrangement of the coils may
      be maintained by the controller 90 during operation. Also, as
      shown in FIG. 3, the Dead Zones 70 at the points between where the
      magnetic polarity changes, may be created by controller 90
      switching off and isolating a predetermined number of coils 50. By
      sequentially energizing (and de-energizing and isolating)
      successive coils 50, the magnetic flux field 80, and Dead Zones
      70, can be made to rotate around the stator 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Some embodiments of the controller 90 may create two Dead
      Zones 70 and two sections of energized stator coils 50, one of
      each magnetic polarity. Of course, it is also possible for the
      toroid motor 10 to have more than two Dead Zones 70 and more than
      two complementary sections of energized sequential coils.
      Likewise, it is possible to vary the width of the Dead Zones 70
      (e.g., by de-energizing, disconnecting, and isolating more, or
      fewer, coils 50), or to change the arc length of the Dead Zones
      (e.g., asymmetric, symmetric, etc.). Other configurations are also
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] For some embodiments, the system controller 402 may control
      the low voltage 404 and high voltage 406 power supplies, and the
      coil switches 400 in order to achieve the desired motor torque and
      RPM at optimal efficiency. System controller 402 may comprise any
      suitable system controller such as a microprocessor, or other
      central processing unit (CPU). Of course, more than one processor,
      integrated processors, or other combinations of processing may
      also be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Some embodiments of system controller 402 may also include
      a communications channel to receive a signal indicative of
      feedback from the motor 10 related to a shaft speed, a shaft
      position, or the like. The feedback signal may be generated in any
      suitable fashion. For example, feedback signal may be created via
      a shaft encoder 408 or other shaft position sensor. The feedback
      signal may, among other things, be used to keep the motor 10
      within certain operational specifications.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In some embodiments, low voltage power supplies 404A and
      404B may be used to hold the active motor coils 50 at an electric
      current level which is controlled by the system controller 402.
      For the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, two supplies 404 are used; one
      supply 404 for each coil 50, although the disclosure is not so
      limited and other types of supply 404 may be implemented. Thus,
      for some embodiments, low voltage supply 404 A may energize one
      coil 50 (e.g., to a North polarity) in the first group of active
      coils, and supply 404B may energize the complementary coil 50
      (e.g., to a South polarity) in the second group of active coils
      50.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Similarly, some embodiments may also comprise high voltage
      power supplies 406 A and 406B which may be used to quickly raise
      motor coils 50 up to the electric current level that the low
      voltage supplies 404 are set to hold. For the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 4, two supplies 406 are used; one supply 406 for each coil
      50, although the disclosure is not so limited and other types of
      supply 406 may be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 5 illustrates a schematic diagram for a coil switch
      400 in accordance with some disclosed embodiments. The coil
      switches 400 for a toroid motor 10 may preferably perform the
      following functions: (1) energize a coil 50 with the appropriate
      (e.g., North or South) polarity, for a particular coil 50 in a
      particular direction, and then switch to the opposite polarity
      every 180 degrees of rotation; (2) provide a relatively short
      duration high voltage pulse in order to generate the flux lines 80
      quickly around the subject coil 50 (for higher RPM); and (3)
      capture any recoverable energy when the coil 50 is turned off and
      isolated. In some embodiments, the controller 90 will include as
      many coil switches 400 as there are coils 50 in stator 40. Other
      configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] As also shown in FIG. 5, for some embodiments, the main
      output section of the entire switch 400 may contain six separate
      switching positions, which may consist of more than one transistor
      at each position in order to increase current flow capability. In
      FIG. 5, these switch positions are labeled Ql through Q6.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In some embodiments, three switches may be used to energize
      each motor coil at a given time in order to provide the desired
      North or South polarity. For example, Ql, Q3 and Q5 may be used
      for one polarity, and Q2, Q4 and Q6 are used for the opposite,
      complementary, polarity.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 6 shows the coil switch 400 functional diagram
      displaying only the parts which are used for one of the two
      magnetic polarities in accordance with some embodiments. For these
      embodiments, a sequence of operation to turn a coil 50 completely
      on, hold it on, and then turn it off and isolate it while
      re-capturing inductive energy for a given polarity, is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] First, Ql and Q3 turn on in order to make the holding
      voltage and current available to the coil 50. The low voltage
      power supply 404 may be set so as to provide the given current for
      a desired motor 10 torque, and at a voltage which will sustain
      that current by counteracting the inevitable resistive losses in
      the system. This voltage is lower than the fast rise voltage.
      [0052] After Ql and Q3 are turned on, Q5 turns on for a relatively
      small amount of time in order to provide a short high voltage
      pulse that causes the coil's 50 magnetic flux lines 80 to rise
      quickly. Some embodiments may also comprise Dl which is a blocking
      diode that allows the voltage on the B side of the coil 50 to go
      negative with respect to ground A and Q3 without causing current
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] When it is time to turn off and isolate the coil 50, Ql is
      turned off first. The flyback action caused by flux lines 80
      leaving the coil 50 causes the voltage on the A side of the coil
      50 to go negative, forward biasing D5 in order to capture the
      coil's 50 inductive energy. In this embodiment, CI represents a
      capacitor which may be used to capture this fly-back energy for
      later use. Of course, other capture and storage devices may also
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] After the fly-back energy dissipates out of the coil 50, Q3
      is then turned off, and the coil switch 400 is again ready to
      perform an identical operation but with the North and South poles
      reversed, by using Q2, Q4, Q6, D2, and D6.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] As also shown in FIG. 4, embodiments of the controller 90
      may also communicate with a recaptured energy system 100. The
      concepts of recapturing energy from the collapse of the magnetic
      flux 80 fields in each coil 50, has been previously disclosed in
      copending application serial number 13/562,233, titled "Multi-Pole
      Switched Reluctance D.C. Motor with a Constant Air Gap and
      Recovery of Inductive Field Energy," which is hereby incorporated
      by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In brief, each collapsing flux 80 field in coil 50 produces
      an electrical output pulse which represents the re-captured field
      energy. These pulses may be then directed by the coil switches 400
      of controller 90 to a recaptured energy system 100, and then may
      be stored, for example, in a capacitor bank or other storage that
      comprises part of recapture system 100. In some embodiments,
      energy from this recapture system 100 could be removed if desired,
      and used to supply power to external appliances (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In some embodiments, recapture system 100 may operate in
      "Open System Operation," which means that energy recaptured from
      the motor's inductive components during its operation, will be
      applied to a capacitive storage element, and then utilized to
      supply power to some electrical load external to the motor itself,
      such as a lamp, a resistor, a pump, etc. Of course, any suitable
      external load may be powered in this manner. [0058] Likewise,
      power inverters or other devices can be used to convert the
      recaptured power to alternating current (AC). Unconverted direct
      current (DC) power from recapture system 100 may be used to power
      DC loads. Other configurations of Open System Operation are also
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In addition, some embodiments may be designed for "Closed
      System Operation," which means that energy recaptured from the
      motor's inductive components during its operation, will be applied
      to a capacitive storage element in recapture system 100 and then
      utilized to send power back to the motor power supply by means of
      a DC to DC converter operating in conjunction with an electronic
      feedback controller, or the like. Other configurations of Closed
      System Operation are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The torque and speed characteristics of the motor disclosed
      here -in are quite straight forward. Because there is little or no
      Back EMF, the torque is proportional to the applied current
      regardless of the angular speed. The RPM is dependent upon the
      effectiveness of the switching frequency, which controls the
      movement from one coil 50 set to the next.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the inductive reactance of the individual coil 50
      windings become a limiting factor where speed is concerned, as
      said reactance will impede or limit the rise time of the magnetic
      field for a given voltage selection. However, this impedance
      becomes a matter of engineering design choice because of the
      effects which are brought to bear by the toroidal coil 50
      windings.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The geometry of the toroid 40 tends to create a condition
      which is very natural to the confinement of a magnetic field. This
      property may be exploited by running the flux 80 density up close
      to saturation, which not only produces high torque in the rotor
      46, but which also drives down the inductive reactance of the coil
      50 windings in much the same way as experienced in a saturable
      reactor. One result of applying this concept may be the approach
      of the coil 50 windings to a pure resistive impedance as the flux
      80 density approaches saturation, and an associated diminution of
      the coil 50 rise-time. Therefore, as impedance (Z) approaches
      resistance (R) in value, the time (t) will become very small, and
      allows switching speeds of a very high order indeed. The
      above-described properties and parameters also results in the
      formation of a substantially square wave current.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Such an arrangement also allows for reasonably constant
      torque at any current (I) setting, with I being limited mostly by
      the value of resistance (R), and a variable speed function which
      will support a wide range of angular speeds and high values of
      acceleration. Under such conditions, the shaft horsepower is
      substantially linear at a given value of current, with angular
      velocity being the independent variable. Thus, a graph of shaft
      horsepower versus RPM is expected to be almost linear in nature.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Although inductive reactance is greatly reduced by the use
      of controlled saturation of the back iron, it cannot be eliminated
      completely, especially when lighter torque settings are arranged.
      Accordingly, where there is inductance (L) and current (I), there
      will be stored energy (E) in keeping with the relationship E = 1⁄2
      LI &lt;2&gt;. Therefore, when coil 50 windings collapse their
      magnetic fields at the start of each Dead Zone 70, the stored
      field energy will be converted back into electrical energy in very
      short intervals of time, and provisions, as described herein,
      preferably exist to contend with this recaptured power.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] While the invention has been described in detail and with
      reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to
      one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can
      be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope
      thereof.<br>
