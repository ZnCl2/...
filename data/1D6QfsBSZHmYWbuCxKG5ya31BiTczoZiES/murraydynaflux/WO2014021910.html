      A Back Torque reducing electrodynamic generator machine is
      disclosed. Some embodiments include a multi-pole stator comprising
      field windings and power windings and a rotor having a flux path
      element. For some embodiments, the flux path element is attached
      to a rotor shaft at an oblique angle to the longitudinal axis of
      the shaft. The flux path element has a shape that provides a
      uniform constant air gap between it and the stator poles when the
      shaft is rotated.<br>

      [0003] The disclosed inventions relate to the field of electric
      power generation. More particularly, the disclosed inventions
      relate to an electric power generation device employing a constant
      dimension air gap and an elliptical swash-plate rotor that reduces
      the Back Torque present in the device.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Existing electric energy generation devices have made
      incremental advances relating to improved magnetic materials, more
      powerful permanent magnets, and<br>
      <br>
      sophisticated electronic switching devices. Such improvements, at
      best, relate to small increases in overall efficiency, often
      gained at considerable expense.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Patents in this area include: U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,917,699; 3,
      132,269; 3,321,652; 3,956,649; 3,571,639; 3,398,386; 3,760,205; 4,

      patent no. 2386181 (10/1978) and UK patent no. 1263176 (211972).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The basic concept employed in earlier electrodynamic
      machine art, concerning generators, is the interaction between a
      moving conductor(s) and a magnetic field of some kind. However,
      existing machines typically experience performance limitations due
      to the manner in which Back EMF (in motors), Back Torque (in
      alternators and generators), and inductive field energy (in
      general) are treated. One drawback of Back EMF is its parasitic
      nature that serves to degrade the potential supplied to the motor
      from an outside source (i.e., the source voltage). Likewise, Back
      Torque in electrical generating machines necessitates the
      application of additional prime-mover motive force (i.e.,
      additional torque) in order to overcome degradation of the source
      torque and function on a continual basis.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The parasitic nature of Back EMF and Back Torque arises
      from, among other things, the mistaken assumption that Back EMF is
      required to produce torque in motors, and that Back Torque is
      required to produce generator action (and/or induce a voltage).
      This, in turn, leads to design compromises which must be made in
      order to implement traditional electrodynamic machine geometries.
      Consider, for example, a conventional DC Motor consisting of a
      stator with salient field poles, and a rotor-armature with a
      self-contained commutator. Application of a DC current to the
      rotor leads produces a rotary motion of the rotor (i.e., motor
      action). However, the rotation of the rotor conductors in a
      magnetic field also induces a voltage in the conductor that
      opposes the current applied to the rotor leads (i.e., generator
      action). These facts demonstrate an important aspect of
      conventional machines; if conventional design parameters are
      always followed, then any motor must perform as a generator while
      it is running, and any generator must perform as a motor while it
      is in operation. The explanation of this similarity is because
      both machines are dependent upon the same basic geometry for their
      functionality, and so, both motor and generator action occur
      simultaneously in both devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The above-described basic geometry of a conventional system
      results in the production of parasitic Back EMF in a motor as
      follows. In many traditional electric motor systems, the magnetic
      flux must interact with an electrical current-carrying conductor
      (e.g., rotor windings), thereby producing a mechanical force that
      generates a torque to turn the motor shaft (i.e., a motor action).
      The subsequent motion of the conductors through the magnetic flux
      produces a relatively high Back EMF (i.e., acts in opposition to
      the torque producing current) due to the motion of the conductors
      with respect to the magnetic flux (i.e., a generator action). In
      order to continue normal operation, and establish electrical
      equilibrium, any motor that produces a Back EMF having a constant
      average value, must draw down on the line-potential in order to
      overcome the effects of this parasitic reverse voltage. Thus, this
      process of source potential degradation due to Back EMF requires
      the input of considerable potential energy from the source in the
      form of a higher voltage in order to maintain normal operation.
      [0009] In a conventional generator the production of parasitic
      Back Torque arises from the same principles. Mechanical torque is
      required to rotate the electrical conductors of the rotor (e.g.,
      rotor windings) in the presence of a magnetic field (e.g., as
      produced by the stator field windings). This, in turn, produces an
      electrical current (e.g., in the rotor windings) that also
      interacts with the field and produces a relatively high Back
      Torque (i.e., acts in opposition to the torque driving the rotor).
      In order to continue normal operation and establish electrical
      equilibrium, any generator that produces a Back Torque requires a
      continuous supply of mechanical torque on the rotor from the prime
      mover in order to overcome the effects of the parasitic Back
      Torque and generate electricity. Thus, this process of source
      torque degradation due to Back Torque requires the input of
      considerable power from the prime mover source in order to
      maintain normal operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A different approach from the above and other existing
      devices is disclosed in the related U.S. Patent No. 4,789,632,
      titled "Alternator Having Improved Efficiency," to the same
      inventor of the present application, in U.S. Patent Application
      No. 12/993,941, which in turn is a 35 U.S.C. ยง 371 filing of
      Application No. PCT/US09/46246, which in turn claims the benefit
      under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 to provisional Application No. 61/085,824,
      in U.S. Patent Application No. 13/390,437, which in turn is a 35
      U.S.C. ยง 371 filing of Application No. PCT/US 10/45298, which in
      turn claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 to provisional
      Application No. 61/234,01 1, and in the above-noted related
      applications, each of which is hereby incorporated in its entirety
      by reference. The approach outlined therein generally involves,
      among other things, a canted flux path element as part of the
      rotor assembly and a constant dimension air gap between rotor and
      stator elements that reduces or realigns the Back EMF or Back
      Torque in motor and generator machines respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] As discussed above, conventional electrodynamic machines
      (e.g., motors and generators) are typically interchangeable in
      function (i.e., from motor to generator, or vice versa), by simply
      reversing shaft torque (i.e., using the applied field to produce
      shaft torque, or applying torque to the shaft to produce an output
      voltage). However, in the constant- dimension air gap, Back EMF
      and Back Torque reducing motor designs described in the above
      patents and applications of the present inventor, applying torque
      to a motor shaft will produce only a small output voltage, due to
      the unique rotor geometry which enables a constant air gap during
      operation. Typically, a Back EMF reducing motor of the disclosed
      designs when driven as a generator will produce a voltage
      substantially equivalent in magnitude to the Back EMF that would
      be produced by running the device as a motor.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, a Back Torque reducing generator when driven as a motor
      will produce an output torque substantially equivalent in
      magnitude to the Back Torque that would be produced by running the
      device as a generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Therefore, in order to produce a typical, commercially
      desirable output voltage, some embodiments may incorporate an
      increased number of stator windings (relative to conventional
      machines) into a Back Torque reducing machine. An embodiment of
      this is also disclosed in the related U.S. Pat. No. 4,789,632 for
      a two-pole embodiment. Typically, relative to a comparable
      conventional machine, the presently disclosed stator designs will
      accommodate a greater number of windings per pole because each
      pole contains both field coils and power coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is also, of course, possible to derive and calculate the
      operational characteristics of a multi-pole, Back Torque reducing
      machine in a manner similar to those provided in the
      above-referenced applications and patents. Further prototyping and
      testing may also be implemented to compile additional operational
      and performance data and principles.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] An additional factor of Back Torque and Back EMF reducing
      designs is that the movement of the flux within the machine may
      produce eddy currents in the stator structures in more than one
      direction. Thus, in some embodiments, it is desirable to implement
      stator structures that reduce or compensate for such eddy
      currents. For example, stator shoe and pole pieces may be arranged
      with laminations of differing orientations in order to reduce eddy
      currents. Other configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Drawbacks also exist in conventional generator designs as
      well as in Back Torque reducing designs. For example, in a typical
      generator the current inducing magnetic flux will "reverse"
      directions as the rotor turns. This, in turn, may cause hysteresis
      losses in the stator material.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Some existing generator designs employ a source of DC power
      to excite a magnetic field in the rotor in order to induce a
      current in the stator coils. Such a scheme typically requires slip
      rings, brushes, or commutators in order to supply the DC power to
      the rotor which adds to the complexity and cost of such a device,
      and can contribute additional losses to the system operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] As noted, existing designs also create Back Torque which
      necessitates the input of additional mechanical torque from the
      prime mover equal in magnitude to the generator's reverse torque
      in order to overcome the Back Torque and produce the desired
      power. Other drawbacks also exist. SUMMARY<br>
      <br>
      [0018] An electrodynamic generator machine is disclosed, some
      embodiments comprising a multi-pole stator comprising field
      windings and power windings and a rotor having a flux path
      element. For some embodiments, the flux path element is attached
      to a rotor shaft at an oblique angle to the longitudinal axis of
      the shaft. The flux path element has a shape that provides a
      uniform constant air gap between it and the stator poles when the
      shaft is rotated.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In an embodiment, the flux path elements comprise a silicon
      steel lamination stack or a solid ferrite plate. In a further
      embodiment, the stator poles are positioned in pole pairs with the
      rotor and rotor shaft between them and form isolated stator
      magnetic field circuits when the stator windings are supplied with
      electrical current, such that a magnetic field is established
      having a single magnetic polarity in each of the poles of said
      pole pairs, with each pole of the pole pairs having opposite
      magnetic polarity. In further embodiments more than two poles are
      installed in each stator section and share the magnetic
      permeability of a common rotor structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In a further embodiment, the rotor flux path elements have
      a shape defined by the volume contained between two parallel cuts
      taken through a right circular cylinder at an angle other than 90
      degrees with respect to the axis of symmetry of said cylinder,
      each flux path element having front and back faces that are
      substantially elliptical, and having major and minor axes. In an
      embodiment, the flux element angle with respect to the axis of
      symmetry is substantially 45 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In a further embodiment, the electrodynamic machine has
      rotor<br>
      <br>
      counterweights to statically and dynamically balance the eccentric
      mass of the rotor flux elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] One advantage of the presently disclosed system and method
      is that it addresses the drawbacks of existing systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Another advantage of the presently disclosed system is to
      provide an electrodynamic machine that develops a significantly
      reduced Back Torque.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Another advantage of the presently disclosed system is to
      provide an electrodynamic machine that makes use of a plurality of
      salient poles within its stator structure that may possess
      characteristics different than typically employed by existing
      systems. For example, the stator poles should be arranged or
      constructed to be protected from flux movement in two directions
      in order to minimize eddy currents, and related iron losses. For
      example, fabricating all or part of the pole pieces from different
      metals, using grain orientation, using ferrite materials, using
      distributed air gap material, or laminations disposed at right
      angles with respect to one another, are some techniques that may
      be implemented to inhibit the production of eddy currents, and
      thereby lessen iron losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] One embodiment of the presently disclosed system employs a
      rotor fabricated from a stack of steel disks, chemically insulated
      from one another to discourage and reduce eddy currents. The disks
      may be pressed upon an arbor which, in turn, is obliquely disposed
      with respect to the intended axis of rotation, and suitably
      machined so as to produce an assembly with a peripheral contour
      generally equivalent to that of a cylindrical segment. The stator
      may be composed of a plurality of salient pole sets, each set
      comprising a pair of poles, and associated windings, arranged 180
      degrees apart from one another upon the stator, and each pole set
      angularly displaced from one another by a desired number of
      mechanical degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In some embodiments, each pole set may also be provided
      with a concave pole face, whose radius is slightly greater than
      the radius of the rotor. The rotor, therefore, defines an air gap
      of continuous dimension when rotated despite the elliptical nature
      of the rotor. The rotor is in magnetic series with each set of
      magnetic poles, thereby completing the magnetic circuit, and the
      rotor reacts to each set of energized poles by undergoing a
      mechanical displacement equal in degrees to the pole set's
      mechanical distribution around the periphery of the stator
      assembly. As the rotor rotates, the zone in which the flux is
      coupled to the active pole pieces may vary in position along the
      length of each pole face. However, the width of the air gap
      separating the pole face from said rotor will not vary.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] This arrangement permits the magnetic potential within the
      air gap to remain substantially constant, but redirects the Lenz
      force vector such that its magnitude is diluted by the oblique
      angle of the rotor thereby minimizing the development of a large
      Back Torque.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] For existing conventional generator designs, the frequency
      of the output current is a function of the number of poles, the
      angular speed of the machine, and the number of coils involved.
      However, the conditions which influence the operational frequency
      of the device disclosed herein are notably different. In some
      embodiments of the disclosed machine, the output frequency is a
      direct function of power coil placement, shaft speed, and the
      unexpected fact that the flux has a rate of change with respect to
      position, not just with respect to time.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Thus, for some embodiments, the electrodynamic machine's
      output frequency effectively involves a relativistic effect, which
      introduces harmonics under controlled conditions, and has an
      effect upon both voltage wave shape, and the system periodicity.
      For some embodiments, the net effect is that a two pole Back
      Torque reducing machine as disclosed herein can provide its load
      with a 60 cycle output while turning at an angular speed of 1800
      RPM, as opposed to a conventional device which must turn at 3600
      RPM to achieve the same effect with two poles. Subsequently, a
      four pole electrodynamic machine as disclosed herein may enable a
      shaft speed of only 900 RPM to produce a 60 cycle output.
      Therefore, in some embodiments, one advantage of the disclosed
      designs is to provide an electrodynamic machine capable of
      producing higher- frequency output, per shaft revolution, per pole
      set than is found in existing devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Other aspects and advantages of the presently disclosed
      systems and methods will now be discussed with reference to the

      limiting sense.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As shown in FIGS. 1-4, and 10A and 10B some embodiments of
      the disclosed electrodynamic machine 20 may comprise a stator
      assembly 22 and a rotor assembly 30 disposed within a housing 12.
      For some embodiments, the stator assembly 22 may generally form a
      hollow cylinder which may be formed of a highly permeable
      material, silicone steel laminations, sintered steel alloys,
      special solid steel forms, distributed air gap material, or the
      like, and is provided with pole pieces 23 which extend radially
      inwardly and terminate in concave faces 23a. While two pole pieces
      23 are evident in the cross sectional views of FIGS. 1-3, the
      presently disclosed embodiments incorporate 2N poles in a
      multi-pole configuration, where N is an integer. For example, the
      cross sectional view of FIG. 4 illustrates a four pole (N = 2)
      embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] For some embodiments, each pole piece 23 may carry two sets
      of windings. Field windings 24 may be carried on the stator pole
      23 in a convenient location, for example, at the portion 22a.
      Other configurations are also possible. Any suitable field
      windings 24 capable of producing the desired magnetic field are
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] For some embodiments, power windings 26 may also be carried
      by the stator assembly with one or more windings on each pole
      piece 23. For example, power windings 26 may be located in slots
      extending in to the face 23a of each pole piece 23.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Of course, the slots should be of sufficient depth and
      width to insure that the power windings 26 disposed in them do not
      protrude into the air gap 42. Other<br>
      <br>
      configurations of power windings 26 are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] An embodiment of rotor assembly 30 is shown comprising a
      shaft 32 that carries a rotor 34 within the hollow cylinder
      defined by the stator body. For some embodiments, shaft 32 may be
      positioned on suitable bearings 38 mounted in each of the opposite
      end bells 12a of the casing 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A prime mover (not shown), may be connected to shaft 32 to
      provide a driving torque. In some embodiments, rotor 34 may be
      fabricated from material having high permeability, such as,
      silicone steel laminations, sintered steel alloys, distributed air
      gap material, or the like, to, among other things, reduce or
      minimize eddy currents. The rotor 34 may be secured to shaft 32 by
      an arbor 36a or the like. Of course, other configurations, such as
      a unitary machined rotor and shaft, or other mounting devices, may
      also be implemented. Counterweights 40 may be mounted on the shaft
      32 to provide a balanced rotational mechanical structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In some embodiments, the form of the rotor 34 as shown in
      FIG. 1, is a section of a cylinder having a diameter D and an axis
      A, which is cut by two parallel planes "B" and "C." In one
      embodiment, angle "a," between planes C and shaft 32 may be 45
      degrees. Other angles are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of the rotor assembly 30 at the
      beginning of a cycle of rotation when the rotor is seen as if on
      edge. FIG. 2 shows the rotor assembly 30 viewed 90 degrees from
      the position of FIG. 1. In the position show in FIG. 2, the face
      34a of the rotor 34 can be seen, for this embodiment, to be
      elliptical.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of the rotor assembly 30 after a
      movement of 180 degrees from the position shown in FIG. 1. The
      areas on the rotor edge 35 and a portion of the faces -of the pole
      pieces 23 are referred to herein as coupling zones 37 and pole
      face flux zones 39, respectively. As described herein, for some
      embodiments pole face flux zones 39 oscillate along the length of
      each pole face 23a with periodic motion (e.g., simple harmonic
      motion) as the rotor assembly is revolved. Thus, the position of
      the upper pole flux zone 39 as shown in FIG. 1 is located at the
      right-hand end of the pole face, while the same zone 39 as shown
      in FIG. 2 is located near the center of symmetry of the power
      winding 26, and as shown in FIG. 3, this zone 39 has travelled to
      the left-hand end of the pole face 23a. Thus, as the rotor
      assembly 30 turns through the next 180 degrees, the flux zones 39
      return to the position shown FIG. 1. Thus, for these embodiments,
      these zones 39 execute periodic motion (e.g., simple harmonic
      motion) back-and-forth along the pole faces 23a.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In accordance with some embodiments, the presence of an
      excitation current in the field windings 24 and the application of
      a torque (e.g., by a prime mover) to shaft 32 will operate as
      follows. The current flowing in the field windings 24 produces a
      stationary magnetic field in the stator iron 22 with the lines of
      flux tending to flow in the magnetic circuit by following the path
      of least reluctance, as illustrated with reference to the
      four-pole embodiment shown in FIG. 4. Starting at the left most
      pole piece 23 in FIG. 4 (i.e., the one at the 9 o'clock position),
      flux will flow through the stator 22 to the flux zone 39 of pole
      pieces 23. From there, flux will pass across the air gap 42 to the
      flux zone 37 of the rotor 34, returning across the air gap 42 to
      the pole pieces located 90 mechanical degrees away (i.e., the pole
      pieces at 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock), and then back through the
      stator. Thus, the rotor magnetically couples the pole faces 23, by
      providing a low-reluctance path between the relevant pole pieces.
      A similar, mirror-image path is followed by the flux due to the
      pole piece 23 on the right most side (i.e., 3 o'clock) of FIG. 4.
      Since the peripheral portions of the rotor are parallel to the
      pole faces, the flux density in the air gap will remain constant
      while the flux region oscillates across the relevant pole faces
      with simple harmonic motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] While certain embodiments are disclosed herein, it is also
      possible configure the machine with alternative components. For
      example, in some embodiments of the electrodynamic machine any
      suitable type of bearing 38 may be implemented depending on the
      design circumstances, intended implementation, environment of
      application, or the like. Thus, bearings 38 may be single roller
      bearings, multiple-roller bearings, thrust bearings, conical
      bearings, metallic sleeve bearings, or other suitable type of
      bearing.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Likewise, for embodiments where magnetically conductive
      rotor stack 34 is mounted in a canted position with respect to
      shaft 32, it may be desirable to include rotational stabilizers 40
      to dynamically balance the rotation of the shaft 32. Any suitable
      stabilizers 40 may be implemented. For example, in some
      embodiments stabilizers 40 may take the form of machined metallic
      rings containing distributed tungsten weights to achieve dynamic
      balance. Other configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Likewise, in some embodiments, the arbor 36a may comprise
      any suitable arbor or mounting mechanism for securing the rotor
      stack 34 to the shaft 32. For example, in some embodiments, where
      rotor stack 34 comprises a laminate stack, it may be desirable to
      use a compression arbor 36 that facilitates the securing and
      positioning of the laminate.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, arbor 36 may be formed from any non-magnetic alloy,
      compound or element which may serve to enhance generator
      performance. Of course, other arbors 36 may be implemented
      depending upon factors such as the type of shaft 32, design of the
      rotor stack 34, as well as other factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] As noted, in some embodiments, magnetically conductive
      rotor stack 34 may comprise a stack 34 of individual disks
      fastened together. In other embodiments, stack 34 may comprise a
      unitary structure, or other similar solid magnetically conductive
      path. In still other embodiments, stack 34 may be replaced with
      any suitable magnetic material that enhances motor performance,
      including, but not limited to, various steel alloys, various
      paramagnetic materials, and distributed air-gap materials such as
      sintered steels and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Further, in some embodiments the stack 34 is fashioned to
      present a substantially cylindrical profile, such as one described
      with reference to FIG. 9, thereby ensuring an air gap with the
      stator of constant, or substantially constant, dimension at the
      cost of a relatively slight increase in magnetic circuit length.
      Such an arrangement facilitates a minimum change in magnetic
      potential energy across the air gap, thereby restricting the dO/dt
      voltage to a minimum, while allowing the speed voltage to have
      maximum effect upon the electric circuit as the flux interacts
      with the conductors imbedded in the wire slots of each pole face.
      This process highlights the exact opposite parameters found within
      embodiments of a Back EMF reducing motor, such as those disclosed
      in the related applications noted above, thereby maximizing the
      difference between embodiments of generator and motor geometries.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] As discussed in connection with FIGS. 8A and 8B,
      embodiments of the electrodynamic machine's stator poles and
      stator stack may comprise laminations or other material to
      optimize magnetic flux production without inducing detrimental
      eddy currents. Other embodiments of the stator assembly, and the
      components of the same, may also be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] For some embodiments implementing a multi-pole stator
      assembly, the stator assembly 22 may comprise silicone steel
      laminations, sintered steel alloys, distributed air gap material,
      or any other material which may suppress the formation of eddy
      currents and enhance motor efficiency and performance. Further,
      for some embodiments the stator assembly may have at least four
      (4), diametrically opposed salient pole projections 23, situated
      at even angular increments around the stator periphery, and
      aligned in pole pairs 180 mechanical degrees apart, but with pole
      polarity that alternates from North to South and from South to
      North for every 90 mechanical degrees so as to constitute a
      complete magnetic path through the rotor at all times. Other
      configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Some embodiments of the device include multipolar
      arrangements with salient poles placed at 90 degree intervals, or
      sub-divisions thereof, such as 45 degrees, 22.5 degrees, etc.
      However, a particular device's physical constraints (e.g., space
      limitations), as well as magnetic constraints (e.g., interference
      from adjacent poles) should be considered as necessary for a given
      application of the device. [0060] As discussed, in some
      embodiments, each salient pole projection 23 supports an
      electrical winding or coil 24 that develops a magnetic field in
      response to the passage of a current through the field winding 24.
      This field provides a magnetic force which acts upon, and is
      correspondingly acted on by, the rotor assembly 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] A more detailed description of flux movement may be gained
      with reference to FIGS. 5A-5F which are each a schematic
      representation of a cross-section of a face 23a of a pole piece 23
      and the opposing rotor edge portion 35 of the rotor 34, taken at
      different points during one cycle of rotation of the rotor 34 in
      accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Again, as the
      view is cross-sectional only one pair of pole pieces 23 is shown.
      However, the same motion of the flux zones 37, 39 will occur in a
      similar manner on each pole of the device, although in opposite
      mechanical phase (i.e., 180 degrees out of phase).<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIG. 5A depicts a point in the rotor cycle at which the
      flux zone 39 is located midway between the conductors of power
      winding segments 26a and 26b. As noted above, the rotor geometry
      results in the flux zones being moved reciprocally back and forth
      across the faces 23a of the pole pieces 23. As shown in FIG. 5A,
      the rotor edge (and thus, the flux zone 39) is being accelerated
      in the direction of arrow M, toward power winding segment 26a.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 5B depicts the situation after 90 degrees of rotor 34
      rotation in the direction of the arrow. Here, the flux zone has
      moved to overlap power winding segment 26a with rate of change of
      flux becoming zero. Accordingly, the voltage in the power winding
      26 becomes practically zero. This is the location at which the
      point of reversal in direction of the flux zone takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 5C shows the situation after another 45 degrees of
      rotation. The pole face flux zone 39 has returned part way toward
      the midpoint of the power winding 26 in a direction extending
      toward power winding segment 26b.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 5D depicts the condition at 90 degrees of rotation
      with the pole face flux zone 39 at the midpoint between winding
      segments 26a and 26b.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In FIG. 5E there is shown the condition after another 45
      degrees of rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In FIG. 5F, the pole flux zone 39 is at an extreme point of
      movement relative to the pole piece face 23a and including power
      winding segment 26b. No directional arrow is shown since the zone
      39 is momentarily at rest with respect to the pole piece face 23a.
      In this way, a full cycle is completed for some embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] For such embodiments, the position of maximum flux
      concentration alternates from a relative zero position to a
      maximum displacement twice each cycle without undergoing a
      reversal of its magnetic polarity. It is understood that the flux
      density does not vary sinusoidally in the angular sense, but
      exhibits a complex variation in position which can be expressed
      mathematically as a spatial harmonic wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Furthermore, for these embodiments, because the flux never
      reverses polarity, the "iron" domains within the pole pieces 23
      will not exhibit major hysteresis loops usually associated with
      oscillating flux. In this manner, embodiments of the disclosed
      systems drastically reduce the hysteresis losses which are
      particular to all flux-reversing systems. In addition, cooling
      requirements for such embodiments of the alternator are likewise
      reduced since smaller quantities of heat are generated by the
      reduced hysteresis losses in the pole pieces 23.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In some embodiments, the motion of the rotor 34 causes a
      simple harmonic motion of the magnetic flux across the pole faces,
      such that, despite the substantially constant flux density, the
      flux position becomes a direct function of shaft speed. Hence,
      actual flux velocity across each pole face becomes proportional to
      some maximum flux density value, B, times the simple harmonic
      velocity, v. Accordingly, the speed voltage, Vs = B(v maxsin rot);
      this equation represents the motional portion of the induced
      voltage. However, considering the "transformer voltage" component,
      Vt, which is equal to some expression involving dO/dt. Therefore,
      the total voltage will be the sum of the speed voltage Vs, and the
      transformer voltage Vt, with a mathematical result approximating
      Vi ot ai = [B(v maxsin rot)] + (dO/dt).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In two-pole embodiments, the induced voltage in the power
      windings 26 oscillates through a complete cycle for every 180
      degrees of rotation of the rotor 34. Thus, the induced voltage has
      twice the frequency of the harmonic velocity of the flux and the
      angular velocity of the shaft 32. This fact has an important
      consequence, as the prior art teaches that a two-pole alternator
      can generate only one cycle of current for each revolution of the
      rotor. Thus, the prior art requires that a two-pole alternator
      must operate at 3600 r.p.m. in order to generate 60 cycle
      alternating current. By contrast, with the alternator of the
      current invention a two-pole machine can produce 60 cycle
      alternating current at 1800 r.p.m.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] By extension of the above characteristics, a four pole
      machine could produce 60 cycle alternating current at 900 r.p.m,
      and an eight pole machine can produce the same 60 cycle current at
      450 r.p.m. The ability to operate at lower r.p.m. is advantageous
      and reduces the wear on mechanical components of the machine, can
      offer increased reliability, and longer machine life. The
      presently disclosed embodiments of the electrodynamic machine also
      result in a reduction of iron-related losses which are
      proportional to rotor speed, as well as loses stemming from
      mechanical friction and windage. Other advantages also exist.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Embodiments of the herein-disclosed rotor geometry and
      multiple salient poles upon the stator will create an electrical
      phase for each additional pole set. Accordingly, a two pole
      embodiment will generate a single phase output, a four pole
      embodiment will generate two phase output, an eight pole
      embodiment will generate four output phases, a sixteen pole
      embodiment will generate eight output phases, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Various connection configurations exist to handle the
      phased output. For example, some embodiments may employ
      rectification of each output phase together with the summation of
      each phase's power on a common DC output bus. Other embodiments
      may employ a series interconnection of AC phases such as to
      produce a single phase AC output. This configuration is called a
      zigzag connection, and it is typically applicable in environments
      where the final electrical output phase relationship does not
      interfere with the energy feedback mechanism. Other phase handling
      output configurations are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In an inductive circuit, such as that of the power windings
      of an electrodynamic machine configured as an alternator, it is
      well-known that a certain component of the current flows in a
      reactive relationship to the induced voltage. This "produces" a
      "reactive power component" referred to as "volt-amperes reactive,"
      or "VAR" power. The average value of reactive power is zero, and
      it can make no contribution to the consumed power such as a
      resistive load. However, in embodiments of the disclosed machine,
      due to the fact that the flux changes its direction mechanically,
      the energy stored in the VAR component can be transformed into
      useful mechanical work, and assist the prime mover in rotating the
      rotor shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] For some disclosed embodiments, the rotor is constantly
      oscillating the space angle, and, thus, a portion of the converted
      power, between the real power domain and the imaginary power
      domain. Thus, when the rotor is in the real power domain, VARS
      appear as imaginary power and watts are real. Likewise, when the
      rotor is in the imaginary power domain, VARS appear real and Watts
      appear imaginary (note the following definitions: Watts (resistive
      loads), +VAR's (inductive loads) and -VAR's (capacitive power)).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The basis of this concept can best be grasped by referring
      to FIG. 6A. This drawing shows an embodiment with an elliptical
      rotor 34 pictured within its cylindrical surface of revolution. At
      the instant depicted, the rotor 34 is so positioned that the flux
      is centered on each pole face, and is passing through the axis of
      symmetry of elliptical rotor 34. As rotation proceeds, from left
      to right, the flux in the left pole face is moved in a downward
      direction, and begins to induce a voltage in 23 a, the flux in the
      right pole face is moved in an upward direction and begins to
      induce a voltage in 23b. Assume for simplicity and by way of
      example, that the power coils 26 are connected in additive series,
      and that their output is short circuited. This will ensure that
      the windings are the only active components in the circuit, and
      that the power produced in them will be substantially reactive. As
      current starts to build within the coils 26, an opposing force due
      to the Lenz reaction will attempt to thrust the flux in a
      direction opposite to that of its motion. This thrust will be
      parallel to the axis of rotation of shaft 32, and in an opposite
      sense for each pole 23. The action of these forces upon the rotor
      34 will be analogous to that of followers in the groove of a
      cylindrical cam. Hence, these lateral thrusts will be converted
      into "diluted" torques that oppose the effort of the prime mover
      for one quarter cycle, and provide assistance over the next
      quarter cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Because of the lateral oscillation of the external magnetic
      field rather than the usual rotary movement, the current carrying
      conductors will still develop powerful forces in accordance with
      Lenz's law. In this case though, the force is directed parallel to
      the axis of rotation, thus, only a minor vector component
      interacts with the torque necessary to spin the rotor. Unlike
      conventional systems where the resulting Lenz force attempts to
      deplete torque (i.e., Back torque), in this case a percent of the
      effort made by prime mover is reflected at the limits of travel of
      the rotor such that it assists rather than retards the torque
      provided by the prime mover. The power for this operation is
      provided by the reactive power in the system. This mechanism
      therefore decreases the average torque required to rotate the
      machine. The system may be considered to function as a non-linear
      spring, compressing and expanding in synchronicity with each
      electrical cycle. As a result power may be directed back toward
      the prime mover, where it is stored as kinetic energy in the mass
      of rotor, and can be reused at the start of the next successive
      electrical power generation cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] As an analogy, or explanation, of the above-imagine a child
      on a swing set who swings all the way to the top position possible
      on the swing, and instead of letting them go around the other side
      you pull an imaginary rope ever so slightly and they come back
      toward you with full force.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In FIG. 6B, the drive shaft 32 has rotated 90 mechanical
      degrees, and the lamination stack has traversed a space angle of
      90 degrees relative to the pole faces. At the instant depicted,
      the harmonic velocity of the surface of the rotor 34 relative to
      the pole faces is exactly zero, but about to reverse. At this
      point in time, the reactive current in each winding 26 is just
      reaching its maximum value because it is 90 degrees out of phase
      with the induced voltage. Hence, as each edge 35 of the rotor 34
      begins to accelerate in the opposite direction, relative to the
      pole faces, magnetic forces produced by the current in each
      winding now attract the flux, and develop thrusts which operate in
      the same direction as that of the motion. Due to the cam-like
      design of this embodiment of the rotor 34, these actions give rise
      to torques which now assist the effort of the prime mover for the
      next quarter cycle which contributes to an increased overall
      system efficiency and requires less input power from the prime
      mover.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Because embodiments of rotor 34 comprise a magnetic
      material canted at a specific angle, rotor 34 possesses mechanical
      properties as well as magnetic properties. Accordingly,
      embodiments of the rotor 34 can operate as a swash plate when it
      is impinged upon by forces which are parallel to the axis of
      rotation. Therefore, when Lenz forces appear as a result of the
      interaction between the generated current, and the stationary
      magnetic field, a force, or "thrust" will appear and act upon the
      rotor 34. The face angle of the rotor 34, or its tilt, will act to
      dilute this force, as in the case of a cylindrical cam. However,
      when the rotor edge 35 reverses direction at the 180 degree
      position, the retarding force, or Lenz reaction, will be augmented
      by the shaft torque, thus off-loading the prime mover for a
      portion of one electrical cycle. This effect lowers the average
      torque requirement, and lessens the power contribution for the
      prime mover.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] One periodic change in induction is synchronized with the
      occurrence of maximum current within the circuit. This change in
      volume of the circuit energy requires no additional work input
      from the prime mover and produces a net gain in power production.
      In this method of energy transformation, power flow oscillates
      between the mechanical and electrical domains such that unused
      reactive power is periodically converted to angular kinetic energy
      after which it can be dissipated in the electrical load. The
      parametric pumping of the main inductance modulates the magnetic
      energy associated with the current flow. This gives form to a
      second order resonance that associates itself with an oscillation
      of energy between the mass of the alternator's rotor and the
      magnetic induction of the power windings situated in the stator
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] This form of energy resonance does not require capacitance
      within the electrodynamic machine's electric circuit. Rather,
      energy is stored within the rotor's mass and produces reversals in
      shaft torque which in turn provides rotational assistance to the
      prime mover.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] As explained herein, and with reference to FIGS. 7A and 7B,
      the disclosed machine will experience two distinct, internal flux
      movements, each of which may induce eddy currents of different
      directions within the machine steel. FIG. 7A is an illustration of
      a portion of some stator lamination plates 1010 in accordance with
      some embodiments of the disclosed machine. Each lamination plate
      1010 may also comprise an insulating coating 1012 on the outer
      surfaces. As shown, a magnetic flux field 1014, indicated as
      coming out of the page by the dots as shown, experiences a first
      velocity (vi) indicated by arrows 1016 pointing to the right, and
      an electric field (Ei), indicated by the arrows 1018 pointing to
      the top of the figure. This field (Ei) produces a relatively
      insignificant eddy current because the insulating coating 1012
      between each plate inhibits the current flow. However, as shown in
      FIG. 7B, when a second direction of motion (v 2) is experienced as
      indicated by the arrows 1020, such motion will produce a second
      electric field (E 2) as indicated by the arrows 1022. Because this
      field (E 2) is established between the insulating coatings 1012,
      eddy currents (I) as indicated by arrows 1024 will flow within the
      metal lamination plates 1010.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIGS. 8 A and 8B illustrate an end view and a side view of
      stator pole arrangements in accordance with some embodiments of
      the disclosed machine that enable the minimizing of the eddy
      currents in the salient poles due to flux movement in two
      directions as described above. As shown for this embodiment, a
      stator pole may comprise a top pole piece (called a shoe)
      comprising vertically disposed laminations 1028. A bottom portion
      of the pole may comprise standard, or radially disposed,
      laminations 1030. Other arrangements of laminations are also
      possible, the concept being that the layers of the various
      portions are arranged to minimize eddy currents by inhibiting
      current flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Also illustrated for this embodiment in FIGS. 8 A and 8B
      are stator field windings 1026 for generating the magnetic flux
      fields, rotor 1032, rotating about an axis of rotation 1034, and
      constant air gap 1036 between the edge of rotor 1032 and stator
      shoe 1028. Not shown here, are the power windings 26 which are
      used in generator action. For some embodiments, power windings 26
      may reside at or in slots within shoe 1028.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Additional embodiments of stator poles may also be
      implemented to minimize eddy currents. For example, another
      embodiment is to have the pole face, or shoe 1028, made of a
      material such as sintered steel, ferrite, or distributed air-gap
      material, and then bond, or otherwise fasten, the shoe 1028 to the
      bottom portion 1030 of the stator pole.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, other embodiments may also implement stator pole pieces
      comprising grain- oriented steel, with the grain best oriented for
      lateral flux movement. Embodiments employing combinations of these
      techniques for eddy current minimization are also possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Likewise, for some embodiments, the salient poles are
      designed to be as short as is optimal in order to optimize the
      overall magnetic circuit length. This has the advantage of also
      lessening iron losses. [0089] Finally, for some embodiments, the
      design of the pole field windings (e.g., windings 1026) is to be
      of adequate wire size, but with a number of turns that is optimal.
      This has the advantage of keeping I &lt;2&gt;R (i.e., copper)
      losses to a minimum. The wire size and number of turns are
      preferably optimized so that enough turns are used to establish a
      magnetic flux of sufficient magnitude, while also keeping the I
      &lt;2&gt;R losses to an optimal minimum. Typically, relative to a
      comparable conventional machine, the presently disclosed stator
      designs will accommodate a greater number of windings per pole
      because each pole contains both field coils and power coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] As noted previously, the rotor design features of the
      presently disclosed invention also contribute to the herein
      described performance. As discussed above, an important feature of
      the disclosed rotor is that it be shaped to assist in the
      reduction of the factors that contribute to the generation of Back
      Torque. To that end, rotors that exploit the design principles in
      accordance with the present disclosure will be designed to form a
      constant, or substantially constant, air gap with respect to the
      stator poles.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In addition, a rotor designed in accordance with the
      disclosed embodiments of the invention will also facilitate the
      creation of a variable length magnetic circuit path. In general,
      one way to design a rotor capable of creating a variable length
      magnetic circuit path is to create an ellipse that, when rotated,
      retains a circular cross-section. For some embodiments, such an
      ellipse may be created in the manner illustrated in FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] FIG. 9 illustrates a conceptual diagram of the generation
      of an ellipse that, when rotated, has a circular cross-section. As
      shown, such an ellipse can be generated by drawing a reference
      circle c with a radius r. Projecting out of the plane of the
      circle c, a height h is generated from r sin a, where a is that
      angle of inclination of the hypotenuse R (of triangle aOb) from
      the plane of circle c, and where ฮ represents the angles generated
      about the point 0 in the plane of circle c. Thus, the triangle aOb
      is formed having a radius value of R = (r &lt;2&gt;+ (rsin a)
      &lt;2&gt;) &lt;172&gt;. If the height (h) of the triangle aOb is
      varied sinusoidally in accordance with the angle ฮ, then for a
      given ฮ, the instantaneous angle of slope may be calculated by the
      following relation, S = Atan (cos a). Plotting an infinite number
      of similar triangles about ฮ for the full 360 degrees of circle c
      produces an ellipse of perimeter e pas shown in FIG. 9. Ellipse e
      pwill always have a circular cross-section when rotated about 0 in
      the plane of circle c. Additional rotor designs suitable for
      implementation of the concepts presently disclosed are also
      possible. [0093] Another aspect of embodiments of the disclosed
      electrodynamic machine may be illustrated with reference to
      performance under the application of an electrical load to the
      device. The application of a load to most conventional generating
      devices produces a secondary magnetic field which opposes the
      generator's field flux, thereby causing a reduction in output
      voltage. This "voltage drop" is then countered by increasing the
      current delivered to the device's field windings, which in turn
      boosts the output voltage. However, the presently disclosed
      electrodynamic machine has the heretofore unexpected behavior of
      increasing its rotational speed as the output impedance approaches
      a short circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Naturally, this kind of behavior can be controlled, and so
      here we have the basis of a type of regulator which may interact
      with the prime mover providing a "governor" action, as well as
      controlling the output voltage. For example, in some embodiments a
      mechanism in place between the prime mover and the electrodynamic
      machine could be used to prevent any overspeed condition due to a
      shorted load from affecting the increased speed of the
      electrodynamic machine from impacting the prime mover.<br>
