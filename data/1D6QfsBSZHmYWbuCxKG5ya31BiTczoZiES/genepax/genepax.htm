        <p><b><font size="+1">New Fuel Cell System 'Generates
              Electricity with Only Water, Air'</font></b> </p>

      <p>Genepax Co Ltd explained the technologies used in its new fuel
        cell system "Water Energy System (WES)," which uses water as a
        fuel and does not emit CO2. </p>
      <p>The system can generate power just by supplying water and air
        to the fuel and air electrodes, respectively, the company said
        at the press conference, which took place June 12, 2008, at the
        Osaka Assembly Hall. </p>
      <p>The basic power generation mechanism of the new system is
        similar to that of a normal fuel cell, which uses hydrogen as a
        fuel. According to Genepax, the main feature of the new system
        is that it uses the company's membrane electrode assembly (MEA),
        which contains a material capable of breaking down water into
        hydrogen and oxygen through a chemical reaction. </p>
      <p>Though the company did not reveal the details, it "succeeded in
        adopting a well-known process to produce hydrogen from water to
        the MEA," said Hirasawa Kiyoshi, the company's president. This
        process is allegedly similar to the mechanism that produces
        hydrogen by a reaction of metal hydride and water. But compared
        with the existing method, the new process is expected to produce
        hydrogen from water for longer time, the company said. </p>
      <p>With the new process, the cell needs only water and air,
        eliminating the need for a hydrogen reformer and high-pressure
        hydrogen tank. Moreover, the MEA requires no special catalysts,
        and the required amount of rare metals such as platinum is
        almost the same as that of existing systems, Genepax said. </p>
      <p>Unlike the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), which uses
        methanol as a fuel, the new system does not emit CO2. In
        addition, it is expected to have a longer life because catalyst
        degradation (poisoning) caused by CO does not occur on the fuel
        electrode side. As it has only been slightly more than a year
        since the company completed the prototype, it plans to collect
        more data on the product life. </p>
      <p>At the conference, Genepax unveiled a fuel cell stack with a
        rated output of 120W and a fuel cell system with a rated output
        of 300W. In the demonstration, the 120W fuel cell stack was
        first supplied with water by using a dry-cell battery operated
        pump. After power was generated, it was operated as a passive
        system with the pump turned off. </p>
      <p>This time, the voltage of the fuel cell stack was 25-30V.
        Because the stack is composed of 40 cells connected in series,
        it is expected that the output per cell is 3W or higher, the
        voltage is about 0.5-0.7V, and the current is about 6-7A. The
        power density is likely to be not less than 30mW/cm2 because the
        reaction area of the cell is 10 x 10 cm. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the 300W fuel cell system is an active system, which
        supplies water and air with a pump. In the demonstration,
        Genepax powered the TV and the lighting equipment with a
        lead-acid battery charged by using the system. In addition, the
        300W system was mounted in the luggage room of a compact
        electric vehicle "Reva" manufactured by Takeoka Mini Car
        Products Co Ltd, and the vehicle was actually driven by the
        system. </p>
      <p>Genepax initially planned to develop a 500W system, but failed
        to procure the materials for MEA in time and ended up in making
        a 300W system. </p>
      <p>For the future, the company intends to provide 1kw-class
        generation systems for use in electric vehicles and houses.
        Instead of driving electric vehicles with this system alone, the
        company expects to use it as a generator to charge the secondary
        battery used in electric vehicles. </p>
      <p>Although the production cost is currently about ¥2,000,000
        (US$18,522), it can be reduced to ¥500,000 or lower if Genepax
        succeeds in mass production. The company believes that its fuel
        cell system can compete with residential solar cell systems if
        the cost can be reduced to this level. </p>

      <p>Kiyoshi Hirasawa, president of Genepax Co Ltd, unveiled part of
        the reaction mechanism of the company's new fuel cell system
        called "Water Energy System" in an interview with Nikkei
        Electronics. </p>
      <p>The system, which is capable of generating power with water and
        air, was first presented June 12, 2008. As reported in our
        previous article, the system produces hydrogen through a
        chemical reaction between water and a metal (or a metal
        compound) on the fuel electrode side (See related article). </p>
      <p>Genepax uses a metal or a metal compound that can cause an
        oxidation reaction with water at room temperature, the company
        said. Metals that react with water include lithium, sodium,
        magnesium, potassium and calcium. The main feature of the Water
        Energy System is that it can be operated for a longer period of
        time by controlling the reaction of the metal or the metal
        compound, the company said. </p>
      <p>According to Genepax, the metal or the metal compound is
        supported by a porous body such as zeolite inside the fuel
        electrode of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The products
        of the hydrogen generation reaction dissolves in water, and the
        water containing them will be discharged with water inside the
        system. Upon the completion of the reaction, the generation of
        hydrogen and power stops. </p>
      <p>Considering the commercialization of the system, Genepax is
        conducting evaluation tests and plans to release test data.</p>

      </center>
      <p>...Genepax demonstrated the car in the Japanese city of Osaka
        on 12 June 2008. Genepax Claims that one liter (2.1 pints) of
        any kind of waterrain, river or sea (even tea, stated the press
        release)is all that is needed to run the engine for about an
        hour at a speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). However, their claims that
        a 300 watt (0.4 horsepower) engine could drive the car (the
        weight of which has not been specified) at this speed and for
        this duration despite wind resistance / Automobile drag
        coefficients and other energy-draining forces warrants further
        investigation. </p>
      <p>The demonstration vehicle was a Takeoka Reva, a small electric
        car whose manufacturer claims a range of 85 km running on its
        standard set of batteries, which take 8 hours to charge off the
        mains at 100 V on a 15 A circuit. A charge of up to 12 kWh for a
        range of 85 km suggests that the micro car draws about 40 times
        more power than the claimed rating of the fuel cell. This would
        indicate that during the test drive the fuell cell could have
        contributed little more than 2% of the power used, the remainder
        being drawn from the previously charged batteries...<br>

        <div align="left">The present invention relates to water energy
          system capable of water as a fuel, power generation is
          performed at room temperature atmosphere.<br>
          <br>
          Various fuel cells have been proposed in the prior art.<br>
          <br>
          Fuel cells are devices that generate electricity by utilizing
          an electrochemical reaction, depending on the type of material
          constituting the cell, the material various kinds are used as
          fuel.<br>
          <br>
          For example, organic materials such as aldehydes and methanol
          is used.<br>
          <br>
          Here, in a general fuel cell, to be able to supply hydrogen
          efficiently for the fuel electrode, is reformed through a fuel
          reformer before being supplied to the fuel electrode directly
          to the fuel.<br>
          <br>
          As the system for oxidation is supplied to the fuel electrode
          of the cell to the fuel directly, for example, direct methanol
          fuel cells are known.<br>
          <br>
          The object of the present invention is that without using a
          fuel such as methanol, we propose a water energy system
          capable of performing power generation under normal
          temperature by using pure water.<br>
          <br>
          In order to solve the above problems, it is opposed disposed
          sandwiching an electrolyte and oxygen electrode and the fuel
          electrode, and pure water is supplied to the fuel electrode,
          supplying oxygen to the oxygen electrode, water energy system
          of the present invention, the subject to the electrochemical
          reactions occurring at the oxygen electrode and the fuel
          electrode causes the output DC power from these poles, as the
          fuel electrode, the platinum is supported on a sintered body
          of fine powders of carbon black zeolites, and coral sand and
          is characterized in that using, as the oxygen electrode, is
          used in which ruthenium is supported on a sintered body of
          fine powders of carbon black and zeolites.<br>
          <br>
          According to the experiments of the present inventors, in the
          water energy system according to the present invention, when
          supplying pure water directly to the fuel electrode, hydrogen
          contained therein is oxidized and decomposed efficiently, and
          a power generating operation efficiently at room temperature
          under be done has been confirmed.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, according to the present invention, as
          conventional, without the use of fuel gases such as methanol,
          it is possible to realize a fuel cell system capable of
          performing efficient power generation through a simple
          mechanism.<br>
          <br>
          The following describes an embodiment of a water energy system
          with reference to the drawings, the present invention has been
          applied.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of the water energy system
          according to the present embodiment.<br>
          <br>
          The water energy system 1 is a system that generates power by
          an electrochemical reaction of the catalyst with water, a
          basic configuration is the same as that of a general fuel
          cell.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in the figure, the water energy system 1, is
          sandwiched between the catalyst 2, the cell of the
          configuration are oppositely disposed (cathode) fuel electrode
          3 oxygen electrode 4 (anode) is a structure which is connected
          to a large number of series are.<br>
          <br>
          Is shown only one cell in FIG.<br>
          <br>
          The fuel electrode 3, by the catalytic, hydrogen pure water 5
          is supplied directly contained therein is electrolysis
          negative hydrogen ions and electrons.<br>
          <br>
          The catalyst, oxygen air is supplied from the outside to the
          oxygen electrode and the other four are included therein are
          generated water by reduction reaction with hydrogen ions.<br>
          <br>
          Through a recovery passage (not shown), water is produced is
          caused to circulate on the side of the fuel electrode 3.<br>
          <br>
          Oxygen electrode 4 and the fuel electrode 3 is connected to
          the external load 8 via conductor 6, 7 being drawn from them.<br>
          <br>
          Motor is driven by direct current, an external load 8, and the
          like lamp.<br>
          <br>
          It is also possible to, or instead of the external load 8,
          with this, stored in a secondary battery 9, such as electric
          double layer capacitor, the conductors 6 and 7, is used as
          capable of supplying AC power source AC via an inverter 10 .<br>
          <br>
          In the present embodiment, as the fuel electrode 3, is used as
          the platinum is supported on a sintered body of fine powders
          of carbon black zeolites, and coral sand.<br>
          <br>
          As the oxygen electrode 4, I have used as the ruthenium is
          supported on a sintered body of fine powders of carbon black
          and zeolites.<br>
          <br>
          I will explain the power generating operation of water energy
          system 1 of this configuration.<br>
          <br>
          When supplied to the fuel electrode 3 of pure water 5,
          hydrogen and oxygen is produced which is electrolyzed,
          hydrogen splits into negative hydrogen ions and electrons by
          the electrochemical reaction.<br>
          <br>
          This reaction is an oxidation reaction because hydrogen emit
          electrons.<br>
          <br>
          Hydrogen ions produced move to the oxygen electrode 4 through
          the catalyst 2.<br>
          <br>
          There are ion-permeable but electron is not passed, the
          negative electrons are extracted to the outside via conductor

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a drive unit that has a low noise
      level, does not emit exhaust gas, and is suitable for use in a
      hydraulic backhoe or other construction working machine or other
      hydraulic working machines, electric vehicles, and the like.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      A construction working machine such as a front-end loader for
      digging holes or the like in residential or other areas is a
      hydraulic vehicle, and is constructed so that a hydraulic pump of
      a hydraulic drive mechanism is driven by a gasoline engine or a
      diesel engine to generate operating hydraulic pressure. Hydraulic
      working machines are often limited to nighttime use in residential
      and other areas due to engine noise.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, working machines and vehicles driven by gasoline
      engines or diesel engines emit carbon dioxide. Air pollution from
      exhaust gas is currently a global issue and is a problem that
      requires an urgent resolution.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it has been suggested that a hydraulic pump be driven
      using an electric motor in order to address the noise issue and to
      avoid air pollution from exhaust gas. However, a small-size,
      high-output power source suitable for mounting on a working
      machine is not currently available.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In view of this situation, an object of the present invention is
      to provide a drive unit having a built-in small-size, high-output
      power generator suitable for mounting in a hydraulic working
      machine, electric vehicle, or other vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Aimed at attaining the stated object, the drive unit of the
      present invention is characterized in having:<br>
      <br>
      an electric motor; and<br>
      a power generator for supplying electric power to the electric
      motor;<br>
      wherein the power generator is provided with a power generator
      module, a fuel supply component for supplying liquid fuel for
      hydrogen generation to the power generator module, and an air
      supply component for supplying air to the power generator module;<br>
      wherein the power generator module is provided with a power
      generator module structured so that an anode-side electrode plate
      supplied with the liquid fuel and a cathode-side electrode plate
      supplied with hydrogen contained in the air are disposed facing
      each other, an electrolyte membrane being sandwiched between the
      electrode plates;<br>
      wherein the anode-side electrode plate is an electrode plate in
      which platinum is supported on a sintered body of a
      microparticulate powder made of zeolite, coral sand, and carbon
      black; and<br>
      wherein the cathode-side electrode plate is an electrode plate in
      which ruthenium is supported on a sintered body of a
      microparticulate powder made of zeolite and carbon black.<br>
      <br>
      According to experiments conducted by the present inventors, it
      has been confirmed that the hydrogen contained in the liquid fuel
      supplied to the anode-side electrode plate undergoes efficient
      oxidative decomposition in a power generator module using such
      electrode plates, ensuring that power can be generated efficiently
      at normal temperature. It is therefore possible to efficiently
      generate power by a simple structure without using methanol or
      other fuel gases as in the past.<br>
      <br>
      The power generator module in the present invention is provided
      with a pair of collector plates, a plurality of partition plates,
      and a plurality of electrode assemblies. The electrode assemblies
      are stacked and bonded structures in which an electrolyte film is
      sandwiched between the anode-side electrodes and the cathode-side
      electrodes. The electrode assemblies sandwich the partition plates
      and are serially connected. The electrode assemblies positioned on
      both edges sandwich the corresponding partition plates and are
      connected to the collector plates. Furthermore, each of the
      partition plates is provided with an anode-side face in which a
      fuel supply groove is formed, a cathode-side face in which an air
      supply groove is formed, an external circumferential end face in
      which an air intake is formed, and a fuel supply port passing in
      the thickness direction of the corresponding partition plate in an
      area disposed at a distance from the formation region of the fuel
      supply groove and the air supply groove. The air intake
      communicates with the air supply groove via an air duct formed in
      the interior of the partition plate; and the fuel supply port
      communicates with the fuel supply groove via a fuel duct formed in
      the interior of the partition plate. Fuel supply ports passing in
      the thickness direction in an area that corresponds to the fuel
      supply ports of the partition plates are formed in the electrode
      assemblies and the collector plates in a corresponding manner; the
      partition plates are stacked while disposed opposite the
      anode-side face in the anode-side electrode plates of the
      electrode assemblies; and the partition plates are stacked while
      disposed opposite the cathode-side face in the cathode-side
      electrode plates.<br>
      <br>
      In this arrangement, the electrode assemblies and the partition
      plates can be bonded in a liquid-tight state by being stacked with
      interposed frame gaskets. In this case, each of the frame gaskets
      may be provided with a fuel supply port passing in the thickness
      direction of the frame gasket in an area corresponding to the fuel
      supply port.<br>
      <br>
      Increasing the number of electrode assemblies in the power
      generator module thus configured allows power generation capacity
      can be increased in a simple manner.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the hydraulic working machine of the present invention is
      characterized in having a hydraulic drive mechanism provided with
      a hydraulic pump, and a drive unit for driving the hydraulic pump,
      the drive unit having the aforementioned construction being used
      as the drive unit. A hydraulically driven working machine that has
      a low noise level and does not emit exhaust gas can be implemented
      because the hydraulic pump is driven by the electric motor and
      because a small-size power generator that capable of delivering a
      high output is used as the power source of the electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the electric vehicle of the present invention is
      characterized in being equipped with a drive unit having the
      aforementioned construction.<br>

      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Embodiments will now be described with reference to drawings for a
      case in which the drive unit of the present invention is adopted
      as a drive unit for a hydraulic working machine.<br>
      (Overall Structure)<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a drive unit for a
      hydraulic pump. The drive unit 1 of the present example is a unit
      for driving, for example, the hydraulic pump 100 of a backhoe or
      other hydraulic construction working machine, and is provided with
      an electric motor 2, a power generator 3 for supplying power to
      the electric motor 2, and a battery 4 for storing the electric
      current generated by the power generator 3. Power is supplied to
      the electric motor 2 via a capacitor 5. The parts 2, 3, 4, 5 are
      drivably controlled by a controller 6. The controller 6 is usually
      constructed as a part of a controller for drivably controlling a
      working machine on which the drive unit 1 is mounted.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram showing the power generator 3.
      The power generator 3 comprises a power generator module 14, a
      fuel circulation system 15 for supplying liquid fuel for hydrogen
      generation to the power generator module 14, a blower 16 for
      supplying air (oxygen) to the power generator module 14, a cooling
      fan 17 for cooling the interior of the generator, and an internal
      power source 18 for driving the blower 16, the cooling fan 17, and
      the pump of the fuel circulation system 15.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid fuel is a fuel having high hydrogen generation
      efficiency and can be a product obtained by dissolving 2 to 5 wt %
      organic material in 95 to 98 wt % purified water. Purified oil of
      citrus fruits or other plants, fermented alcohol from corn or
      other grains, or the like may be used as the organic material. A
      liquid fuel (trade name: Zumie fuel) manufactured and sold by the
      applicant of the present application is particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel circulation system 15 of the power generator 3 comprises
      a circulation tank 23, a fuel circulation circuit 24 for
      circulating the liquid fuel stored in the circulation tank 23 via
      the power generator module 14, and a circulation pump 25 for
      circulating the liquid fuel along the fuel circulation circuit 24.
      Also provided is a main tank 28 capable of supplying liquid fuel
      through an injection port 27 positioned in a generator housing 26.
      When the amount of liquid fuel inside the circulation tank 23 is
      equal to or less than a prescribed amount, a supply pump 29 is
      driven, and the liquid fuel is replenished from the main tank 28
      into the circulation tank 23.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel circulation system 15 is provided with a recovery tank
      30, and the liquid fuel recovered along with the air from the
      power generator module 14 is collected in the recovery tank 30.
      The liquid fuel collected in the recovery tank 30 is discharged as
      needed through a water discharge outlet 31 positioned in the
      generator housing 26. Furthermore, the liquid fuel recovered in
      the recovery tank 30 can be returned to the circulation tank 23 by
      a supply pump 32.<br>
      <br>
      The DC current generated by the power generator module 14 is
      outputted to the internal power source 18 and the battery 4 via a
      rectifier 33. A startup switch 34 is positioned in a circuit for
      supplying power to the battery 4, and when the startup switch 34
      is switched on, power is supplied from the internal power source
      18 to the pumps 25, 29, 32, the blower 16, and the cooling fan 17
      via a relay 35, and an operation is started in which these
      components are driven. Supply of generated current to the battery
      4 is started after the power generation of the power generator
      module 14 is stabilized.<br>

      FIG. 3 is a perspective view showing the power generation module
      14, FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view of the power generation
      module 14, FIG. 5 is a perspective view showing the partition
      plate, and FIG. 6 is a schematic view showing the flow of a liquid
      fuel. The power generation module 14 is provided with the pair of
      collection plates 45, a plurality of partition plates 44, and a
      plurality of electrode assemblies 42. The electrode assembly 42
      has a configuration in which an anode-side electrode plate 47 and
      a cathode-side electrode plate 48 are stacked and bonded,
      sandwiching an electrolyte film 46. The anode-side electrode plate
      47 is a rectangular-shaped electrode plate disposed inside the
      interior frame of a rectangular-shaped gasket 47a, the
      cathode-side electrode plate 48 also is a rectangular-shaped
      electrode plate disposed inside the interior frame of a
      rectangular-shaped gasket 48a.<br>
      <br>
      The plurality of electrode assemblies 42 of this configuration are
      sandwiched by the partition plates 44 and connected in series. The
      electrode assemblies (not shown) that are placed at both ends are
      sandwiched by partition plates 44, respectively, and are connected
      to the collection plates 45. The rectangular frame-shaped gasket
      43 is sandwiched between the electrode assembly 42 and the
      partition plates 44 on two sides, respectively, and a fluid-tight
      state is formed therebetween. The configuration of these parts
      will be described in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      First, the anode-side electrode plate 47 of the electrode assembly
      42 is an electrode plate in which platinum is supported on a
      sintered compact of particulate powder composed of zeolite, coral
      sand, and carbon black. The other cathode-side electrode plate 48
      is an electrode plate in which ruthenium is supported on a
      sintered compact of particulate powder composed of zeolite, and
      carbon black.<br>
      <br>
      Positioning holes 41a, 42a, 43a, 44a pass through and extend in
      the thickness direction of the fastening plate 41, the electrode
      assembly 42, the gaskets 43, the partition plates 44, and the
      collection plates 45 in a pair of corner portions in the diagonal
      direction of these components. Positioning pins that are not shown
      are passed through these positioning holes 41a through 44a, and
      these components are stacked in an aligned state. A plurality of
      boltholes 41b are formed in the fastening plates 41, and the
      components are integrated in a stacked state by fastening bolts 49
      that are passed through the boltholes.<br>
      <br>
      A pair of liquid-fuel supply ports 41c, 42c, 43c, 44c, 45c that
      pass through and extend in the thickness direction of one of the
      fastening plates 41, the electrode assembly 42, the gaskets 43,
      the partition plates 44, and the collection plates 45 is formed in
      the other pair of corner portions in the diagonal direction of
      these components. The liquid fuel is supplied, e.g., via a
      liquid-fuel supply conduit 50 connected to the liquid-fuel supply
      ports 41c on an upper side in the exterior surface of one of the
      fastening plates 41, and is discharged via a liquid-fuel supply
      conduit 50 connected to the liquid-fuel supply ports 41c on a
      lower side.<br>
      <br>
      The collection plates 45 have a shape in which a terminal plate
      region 45d extends upward in a fixed width from one end of an
      upper end surface of the rectangular main plate member. In the
      present example, two collection plates 45 have the same shape, and
      are disposed with opposite orientations.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the configuration of the partition plates 44 will be
      described with reference to FIGS. 5 and 6. One surface of the
      partition plate 44 is used as the anode-side surface 51, and in
      this case, liquid-fuel supply grooves 52 having a constant depth
      extending in a parallel manner at fixed intervals in which the two
      ends are in communication are carved inside the exterior
      peripheral rectangular frame portion having a constant width. The
      other surface of the partition plate 44 is the cathode-side
      surface 53, and in this case, air supply grooves 54 having a
      constant depth formed in a grid shape are formed inside of the
      exterior peripheral rectangular frame portion having the same
      constant width.<br>
      <br>
      The same number of air inlet ports 59 is formed in each of the
      four peripheral end surfaces 55 through 58 of the partition plates
      44, and the air inlet ports 59 are in communication with the air
      supply grooves 54 via air passages 60 formed inside the partition
      plate. Therefore, outside air is supplied to the air supply
      grooves 54 of the partition plates 44 via the air inlet ports 59.
      The air supplied to the air supply grooves 54 of the cathode-side
      surface 53 of the cathode-side partition plate 44 is supplied to
      the cathode-side electrode plate 48 of the electrode junction body
      42 facing air supply grooves.<br>
      <br>
      The pair of liquid-fuel supply ports 44c that are formed in the
      partition plate 44 are in communication with the liquid-fuel
      supply grooves 52 via liquid-fuel passages 61 that are formed
      inside the partition plate. Therefore, the liquid fuel that is
      supplied from the liquid-fuel supply conduit 50 of the fastening
      plate 41 passes through the liquid-fuel supply ports 41c, 45c,
      43c, flows into the liquid-fuel supply ports 44c of the partition
      plate 44, and from here, passes through the liquid-fuel passages
      62 inside the partition plate and is supplied to the liquid-fuel
      supply grooves 52. The electrode junction body 42 is stacked in a
      fluid-tight state via the gasket 43 on the anode-side surface 51
      of the partition plate 44 on which the liquid-fuel supply grooves
      52 are formed. Therefore, the liquid-fuel supply grooves 52 are in
      an airtight state, and liquid fuel is supplied to the anode-side
      electrode plate 47 of the electrode junction body 42 without
      leaking to the outside.<br>
      <br>
      At this point, the liquid fuel passes through the liquid-fuel
      supply ports 44c, 43c, 42c, 43c that are formed in the partition
      plate 44, the gasket 43, the electrode assembly 42, and the other
      gasket 43; and is supplied to the liquid-fuel supply port 44c of
      the next partition plate 44, as shown in FIG. 6. From here, the
      liquid fuel passes into the internal liquid-fuel passage 61, and
      is supplied to the liquid-fuel supply grooves 52 of the partition
      plate 44. The liquid fuel that flows down to the liquid-fuel
      supply grooves 52 of the partition plate 44 passes through the
      internal liquid-fuel passage 61, is discharged to the other
      liquid-fuel supply port 44c, passes therefrom through the
      liquid-fuel supply ports 43c, 42c, 43c, 44c, and is discharged to
      the exterior.<br>
      <br>
      In a power generation module 14 of this configuration, the number
      of electrode assemblies 42 sandwiched between partition plates 44
      and gaskets 43 and connected in series may be increased, whereby
      power-generating capacity can be readily increased.<br>
      <br>
      The power generation module 14 generates power by an
      electrochemical reaction between a liquid fuel and a catalyst, and
      is substantially equivalent to an ordinary fuel cell. In other
      words, when liquid fuel is supplied to the anode-side electrode
      plate 47 (the fuel electrode), the fuel is electrolyzed and
      hydrogen and oxygen are produced, the hydrogen is divided into
      hydrogen ions and negative electrons by an electrochemical
      reaction, as shown in FIG. 7. Since hydrogen releases an electron
      in the reaction, the reaction is an oxidizing reaction. The
      generated hydrogen ions pass through the electrolyte film 46
      (catalyst) of the electrode assembly 42 and migrate to the
      cathode-side electrode plate 48 (oxygen electrode). The
      electrolyte film 46 is permeable to ions but blocks electrons, and
      the negative electrons are therefore removed to the exterior via
      the collection plate 45 of the anode side. On the other hand, air
      is fed into the cathode-side electrode plate 48 (oxygen
      electrode). Therefore, the hydrogen ions supplied along the
      electrolyte film 46 and electrons supplied from the exterior via
      the collection plate 45 undergo a reductive reaction, and water is
      produced. Power is produced thereby. The produced water is
      recovered together with air in the recovery tank 30 (see FIG. 2).<br>

      The drive unit of the present invention can be used as that for
      driving the electric motor of an electric vehicle. In this case,
      the drive unit may have the same structure as that shown in FIG.
      1, and the output of the electric motor 2 is transferred to a
      power transmission mechanism that transfers the power to the drive
      shaft of the drive wheels of the electric vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned above, the drive unit according to the present
      invention is able to use the power generator that has high
      power-generation efficiency, is small and has high power output in
      comparison with the conventional fuel batteries, and to drive an
      electric motor for driving a hydraulic pump, an electric vehicle
      and other machines. Hence, it is possible to realize a drive unit
      that is suited for use in the hydraulic pump and that has a low
      noise level and does not emit exhaust gas. It is also possible to
      realize a drive unit suited in use for driving the electric motor.<br>
