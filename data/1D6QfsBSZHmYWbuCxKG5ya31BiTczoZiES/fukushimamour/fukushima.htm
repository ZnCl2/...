                    minutes under the flame, the molten metals sent up
                    an instant flash in what Brown says is the reaction

                    registered 16,000 curies [ sic; counts? ] per minute

                    Department of Energy, at the request of the Hon.
                    Berkeley Bedell.&nbsp; Cobalt 60 was treated and
                    resulted in a drop of Geiger readings from 1,000
                    counts to 40 -- resulting in radioactive waste
                    residue of about 0.04 of the original level.&nbsp;
                    Apprehensive that somehow the radioactivity might
                    have been dispersed into the ambient environment,
                    the official requested the California Department of
                    Health Services to inspect the premises. The health
                    services crew found no radioactivity in the air

                    The Japanese scientists were so excited by what they
                    saw that they immediately purchased a generator and

              Radioactive material can be processed by an apparatus that
              includes at least a cylindrical outer shell electrode, an
              inner electrode, and a plurality of prism-shaped
              ferromagnetic elements positioned between the outer and
              inner electrodes. The prism-shaped ferromagnetic elements
              are positioned around the inner circumference of the metal
              cylinder. The inner electrode component is located within
              the metal cylinder and is configured to cover the
              inwardly-pointing portions of the prism-shaped
              ferromagnetic elements. Radioactive material in a

              excitation signal is applied to the electrodes of the
              apparatus during treatment of the material. The frequency

              Disclosed is a radioactive waste treatment process for
              transmuting long-lived radioisotopes into short-lived
              radioisotopes through applied nuclear physics. Nuclear
              reactions, specifically of the (gamma, n) type, also known
              as photo-disintegration, are utilized to accomplish this
              transmutation from troublesome, long-lived radioactive
              waste isotope(s) of given atomic mass to shorter-lived or
              stable materials of lower atomic mass, by exposing the
              troublesome isotopes to a high energy photon flux for a
              sustained time. Generally speaking, the target nucleus of
              the radioisotope(s) to be treated is irradiated by gamma
              photons of an energy greater than the binding energy of
              the neutron in the target nucleus. This causes the
              irradiated nucleus to absorb the gamma rays, thereby
              placing the nucleus in an excited state. Upon relaxation,
              the nucleus ejects a neutron through the (gamma, n)
              reaction, thereby transmuting the element to an isotope of
              lower atomic mass and shorter half-life.<br>

              Disclosed is a radioactive waste treatment process for
              transmuting long-lived radioisotopes into short-lived
              radioisotopes through applied nuclear physics. Nuclear
              reactions, specifically of the (gamma, n) type, also known
              as photodisintegration, are utilized to accomplish this
              transmutation from troublesome, long-lived radioactive
              waste isotope(s) of given atomic mass to shorter-lived or
              stable materials of lower atomic mass, by exposing the
              troublesome isotopes to a high energy photon flux for a
              sustained time. Generally speaking, the target nucleus of
              the radioisotope(s) to be treated is irradiated by gamma
              photons of an energy greater than the binding energy of
              the neutron in the target nucleus. This causes the
              irradiated nucleus to absorb the gamma rays, thereby
              placing the nucleus in an excited state. Upon relaxation,
              the nucleus ejects a neutron through the (gamma, n)
              reaction, thereby transmuting the element to an isotope of
              lower atomic mass and shorter half-life<br>
              .

              A method for generating high energy 32He particles
              includes the steps of accumulating protons and deuterons
              in intimate contact with a lattice structure storage

              hydrogen atoms includes steps for storing a first isotope
              of hydrogen and a second isotope of hydrogen in contact
              with a lattice structure to produce a first ratio of the
              first isotope to the second from a mixture having a second
              ratio of the first isotope to the second isotope,
              adjusting the energy of the lattice structure to initiate
              the energy production reaction caused by the interaction

                which can cause nuclear transformation. Solution:
                Radioactive or nonradioactive isotopes are manufactured
                by the nuclear transformation in an electrode and the
                combination of nuclear reactions such as neutron capture
                and natural nuclear disintegration of products made
                through the nuclear reactions. The kinds of manufactured
                isotopes are very numerous, and it is especially easy to
                obtain non-single isotopes. Since the conditions of
                electrolysis can be controlled very precisely, it is
                possible to manufacture only target substances
                precisely. For an electrode for cold nuclear fusion, an
                element whose atomic number is close to that of a

                metal and a rare element. For example, W, Ag, Sn and Pt

              A method for transmuting spent fuel from a nuclear reactor
              includes the step of separating the waste into components
              including a driver fuel component and a transmutation fuel
              component. The driver fuel, which includes fissile
              materials such as Plutonium.sup.239, is used to initiate a
              critical, fission reaction in a reactor. The transmutation
              fuel, which includes non-fissile transuranic isotopes, is
              transmuted by thermal neutrons generated during fission of
              the driver fuel. The system is designed to promote fission
              of the driver fuel and reduce neutron capture by the

              (long-lived FP nuclides such as technetium-99 or

              Wire-type members of a long-lived radioactive material

              long-lived FP nuclides are surrounded by a moderator

              The FP pins, and nothing else, are housed in a wrapper

              members can be replaced by thin ring-type members. The

              FIELD: chemistry, waste recycling. ^ SUBSTANCE: invention
              relates to field of liquid radioactive wastes recycling.
              Long-living radionuclides are isolated from nitric acid
              solution of used nuclear fuel (UNF) into solid phase in
              form of acetates, oxides and other compounds, which do not
              contain elements strongly activated with neutrons.
              Radionuclides are imbedded and fixed in carbon matrix.
              Carbon matrix is obtained in process of carrying out
              reaction of metal acetates with excess of phthalonitryl
              and their further pyrolysis. For radionuclides isolated
              from UNF in form of oxides or other compounds, carbon
              matrix is obtained by their mixing with yttrium acetate,
              then synthesis and pyrolysis of yttrium diphthalocyanine

              yttrium diphthalocyanine is carried out in inert
              atmosphere, pyrolysis is carried out at T=850-1100 DEG C.;

              The invention discloses a solution reactor used for the
              plutonium combustion and the neptunium-237 or the
              americium-241 transmutation. The solution reactor adopts
              plutonium or plutonium and americium in the spent fuel of
              the nuclear power plant as the fuel, and adopts
              neptunium-237 or americium-241 as the target. By adopting
              the solution reactor, the minor actinides which have long
              half life and high toxicity and can not be stored for a
              long time, such as the neptunium-237 or the americium-241,
              can be changed into nuclides with short half life and low

              reactor adopts the spent fuel and can generate electricity
              at the low temperature, the cost-effectiveness and the
              security are high; the neutron provided by the plutonium

              An apparatus and method is described for transmuting
              higher actinides, plutonium and selected fission products
              in a liquid-fuel subcritical assembly. Uranium may also be
              enriched, thereby providing new fuel for use in
              conventional nuclear power plants. An accelerator provides
              the additional neutrons required to perform the processes.
              The size of the accelerator needed to complete fuel cycle
              closure depends on the neutron efficiency of the supported
              reactors and on the neutron spectrum of the actinide
              transmutation apparatus. Treatment of spent fuel from
              light water reactors (LWRs) using uranium-based fuel will
              require the largest accelerator power, whereas
              neutron-efficient high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) or
              CANDU reactors will require the smallest accelerator
              power, especially if thorium is introduced into the newly
              generated fuel according to the teachings of the present
              invention. Fast spectrum actinide transmutation apparatus
              (based on liquid-metal fuel) will take full advantage of
              the accelerator-produced source neutrons and provide
              maximum utilization of the actinide-generated fission
              neutrons. However, near-thermal transmutation apparatus
              will require lower standing inventories of plutonium and
              higher actinides. Uranium, presently the largest volume
              constituent in nuclear waste, is fully utilized and not
              discharged as waste. Since no plutonium, higher actinides
              or fission products are present in the reconstituted fuel
              elements, the present processes can be used repeatedly.
              Since the performance of the existing reactors is not
              changed, full utilization of both thorium and uranium
              resources is achieved.<br>

              including a driver fuel component and a transmutation fuel
              component. The driver fuel, which includes fissile
              materials such as Plutonium&lt;239&gt;, is used to
              initiate a critical, fission reaction in a reactor. The
              transmutation fuel, which includes non-fissile transuranic
              isotopes, is transmuted by thermal neutrons generated
              during fission of the driver fuel. The system is designed
              to promote fission of the driver fuel and reduce neutron
              capture by the driver fuel. Reacted driver fuel is
              separated into transuranics and fission products using a
              dry cleanup process and the resulting transuranics are
              mixed with transmutation fuel and re-introduced into the
              reactor.; Transmutation fuel from the reactor is
              introduced into a second reactor for further transmutation
              by neutrons generated using a proton beam and spallation
              target.<br>

              The invention is a plasma torch for insertion through an
              opening in the wall of a waste processing chamber. The
              plasma torch of the invention is characterized by
              comprising a coaxial sleeve having an upper end and a
              lower end. The sleeve surrounds at least the portion of
              the outer surface of the torch that is located in the
              opening, thereby forming an insulating chamber between the
              outer surface if the torch and the inner surface of the
              sleeve. At least a portion of the portion of the coaxial
              sleeve that surrounds at least the portion of the outer
              surface of the torch that is located in the opening in the
              wall of the processing chamber is porous or permeable to a
              heat exchanging fluid. The torch comprises an inlet for
              introducing the heat exchanging fluid into the insulating
              chamber. When the plasma torch is inserted through the
              opening, a gap exists between the processing chamber wall
              and the coaxial sleeve. Thus the coaxial sleeve and the
              insulating chamber shield the outer surface of the plasma
              torch from a significant amount of the heat that radiates
              from the processing chamber wall and from inside the
              processing chamber and the heat exchanging fluid that
              flows through the inlet exits the insulating chamber into

              in a neutron-diffusing medium surrounding a neutron
              source. The diffusing medium is transparent to neutrons
              and so arranged that neutron scattering substantially
              enhances the neutron flux to which the material is
              exposed. Such enhanced neutron exposure may be used to
              produce useful radioisotopes, in particular for medical
              applications, from the transmutation of readily-available
              isotopes included in the exposed material. It may also be
              used to efficiently transmute long-lived radioactive
              wastes, such as those recovered from spent nuclear fuel.
              The use of heavy elements, such as lead and/or bismuth, as
              the diffusing medium is particularly of interest, since it

              material (long-lived FP nuclides such as technetium-99 or
              iodine-129) which was produced in the nuclear reactor.
              Wire-type members of a long-lived radioactive material
              comprised of metals, alloys or compounds including
              long-lived FP nuclides are surrounded by a moderator
              material and installed in cladding tubes to form FP pins.
              The FP pins, and nothing else, are housed in a wrapper
              tube to form a transmutation assembly. The wire-type
              members can be replaced by thin ring-type members. The
              transmutation assemblies can be selectively and at least
              partly loaded into a core region, a blanket region or a
              shield region of a reactor core in a fast reactor. From a
              viewpoint of reducing the influence on the reactor core
              characteristics, it is optimal to load the transmutation
              assemblies into the blanket region.<br>

              Apparatus for nuclear transmutation and power production
              using an intense accelerator-generated thermal neutron
              flux. High thermal neutron fluxes generated from the
              action of a high power proton accelerator on a spallation
              target allows the efficient burn-up of higher actinide
              nuclear waste by a two-step process. Additionally, rapid
              burn-up of fission product waste for nuclides having small
              thermal neutron cross sections, and the practicality of
              small material inventories while achieving significant
              throughput derive from employment of such high fluxes.
              Several nuclear technology problems are addressed
              including 1. nuclear energy production without a waste
              stream requiring storage on a geological timescale, 2. the
              burn-up of defense and commercial nuclear waste, and 3.
              the production of defense nuclear material. The apparatus
              includes an accelerator, a target for neutron production
              surrounded by a blanket region for transmutation, a
              turbine for electric power production, and a chemical
              processing facility. In all applications, the accelerator
              power may be generated internally from fission and the
              waste produced thereby is transmuted internally so that
              waste management might not be required beyond the human
              lifespan. <br>

              The present invention addresses the problems outlined
              above. An accelerator based on a combination of a high
              repetition rate high energy pulsed power supply (RHEPP)
              and a magnetically-injected anode plasma (MAP) source
              diode is used to provide pulsed particle beams having
              intermediate energy (0.2-20 MeV) and average power levels
              of hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts. This will increase
              the rate of isotopic production by 2-3 orders of magnitude
              over processes based on conventional accelerators. Any
              gaseous ion can be accelerated with this technology
              (proton, deuteron, and helium beams are of special
              interest). This capability can be applied to transmute
              target nuclei selectively into desired isotopes. RHEPP/MAP
              accelerators are also extremely power efficient and
              relatively small in size, making application of small
              units practical in, for example, major local or regional
              medical facilities. Finally, the use of relatively low
              beam particle energies reduces or eliminates the problem
              of undesired products and the subsequent generation of
              radioactive waste. Although the invention is being
              discussed in terms of embodiment via the RHEPP/MAP system,
              any pulsed ion beam generator having sufficient ion
              kinetic energy and total average beam current can be used
              in the same manner.<br>

              Accelerated decay of radioactive materials is used for
              power production. In the method of this invention an
              alpha-emitting radioactive material is placed in a region.
              The region is selected so that when a negative potential
              is applied to the region, enhanced alpha decay of the
              radioactive material results. The energy of the alpha
              decay particles is captured and converted to thermal
              energy.<br>

              <p>Nuclear physics; decontamination of radioactive wastes
                and the like from long-living radioactive isotopes.
                Substance: transmutation of long-living radioactive
                isotopes into short-living or stable ones is conducted
                under the action of electromagnetic radiation. In the
                process, highly ionized atoms with energy- resolved hole
                of accelerated beta-decay are produced from atoms of
                long-living radioactive isotope and held in ionized
                state until transmutation of mother nuclei to daughter
                short-living or stable ones takes place. With
                coefficient of operating time k preset for daughter
                nuclei, atoms of long-living radioactive isotope are
                held in highly ionized state for at least time beta,
                where beta is lifetime of mother nuclei under
                accelerated beta-decay conditions. Electromagnetic
                radiation may be effected by beams of accelerated
                charged particles (electrons, protons, or ions) or by
                photon flux. Radiation by charged-particle beam may be
                combined with photonflux radiation. Effect:&nbsp;
                enhanced transmutation efficiency dispensing with
                nuclear reactions of collision character and avoiding
                formation of by-products. <br>

                particles including photons in an amount sufficient to

                that includes at least a cylindrical outer shell
                electrode, an inner electrode, and a plurality of
                prism-shaped ferromagnetic elements positioned between
                the outer and inner electrodes. The prism-shaped
                ferromagnetic elements are positioned around the inner
                circumference of the metal cylinder. The inner electrode
                component is located within the metal cylinder and is
                configured to cover the inwardly-pointing portions of
                the prism-shaped ferromagnetic elements. Radioactive
                material in a container is placed into the apparatus,
                and an AC voltage excitation signal is applied to the
                electrodes of the apparatus during treatment of the
                material. The frequency of the excitation signal is
                selected according to the frequency of structurization
                or the frequency of destructurization of the
                ferromagnetic material. The process can be monitored and

              I have beaten my head against this wall since 1994, when
              S-X Jin, David Faust and I began testing High Density
              Charge Clusters as a way of Remediating radioactive
              emissions produced by spent nuclear fuels. We developed a
              system that was totally viable. We developed the math that
              explained what it was and how it worked. WE conducted the
              experimental protocols for 7 years and documented the
              procedures that were used to enable and sustain it. We
              submitted this info to US DOE in 2003 by invitation. In
              2004 our system was independently validated by the guys at
              Sandia Labs. In 2005 I was contacted by Dr. Frank Goldner,
              the senior nuclear scientist responsible for developing
              and testing remediation technologies at the agency. He
              screamed at me and threatened to have me and Dick Shamp
              arrested under FISA unless we stopped sending
              documentation to the Department and discontinued our work.
              I stopped. Dick did not. In 2009, after Obama was elected,
              Dick contacted the #3 guy at DOE, a career bureaucrat who
              has served as personal private secretary to the Secy of
              DOE for more than 30 years named Dr. Eysan Khan. He
              apologized profusely for the way we had been treated and
              invited me to come to DC to present the HDCC methodology
              to all 26 of his senior department heads. Two weeks before
              I was scheduled to make the trip, he called to tell me
              that he had gotten so much push-back from clients of DOE
              about my presentation that he couldnt tolerate the
              pressure. The presentation was cancelled.<br>

              This has nothing to do with Yucca Mountain . It has
              everything to do with the governments secret and unlawful
              use of public utilities who generate atomic power as the
              source for high grade uranium and weapons grade plutonium.
              They dont want the problem solved because it would
              deprive them of their only viable source of supply. They
              dont give a fart in a windstorm about the risks they
              impose on local populations like Fukushima  all they care
              about is using nuclear weapons to control the planet. And
              they are getting away with it. Thats why this subject
              makes no sense to anyone who talks about it  the real
              agenda has nothing to do with public safety or possible

              Of all the problems I have participated in developing
              solutions for, perhaps the most important and frustrating
              has been the development of a system for treating
              radioactive fuel wastes produced by nuclear power plants.
              After WWII, the development of nuclear power plants was
              hailed as the final solution for the energy shortage
              supply-side crisis predicted by so many for so long. The
              use of atomic power was touted as the final solution for
              the problem. Unfortunately, before the 20th Century was
              ended, we had witnessed the catastrophes at Three Mile
              Island and Chernobyl. By the end of the century, America
              had hit the wall with the set of problems posed by
              accumulating stockpiles of spent nuclear waste materials.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Weve all seen the statistics. Fifty-two thousand metric
              tons of spent fuel rods and three hundred eighty thousand
              cubic meters of solid nuclear waste, which does not
              include three hundred forty-five million liters of
              liquefied high level radioactive waste materials are now
              being collected and stored on more than 140 sites across
              the nation. [[1]] The US Department of Energy has embarked
              on a suicidal program to encapsulate and bury all of this
              material underground beneath Yucca Mountain, a series of
              limestone caves located in the desert of Western Nevada.
              Environmentalists have risen up in fury to prevent Yucca
              Mountain from happening, and the government has mindlessly
              rolled out its agendas as it always does. The nature and
              extent of the problem has been deliberately minimized,
              distorted, and polarized by the opposing forces. The
              dangers involved in transporting, encapsulating and
              burying nuclear waste have been denied, suppressed, spun,
              and ignored by everyone who stands to profit from
              participation in the program.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              The governor of Nevada has vowed to prevent the
              importation and burial of high level nuclear waste
              materials in his state by any and every means possible. He
              has threatened civil disobedience and promised to call out
              the National Guard to prevent shipments from being
              delivered in his state. The Nevada legislature
              successfully importuned its congressional representatives
              and senators to create a protected wildlife sanctuary
              around Yucca Mountain so that water, roads, railroads, and
              all the accompanying development that is called for in the
              DOEs plan cannot be lawfully implemented. In exchange,
              the DOE published a series of scientific and engineering
              reports purporting to show that the site is totally safe
              for the storage of high level nuclear waste products. The
              reports have since been shown to be specious, but the
              DOEs policy remains. President Bush has vowed to override
              Congressional action using the power of the presidential
              pen. The battle lines have been drawn.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              After talking about the problem with several colleagues,
              we decided that remediation of radioactive emissions
              generated by spent nuclear fuel wastes was a problem that
              could and should be solved. We assumed that because so
              much attention was being focused on the overriding nature
              of the problem, it was something that deserved our best
              efforts. My opinion about it at the time was based on the
              notion that if the problem of radioactive waste could be
              eliminated from the equation, then nuclear power could be
              developed in a way that might eventually provide a safe,
              manageable, reasonably benign alternative to damming
              rivers, burning coal, and combusting natural gas to
              produce electric power. It seemed logical and reasonable
              to all of us.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              I began the process in much the same way as I do with any
              project I participate in. I surveyed the literature,
              contacted experts, evaluated available technologies,
              corresponded with friends at DOE and other government
              agencies, and worked for more than a year to familiarize
              myself with the territory. I went to some scientific
              conferences, met some of the private and public sector
              experts, and listened to their descriptions of the
              challenges presented by the accumulation of high level
              nuclear waste at places like Savannah&nbsp; River, Hanford
              and more than 100 others. I reviewed reports printed and
              circulated by the DOE and some of its contract laboratory
              research partners. After nearly a year, I decided that
              there were a couple of approaches that could be taken to
              solving the problem that no one else was pursuing.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              In 1995 I met with a very special Chinese physicist by the
              name of Shiang Xian Jin. Before he escaped from the PRC in
              1993, he was the top plasma physicist in China. He wrote
              the physics texts that are still being used to teach
              plasma physics in Chinese universities nearly two decades
              later. While serving as the Head of the Physics Department
              at Beijing University, he was also tasked by the Chinese
              government with the primary responsibility for evaluating
              all energy production inventions created by inventors in
              the PRC. He knows science and scientists because he is
              one. He knows invention and inventors because he has
              become thoroughly familiar with the process. When I met
              him, he was working in a small, privately owned laboratory
              that was one of the spin-offs from the Pons and
              Fleischmann cold fusion debacle. When I met him, Jin was
              writing papers about a totally new kind of technology,
              patented in the US by a genius inventor/scientist by the
              name of Kenneth Shoulders. His discovery of a new kind of
              electron cluster was fascinating because the phenomenon
              described in his patent was specifically prohibited by the
              standard physical model as a violation of basic quantum
              mechanical principles.[[2]]<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Jins papers describing the behaviors and dynamics of
              Shoulders High Density Charge Clusters were published in
              the peer reviewed Journal of New Energy, printed and
              distributed by the International New Energy consortium, a
              loose affiliation of scientists, engineers, technologists,
              and inventors from around the world. [[3]] At the 1997 INE
              convention, Jin and Shoulders presented papers and held
              discussions about HDCCs as a possible solution for the
              nuclear waste material treatment option we had begun to
              work on. Several major players in the research community
              attended and participated in these discussions, including
              George Miley of the University of Chicago, Rugerro
              Santilli of MIT, Tom Valone of the US Patent and Trademark
              Office, Eugene Mallove, also formerly of MIT [and
              publisher of Infinite Energy Magazine and Executive
              Director of the Integrity Research Institute in Camden,
              New Jersey] and Tom Bearden, eminent inventor and founder
              of the Union of Distinguished Scientists.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Papers by Russian, Ukrainian, Byelorussian, and other
              scientists from the former Soviet Union were also
              presented at subsequent conferences and published in later
              issues of the JNE. Eventually, we began to develop a
              consensus about HDCC behaviors and attributes. Much of the
              work that proved the utility of HDCCs as a way to
              eliminate radioactive emissions from high level spent
              nuclear fuels was supplied by Jin, his high voltage
              discharge and instrumentation engineer David Faust of
              Drexel University, and by Dr. Leonhardt Schroedter, a high
              profile materials and systems designer with more than 40
              patents issued while he worked for Boeing, Rockwell, and
              other aerospace companies. After seven years of testing
              and bench top development, Jin and Faust succeeded in
              demonstrating that a simple high voltage charge cluster
              generator could produce a high density stream of clusters
              of electrons which could be propelled through a
              proton-rich environment [such as deuteride gas] to impact
              a radioactive target material in a way that would
              effectively eliminate gamma ray emissions and reduce alpha
              [nuclear particle] emissions to ambient background levels
              in less than seven hours. It was a good beginning.&nbsp; <br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              In simple terms, what this meant was that a low velocity
              torus [a self-organizing standing wave in the shape of a
              donut] comprised of 6.022 x 1023 electrons [also known as
              Avogadros Number, this is 6.022 times 10 with 23 zeroes
              after it] could be generated by a controlled device,
              magnetically driven through a cloud of free protons and
              directed at a specific target with control and
              consistency. The velocity of the charge clusters was
              relatively low [less than 10% of the speed of light] when
              compared to the kinds of velocities demonstrated by
              nuclear particle accelerators, but the amount of kinetic
              energy produced by the interaction was enormous. For each
              108 electrons, a single proton was captured in the
              negatively charged center of the torus. Because protons
              are 1,883 times more dense than electrons, this meant that
              instead of bombarding the nucleus of a radioactive
              material with one high speed particle at a time, which is
              the basis of the catastrophic annihilation on which atomic
              bombs are based, each charge cluster was carrying 1015
              protons in its center.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              While the velocity may have been relatively low, the
              amount of mass contained in each charge cluster was huge
              by atomic standards. When the mass of protons impacted the
              surface of the radioactive target material, the protons
              penetrated deeply into the sub-surface layers. Unlike
              neutrons, which travel in a very orderly, linear way,
              protons bob and weave around the perimeter and in between
              other atoms because of the strong positive charge they
              carry. This attribute of protons in such high numbers,
              traveling at very high actual velocities, meant that many
              of the protons struck the nuclei of atoms making up the
              radioactive targets. The product of the impact was not
              catastrophic because the kinetic energy carried by the
              protons was insufficient to destroy the atoms. Instead, in
              the same way a bowling ball knocks the pins down on a
              bowling alley, the protons impact with a nucleus knocked
              the nuclear materials apart without annihilating the
              structure.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              The temporary separation of the nuclear materials released
              significant amounts of light and heat, which represented
              the product of the dissipation of the binding energies
              imposed by the strong and weak nuclear forces. But instead
              of creating a chain reaction, the impact simply knocked
              the atomic particles apart long enough to release as much
              as 50% of the nuclear binding energies. Very shortly after
              being knocked apart by the proton impact, the nuclear
              particles realigned themselves and rejoined to form nuclei
              with lower energy states and smaller atomic nuclear
              numbers. What we also discovered was that the recombining
              process actually created new material with atomic numbers
              that were different from any of the materials originally
              contained in the target samples. This was an important
              discovery because it meant that the mathematical model
              which predicted that the target material would literally
              be transmuted into new materials could be verified.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              We demonstrated the techniques effectiveness with both
              solid and liquid nuclear waste materials in successive
              trials conducted over a period of seven years. Jin, Faust,
              Schroedter, and Shoulders worked together to create a
              mathematical model to describe the interactions created by
              HDCCs and published their findings in the JNE in 1999. In
              2000, I went to work as CEO of Primary Technologies in
              Chicago and immediately contracted Jin to pursue his work
              as one of the technologies sponsored by Primary. Dick
              Shamp, former environmental scientist and intelligence
              analyst, who has been a member of the Republican National
              Committee for more than 40 years and is therefore well
              connected politically in Washington, worked with us to
              create a new company called Nuclear Remediation
              Technologies. This company was created to provide a home
              for the newly emerging HDCC-based nuclear remediation
              treatment program we had worked so hard to develop.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              By the time Primary imploded in the late Winter of 2001,
              Jins remediation model had been validated by other
              physicists, including notorious physicist Jack Sarfatti,
              who produced an extensive critical analysis of Jins
              mathematical formulations.[[4]] Tom Bearden and the Union
              of Distinguished Scientists also reviewed the model and
              Jins test results. In their 2001 monograph entitled
              Reformulation of Maxwells Electrodynamic Field
              Equations, Bearden, along with world-class mathematicians
              Lawrence Crowell and Myron Evans and 18 other scientists
              and mathematicians validated the mathematical formulations
              by showing that the phenomenon of the High Density Charge
              Cluster is specifically called for in Maxwells original
              quaternion equations. In addition, we discovered that
              scientists in China and Ukraine had also developed charge
              cluster generator technologies which produced
              quantum-defined clusters that conformed perfectly to the
              attributes predicted by Jins model.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              By the end of 2002, we were confident that we had
              developed and validated a simple, affordable, effective
              way to treat high level nuclear waste materials so that
              they produced no radioactive emissions at all. In fact,
              when the laboratory results were validated by other
              laboratories, it was discovered that spent nuclear fuel
              rods could be induced to produce up to nine times as much
              heat output during HDCC treatment as they do before being
              retired to water-borne storage tanks. This, we thought,
              was just icing on a very attractive and commercially
              valuable technological cake. We were ready, it appeared,
              to put the wheels on the HDCC radioactive emissions
              treatment program by driving NRT into the capital
              formation process.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Just as we were putting the pieces together, a brilliant
              and much valued colleague died suddenly and unexpectedly
              in an automobile motorcycle accident. Dr. Paul Brown,
              (Nuclear Solutions, Aurora, Colorado) had developed a
              novel method to remediate nuclear waste by photo nuclear
              reaction using high intensity gamma-rays. The technology
              utilized long established principles of physics [e.g.
              giant dipole resonance] that had also been overlooked in
              their possible application in the treatment of nuclear
              waste. Browns nuclear spallation device had been built
              and demonstrated in Japan and was on its way to the US for
              demonstration to the House Science &amp; Technology
              Committee in Washington, DC, when his death occurred. This
              event exerted a chilling effect on the members of the INE
              because it appeared to all of us that his death may not
              have been accidental at all.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              From the outset, our team had acted on a set of
              assumptions that seemed completely valid at the time but
              which later proved to be very ill advised. We assumed, for
              example, that because the nuclear waste problem was
              global, everyone would welcome a solution. We assumed that
              our agendas for carefully, scientifically defining and
              resolving the problem sets were consistent with those of
              the government agencies tasked by law and public policy to
              do the same thing. We assumed that the public utilities
              and providers of the technologies that support the nuclear
              power production industry would welcome a simple,
              cost-effective, efficient solution to a universal problem.
              We were sadly mistaken but did not discover how misguided
              our attempts were until several years and many hundreds of
              thousands of dollars later.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Dick Shamp, in his role as President of Nuclear
              Remediation Technologies, contacted Dr. Condoleezza Rice
              while she was serving as Director of the National Security
              Council at the White House. She passed his proposal off to
              one of her NSC staff members, who sent it to the
              Department of Energy. The proposal eventually found its
              way to the desk of Dr. Frank Goldner, AFCI Program
              Technical Director, Office of Advanced Nuclear Research,
              at DOE, who eventually responded by inviting us to submit
              a raft of documents, all of which taken together were
              needed to provide DOEs staff engineers and scientists
              with sufficient information to enable them to evaluate our
              claims and determine whether the HDCC program would
              qualify for research and development support. Over a two
              year period we produced more than 1,800 pages of
              application and disclosure documents, project
              descriptions, white papers, laboratory reports, R&amp;D
              protocols, benchmarks, timetables, milestones, and so on.
              The process was costly and time consuming, but we kept at
              it because we had convinced ourselves that all the work we
              were engaged in could only produce valuable and useful
              results.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              DOE dispatched three of its top remediation consultants to
              talk with our team, including Dr. Tom Ward and two other
              DOE consultants who were actively involved in the
              development and testing of other protocols at Los Alamos
              and Sandia Laboratories. We believed, based on the kinds
              of responses we continued to receive from Dr. Goldner and
              his staff at DOE that the NRT technologies not only
              qualified for funding support but that we would be
              contracted by DOE-affiliated laboratories at MIT and other
              prestigious universities to jointly develop and deploy
              successive iterations of the HDCC treatment devices in
              beta tests related to five different industrial
              applications.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              We prepared and filed a patent application which explained
              the proprietary features of the NRT HDCC-based radioactive
              remediation and treatment system. As a team, we had
              dedicated nearly 50 man-years over nearly a decade to
              develop and mature the technology. By the time the fateful
              call from Frank Goldner came in November of 2003 we were
              convinced that NRT was well on its way to becoming a
              global player. On a stormy afternoon in mid-November, my
              phone rang. Dick Shamp was on the line. He sounded
              breathless, as if he had been running up and down the
              stairs. He told me he had Frank Goldner on the phone and
              wanted to conference me in, so I told him to go ahead. The
              instant Dr. Goldner came on the line, he began screaming.
              Literally. He was yelling so loud that I had to put the
              receiver a foot away from my head to avoid damaging my
              ear. At first I was just astonished. I had never been
              spoken to in that tone of voice by anyone in my life so it
              took me a few seconds to recover my composure.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              During his diatribe, Goldner accused us of all sorts of
              things, including impermissibly bombarding Energy
              Secretary Spencer Abrahams office with an endless stream
              of unnecessary, unwanted, useless correspondence. He had
              been specifically instructed by Mr. Abraham, he said, to
              put a stop to our correspondence. He told us that the
              Secretary did not want our correspondence on file and
              demanded that we stop sending it to him. Somewhere in the
              middle of his screaming I screamed back. After I had
              managed to put a stop to his tirade, I got his undivided
              attention by telling Dr. Goldner that I had turned on my
              tape recorder and intended to send a copy of the tape to
              Secretary Abraham if he didnt shut up.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              What followed was one of the most astonishing
              conversations I have ever participated in in my life. We
              had done everything asked of us by Goldner and his minions
              at DOE. We had submitted all the documents, made all the
              disclosures, cooperated with all their consultants and
              demonstrated that the NRT system was both viable and
              effective. Goldner informed us that notwithstanding all
              that, the Departments policy called for the encapsulation
              and burial of high level radioactive nuclear waste under
              Yucca Mountain. No other technology, no other means of
              remediation, no other alternative would be permitted to
              impinge on the Departments policy, under any
              circumstances. We were ordered forthwith to cease and
              desist sending any further correspondence to DOE, at any
              level, for any reason, under any circumstances, related to
              our treatment system. Further, we were informed that NRT
              would be denied permission to obtain samples of any
              radioactive materials under any circumstances, whether for
              further testing and evaluation or any other purposes. In
              short, we were told that the United States government and
              the agency charged with protecting the welfare of its
              citizens had decided to specifically prohibit the
              implementation of a technology that had been demonstrated
              to solve the problem of radioactive emissions generated by
              high level spent nuclear fuel wastes.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              We were understandably enraged by both the decision and
              the way the message had been delivered. Over the next two
              years Dick and I complained to several of our White House
              contacts, as well as dozens of senators and congressmen.
              We wrote and published op-ed pieces in a number of
              newspapers. We attempted to contact the DOE consultants we
              had been working with to see if we could figure what had
              gone wrong. Once the door had been shut at DOE, all our
              access to pertinent research information produced by
              government-sponsored laboratories immediately ceased.
              People we had worked with for years refused to take our
              calls. For reasons that have since become crystal clear,
              but which at the time remained a total mystery to us, the
              solution we had created was summarily booted off the
              playing field.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Since that time, it has become clear that we made a number
              of serious tactical mistakes. The first and most important
              was the mistake of presumption. We assumed, because it
              seemed so patently obvious and logical at the time, that
              if radioactive emissions was such a terrible global
              problem, and if we could develop an effective solution, we
              would have contributed something meaningful, useful and
              important to the process. What we have since learned is
              that we could not have been more mistaken. The line at the
              food trough leading from DOE to Yucca Mountain is $12 -
              $15 billion a year long. The high temperature gas cooled
              nuclear fission university-based research establishment
              consumes another $8 - $10 billion each year from DOE and
              its affiliated agencies. The ancillary research and
              consulting services related to the actual design,
              engineering, construction, and operation of the Yucca
              Mountain implementation plan accounts for another $10
              billion a year more.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Everyone in the food chain who relies on DOE funding
              stands to be disenfranchised if someone outside the system
              actually figures out how to solve the problem. In this
              case, as in others we have tackled over the years, the
              problem set constitutes such a rich target for
              exploitation that no one who has a position at the trough
              really wants it resolved at all. I was genuinely
              astonished when it finally dawned on me that we would have
              been just as effective if we had painted a big red target
              on our foreheads and stood naked in the middle of
              going-home traffic on the DC beltway. Not only did we not
              fix the problem, we blew the cover of everyone in the
              private sector who had ever been involved in the process
              with us for more than 10 years. I guess I can take some
              comfort in the knowledge that I wasnt alone in my
              navet, but it hardly gives comfort to the prospect posed
              by the EEUs recent decision to build 85 new fission-based
              nuclear power plants over the next two decades.<br>
              &nbsp;<br>
              Second, in order to move our own agendas forward, we
              voluntarily disclosed absolutely everything there was to
              know about who was involved, what we were doing, how we
              were doing it, how it worked, and why. The DOE and its
              counterparts in other undisclosed agencies of government
              who have been tasked with derailing our research dont
              have to lift a finger to find out who or where we are. We
              are now totally naked after having been stripped to our
              financial shorts and washed repeatedly with a torrent of
              DOE sanitizers. We cannot hide any longer and therefore
              can never be safe even if we decide to take this
              technology elsewhere for development. The results we
              produced could hardly have been less effective...<b><br>
