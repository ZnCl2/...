        <p><b><font size="+1">Technology for High Mileage Auto Currently
              Available</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By</b> </p>
        <p><b>Tom Valentine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>“The big automakers, GM, Ford and so forth, have long had the
        know-how to build better performing, more fuel efficient cars,
        but it would defeat their marketing schedule to give us these
        advantages all at once.” </p>
      <p>The speaker was Dr William D. Guentzler, Industrial Arts and
        Power Technology professor at San Diego State University (SDSU)…
      </p>
      <p>Dr Guentzler has been teaching a special class for graduate
        automotive engineers at SDSU for the past 3 years --- a class
        that stimulates the students to create hardware projects
        designed to cost-effectively produce better mileage and cleaner
        air. </p>
      <p>“The technology has been around for several years which could
        provide a car owner with 100 % better mileage,” Guentzler
        stressed in an interview with the Spotlight. </p>
      <p><b>Dollar Savings</b> </p>
      <p>With gasoline prices at a present “low” of $1.16… to more than
        $1.50 for super-unleaded with service, a doubling of mileage
        could mean considerable dollar savings. </p>
      <p>“The very best retrofit methodologies (devices or adjustments
        one can make on the original equipment) would be a cylinder
        deactivation system&nbsp; (Cadillac’s heralded “8-6-4”, for
        example) and an automatic overdrive,” Guentzler told the
        Spotlight… </p>
      <p>This system will typically return from 30 to 60 % improvement
        in mileage on a V8, and is one of the best mileage improvement
        systems available. </p>
      <p>Guentzler recently designed an “8-4” system for the Brown
        Carburetor Co of Draper, UT (Spotlight, may 2), the
        manufacturers of the Fish carburetor. </p>
      <p><b>No Vacuum Drag</b> </p>
      <p>“There are a number of patents already granted for units that
        simply cut off the gasoline going into four of the cylinders.
        This is the least efficient method of all, however . The system
        I’ve designed for Brown, which utilizes two Fish carburetors
        very effectively, is the only system that also eliminates the
        vacuum drag from the deactivated pistons.” </p>
      <p>Actual mileage improvement figures were being obtained at the
        time of the interview, but Guetnzler estimates the
        Brown/Fish/Guentzler unit will derive “about 35 % improvement on
        the road,” and will sell for under $500. </p>
      <p>The Reflan computerized system, which literally deactivates the
        valves within the engine, tested on a treadmill dynamometer,
        returned a “low” figure of 66 % mileage improvement. </p>
      <p>“Of course the Reflan system is expensive,” Guentzler pointed
        out, “costing more than $900 installed.” </p>
      <p>“Someone with a station wagon, pickup or other large V8 powered
        vehicle can have the highway fuel efficiency of a small car. The
        Reflan system starts paying for itself after 18000 miles. Recent
        statistics indicate that the average auto owner today keeps his
        vehicle 6 to 10 years… </p>
      <p>“It’s a marketing conspiracy,” Guentzler smiled. ‘They want to
        sell you a piece at a time, rather than all at once --- for two
        reasons. It is less costly to tool up for changes slowly, and
        they will have new features for new models as sales incentives.”
      </p>
      <p>In addition, Guentzler said, “manufacturers do not necessarily
        use the best components for the best mileage and so forth ---
        they use parts and equipment that do the job at the least cost.”
      </p>
      <p>What about the fantastic carburetor claims --- the fabled 200
        mpg carburetor, for example? </p>
      <p>“It has never been proved that such a thing existed, and the
        rest of the auto engine is so inefficient I doubt it’s even
        possible for a carburetor alone to provide much more than, say,
        20 %.” </p>
      <p>To be cost effective means to get back more in savings than
        what the gas-saving device actually costs. Many people would
        lose money if they spent $500 on a retrofit system to save 25%/
      </p>
      <p>“Street mileage involves so many variables and factors that
        mileage ratings may be literally meaningless,” Guentzler
        explained. “However, an overall percentage improvement can
        definitely be obtained with several methods. Often these methods
        are additive, meaning that the 10% improvement of one method may
        be added to the 10% improvement of the other.” </p>
      <p><b>121 Miles Per Gallon</b> </p>
      <p>Guentzler has been testing mileage devices and additive claims
        for the past 10 years and a few years ago, working in
        conjunction with Dr Harold McEowen, the SDSU team produced a
        small diesel sports car that turned 121 miles per gallon… </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">American Consumers Victims of
              Oil-carburetor Conspiracy</font></b> </p>

        <p><b>Tom Valentine</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In 1934, John Robert Fish proudly announced he had built a
        simple, inexpensive, fuel-saving, cleaner-exhausting carburetor.
        But his thoroughly tested and proven invention was not happily
        received by eager automakers, as you might expect. Instead, the
        inventor met with suppression and harassment. </p>
      <p>What was wrong with the Fish carburetor? Why did Detroit react
        so violently to this easier-to-manufacture carburetor that would
        have saved millions in production costs even back then? Why did
        “they” turn thumbs down on a lower-cost, better-performing
        carburetor that outperforms what we live with today? </p>
      <p><i>The Spotlight</i> has learned that it wasn’t something
        ‘wrong” with the Fish carburetor that ld to near oblivion; it
        apparently was the ‘secret” that the Fish device uncovered that
        posed the threat. </p>
      <p>Today the Fish carburetor has been resurrected. And, although
        the monopoly powers and their government flunkeys are trying to
        continue the cover-up, the device is readily available today…
        [1983] </p>
      <p>Michael H Brown (<i>Spotlight,</i> 1 Nov 1982 ) is the owner of
        the Brown Carburetor Company of Draper UT. He is the man who
        single-handedly revived the Fish carburetor. </p>
      <p>Brown manufactures and markets the carburetors as high-mileage,
        high-performance equipment. </p>
      <p>“An immense mythology has built up concerning carburetors and
        fuel efficiency,” Brown told The Spotlight in a recent
        interview, “but the Fish is the only carburetor that gives you
        4-way satisfaction. It will give you more miles to the gallon,
        and yet it can be set to register zero emissions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;“If you care to sacrifice a little fuel economy, it will
        deliver up to 30% more horsepower. And, that’s not all. The Fish
        is the only multi-fuel carburetor in existence. You can run
        gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, and even crude oil, or Diesel fuel
        with a Fish on your gasoline engine.” </p>
      <p>Brown is not blowing some when he talks of fuels and the
        carburetor mythology of America. </p>
      <p>Brown goes out of his way to explain carburetion to neophytes.
      </p>
      <p>“Essentially, the carburetor is the device mixes fuel and air
        so that the mixture will explode inside the cylinder chambers of
        the engine to provide motive power. The mixing of fuel and air
        in a moving vehicle, with variables in the demands for changing
        engine speed, poses all kinds of problems for makers of
        carburetors. Most of today’s carburetors have at least 25 moving
        parts and 5 times as many part components. </p>
      <p>“The Fish carburetor has only 3 moving parts, and a total of 17
        components. You can imagine how inexpensive they would be if
        they were manufactured in the numbers of the big auto companied.
        My carburetors retail for $189 --- and that’s only because I
        make only a few at a time. A 4-barrel Rochester carb lists at
        $311—And they’re tooled up to make millions!”, Brown stressed. </p>
      <p>“The first carburetor was intended for use with diverse fuels,
        such as kerosene and alcohol, because, at the time (the 1890s),
        gasoline was nothing more than a waste product in kerosene
        distillation. </p>
      <p><b>Studied Chemistry</b> </p>
      <p>Brown went back to college and studied chemistry for several
        years before he felt knowledgeable enough to throw his weight
        into the defense of his Fish carburetor program, and at the same
        time tackle the great oil scam he uncovered. </p>
      <p>“I’ve studied petroleum chemistry for years, and I enrolled in
        GM’s carburetion classes in order to know what I’m talking
        about,” Brown said. “And I know, now, why so much useless
        verbiage has clouded the picture when it comes to carburetion,
        mileage and pollution.” </p>
      <p>Brown, who produced the first dial-fuel gasoline-alcohol care
        back in 1979, explained that the compression ratio in an engine
        holds the key to combustion --- combustion which produces
        horsepower, mileage and exhaust emissions. </p>
      <p>“These explanations are oversimplified, of course,” Brown
        explained. “But, if a piston travels 4 inches upward to compress
        the air-fuel mixture in a cylinder 5 inches long, the
        compression is said to be 4 to 1. Fuel ad air mixtures, like
        gunpowder, provide more power the more they are compressed. </p>
      <p>Drivers who recall the “muscle cars” of the 1960s and 70s ---
        cars with immense power, and low mileage,&nbsp; which were
        designed to run on “premium” fuel – will recall tetraethyl lead,
        or simply “ethyl”, the stuff used to make gasoline perform
        better in those big, higher-compression engines. </p>
      <p><b>High-Priced Gas</b> </p>
      <p>Tetraethyl lead also was a premium air pollutant, and
        eventually reaction to the fact ushered in the now nearly
        universal unleaded gasolines. Curiously, all gasoline is
        unleaded when refined --- only today we pay a higher price for
        it. Refiners claim the higher price is due to the need for
        additives other than tetraethyl lead. But skeptics say it’s
        merely a curious twist of supply-and-demand pricing, controlled
        by the cartel. </p>
      <p>“In the early 1970s,” Brown continued, “the federal government
        forced the automakers to lower the compression ratios ---
        setting automotive design and tooling back a decade or more. The
        earlier engines were unable to run such high compressions,
        because, as the engine developed speed, severe hammerings and
        knockings would result --- the infamous ‘ping’!” </p>
      <p>Brown, trying not to be too technical, explained that the
        so-called “octane rating” was introduced as a means of rating
        the ability of a fuel to resist such knocking. Obviously, oil
        companies and automaking companies had to work together. </p>
      <p>Brown furrowed his brow for emphasis when he reached this point
        in his explanation because he was nearing the key factor in the
        great fuel-carburetor scam he had uncovered. </p>
      <p>“The problem is that in all these years, no one has ever
        noticed that the octane rating is not dependent on compression
        factors alone. It was, and is, almost totally dependent on a
        defect in the idle circuit of almost every carburetor
        manufactured in the entire world from 1890 to present --- the
        Fish carburetor being the sole exception” </p>
      <p>Brown has published his analysis of carburetion in detail.
        Essentially, while learning all he could about carburetion, from
        every source he could find, Brown discovered that the oil-auto
        industry built its multi-billion dollar business by requiring
        multi-billion dollar refinery capacities in order to break crude
        oil down into gasoline with an octane rating. </p>
      <p><b>Burn Crude</b> </p>
      <p>“It’s a huge scam!” Brown stressed. “Diesel fuel used to be
        extremely cheap, because the gasoline was distilled out, and the
        leftover was labeled Diesel fuel. It’s an absolute fact that
        crude oil --- unrefined, cheap crude --- can be run straight in
        a Diesel engine, with its high compression ratio. Crude and
        diesel fuels are chemically almost identical. </p>
      <p>“Well, with the Fish carburetor, you can run crude in a
        gasoline-type engine --- fairly efficiently if the compression
        ratio is high --- and there is not more pollution than with
        refined gasolines,” said Brown. </p>
      <p>Brown’s penetrating question is: “Did the automakers know this
        about the Fish carburetor when he approached them in 1934? Could
        that have been the reason the Securities &amp; Exchange
        Commission (SEC) landed on him when he tried to manufacture and
        market the carburetor on his own? Could that be why the post
        office authorities came down on him with the old false ‘fraud’
        charges game and nearly destroyed his business in 1954?” (Fish
        ultimately refuted those charges in court.) </p>
      <p>“His company finally failed because of his death,” Brown added.
        “But Fish had a better product, and the world beat a path to his
        door --- not to praise him and make him deservedly rich --- no,
        they suppressed him because his carburetor could have demolished
        their octane rating game.” </p>
      <p><b>Disqualified</b> </p>
      <p>Brown glowed with anger as he recalled one of the all-time low
        points of the Fish carburetor suppression story: “Back in 1955,
        ‘Fireball’ Roberts drove a Fish-carburetor equipped Buick in the
        Daytona 500 race, and he beat 3 Chrysler supercharged 300G’s by
        a mile and a half. </p>
      <p>“They disqualified Roberts for reasons never given. Now, in my
        book, that the height of suppression. Fireball’s victory and his
        need to make fewer pit stops because of the Fish carburetor
        threatened to make Fish a major factor in the aftermarket.” </p>
      <p>Brown’s point is simple: “If there is no need for an octane
        rating, which is apparently deliberately engineered, there is no
        need to refine the fuel. If there’s no need to refine the fuel,
        then there’s no need for Exxon, Standard, Shell and the like. We
        can simply pump the crude out of the ground, as some Kansas
        farmers do, let the sand and water sink to the bottom of tanks,
        and use it directly as fuel.” </p>
      <p>Brown grinned, then explained: Don’t let your image of motor
        oil in the can confuse you when thinking about crude as it comes
        out of the ground. Crude is much closer to Diesel fuel.” </p>
      <p><b>Proved It</b> </p>
      <p>When Brown, his mechanics and distributors first completed
        their research on this discovery about the Fish carburetor’s
        multi-fuel capacity, one Kentucky dealer told Channel 18
        television in Lexington about it. </p>
      <p>The television people said, “Prove it.” </p>
      <p>Using a 350 Chevy, the mechanic used crude, kerosene, Diesel
        fuel and even dry cleaning solvent, as the news cameras recorded
        it. “It took only 7 seconds for the mechanic to adjust the Fish
        carburetor when switching from one fuel to the next,” Brown
        said. </p>
      <p>On addition, the carburetor consistently proved its ability to
        brig emission levels down lower than any carburetion system to
        come out of Detroit… </p>

      <p>Claims have been made for fuel efficiency in excess of 100
        miles per gallon through the use of exotic carburetors, the best
        known being those designed by John Robert Fish and Charles
        Nelson Pogue. These claims usually go on to say that the designs
        were sabotaged or otherwise supressed by petroleum companies
        and/or automobile manufacturers, in an attempt to maintain the
        technological status-quo. </p>
      <p>Of the two designs, the Pogue Carburetor tended to be the
        source of more extravagant claims. Although assigned US Patent
        #2,026,798 (and others), the carburetor was an experimental
        device and was never put into large-scale production. The theory
        behind the Pogue Carburetor involved the use of a combination of
        pressure and heat to improve the conversion of liquid fuel to
        vapor, and thereby improve combustion and efficiency. </p>
      <p>In contrast to the Pogue design, tens of thousands of the
        various models of the Fish Carburetor were eventually
        manufactured. Owing to various financial and production
        problems, paid orders from 1936 were not delivered until 1948,
        leading to a lengthy battle over alleged postal fraud. Serious
        production finally got underway in the mid-1950s. It has been
        reported that the Fish achieved 20% percent better gas mileage
        and 30% more horsepower when mounted on many different engines.
        After Fish died in 1958, the design was licensed to a firm that
        subsequently folded. From 1981-1996, a version of the Fish
        Carburetor was again manufactured by the Brown Carburetor
        Company. </p>

        <p><i>30% More Mileage on Gas, Diesel fuel, Toxic Waste
            Chemicals, or even Unrefined Crude Oil !</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>The most famous --- and most often copied --- high mileage
        carburetor in history. </p>
      <p>The first Fish carburetor was hand-built in 1933 and tested by
        Ford Motor Co 1934. Ford admitted the carburetor delivered 34%
        better mileage but then demanded that John Robert Fish --- the
        inventor --- immediately furnish a worldwide service network. </p>
      <p>Undaunted, Fish put together his own organization in 1937 and
        by 1947 was outing out a handful of them. By 1954 --- after
        repeated battles with everyone from the Post Office to the US
        Navy --- the Fish Carburetor Company of Daytona Beach, FL was
        cranking out over 2000 carburetors a month. </p>
      <p>John Fish died in 1958 and his Company folded the next year.
        Another company in San Diego bought the rights to the carburetor
        in 1961 and produced 6000 of them up until they went bankrupt in
        1965. The San Diego Company neglected to put bushings around the
        throttle shaft of their version of the Fish carburetor and as a
        result almost all their carburetors developed leaks in the
        castings. </p>
      <p>The Fish was guaranteed for a minimum 20% increase in fuel
        economy. 30% is average. </p>
      <p>The Fish won a lot of stock car races in the 50s… </p>
      <p>The Fish will run on any liquid fuel that will burn hotter than
        rubbing alcohol, including but not limited to alcohol, used dry
        cleaning solvent, diesel fuel, and crude oil… </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">How and Why This Carburetor Works</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the top photo the entire carburetor is pictured. The float
        chamber on the left operates on the same principles as other
        carburetors. The diaphragm plate fits between the float chamber
        and the throttle body. The lead --- or reed --- valve on the
        diaphragm is your accelerator circuit. When the fuel pick-up arm
        moves forward suddenly the pressure closes the leaf valve. The
        fuel that is ahead of the fuel pick –up arm is forced up the
        arm, which is hollow. At the top of the fuel pick-up arm is a
        needle valve.&nbsp; The needle valve adjustment allows you to
        set your carburetor for fuel&nbsp; economy, power, or the
        utilization of alternate fuels, such as ethyl alcohol, flammable
        toxic waste chemicals, or crude oil. This adjustment is made by
        removing a blanking plug and using an allenhead wrench, a
        procedure normally taking less than 30 seconds. </p>
      <p>There are&nbsp; no jets or metering rods in the Fish
        carburetor. The fuel metering groove at the bottom of the fuel
        pick-up arm replaces the idle, intermediate, and high-speed
        circuits in a regular carburetor. This groove starts at 0.0023
        at idle and goes to 0.078 inch at full throttle. When the
        pick-up arm moves over this groove it creates a constantly
        changing main jet size. The changing jet size is where a lot of
        out fuel efficiency comes from. </p>
      <p>The bottom photo shows the view from the top of the carburetor
        throat. At part throttle air is drawn through the top three
        holes and mixed air and fuel is pulled through smaller holes in
        the bottom. This is a superior method of atomizing fuel. At full
        throttle fuel comes out all six holes in the throttle shaft.
        This feature allows the use of regular six holes in the throttle
        shaft. This feature allows the use of regular octane gasoline in
        high-compression engines and eliminates the need for a fuel with
        an octane rating (more fully discussed in Brown’s Book of
        Carburetor) . </p>
      <p>By loosening the allenhead screw on the throttle valve you can
        change the air-fuel ratio by adjusting throttle valve angle. You
        can adjust the air volume just as you can adjust fuel volume
        with the needle valve, from 20 to 1 for maximum fuel economy to
        6 to 1 for wood alcohol… </p>
      <p>In plain English, we’ve been running high-compression engines
        on low test gasoline with no problems and have no ideas when
        we’ll stop climbing on the compression rations. We might even
        pass the diesel… </p>
      <p>If there is no carbon formation, there is no way to pre-ignite
        or detonate. </p>
      <p>If there is no need for an octane rating there is no need to
        refine the fuel… </p>

      <p><b>The Fish Carburetor Story</b> </p>
      <p>The Fish Carburetor was originally invented by John Robert Fish
        in America in the early Thirties. J.R. was not an automobile
        engineer but a brilliant all-round inventor with a strong grasp
        of pressure differentials and expertise in machine tooling. He
        was possibly the originator of the "Iron Lung" as he invented a
        "pressure bag" for his wife who appeared to suffer with serious
        circulation problems. The raising and lowering of the bag
        pressure apparently helped her greatly. 0n another occasion, Bob
        Fish cabled the President with instructions at great length on
        how a very simple pressure box could be lowered to rescue some
        sailors who were trapped in a sunken submarine! </p>
      <p><b>Carburetion Principles</b> </p>
      <p>When he came to look at carburetors initially, it was to stop
        the waste of fuel as it slopped about on cornering, braking and
        hard acceleration. All standard or conventional carburetors are
        entirely dependant on a stable fuel level to feed through the
        "Manometer" principle. He demonstrated the point by fitting a
        glass jug to the bonnet (hood) of a car. The level changed by
        literally inches on hard cornering. The typical four barrel
        carburetor of the time had float chambers almost all round the
        unit to prevent starvation but it was very wasteful on the high
        side of the float chamber. All conventional carburetors still
        use the "Manometer" or "U" tube principle today and rely on a
        Venturi to accelerate the incoming air so dropping the pressure
        which then lifts the fuel level through the jetting.
        Unfortunately, this tends to strangle the engine at higher revs.
        Fuel of course has a much higher inertia than air so jetting has
        to be much richer at low speeds (air velocity) which means that
        when the fuel finally catches up with the air flow, it would be
        chronically over-rich requiring it to be corrected by an "air
        corrector jet" to bleed down the over-rich main jet. </p>
      <p>Small carburetors suit bottom-end flexibility, response and
        fuel consumption but not top-end power which then requires a
        larger or multi-carburetor set-up that in turn produces poor
        fuel consumption and flexibility. Bob Fish produced a carburetor
        that entirely eliminated these compromises as: </p>
      <p>· Fuel level was not critical to metering under any conditions.
        <br>
        · No Venturi was required to potentially strangle the air flow.
        <br>
        · A single progressive metering groove did away with both main
        and corrector jets, as well the Venturi. <br>
        · The carb works on pressure differential - not air speed, which
        means that it is almost instantly self adjusting &amp; self
        compensating so any change in weather or altitude requires no
        adjustments or modifications as with conventional carbs. Hence
        all round suitability for cars, boats, aircraft, mountain or
        pressure charging use. <br>
        · Instead of the usual one main fuel discharge point within the
        carburetor, the "Fish" has from SIX to TEN leading to vastly
        superior atomization and therefore much improved vaporization
        and since wet fuel DOES NOT burn (only the vapor), better and
        more complete combustion is ensured enabling more power to be
        extracted from the same amount of fuel. <br>
        · Result - again LESS WASTE! </p>
      <p><b>The Struggle</b> </p>
      <p>The "Fish" was seen as a very serious threat to the "Original
        Equipment" establishment and could not be tolerated. J.R.
        suffered years of dirty tricks and persecution in an attempt to
        put him and his carburetor out of business. He even had his mail
        stopped on trumped up charges which were entirely UNTRUE and the
        case never went to court. It was simply a deliberate time
        wasting exercise to stop his cash flow and ruin him. He was not
        to be beaten and moved to Florida where he kept going by selling
        carbs to individuals including some wealthy big game fishermen
        which enabled them to reach and return from their fishing
        grounds much quicker so having more time to actually fish (no
        pun intended!) and increase their catch potential. </p>

          the Seabreeze bridge</i> <br>
        <i>Picture Courtesy of Orlando Boni www.Boni.com/fish</i> </p>
      <p>At about the same time an up-and-coming local Stock Car driver
        got involved. The famous and almost legendary "Fireball Roberts"
        who drove the original M-1 car and carburetor in place of the
        big 4 barrel "Works" carbs. He literally left them standing with
        his otherwise out-of-date car. His epic performances must have
        helped put Daytona Beach race track on the map. In those days,
        it was partly on the road and partly on the beach itself! The
        "Works" organizations did not like it one bit and again the
        "dirty tricks" started. "Fireball Roberts" frequently made Pole
        Position and gained the trophy. Repeatedly, however, his race
        tires developed "mysterious problems" when leading the race
        convincingly. These "faults" suspiciously did not seem to occur
        in the "Works" cars. - It would seem that the Fish Carb could
        not be allowed to succeed either on the track or commercially. </p>
      <p><b>The Revival</b> </p>
      <p>In the early Fifties, one of J.R.'s many backers, a Canadian by
        the name of Eric Liebman of "Fish Canadian Carburetors" from
        Willowdale, Ontario, talked J.R. into producing a "sleeved down"
        M 1 called the SM (Small Medium) and adapt it to the growing
        tuning market for VW Beetles. This helped the factory's
        financial situation for a while. Then in return for his
        considerable ongoing financial backing, J.R. granted Eric
        Liebman exclusive "rights" to the Northern States, Canada and
        the rest of the World. Bob Henderson first met Eric Liebman in
        1956 and was granted a Dealership for part of Canada. In 1959,
        Bob Henderson returned to the U.K. with a few samples for his
        friends to try out. The interest was considerable and an
        unexpected business then took off. </p>
      <p>The Americans could not keep up with the UK demand so Eric
        Liebman granted Bob Henderson his "rest of the World" rights
        with a view to being supplied back with carbs from the new
        production of further improved models. Bob Henderson was granted
        improvement patents for the "Minnow Fish" (small fish) versions
        and obtained registered trade marks for the name MINNOW and the
        Fish device itself. </p>
