      <b>Abstract: </b>The aim of this work is to demonstrate that the
      physicochemical properties of water depend on its electric charge
      (potential). It is also shown that the physico-chemical properties
      of aqueous solutions depend very much on the electric charge
      (potential) of the water on which these solutions are prepared.<br>

      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Michaels and Hill found that the direction of reversible
      oxidation-reduction modifications of phenazines is determined by
      the electrical potential of the aqueous medium: in a medium with a
      positive electrical potential, the phenazines become oxidized, and
      in a medium with a negative electrical potential, into a reduced
      state [1, 2]. Consequently, when studying the interactions between
      phenazines and DNA, we had to use both water with different
      electrical potential and aqueous solutions prepared on water with
      different electrical potential [3]. As a result of this approach,
      it was found that many properties of water depend significantly on
      its electrical potential; It was also found that the properties of
      aqueous solutions depend on the electrical potential of the water
      used for their preparation. Here are examples of this
      relationship.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Material and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      First, it is necessary to define the terminology used. The term
      "uncharged water" is used to determine the water that was used as
      a control: it is assumed that the electric potential of this water
      is 0 mV.<br>
      <br>
      Uncharged water was obtained during storage of distilled water in
      closed aluminum containers: It is considered that in such
      circumstances, the electric charges of water are concentrated on
      the outer surface of the container [4].<br>
      Water with a positive electrical potential was obtained in two
      ways:<br>
      (a) By passing through uncharged water of gaseous oxygen.<br>
      (b) By filtration of uncharged water through the silica gel. <br>
      It is known that when in contact with water, oxygen gas exhibits
      the properties of a sorbent of aqueous electrons, and the silica
      gel exhibits the properties of a sorbent of aqueous hydroxyl ions
      [5].<br>
      <br>
      Water with a negative electric potential was also obtained in two
      ways:<br>
      <br>
      (a) By passing through uncharged water of gaseous hydrogen.<br>
      (b) By filtration of uncharged water through the activated carbon.<br>
      It is known that when in contact with water, hydrogen gas is the
      electron donor, and activated carbon exhibits the properties of a
      sorbent of aqueous hydrogen ions [5].<br>
      Water with the required electrical potential was obtained in two
      ways:<br>
      (a) By varying the depth of the layer of sorbent through which
      filtered water is discharged.<br>
      (b) Varying the time during which the gas passed through the
      uncharged water.<br>
      <br>
      The electric potential of the charged water was measured with
      respect to uncharged water, the potential of which was
      conditionally assumed equal to 0 mV. In fact, the electric
      potential of charged water was measured as the flow potential or
      as the filtration potential [6]...<br>
      <br>
      <i>Figure 2. Left: When water with a negative charge flows through
        a narrow crack, it twisted clockwise. Right: When water with a
        positive charge flows through a narrow crack, it twisted
        counterclockwise [8]</i><br>
      <br>
      Further studies have shown that the electric potential of water
      can determine not only its spectral properties. Thus, it was
      established that the electrical potential of water flowing from a
      narrow gap determines the direction of its rotation: the flow of
      negatively charged water rotates clockwise (Figure 2, left), and
      the flow of positively charged water is twisted counterclockwise
      (Figure 2, right) [8].<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that this difference is observed in the
      Northern Hemisphere, where the vertical component of the
      geomagnetic field is directed downwards. It should be also
      recalled that a similar difference in the direction of rotation of
      charged particles moving along the magnetic field used in the mass
      spectrograph to determine the sign of the electric charge of the
      particles [4, 9].<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.4. Rotation of Aqueous Solutions Flowing Through a Narrow Gap
      </b><br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted that when flowing out of a narrow gap,
      aqueous solutions of surface-inactive substances rotate clockwise
      (this is <br>
      like water with a negative potential), and aqueous solutions of
      surfactants rotate counter-clockwise (this is like water with a
      positive potential). Such a difference in the rotation of aqueous
      solutions can be explained by the fact that during storage,
      surface-inactive substances sorb negative charges... &amp;c...<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.5. UV Absorption of DNA Solutions Prepared on Water with
        Different Electrical Potential</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In the course of further spectral studies it was found that the UV
      absorption of aqueous DNA is significantly dependent on the
      electric charge (potential) of the water used&nbsp; (Figure 3)
      [7].<br>
      <br>
      The last result obviously allowed to assume that the electric
      charge (potential) of water affects not only the UV absorption of
      water DNA, but also its state. ..<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.6. Saline Solutions Prepared on Water with Different Electric
        Charge (Potential)</b><br>
      <br>
      In a number of studies, it was found that the shape of the
      crystals that are formed when the salt solutions dry out is
      uniquely dependent on the electric charge (potential) of the water
      on which such solutionwere prepared.<br>
      <br>
      It has been particularly found that the evaporation of solutions
      with positive electric potential is accompanied by the formation
      of cubic crystals (Figure 4, left) and the evaporation of
      solutions with negative electric potential is accompanied by the
      formation of needle-like crystals (Figure 4, right) [10, 11].<br>
      <br>
      <i>Figure 4. KH 2 PO 4 crystals. Left: the rhombic crystals formed
        upon drying of an aqueous solution of KH 2 PO 4 prepared on the
        water with positive electric potential. Right: the needle-shaped
        crystals formed upon drying of an aqueous solution of KH 2 PO 4
        prepared on the water with negative electric potential [10, 11].</i><i><br>
      </i><i><br>
      </i><i>Figure 5. This is the powder of metallic copper at the
        boundary of aqueous solutions with positive (above) and negative
        (below) potentials.</i><i><br>
      </i><i>It should be also noted that these dependences are observed
        not only for the salt crystals, but for some of the metals
        (Figure 5).</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Based on the latest results, it can be assumed that the electric
      potential of water determines its internal structure, which can be
      manifested through the form of substances, both dissolved in water
      (Figure 4) and contacting it (Figure 5). It seems quite likely
      that different internal water structures are reflected in the type
      of spectra obtained, in particular – on the spectra of aqueous DNA
      (Figures 1, 3).<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.7. The Surface Tension of the Electrified Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      These results stimulated further studies aimed at elucidation of
      the properties of water and aqueous solutions, which depend on the
      electric potential. During these studies it was particularly found
      that the surface tension of the water clearly depends on its
      electrical potential: an increase in the positive electric
      potential of water is accompanied by an increase in its surface
      tension and increase the negative electrical potential of the
      water is accompanied by a decrease of its surface tension [11].<br>
      <br>
      The existence of such dependencies can be demonstrated through
      some simple experiments. So, if to pour 5 ml of water (exactly!)
      with a negative potential in a standard Petri dish and mix, you
      can see that the water completely covers the bottom of a Petri
      dish (Figure 6, left). On the other hand, if to pour 5 ml of water
      (exactly!) with a positive potential in a standard Petri dish and
      mix, you can see that such water will not cover all the bottom of
      a Petri dish (Figure 6, right).<br>
      <br>
      Such a distinction clearly demonstrates that the forces acting on
      the surface of the water depends on its electric potential. It can
      be explained by the fact that water with a positive potential has
      a greater surface tension than water with negative potential.<br>

      It is shown that the state and properties of aqueous DNA depend on
      the electric potential of the surrounding water. It is
      particularly shown that water with a positive potential much more
      actively hydrates DNA than water with negative potential. Since
      the electric potential of tissue fluids determines the degree of
      hydration of DNA, i.e. its state, it can be considered as an
      epigenetic factor.<br>

      </b><b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b>It&nbsp; is&nbsp; known&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      evaporation&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; female&nbsp; body&nbsp;
      liquids&nbsp; is&nbsp; accompanied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the&nbsp;
      formation&nbsp; of&nbsp; crystals&nbsp; of&nbsp; different&nbsp;
      shapes.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is&nbsp; also known that the shape of these
      crystals depends on the stage of the&nbsp; menstrual&nbsp;
      cycle:&nbsp; cubic&nbsp; or&nbsp; rhombic&nbsp; crystals&nbsp;
      are&nbsp; formed&nbsp; before and after the stage of ovulation;
      arbor-shape crystals are formed in the ovulation step (Figure 1)
      [1].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>It was previously shown that the electric potential of
      biological liquids of the female body correlated with the stages
      of the menstrual cycle: these liquids have a negative potential at
      the stage of ovulation, but the positive potential on the phases
      before and after ovulation. It was also shown that the electric
      potential of the water determines its surface tension, as well as
      its ability to hydrate the polysaccharides. On the basis of
      obtained results it is concluded that the electrical potential of
      the body liquids of women, and is the surface tension and the
      ability to hydrate the polysaccharides of these liquids, can be
      cyclically varied during the menstrual cycle. It is demonstrated
      that the use of these ratios allows influencing the processes of
      reproduction and increasing the efficiency of cloning.<br>

        Abstract<br>
      </b>It was shown previously that the shape of the crystals formed
      during the evaporation of salt solutions depends on the sign of
      the electric potential of such solutions. It has been particularly
      found that the evaporation of salt solutions with positive
      electric potential is accompanied by the formation of cubic
      crystals and the evaporation of salt solutions with negative
      electric potential is accompanied by the formation of needle-like
      crystals. The obtained results stimulated further studies of the
      properties of water and aqueous solutions, which depend on the
      electric potential. During these studies it was found that the
      surface tension of the water clearly depends on its electrical
      potential: an increase in the positive electric potential of water
      is accompanied by an increase in its surface tension and increase
      the negative electrical potential of the water is accompanied by a
      decrease of its surface tension. It was also discovered that the
      electrical potential of the water determines its ability to
      hydrate the polymers of biological origin. It is shown that water
      with a positive potential is better hydrates biological polymers
      than water with negative potential.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Due to the daily rotation of the Earth the lower layers of earth's
      atmosphere are continuously crossed by horizontal lines of the
      geomagnetic field. For this reason, near the earth's surface there
      is an upward-directed Lorentz force. Under the action of this
      force the positively charged objects move upward and the negative
      charges down. As a result, this force can increase the lift of
      flying objects that have a positive charge: water vapor, birds,
      insects, airplanes and space rockets. In addition, the action of
      the upward directed Lorentz force blocks the deflection of the
      racket's body in the horizontal direction, that is, ensures its
      equilibrium.<br>
