      </div>
      <br>
      By NEA Service Denver -- Speeds from 800 to 1000 miles an hour are
      seen possible through the use of a new device, the "gyradoscope",
      to replace the propeller of an airplane, according to the inventor
      of the attachment, Edgar R. Holmes.<br>
      <br>
      Holmes asserts that the gyradoscope will double the power thrust
      of the conventional-type motor and increase air speed of the
      ordinary plane more than 200 miles an hour without altering the
      present construction of plane or engine.<br>
      <br>
      He hopes to reach from 800 to 1000 miles an hour by special
      designing of motor and the plane itself.<br>

            Airship<br>

      </b>WHAT is certainly the most unique airship in the world is now
      under construction in the form of an experimental model in the
      factory of its inventor in Denver, Colorado. As depicted on these
      pages, the extraordinary ship will use neither propellers nor gas
      to keep it in the air, but will depend on a mechanism which its
      inventor, Edgar R. Holmes, calls the “gyradoscope”. <br>
      <br>
      Each horsepower of gyradoscope is expected to lift 1,000 pounds
      vertically in midair and sustain the load at any desired elevation
      by regulating the speed, and the inventor expects a machine
      weighing 2,000 pounds to lift 500 tons. <br>
      <br>
      Briefly, the gyradoscope combines gyroscopic action with
      centrifugal force. As described in the prospectus of the company,
      the gyradoscope consists of two wheels rotating in opposite
      directions in the same plane. Each wheel has several weights, the
      arms of which are connected to eccentrics on each wheel, which
      propel the weights in opposite directions in such a way that a
      lifting effect is exerted when the weights are at the top point of
      travel. <br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanism by which this effect is produced is somewhat
      obscure, but a model of the device already built has been bolted
      to the floor of a freight elevator, it is claimed, and succeeded
      in raising and lowering it with ease. In this test a 20-horsepower
      gasoline engine furnished power. <br>
      <br>
      Lifting force exerted by the gyradoscope is likened to that of a
      ball thrown on the end of a string. The weight of the ball at the
      moment it draws the string taut exerts a lifting effect on a
      pencil or other object to which the bottom of the string may be
      tied. In the gyradoscope the moving weights on the wheels are
      analogous to the thrown ball. To a casual scrutiny the whole idea
      seems very much like lifting one’s self by one’s boot straps, but
      the success attained with models indicates that the inventor may
      be successful in developing an entirely new type of aircraft. <br>
      <br>
      Forward motion is to be supplied by a gyradoscope in horizontal
      plane, and steering will be accomplished by a similar mechanism.
      In case of accident to the lifting gyros, which would result in
      the ship’s dropping like a plummet, auxiliary machines are
      provided which are kept running at idling speed ready to be called
      upon in an emergency. <br>
      <br>
      Four hydraulic landing feet, one on each corner of the ship,
      absorb the shock of landing, which is expected to be insignificant
      since rate of descent is controlled by speed of the gyradoscope. <br>
      <br>
      Mr. Holmes, inventor of the gyro-ship, also has the invention of a
      popular front wheel drive for autos to his credit, as well as a
      four wheel drive and a caloric steam engine. This latter machine
      would supply the power for the airship. As developed by Mr Holmes,
      waste heat from oil combustion is used in the caloric engine to
      convert water into steam, which drives a turbine, and is then
      condensed to be used over again.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>The American Gyro 'Gyradoscope'
            Inertial Flyer</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Above is a picture of the Gyradoscope unit that American Gyro
      company is now building and which it expects to have completed in
      the very near future.<br>
      <br>
      A - Is the Gyradoscope<br>
      B - The Gyro Amplifier or transmission<br>
      C - An ordinary gasoline engine<br>
      D - The base or floor of the Gyro Ship<br>
      <br>
      This working model of the Gyradoscope, which is 20 inches in
      diameter and 14 inches in width, is designed to lift and sustain
      in Mid-Air, a load of approximately 3,000 pounds with 3 HP applied
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      The machine has two large Gyro wheels that revolve in opposite
      directions at about 3,000 RPM, or a rim speed of more than 2 miles
      per minute.<br>
      <br>
      In the machine are twelve 7 pound weights, each of which travels
      from the center to the periphery or rim of the gyro wheels at each
      revolution of the wheels.<br>
      <br>
      Thus each weight is traveling two miles per minute in one instant,
      and the next instant or half revolution of the wheel, it is only
      traveling some 300 feet per minute.<br>
      <br>
      The difference in the velocity of these weights traveling between
      the high and low points of rotative speed, together with the
      gyroscopic action of the Gyro wheels, creates the force that is
      controlled and directed. A brief explanation of the Gyro Amplifier
      is given on the opposite page.<br>
      <br>
      The exact mechanism by which this effect is produced is somewhat
      obscure, but a model of the device already built has been bolted
      to the floor of a freight elevator, it is claimed, and succeeded
      in raising and lowering it with ease. In this test a 20-horsepower
      gasoline engine furnished power.<br>
      <br>
      Lifting force exerted by the gyradoscope is likened to that of a
      ball thrown on the end of a string. The weight of the ball at the
      moment it draws the string taut exerts a lifting effect on a
      pencil or other object to which the bottom of the string may be
      tied. In the gyradoscope the moving weights on the wheels are
      analogous to the thrown ball.<br>
      <br>
      To a casual scrutiny the whole idea seems very much like lifting
      one’s self by one’s boot straps, but the success attained with
      models indicates that the inventor may be successful in developing
      an entirely new type of aircraft. <br>
      <br>
      Forward motion is to be supplied by a gyradoscope in horizontal
      plane, and steering will be accomplished by a similar mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to the posted ebay item for $50.00, they write;
      "Lot contains the contents of two offers from The American Gyro
      Company, discussing its inventions related to automobile and
      aviation performance, and soliciting stock orders from the public
      at one cent a share! The contents of each include lengthy sales
      letters extolling the company's Gyradoscope ("the answer to the
      problems of rapidly transporting great burdens through the air").<br>
      <br>
      Mention is also made of The Caloric Steam Engine, the Gyro
      Amplifier and the Holmes Twin Shot Dieselator, a spark plug. A
      brochure is included about the last mentioned product.
      Testimonials about the Dieselator are included on a separate page.
      A subscription blank for ordering the one cent stock is also
      enclosed.<br>
      <br>
      The second offer enclosed an illustration/diagram of the
      Gyradoscope and Gyro Amplifyer, which was designed to lift and
      sustain in mid-air, a load of approximately 3,000 pounds with 3
      H.P. applied energy. It is described in some detail. On the
      reverse is a detailed description of the Gyro Amplifier, "an
      automatic self-contained automobile transmission that is gearless,
      frictionless and has no clutch."<br>
      <br>
      There is very little information available about these products.
      However, the company did produce a most unusual aircraft, the
      Shelton AG-4 Crusader, c1935 (see illustration).<br>
      <br>
      Only one was ever produced, the company going bankrupt c1938. The
      plans for the plane were sold to Timm Aircraft, <br>
      <br>
      but there was no further development of the craft. Thomas Miles
      Shelton worked for the American Gyro Company as an engineer and
      was the principal designer of the Crusader.<br>

      <br>
      ATTENTION Ladies and Gentlemen: Once more and finally I would like
      to bring to your notice and the enormous and immense consideration
      the great assets, merits, and wonderful possibilities of American
      Gyro Company, Inc. American Gyro has been incorporated
      approximately only three years, with five revolutionary and
      absolutely new inventions as its assets from the start, which have
      grown to eight inventions at the present time, and has increased
      from four hundred original stockholders to eight thousand. Five of
      these eight inventions, each and every one of them separately
      would be big enough to form and constitute a great industrial
      concern in itself, but those eight combined which form American
      Gyro have been and are now growing, right at the present, in the
      midst of the greatest depression ever known, with amazing speed,
      into one of the greatest, if not the very greatest, industrial
      giants ever recorded in the annals of commerce. What American Gyro
      has accomplished in the last three years, since its inception, is
      really and truly marvelous and startling. Come and see and I will
      show you. I have been connected with American Gyro for two years
      and a half and have all the data concerning the same on my finger
      tips. The first of the three Inventions on the market now is the
      American Gyro Cartridge-Fire Spark-Plug. It is a wonder without
      compare. Saves in the first place from forty to fifty per cent,
      gasoline, and is by actual test five times as efficient in every
      respect as the very best spark plug up to date in use. American
      Gyro Cartridge-Fire Spark-Plug was entered into the Labor Day
      Races, made forty successive trips up to Pikes Peak and back, each
      trip in nineteen minutes or less and each trip of twelve miles,
      and was found as perfect at the finish as at the start, whereas
      the best spark-pliug en the market up to date could negotiate the
      same round trip to Pikes Peak but once and in very rare cases
      twice. There is a market in the United States alone for three
      hundred million spark-plugs every year, and .American Gyro is
      protected with patents for all eight inventions throughout the
      world. I handle the spark-plug right here in Fairbanks, Come and
      see them for yourselves. Immediately after the Pike's Peak races
      the great Superiority of the A.G. Cartridge Fire Spark Pulg was
      again demonstrated in the terrific run against time from Denver,
      Colorado to Los Angeles, Calif. in a blinding snowstorm over the
      Sierra' Nevada Mountains and back to Denver again, 2824 miles
      driving time in 2726 minutes officially checked and sealed by
      Western Union—and after arrivel in Denver and seal broken it was
      found spark plugs were perfectly clean and practically n as good
      z. condition as before the start — good for any thousands of miles
      of usage. I gladly will show photographs of both Pkes Peak and
      Denver—Los Angeles races to anyone who may care to see them at my
      place at the Riverside Hotel. The Gyradoscope, the greatest
      invention of them all, ever conceived and accomplished by man, was
      only proven and perfected in the • last nine months. With only two
      segments or one unit in the gyro plane it will transport six and a
      half tons of pay load from Los Angeles to New York in
      approximately eight hours, which event is scheduled to happen and
      be accomplished in the latter part of coming August, and the same
      Gyradoscope, in multiplied number of units, combined with the
      rocket principle, in the real Gyro ship, without wings and no
      outside propeller, which will be called into being by American
      Gyro. Company in the near future and which will be the greatest
      gift ever presented to mankind, will transport in one ship load
      thousands of pas' sengers and tons of freight, with undreamed and
      unheard of speed, around the world, in less than a day. Space
      forbids to mention the other six great inventions..<br>
