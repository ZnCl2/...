            <br>

      <br>
      Queensland University of Technology (QUT) researchers have
      developed new technology capable of removing radioactive material
      from contaminated water and aiding clean-up efforts following
      nuclear disasters.<br>
      <br>
      The innovation could also solve the problem of how to clean up
      millions of tonnes of water contaminated by dangerous radioactive
      material and safely store the concentrated waste.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Huai-Yong Zhu from QUT Chemistry said the world-first
      intelligent absorbent, which uses<span style="font-weight: bold;">
        titanate nanofibre </span>and nanotube technology, differed
      from current clean-up methods, such as layered clays and zeolites,
      because it could efficiently lock in deadly radioactive material
      from contaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      The used absorbents can then be safely disposed without the risk
      of leakage, even if the material became wet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"One gram of the nanofibres can
        effectively purify at least one tonne of polluted water,"</span>
      Professor Zhu said.<br>
      <br>
      "This saves large amounts of dangerous water needing to be stored
      somewhere and also prevents the risk of contaminated products
      leaking into the soil."<br>
      <br>
      The technology, which was developed in collaboration with the
      Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and
      Pennsylvania State University in America, works by running the
      contaminated water through the fine nanotubes and fibres, which
      trap the radioactive Cesium (Cs+) ions through a structural
      change.<br>
      <br>
      "Every year we hear of at least one nuclear accident. Not only is
      there a risk of contamination where human error is concerned, but
      there is also a risk from natural disasters such as what we saw in
      Japan this year," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Zhu and his research team believed the technology would
      also benefit industries as diverse as mining and medicine.<br>
      <br>
      By adding<span style="font-weight: bold;"> silver oxide
        nanocrystals to the outer surface, the nanostructures are able
        to capture and immobilise radioactive iodine (I-) ions</span>
      used in treatments for thyroid cancer, in probes and markers for
      medical diagnosis, as well as found in leaks of nuclear accidents.<br>
      <br>
      "It is our view that just taking the radioactive material in the
      adsorbents isn't good enough. We should make it safe before
      disposing it," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "The same goes for Australian sites where we mine nuclear
      products. We need a solution before we have a problem, rather than
      looking for fixes when it could be too late."<br>
      <br>
      With a growing need to find alternatives to meet global energy
      needs, Professor Zhu said now was the time to put safeguards in
      place.<br>
      <br>
      "In France, 75 per cent of electricity is produced by nuclear
      power and in Belgium, which has a population of 10 million people
      there are six nuclear power stations," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Even if we decide that nuclear energy is not the way we want to
      go, we will still need to clean-up what's been produced so far and
      store it safely," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "Australia is one of the largest producers of titania that are the
      raw materials used for fabricating the absorbents of titanate
      nanofibres and nanotubes. Now with the knowledge to produce the
      adsorbents, we have the technology to do the cleaning up for the
      world."<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to substantially ceramic filters,
      and more particularly to metal oxide nanofibre filters.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ceramics have found a wide range of uses in today's society. They
      have applications in the aerospace, medical, military and
      communications industries. This versatility is due to their unique
      properties. Ceramic materials are very stable chemically,
      thermally and mechanically, and in addition are frequently
      bio-inert. Ceramic materials are generally porous and this means
      they can be very useful as filters.<br>
      <br>
      Simply, the medium to be filtered flows through the channels of
      the filter carrier and particles are retained if their size
      exceeds the diameter of the filter pores. The filtrate permeates
      through the pores and can then be subjected to subsequent process
      stages. Ceramic materials are used as filters in the water and air
      purification, pharmaceutical, dairy, radioactive materials
      processing and chemical industries. Particularly important
      applications of this technology are in wastewater processing, as
      air filters in breathing equipment and in filtration of drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Every day, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people worldwide die from
      diseases caused by contaminated water. Ceramic filters with
      nano-sized pores which are capable of removing species larger than
      60 nm have great importance as a potential solution to this
      tragedy. Filters of this selectivity allow the removal of bacteria
      and many pathogenic viruses from our water supply, air supply and
      even from our blood. The recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      (SARS) and 'bird flu' epidemics resulted in many deaths and in
      affected areas people sought protection by the use of respiratory
      masks which were capable of filtering out the virus. These viruses
      fall into the 80-200 nm range.<br>
      <br>
      Already, ceramic microfilters and nanofilters are routinely used
      in most developed countries to clean wastewater before discharge.
      The biggest advantages of ceramic filters over others, such as
      polymer filters, are better corrosion resistance, ability to
      withstand leaching and higher mechanical stability, all of which
      result in long operation lifetimes. Normal filtration at low
      temperature using organic filters causes fouling that has to be
      removed periodically. Steam cleaning is one way to remove it but
      is not possible without damaging the polymer filters. The ability
      of ceramic filters to withstand temperatures as high as
      500&lt;0&gt;C means they are much easier to clean and thereby
      regenerate. The use of chemicals to remove fouling is also
      problematic for organic polymer filters because, unlike ceramic
      filters, they are not chemically inert.<br>
      <br>
      Ceramic filters are typically produced through the sol-gel method
      which is well known in the art. In this method, the inorganic
      precursors go through the formation of a colloidal suspension
      (sol) and gelation of the sol to form a network in a continuous
      liquid phase (gel). At the functional group level, three reactions
      are generally used to describe the sol-gel process: hydrolysis,
      alcohol condensation, and water condensation. The support layer is
      generally thin and has a pore size of 1 [mu]m while the uppermost
      layer has a pore size in the nanometre range. Typical materials
      used to create porous filters employing the sol gel process are
      alkoxysilanes, alumina (AI2O3), titania (TiO2), silica (SiO2),
      zirconia (ZrO2) and mixed oxides. One of the drawbacks of the sol
      gel method is that the control of pore size is often difficult due
      to formation of irregular shaped particles. Pinholes and cracks
      can also appear in the top layer during the drying phase. This
      means that many sol particle layers may have to be put down to
      achieve effective filtration. This increases the mean pore length
      through which the filtrate must pass and so, as mentioned above,
      results in a greatly decreased flux. Low porosity and the presence
      of dead end pores which cannot contribute to filtration are also
      common problems. It is currently extremely difficult to obtain
      porous ceramic filters with both good selectivity and a
      sufficiently large filtration flux. Tepper et al, US patent
      6,838,005, teaches the use of aluminium hydroxide fibres to form a
      composite filter to remove nano size viruses and other
      particulates from drinking water and other fluids. The filter is
      formed from an alumina sol mulched with glass microfibers. The
      resulting filter can suffer from the weaknesses described above
      for sol gel produced filters. The use of the glass is an attempt
      to compensate for the mechanical weakness of the filter. They
      found that attempts to double the thickness of the alumina filter
      resulted in a halving of the flow rate which means that a trade
      off must be made between the mechanical strength of the filter and
      the flow rates which can be achieved. WO 1998/21164 employs a
      functionally gradient ceramic structure as a substrate in a
      ceramic filter and teaches a method of producing said filter. Two
      surfaces are provided with a decreasing pore size between the two.
      Again this filter is synthesised starting from a colloidal
      suspension of ceramic particles. The control over the pore size in
      the resulting filter provided by this method is poor and the
      layers produced are relatively thick. This results in a decreased
      rate of flux and poor separation.<br>
      <br>
      WO 2007/054040 teaches the use of a number of polymeric nanofibres
      to produce a filter for removing biological and physical
      impurities. The disadvantages of polymeric nanofilters compared to
      ceramic nanofilters are well known and include shorter operational
      lifetimes, lower stability to varying temperatures, problems with
      swelling in various solvents and greater difficulty in introducing
      surface modifications.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</span> <br>
      <br>
      The object of the invention is to overcome or at least alleviate
      one or more of the above problems and to provide for substantially
      ceramic nanofilters which possess high selectivity and are also
      capable of good filtration rates.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;In a first aspect, although it need not be the only or
      indeed the broadest form, the invention resides in a substantially
      ceramic nanofilter comprising:<br>
      <br>
      (a) a porous substrate;<br>
      <br>
      (b) one or more intermediate layers of nanofibre non-woven meshes
      coated onto the substrate; and (c) a top layer of nanofibre
      non-woven mesh coated onto the upper surface of the one or more
      intermediate layers, wherein the pore sizes of the nanofibre
      non-woven meshes decrease in each consecutive layer to a desired
      minimum size in the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      In a second aspect the invention resides in a process for
      generating a metal oxide nanofibre non-woven mesh including the
      steps of:<br>
      <br>
      (a) suspending nanofibres of metal oxides in an aqueous, alcohol
      or acetone solution to form a suspension; (b) treating the
      suspension to make it homogeneous;<br>
      <br>
      (c) coating the suspension onto a substrate;<br>
      <br>
      (d) drying the coating in air; and<br>
      <br>
      (e) calcining the coating to produce the non-woven mesh.
      Advantageously, the metal oxides of the second aspect may be
      selected from a wide range of suitable metal oxides such as
      aluminium oxides, titanium oxides, zinc oxides, rare earth oxides,
      copper oxides and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In a third aspect, the invention resides in a process for
      producing a substantially ceramic nanofilter including the steps
      of: (a) coating a porous substrate with a first layer of
      nanofibres wherein the length of the nanofibres is greater than
      the pore size of the substrate;<br>
      <br>
      (b) coating the first layer of nanofibres with a second layer of
      nanofibres wherein the length of the nanofibres in the second
      layer is greater than the pore size of the first layer; and<br>
      <br>
      (c) repeating the process of coating a new layer of nanofibres on
      top of the uppermost layer until the desired number of layers is
      achieved, wherein the length of the nanofibres in the new layer is
      greater than the pore size of the uppermost layer, to thereby
      produce a substantially ceramic nanofilter.<br>
      <br>
      Further features of the present invention will become apparent
      from the following detailed description. The term nanofibres will
      be used in this specification when discussing the suspensions of
      metal oxides being used to generate the non-woven meshes of the
      nanofilter. It should be understood that this also includes
      nanorods, nanotubes, nanobelts and the like which are formed by
      certain of the metal oxides discussed herein.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout this specification, unless the context requires
      otherwise, the words "comprise", "comprises" and "comprising" will
      be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group
      of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of
      integers.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The present inventors have developed a method of creating
      substantially ceramic nanofilters by generating metal oxide
      nanofibre non- woven meshes. These non-woven meshes can be created
      to give pore sizes of diminishing diameters simply by the choice
      of the ceramic nanofibres used. The mesh layers are continuously
      constructed one on top of the other, layer upon layer, starting on
      a porous substrate base, to give nanofilters which have a
      filtration ability based on the pore size of the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that while the pore size generally
      diminishes in going from the porous substrate, through the one or
      more intermediate layers to the top layer, each nanofibre
      non-woven mesh which is put down does not necessarily have a
      smaller pore size than the one directly below it.<br>
      <br>
      This is because each of the one or more intermediate layers may be
      made up of a number of sub-layers e.g. three sub-layers of
      titanate nanofibres laid down one on top of the other. Likewise
      the top layer may consist of a number of sub-layers e.g. three
      sub-layers of [gamma]-alumina nanofibres.<br>
      <br>
      The one or more sub-layers within the one or more intermediate
      layers and top layer, will often be produced using the same
      suspension of nanofibres and so the pore sizes of each individual
      sub-layer being coated down are the same and all contribute to the
      filtration ability of the intermediate and/ortop layers. Each
      intermediate layer and the top layer will, therefore, often
      contain more than one sub-layer of nanofibre non-woven mesh. As
      stated previously however, the pore size will decrease in going
      from the substrate through to each of the one or more intermediate
      layers and, finally, to the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      The term "layer" will, therefore, be used herein to describe a
      distinct section of the nanofilter i.e. individually, the one or
      more intermediate layers and the top layer. The term "sub-layer"
      will be used to describe each of the individual nanofibre
      non-woven meshes which are laid down to collectively form each
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiments described herein the nanofilter is constructed
      from a porous substrate onto which is coated one or more
      sub-layers of the same metal oxide nanofibre non-woven mesh, to
      form the intermediate layer. One or more sub-layers of a different
      metal oxide nanofibre non-woven mesh are then coated on top of
      this to form the top layer. However, it will be appreciated that
      it is possible, using the same process, to lay down a number of
      intermediate layers which may each comprise one or more sub-layers
      of the same or differing metal oxide nanofibre non-woven meshes.
      The use of a number of intermediate layers of different metal
      oxide nanofibres may be structurally or functionally useful to
      support the application of a top layer of metal oxide nanofibres
      of desired dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      It should be appreciated that the term "intermediate layer(s)" as
      used herein refers to the one or more layers the first of which is
      laid down upon the porous substrate i.e. they are located between
      the porous substrate and the top layer. Each of these one or more
      intermediate layers may be made up of one or more sub-layers of
      nanofibre non-woven mesh.<br>
      <br>
      The term "top layer" as used herein refers to the layer which is
      laid down on top of the uppermost intermediate layer. As referred
      to earlier the top layer may be made up of one or more sub-layers
      of nanofibre non-woven mesh.<br>
      <br>
      The term "titanate nanofibres" as used herein refers to hydrogen
      titanate nanofibres (H2TJaO7). It would be understood by a person
      of skill in the art that these nanofibres can be converted to
      TiO2(B) and anatase TiO2 nanofibres upon heating above
      approximately 300 &lt;0&gt;C. These fibres are useful for
      catalytic degradation of organic compounds using UV light. Other
      titanates such as sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7), which can be
      converted to Na2Ti6Oi3 upon heating above approximately 300
      &lt;0&gt;C, are also considered suitable to form metal oxide
      nano-fibre non-woven meshes but were not used in the particular
      examples herein which recite the use of "titanate nanofibres".<br>
      <br>
      FIG 1 is a composite Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) of a
      cross- sectional view of a ceramic nanofilter according to one
      embodiment of the present invention. Image (a) is a cross section
      through the nanofilter, exposing the layers used in its
      construction. The porous [alpha]-alumina substrate can be seen at
      the left of the image and coated onto its surface, forming the
      intermediate layer is the non-woven mesh of titanate nanofibres.
      The top layer, at the right hand side of the image is a non-woven
      mesh of [gamma]-alumina nanofibres. Image (b) is an SEM of the
      filter surface after the substrate has had one coating of a
      0.05-1.0 wt% titanate nanofibre suspension applied to it. Hydrogen
      titanate is particularly useful in the embodiments described as it
      bonds well to both the substrate and other metal oxide nanofibres.
      This image clearly shows the structure of the non-woven meshes of
      the present invention. Image (c) is an SEM of the filter surface
      after the substrate has had three coatings of a 0.05-1.0 wt%
      titanate nanofibre suspension applied to it, thereby demonstrating
      how the non-woven mesh intermediate layer has been built up from
      individual sub-layers in comparison to the single sub-layer in
      image (b). Image (d) is an SEM of the filter surface after the
      titanate intermediate layer has been coated with a 0.05-1.0 wt%
      suspension of AIO(OH) nanofibres. The decrease in pore size
      compared to the images of the titanate layer is clearly visible.<br>
      <br>
      FIG 2 shows a schematic representation, in part (a), of the
      substrate, intermediate and top layers of a ceramic nanofilter
      according to one embodiment of the present invention and relates
      each of these layers to actual electron micrograph images. Image
      (b) is an SEM of the surface of the substrate, in this case
      [alpha]-alumina, demonstrating a relatively loose organization of
      particles and indicating pore sizes in the micrometer range. Image
      (c) is a Transmission Electron Micrograph (TEM) of the titanate
      nanofibres. The non-woven mesh structure can be seen and the
      relative position of this layer in the construction of the
      nanofilter is indicated in the schematic (a). Finally, image (d)
      is a TEM of the AIO(OH) nanofibres which are converted into
      [gamma]-alumina nanofibres during subsequent calcinations, forming
      the top layer of the nanofilter. This image indicates how the non-
      woven mesh has formed pore sizes capable of nano-filtration.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable porous substrate should provide mechanical strength to
      the nanofilter and should have pore sizes sufficiently large to
      allow high flux but not so large as to prohibit the forming of a
      layer of nanofibres on its surface.<br>
      <br>
      Examples are porous glass, ZnO, [alpha]-alumina, Zr[theta]2,
      T[Iota]O2, aluminosilicate and other ceramics. Suitably, the
      substrate is [alpha]-alumina or porous glass. The substrate will
      have pore diameters of 1-20 [mu]m depending on the flux desired
      and the dimensions of the nanofibres chosen to be coated onto the
      surface of the substrate. In one form the substrate will have pore
      diameters of 5-18 [mu]m. Preferably, the substrate will have pore
      diameters of 10-16 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative embodiment the porous substrate is titanium
      micromesh. The pore size of the titanium micromesh will be between
      75 to<br>
      <br>
      150 [mu]m. Typically, the titanium micromesh pore size is between
      80 to 125 [mu]m. In a preferred embodiment the titanium micromesh
      pore size is about<br>
      <br>
      100 [mu]m. The thickness of the mesh will be in the order of 1 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a titanium micromesh as the porous substrate provides a
      number of advantages to the final nanofilter. It provides a
      framework which allows for a very high flow rate, has great
      mechanical strength and allows for excellent binding with
      nanofibres and nanotubes. The one or more intermediate layers and
      top layer of non-woven mesh metal oxide nanofibres can be laid
      down upon the micromesh substrate to generate a substantially
      ceramic nanofilter.<br>
      <br>
      The ceramic porous substrates e.g. alumina may be chemically
      treated to enhance adhesion with the intermediate layer of
      non-woven mesh nanofibres. Non-limiting examples are the treatment
      of the substrate surface with acid or caustic soda to bring about
      activation. This involves the generation of hydroxyl groups on the
      surface which aid in bonding with the intermediate layer in
      contact with the substrate during calcination. Advantageously, the
      surface of the substrate does not have to be made smooth as is
      required in some processes. This allows the use of a wider range
      of materials to act as the substrate and also reduces cost and
      time spent on preparation. Advantageously, the metal oxides of the
      present invention may be selected from a wide range of suitable
      metal oxides such as aluminium oxides, titanium oxides (FIG 12),
      cerium oxides (FIG 8), zinc oxides (FIG 10), rare earth oxides,
      copper oxides (FIG 9), boehmite, alumina, cerium oxide, titanate,
      zirconium dioxide, niobate, rare earth oxides and the like to
      produce non-woven meshes with differing pore sizes, thereby
      providing filtration selectivity. Figures 7-12 are a series of
      SEM's of different metal oxides in the form of nanofibres or
      nanorods which can be used to generate the non- woven meshes in
      the construction of a nanofilter. These images demonstrate some of
      the diversity available when selecting the metal oxide based on
      dimensions and inherent properties.<br>
      <br>
      The intermediate layer can be formed from a range of suitable
      metal oxide nanofibres. The material chosen will depend on the
      pore size of the substrate. Suitable nanofibres will have a length
      greater than the diameter of the substrates pores. The nanofibres
      selected for the intermediate layer will have good compatibility
      with biological systems i.e. non-toxic, photostable and no
      dissolution in water. In one embodiment of the present invention,
      the intermediate layer is constructed from titanate nanofibres.
      ZnO nanorods (FIG 10), niobate nanofibres (FIG 11) and rare earth
      nanorods (FIG 7, praseodymium oxide) with a length in the range
      1-10 [mu]m are further examples of materials suitable for use in
      the construction of this intermediate layer.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the intermediate layer nanofibres are
      coated with a substance which enables the ceramic filters to
      photocatalytically decompose organic or biological species such as
      viruses and bacteria. This may aid in clearing the pores and
      maintaining filtration functionality of the nanofilter. One
      non-limiting example of such a substance is the use of anatase
      CT[Iota]O2) nanocrystals. FIG 3 shows how these nanocrystals can
      be coated onto the surface of a titanate nanofibre. As was
      mentioned previously, the hydrogen titanate nanofibres themselves
      may also be converted by heating into TiOa(B) or anatase
      nanofibres which are both effective in photocatalytic
      decomposition or organic matter and biological species. Other
      suitable examples are the painting of a layer of In2O3ZTa2O5,
      anatase, rutile or TiO2(B) onto the chosen nanofibres to allow the
      decomposition of organic pollutants in water using visible light.<br>
      <br>
      The selected nanofibres are dispersed in a solution which is
      aqueous, acetone or an alcohol to form a suspension greater than
      0.001 wt%. Preferably, the suspension is 0.05-1.0 wt%. In a
      preferred embodiment, the suspension is 0.2 wt%. Suitably, the
      solution is ethanol, an ethanol/water mixture or acetone. The
      solution may already contain various additives such as are
      discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      Substances such as polyelectrolytes and the like may be present in
      the suspension to assist electrostatic self-assembly of the
      nanofibres. Surfactants may also be present to provide control
      over the viscosity of the coating suspension.<br>
      <br>
      The suspension may be treated to form a homogeneous suspension by
      a number of chemical and physical means. One such example is
      sonication. The suspension is then applied to the substrate. The
      suspension can be applied by a number of appropriate means such as
      are known in the art, for example, dip-coating and spin-coating.
      The coating process may be repeated a number of times resulting in
      a number of sub-layers of the same nanofibre being laid down and
      which together form the intermediate layer. This allows the
      desired filtration capacity to be achieved. The layer is then
      dried in air at 323-523 K followed by calcination at 523-973 K. A
      non-woven mesh of nanofibres is formed with pore sizes
      substantially smaller than those of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      The top layer of the filter can be formed from a number of
      suitable metal oxide nanofibres. The nanofibres are chosen so that
      their length is greater than the diameter of the pores of the
      intermediate layer. In one preferred embodiment, the nanofibres
      are boehmite (AIO(OH)) nanofibres. Small nanofibres of rare earth
      oxides, Zr[theta]2 and alumina nanofibres coated with other oxides
      are also suitable for forming the top layer. The metal oxide
      nanofibres used to generate the top layer will also be chosen
      based on the functionality required from the nanofilter, which is
      related to the pore sizes achieved. For example, if the purpose of
      the nanofilter is to filter out bacteria and viruses then metal
      oxides which achieve pore sizes in the range of about 30 nm to
      about 60 nm in the top layer would be suitable. If the application
      of the nanofilter is to separate biological substances such as DNA
      or chlorophyll then metal oxide nanofibres which result in pore
      sizes of approximately 10 nm would be chosen.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the nanofibres of the top layer will result in a
      non- woven mesh with pore sizes of 1-100 nm. Suitably, the top
      layer will have pore sizes of 5-80 nm. Normally the pore sizes of
      the top layer will be between 10-60nm.<br>
      <br>
      A number of metal oxide nanofibres are considered suitable for use
      in the nanofilter of the present invention. Some are particularly
      suitable for use in either the intermediate layer(s) or the top
      layer. It should be appreciated, however, that any metal oxide
      nanofibre may be useful in forming these layers and the particular
      one chosen will depend, in part, on the pore size of either the
      substrate (if laying down the nanofibre non-woven mesh directly
      upon this) or the last layer generated. The pore size the
      particular nanofibres form, their mechanical strength and desired
      functionality e.g. photocatalytic decomposers will all be taken
      into consideration when choosing the metal oxide nanofibres to
      form any one layer.<br>
      <br>
      The top layer is formed in a similar manner to the intermediate
      layer. The selected nanofibres are dispersed in acetone, an
      alcohol or an aqueous solution to form a suspension greater than
      0.001 wt%. Preferably, the suspension formed is between 0.01-5.0
      wt%. In a preferred embodiment, the suspension is 0.2 wt%. The
      suspension may be treated to form a homogeneous suspension by a
      number of chemical and physical means. One such example is
      sonication. In addition, substances such as polyelectrolytes and
      the like may be present in the suspension to assist electrostatic
      self-assembly of the nanofibres. Further, the suspension may
      contain non-ionic polymers such as poly(ethylene)oxide,
      poly(ethylene)glycol and other water soluble polymers, to aid in
      controlling the thickness of the top layer.<br>
      <br>
      The suspension is then applied on top of the intermediate layer
      and the solvent evaporated to leave a non-woven mesh of
      nanofibres. The suspension can be applied to the upmost
      intermediate layer by a number of appropriate means such as are
      known in the art, for example, dip-coating and spin-coating. The
      coating may be repeated a number of times resulting in a number of
      sub-layers. The resulting layer is then dried in air at between
      323-523 K followed by calcination at between 523-923 K. In one
      embodiment, when using boehmite nanofibres, a temperature of 393 K
      is used for drying in air and the calcination is carried out at
      723 K for 2h. During calcination the boehmite nanofibres are
      converted to [gamma]-alumina (AI2O3) nanofibres. The
      [gamma]-alumina nanofibres retain a similar morphology to the
      parent boehmite nanofibres. This results in a non-woven mesh of
      nanofibres with smaller pore sizes than the intermediate layer on
      which it is generated.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a hierarchical structure of non-woven meshes with increasing
      filtration ability on top of a mechanically strong but relatively
      porous substrate is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Further, post-construction, modification of the surface of the
      nanofilter can confer additional, desirable properties on the
      nanofilter. For example, grafting various silanes onto the filter
      surface by impregnation or gaseous reaction alters surface
      properties of the filter such as the relative hydrophobicity.
      Other chemical reactions on the filter surface can achieve
      fine-tuning of the porous structure and alter the affinity of the
      nanofibres for various elements. These nanofibre non-woven meshes
      do not suffer from cracks or pinholes to the same degree as, for
      example, layers created by the sol gel process and, as a direct
      result of the mesh-like structure, have flow rates at 60 nm
      separation that are 10-100 times greater than those of
      conventional filters with similar separation ability. This is due
      to a number of factors inherent in the non-woven meshes, for
      example the absence of dead-end pores and the fact that all the
      pores are interconnected. This can result in high porosity levels
      of 70% or greater. This is demonstrated graphically in FIG 4 (a)
      which shows the changing flux and selectivity of the filter as it
      is built up from its various sub-layers and layers. The filter
      selectivity was determined based on the filtering of a solution
      containing latex spheres of 60 nm diameter. The different points
      represent the flux (black squares) and filtration (clear circles)
      of the layers as they are built, one upon the other. Therefore, S
      = substrate alone, T1 = one titanate coating (on the substrate),
      T2 = two titanate coatings, T3 = three titanate coatings and Al =
      3 boehmite coatings on top. The relatively high flux rates
      demonstrated can be achieved at lower pressures and so, with less
      energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      FIG 4 (b) shows how a latex sphere of 60 nm diameter from the
      above filtration solution has been filtered out by the non-woven
      mesh of [gamma]-alumina nanofibres forming the upper layer of the
      nanofilter.<br>
      <br>
      FIG 5 (a)-(c) is a series of SEM's from three different solutions
      of latex spheres before and after (insert) filtration through the
      nanofilter. In the image shown in (a) the spheres were of 60 nm
      diameter, in (b) 108 nm and in (c) 200 nm. A portion of the
      solutions before filtration were analysed by SEM and these form
      the main part of each image. After filtration through a nanofilter
      with a [gamma]-alumina top layer, and so, pore sizes of 60 nm or
      less, a portion of the filtrate was sampled and analysed by SEM.
      These images form the insert in the top right hand corner of the
      corresponding p re-filtration image (a)-(c). These images show
      that all species of diameter 200 nm or greater are filtered off.
      Spheres of 108 nm are almost completely removed and even 60 nm
      diameter spheres are filtered off to a very large degree.<br>
      <br>
      So that the invention may be more readily understood and put into
      practical effect, the skilled person is referred to the following
      non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1</span><br>
      <br>
      Preparation of a ceramic nanofilter was performed using a porous
      [alpha]- alumina disk with a diameter of 30 mm and thickness of
      2-3 mm as the substrate. The pore sizes of the [alpha]-alumina
      substrate are approximately 10 [mu]m. Titanate fibres (20-30 [mu]m
      long and 40-100 nm thick) were dispersed in ethanol to give a 0.2
      wt% suspension and sonicated for 10 min using an ultrasonic finger
      to achieve a homogenous suspension. This suspension was used to
      coat the substrate using a spin-coat processor. The coating was
      applied at a spinning velocity of 1000 r/min for 2 min and used
      approximately 0.5 ml_ of the fibre suspension for the coating.<br>
      <br>
      The spin-coating process was repeated twice followed by drying in
      air at 393 K and then calcination at 773 K for 4 h. The heating
      rate employed is 1 K/min starting from 393 K. These three
      sub-layers collectively form the intermediate layer.<br>
      <br>
      A 0.2 wt% suspension of boehmite (AIO(OH)) nanofibres (60-100 nm
      long and 2-5 nm thick) in ethanol was then made up and applied on
      top of the calcined titanate nanofibre non-woven mesh in the same
      manner. After coating and drying in air at 393 K, calcining at 723
      K for 2h then results in the boehmite fibres being converted to y
      -alumina nanofibres (AI2O3). The v- alumina nanofibres form the
      top layer of the nanofilter and retain a similar morphology to the
      parent boehmite nanofibres. This process results in a non- woven
      mesh of [gamma]-alumina nanofibres (top layer) with smaller pore
      sizes than the underlying titanate nanofibre non-woven mesh
      (intermediate layer) all formed upon the [alpha]-alumina
      substrate. The result is shown in cross section in FIG 1 (a).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 2</span><br>
      <br>
      The filtration properties of the titanate non-woven mesh
      (intermediate layer) formed from three coating cycles (three
      sub-layers) on the substrate were tested before the boehmite top
      layer was applied by filtering an aqueous suspension of latex
      spheres. Suspensions of spheres of a variety of sizes were made up
      to be 0.1 wt% and were used in the following experiment. 30 ml_ of
      these suspensions were put through the titanate nanofilter layer
      using a vacuum system which maintains a pressure difference
      between the feeding fluid and permeated fluid of 20 KPa.<br>
      <br>
      The concentrations of the latex spheres in the original suspension
      and the filtrate were determined using both scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The titanate layer
      was able to filter out 100% of latex spheres with a diameter of
      200 nm or greater. It also retained a flux of about 800
      L/m&lt;2&gt;/h. The alumina substrate alone has a flux of about
      1200 L/m&lt;2&gt;/h. FIG 4 exemplifies these results for the 60 nm
      diameter latex sphere solution. For comparisons sake the
      filtration and flux were tested at each stage of filter
      construction i.e. on the substrate alone (S), one titanate coating
      on the substrate (T1 ), two titanate coatings (T2), three titanate
      coatings (T3) (these three titanate coatings or sub-layers
      together make up the intermediate layer) and with the final
      [gamma]-alumina layer on top (Al).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3</span><br>
      <br>
      The filtration capability of the completed filter (3 coatings of
      titanate nanofibres on the [alpha]-alumina substrate followed by 3
      coatings of the y- alumina nanofibres on top) was tested.<br>
      <br>
      A 10 wt% aqueous suspension of 60 nm latex spheres was diluted to
      0.01 wt% with water. 30 ml_ of the dilution was used to test
      permeation of the filter. A pressure difference of 20 KPa between
      the feeding fluid and permeated fluid was stably maintained by a
      vacuum system. The time taken for every 5 ml_ of fluid to filter
      through the filter under test was recorded.<br>
      <br>
      The fluids before and after filtration were sampled for analysis.
      SEM images were collected on an FEI Quanta 200 Environmental SEM.
      A JEOL JSM 6400F Field Emission SEM was also used to obtain images
      of high resolution. The samples are coated with gold using a
      BioRad SC500 sputter coater.<br>
      <br>
      The specimens from the liquid samples were prepared by dropping 5
      [mu]l of solution on a glass slide and drying under vacuum. The
      efficiency of filter separation could be estimated directly by
      comparing the numbers of latex spheres in images of the specimens
      taken before and after filtration.<br>
      <br>
      These images are shown in FIG 5 which demonstrates that at pore
      sizes less than 60 nm all spheres of diameter greater than 200nm
      are filtered off.<br>
      <br>
      Those of diameter 108nm are almost completely filtered off and
      spheres of 60 nm diameter are removed to a very large extent.<br>
      <br>
      The morphology of the nanofibres was recorded on a Philips CM200
      Transmission Electron Microscope. UV-visible spectroscopy on a
      Caryl 00 (Varian Inc.) spectrophotometer was also utilized to
      analyze the concentration change of the fluids before and after
      filtration. The intensity of the absorption band at 200 nm was
      adopted to determine the concentration using a standard plotting
      curve.<br>
      <br>
      In this case 96.8% of spheres with a diameter of 60 nm or greater
      were filtered out. The flux passing through the nanofilter was
      still found to be relatively high at 600 L/m&lt;2&gt;/h. This is
      70-80% that of the titanate non-woven mesh filter alone and half
      that of the alumina substrate alone. It also represents a flux of
      10-100 times greater than that of ceramic filters prepared in a
      more conventional manner exhibiting similar separation ability.<br>
      <br>
      Example 4 A glass filter substrate was placed into 50 ml of a HNO3
      solution containing 0.5 g of HNO3 and 49.5 g H2O. It was sonicated
      for about 10 min in an ultrasonic bath and then washed with
      deionised water. The substrate was then dried in air at 393 K for
      4 h.<br>
      <br>
      A suspension of titanate nanofibres was prepared by dispersing
      0.08 g of nanofibres into 50 ml ethanol with vigorous stirring to
      give a white suspension with a fibre content of 0.2 wt%. Stirring
      was continued for a further 30 min.<br>
      <br>
      The pre-cleaned substrate was loaded on the chuck of a spin coat
      processor and the above suspension was dropped at a spin velocity
      of 1000 r/min. The coating process took 1 min. The coating process
      is repeated 2-4 times. The total consumption of one solution was
      about 0.4 g (using 0.5 ml of the suspension). The substrate
      surface was thereby covered with titanate nanofibres.<br>
      <br>
      After spin-coating, the coated substrate is dried firstly at room
      temperature for 12h and then at 393 K for 4 h. The substrate is
      then calcined at 773 K for 4 h to attach the non-woven mesh layer.
      The heating rate is 1 K/min, starting from 393 K.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, a 0.2 wt% suspension of boehmite nanofibres was applied
      on top of the calcined non-woven mesh of titanate nanofibres. The
      coating process is repeated 2-4 times.<br>
      <br>
      The nanofilter product was mounted on a filtration set-up to
      assess its separation efficiency. A 10 wt% aqueous dispersion of
      latex spheres of 60 nm diameter was diluted to 0.01 wt% with
      water. 30 ml_ of the dilution was used to test permeation passing
      through a prepared filter. A pressure difference of 20 kPa was
      maintained between the feeding fluid and the filtrate, by a vacuum
      system, to drive the filtration. The time taken for each 5 ml_ of
      fluid to pass through the filter was recorded. The fluids before
      and after filtration were sampled for analysis. UV-visible
      spectroscopy (UV-vis) on a Caryl 00 (Varian Inc.)
      spectrophotometer was utilized to analyse the concentration change
      of the latex spheres in the fluids before and after filtration.
      The intensity of the absorption band at 205 nm was adopted to
      determine the concentration using a standard plotting curve. FIG 6
      demonstrates the filtration flux and selectivity of this
      nanofilter as it is built up from its various layers by filtering
      a 0.01 wt% solution of 60 nm latex spheres (S is for the glass
      substrate alone; T1 represents the filter after the first coating
      with titanate nanofibres; T2 after the second coating with
      titanate nanofibres; T3 after the third coating with titanate
      nanofibres and Al represents the filter after three coatings of
      [gamma]-alumina nanofibres on top of the coatings of titanate
      nanofibres).<br>
      <br>
      The completed filter comprising a non-woven mesh of titanate
      nanofibres (three coatings) and a non-woven mesh of alumina
      nanofibres (three coatings) is able to filter out 93 % of latex
      spheres with a diameter of 60 nm, with a maximum flux of 994
      Um&lt;2&gt;Zh. Such a flux is significantly greater than the flux
      of filters prepared under conventional approaches which exhibited
      similar separation. The glass substrate (pore size 10-16 [mu]m)
      alone has a flux of more than 4000 Um&lt;2&gt;IU. The nanofilter
      provided by the present invention will be useful for a range of
      applications in the water purification, dairy, pharmaceutical,
      petrochemical and radioactive material processing industries.
      Particularly important, is the application of the nanofilter to
      filtering out viral and bacterial pathogens from water and air.
      The hierarchical structure of non-woven mesh layers with
      increasing filtration ability on top of a mechanically strong but
      relatively porous substrate allows for high flux with nanometre
      separation capability.<br>
      <br>
      The surface of the substrate used does not have to be made smooth
      as is required in some processes thereby making the filter cheaper
      and faster to produce.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe the
      preferred embodiments of the invention without limiting the
      invention to any one embodiment or specific collection of
      features. It will therefore be appreciated by those of skill in
      the art that, in light of the instant disclosure, various
      modifications and changes can be made in the particular
      embodiments exemplified without departing from the scope of the
      present invention.<br>

      Abstract - A method of producing metal oxide nanoparticles in an
      exfoliated silicate framework by forming an aqueous exfoliated
      silicate suspension by mixing a layered clay into water until
      clear. To which is added an acidic hydrated metal species
      precursor solution, formed by dissolving one or more transitional
      metal salts, and a non-ionic surfactant. This solution is then
      aged to precipitate a product precursor before the product
      precursor is separated and washed. The product precursor is
      calcined to form metal oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated
      silicate framework.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0001] THIS INVENTION relates to metal oxide nanoparticles in an
      exfoliated laponite framework, methods of producing and uses of
      same. More particularly but not exclusively, the invention relates
      to the method of producing transition metal oxide nanoparticles in
      an exfoliated laponite framework and their use as catalysts,
      catalyst supports, adsorbents and/or in photoelectronics and
      electromagnetics.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Fine particles of transition metal oxides, in the several
      nanometer range, are of particular interest for their potential
      use in photoelectronics, electromagnetics and as catalyst,
      catalyst supports and adsorbents. Typically transition metal
      oxides in this several nanoparticle range are in the form of fine
      powders and whilst their powdery nature increases the particle
      surface area they are subject to agglomeration which affects their
      general performance. Furthermore these fine powders are very hard
      to recover when used in aqueous systems, thus leading to a
      potential difficulty in downstream separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Various new techniques have been adopted to develop solids
      of large metal oxide surface area. Antonelli, D. M. and Ying, J.
      Y., Angew. Chem., Int.Ed. Engl., 1995, 34(18), 2014-2017 and Yang,
      P. et al, Nature 1998, 396, 152-165 described the formation of
      TiO2 mesoporous molecular sieves have been synthesised by
      templated synthesis. Kresge, C. T., et al, Nature,
      1992,359,710-712 and Inagaki, S, et al, J. Chem. Soc. Chem.
      Commun., 1993, 680-682 earlier described the synthesis of
      mesoporous silica or aluminosilicate. Some approaches, such as
      starting with metal alkoxides and conducting the synthesis in
      non-aqueous systems, were employed to overcome serious
      difficulties in the synthesis, such as those reported in
      Antonelli, D, M, and Ying, J. Y., Angew Chem Int Ed Engl, 1995,
      34(8), 2014-2017. However these processes still did not provided
      products with suitable pore size and surface areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In response to the desire to develop materials with larger
      pore sizes than zeolites, a class of thermally stable porous
      materials, pillared layered clays (PILCs) were developed from
      swellable layered clays, such as smectite, in the late 1970s.
      Numerous references describe the process, mechanism and properties
      of PILC's, for example Brindley, G. W. and Semples, R. E., Clay
      Miner, 1977, 12, 229. It is well understood that when dispersed in
      water, the layered clays swell because of hydration of the
      interlamellae cations which act as counterions to balance the
      negative charges of clay layers, which in turn allows inorganic
      polycations, the so-called pillar precursors, to be intercalated
      into the interlayer gallery by cation exchange. During subsequent
      heating above 400[deg.] C., the intercalated polycations are
      converted to oxide pillars, which prop the clay layers apart. A
      permanent micropore system is thus formed. Whilst pillaring has
      become a well-established technique for the synthesis of porous
      materials the materials produced are limited to microporous solids
      of a moderate porosity (typical characteristics being, pore volume
      of 0.15-0.40 cm&lt;3&gt; /g and BET surface area of 150-450
      m&lt;2&gt; /g), such as those described by Burch, R. Ed, "Pillared
      clays, Catalysis Today", Elsevler: New York, 1998, Vol 2 and
      Mitchell, I. V., Ed. "Pillared layered structures, current tends
      and applications", Elsevier Applied Science, London 1990. As the
      pore size is limited by the formation of pillars, which in turn
      are limited by the size of the cations being incorporated into the
      clay structure, it is extremely difficult to obtain large pillar
      precursors that are identical in size, and result in a catalyst
      having very high porosity.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Galameau, A., et al., Nature, 1995, 374, 529, reported a
      successful synthesis of mesoporous solids termed as porous clay
      heterostructures (PCHs) from layered clays using quaternary
      ammonium surfactants as template agents. Layered clays were first
      intercalated with surfactants, tetraethoxide orthosilicate (TEOS),
      were allowed to hydrolyze and condense, surrounding the
      intercalated surfactants in the galleries of the clay particles.
      An open framework of silica formed within the clay layers after
      removal of the surfactants by heating. Products of this method
      however have poor porosity characteristics. In the formation of
      the PCHs the water content present needs to be carefully
      controlled to ensure that the TEOS is allowed to hydrolyse
      rendering the product outcome somewhat uncertain.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Suzuki, K. and Mari. T., Appl. Catal., 1990, 63, 181;
      Suzuki, K. et al., J. Chem. Soc.,Chem. Commum., 1991, 873 and
      Michot, L. and Pinnavala, T. J., Chem. Mater. 1992, 4 (6), 1433,
      describe the use of poly(vinylalcohol) (PVA) or alkyl polyether
      surfactants in the synthesis of aluminium pillared layered clays
      (Al-PILCs), which resulted in significant changes in the pore
      structure of the products. The Al-PILC prepared in the presence of
      PVA however have poor long-range order, and a relatively large
      pore volume, which mainly arises from mesopores. The PILC catalyst
      structures of the prior art, the clay layer remains intact while
      the pillar precursors intercalate into the clay layers by means of
      ion exchange processes which result in layered clays with a
      typical diameter of 1-2 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Whilst surfactants have been used to form a templates
      within catalyst or nanoparticle structures, all the methods of the
      prior art have suffered one or more limitations, including
      uncontrollable pore size, limited pore size range, poor porosity
      characteristics, the clay layers exhibit short range order, and/or
      their catalytic act is adversely effected when subject to high
      temperatures. The metal oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated
      laponite framework when produced by the method of the invention
      show surprisingly good porosity characteristics and/or resistance
      to the effects of high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0008] In one form of the invention, although it need not be the
      only or indeed the broadest form, the invention resides in a
      method of producing metal oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated
      laponite framework comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      forming an aqueous exfoliated laponite suspension having high pH,
      by mixing a layered clay into water until clear;<br>
      forming an acidic hydrated metal species precursor solution by
      dissolving one or more transitional metal salts;<br>
      adding a non-ionic surfactant and the hydrated metal species
      precursor solution to the aqueous exfoliated laponite suspension
      to form a product precursor;<br>
      ageing to precipitate a product precursor;<br>
      <br>
      separating and washing the product precursor; and<br>
      <br>
      calcining the product precursor to form metal oxide nanoparticles
      in an exfoliated laponite framework.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Preferably, the non-ionic surfactant is selected from
      Tergitol 15S-5, Tergitol 15S-7, Tergitol 15S-9, Tergitol 15S-12 or
      Tergitol 15S-30.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The transition metal salts are preferably selected from one
      or more of aluminium chloride; aluminium nitrate; aluminium
      hydroxychloride; ferric chloride; ferric nitrate; cerium chloride,
      lanthanum chloride; zirconium chloride; zirconium oxychloride;
      titanium (IV) isopropoxide, titanium chloride; chromium chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Preferably, the aqueous exfoliated laponite suspension is
      formed by adding approximately 1 g laponite, per 50 mls water, and
      stirring until clear.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Suitably, 2 to 20 g of the nonionic surfactant is added per
      200 ml of aqueous exfoliated laponite suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The ageing step, is preferably achieved by subjecting the
      solution temperatures between 100[deg.] C. and 700[deg.] C. over a
      period of between one to three days.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Suitably, the calcining step is carried out at temperatures
      between 500[deg.] C. and 1100[deg.] C., for periods of up to or
      about 20 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another form of the invention, there is provided metal
      oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated laponite framework wherein
      the metal ion of the metal oxide is selected from one or more of
      titanium, zirconium, aluminum, cerium, lathanum, iron, nickel and
      chromium.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In another form the invention provides metal oxide
      nanoparticles in an exfoliated laponite framework having
      characteristics selected from two or more of the following:<br>
      <br>
      a. pore size between 3 and 9 nm;<br>
      <br>
      b. surface area between 500 and 900 m&lt;2&gt; /g;<br>
      c. thermal stability at temperatures equal to or greater than
      about 500[deg.] C.; or<br>
      d. metal oxide nanoparticles particle size between 3 and 9 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Preferably the metal oxide nanoparticles in the exfoliated
      laponite framework has characteristics selected from a surface
      area between 500 and 900 m&lt;2&gt; /g and metal oxide
      nanoparticles particle size between 3 and 9 nm; or a pore size
      between 3 and 9 nm, a surface area between 500 and 900 m&lt;2&gt;
      g and a thermal stability at temperatures equal to or greater than
      about 500[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In yet another form, the invention provides for an
      adsorbent comprising metal oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated
      laponite framework, comprising metal oxide nanoparticles in an
      exfoliated laponite framework,<br>
      <br>
      having a surface area between 500 and 900 m&lt;2&gt; /g and metal
      oxide nanoparticles particle size between 3 and 9 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In still another form, the invention provides an
      photocatalyst comprising metal oxide nanoparticles in an
      exfoliated laponite framework having a pore size between 3 and 9
      nm, surface area between 500 and 900 m&lt;2/&gt; g and thermal
      stability at temperatures equal to or greater than about 500[deg.]
      C.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The inventors have found that the metal oxide nanoparticle
      in an exfoliated laponite framework, unlike the PCHs and PILCs of
      the prior art, have no structure order and the metal oxide
      nanoparticles are linked and separated by silica pieces. The pore
      size of the metal oxide particles in the exfoliated laponite
      framework are typically 3 nm as opposed to 1-3 nm for the pillared
      clays, such as that produced by Suzuki supra. Furthermore it has
      been found that the method of the invention can be used for a
      variety of metal oxides rather than being applicable to only one
      metal oxide, such as the work reported by Suzuki supra only being
      applicable to alumina pillared clays.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Without wanting to be bound to a particular theory the
      inventors believe that the advantage achieved by the method of the
      invention is due in part to the reaction of the high pH synthetic
      clay suspension and the low pH of the precursor solution of
      hydrated metal species resulting in additional hydrolysis of the
      metal species. Furthermore it is believed that the clay is
      subjected to acid leaching by the precursor solution which leads
      to the clay loosing its original composition and structure,
      resulting in an amorphous silicate. It has been found that the
      clay particles and metal hydrates species have a high affinity to
      the non-ionic surfactant, which can be used to tailor the
      structure of the product. It also appears that the non-ionic
      surfactants act by separating the hydrolyzed species of metal
      elements, preventing them from further agglomeration and sintering
      during the drying and heating steps. During the heating process
      the non-ionic surfactant is volatilized, leaving a rigid structure
      of metal oxide nanoparticles incorporated into an exfoliated
      laponite framework, having high porosity.<br>

      [0038] For convenience the subsequent examples will refer to the
      metal oxide nanoparticles in an exfoliated laponite framework as
      metal oxide-laponites, for example titanium oxide nanoparticles in
      an exfoliated laponite framework will be referred to as titanium
      oxide-laponite or TiO2-Laponite, or metal oxide nanocomposites.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1</span><br>
      <br>
      Alumina-Laponite<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Materials: The clay was Laponite RD, supplied by Fernz
      Specialty Chemicals, Australia. The clay powder has a BET specific
      surface area of 370 m&lt;2&gt; /g and a cation exchange capacity
      (CEC) of 55 mequlv/100 g of clay.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A commercial solution of aluminum hydroxychloride (Locron L
      from Hoechst, Germany) was used as the alumina source. It contains
      polyoxycations of aluminum hydrate with an Al2O3 content of
      23.5+0.5 wt &amp;, a ratio of OH/Al of 2.5, and a pH of about
      3.5-3.7.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Four nonionic PEO surfactants, Tergitol 15S-n (n=5, 7, 9,
      and 12) from Aldrich, were used. The PEO surfactants have general
      chemical formula of C12-14H25-28O(CH2CH2O)nH and an average
      molecular weight of 420 for Tergitol 15S-5 (n=5) and of 730 for
      Tergitol 15S-12 (n=12).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0042] Preparation of
        Alumina-Laponite Samples.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0043] A 4.09 sample of Laponite was dispersed in 200 ml of water.
      The suspension was stirred until it became clear. Polyethylene
      oxide surfactant Tergitol 15-S-n, was added to the Laponite
      suspension. The amount of surfactant was varied from 0 to 20 g,
      and the different surfactants (n=5, 7, 9 and 12) were used to
      obtain a range of samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The suspension was stirred for 2 h to allow sufficient
      mixing. To this mixture was added 20 mL of the Locron L solution
      dropwise with continuous stirring. The suspension was then
      transferred to an autoclave after being stirred for 2 h and
      maintained at 100[deg.] C. for 2 days. A white precipitate was
      recovered from the mixture by centrifuging and washed with
      deionized water until it was free of chlorine (Cl&lt;-&gt; ) ions.
      The wet cake was dried in air and calcined at 500[deg.] C. for 20
      h. The temperature was raised at a rate of 2[deg.] C./min. The PEO
      surfactants were evaporated in the temperature range between
      100[deg.] C. and 250[deg.] C. The surfactants can be collected in
      a cooling trap during this stage and reused.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at liquid
      nitrogen (-196[deg.] C.) after a degassing period of 16 h at
      230[deg.] C. The BET specific surface area, surface area, pore
      volume and mean diameter of the framework pores (pores formed in
      the galleries between the clay layers) in the calcined alumina
      intercalated laponite samples were derived from the data of the
      isotherms and summarized in Table 1 and 2. In Table 1, m indicates
      the amount of surfactant, Tergitol TS-15-9, introduced in the
      synthesis of the alumina-laponite nanocomposite.<br>

      Titanium Dioxide-Laponite<br>
      <br>
      [0049] A laponite suspension was prepared as in Example 1. PEO
      surfactants, Tergitol 15-S-n, were added into the suspension. The
      amount of the surfactant was varied from 0 to 20 g, and the

      range of samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The titanium hydrate sol was used as the TiO2 source. The
      sol was prepared from 12.9 g of titanium (IV) isopropoxide,
      Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4 and 176 ml of 1.0M HCl. It was then added dropwise
      into the mixture of surfactant and laponite suspension with
      continuous stirring. After prolonged stirring of 3 hours, the
      mixture was transferred into an autoclave and kept at 100[deg.] C.
      for two days. White precipitate was recovered from the mixture by
      centrifuging and washing with deionised water until it was free of

      [0052] Photodegradation of Rhodamine BG<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The UV source was a 100W Hg lamp, Toshiba SHLS-1002A.
      Aqueous suspensions of Rhodamine 6G (usually 25 ml) and TiO2
      nanoparticles in an exfoliated silicate framework (25 mg) were
      placed in a Pyrex vessel. TiO2 nanoparticle of 3.9, 4.4, 5.5 and
      6.2 nm where prepared using a method similar to that described
      above with the pH of the solution varied. Prior to irradation, the
      suspensions were magnetically stirred in the dark for ca. 30 min
      to establish an adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the dye
      and the TiO2 particle surface. At given intervals of illumination,
      a sample of the TiO2 particulates were collected, centrifuged and
      then filtered thorough a millipore filter. The filtrates were
      analysed by UV-VIS spectroscopy using lambda Bio 20
      spectrophotometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Comparing the DR-UV-VIS spectra of the samples FIG. 1A and
      1B, it was found that absorbance of UV light by the sample with
      smaller anatase particle sizes occurs at the shorter wavelength,
      so called blue shift. The blue shift is consistent with the
      variation in the anatase particle size of the samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Larger species of the precursors of TiO2 nanoparticles were
      formed and condense to the acid-leached silicate layers.
      Introducing PEO surfactants in the synthesis significantly
      increased the porosity and surface areas in the composite solids.
      The TiO2 exists in anatase nano-particles, separated by voids and
      silicates platelets, and are accessible to organic molecules. The
      composite solids exhibited superior properties as photo-catalysts
      for degradation of Rhodamine 6G in aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The products of this example may be used for odour
      elimination of drinking water, degradation of harmful organic
      contaminants, like herbicides, pesticides, refractive dyes, and
      oil spills in surface water systems.<br>

      and 200 ml water, was refluxed for 1 hour and used as the ZrO2
      source. It was then added drop wise into the mixture of surfactant
      and laponite suspension with continuous stirring. After prolonged
      stirring of 3 hours, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave

      [0062] With large metal oxide surface area and porosity, good
      thermal and chemical stability, these materials have been found to
      be superior support for advance catalysts. Nickel catalysts
      supported on Zr-laponite exhibit a great long-term stability for

      <br>
      [0063] The laponite suspension was prepared in a similar manner as
      in Example 1. 8.0 g of Terigol 15-S-9 was added into the
      suspension. A 0.2M Iron(III)nitrate solution [Fe(NO3)3], from 17.8
      of iron nitrate, [Fe(NO3)3.9H2O] and 213 ml of deionised water was

      <br>
      [0064] After prolonged stirring of 3 hours, this solution was

      17.6 g of chromium nitrate, [Cr(NO3)3.9H2O] and 213 ml of hot
      water (95[deg.] C.) was mixed with 4.66 g of sodium carbonate,
      Na2CO3 under vigorously stirring. The molar ratio of

      Nickel/Zirconium Oxide Nanoparticle in an Exfoliated Laponite<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A zirconium oxide nanopartilce in an exfoliated laponite,
      subsequently referred to as a Zr-laponite was prepared in a
      similar manner to that described in Example 3 above.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The Ni/Zr-laponite was prepared by the incipient wetness
      impregnation method with aqueous solution of nitrates as metal
      precursors. The solids were dried overnight in air at 105[deg.] C.
      and then calcined at 500[deg.] C. in air for 4 hours in order to
      realize the complete decomposition of the nitrate. After this
      treatment, the catalyst was reduced at 500[deg.] C. in a stream of
      50% H2/N2 for 2 hours. The nickel metal loading of catalyst was 9
      wt %, except where specially stated.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Catalytic performance<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Catalytic reaction experiments were conducted in a vertical
      fixed-bed reactor made of quartz tube under atmospheric pressure.
      0.2 g catalyst was placed in the quartz tube. A thermocouple was
      placed in the tube with one end touching on the catalyst in order
      to measure the bed temperature. The mixture of reactants of
      methane and carbon dioxide with ratio of 1:1 was fed into the
      reactor at the flow rate of 60 ml/min (GHSV=18000 ml/gh). The
      analyses of reactant/product mixtures were carried out using an
      on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu-17A) equipped with a thermal
      conductivity detector. A carbosphere (80-100 mesh) column was used
      to separate H2, CO, CH4 and CO2. Prior to each reaction run, the
      catalyst was reduced in situ at 500[deg.] C. in 50% H2/N2 for 2 h.
      The activities of catalysts were investigated at temperatures
      between 500-800[deg.] C., and stability tests were conducted at a
      certain reaction temperature only.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Surface area and pore size of supports and catalysts<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The surface areas and pore sizes of supports and catalysts
      were studied by nitrogen adsorption, and the results are listed in
      Table 10. The pillaring process greatly increases the surface area
      of these laponite materials. It was seen that when the amount of
      the introduced surfactant was increased, the surface area of
      Zr-Laponite increased, until the Zr-Laponite(12) with a 12 g
      amount of surfactant in the pillaring process, when its surface
      area decreased. This indicates that the surfactant amount of 12 g
      is more than enough in the pillaring process. All these supports
      are mesoporous and have higher surface areas than [gamma]-Al2O3,
      of the prior art. The surface area order of supports is
      Zr-Laponite(8)&gt;Zr-Laponite(12)&gt;Zr-Laponite(4)&gt;Zr-Laponite(0).
      The order of catalysts is similar to that of supports. The surface
      area of catalyst treated at 500[deg.] C. is higher than at
      600[deg.] C. It is also seen that the surface area of catalysts is
      generally reduced for those with high porous structure.<br>

      [0084] These ZrO2-laponite composites were used as supports to
      prepare supported Ni catalysts for methane reforming with carbon
      dioxide. These catalysts exhibited high conversion and good

      operating temperature of 1023K. While the nickel catalyst on

      <br>
      [0085] A number of metal oxide nanoparticle in exfoliated
      laponites framework were formed using methods similar to those
      described above. It was found that the porosity of the
      nanocomposite was significantly increased by introducing
      polyethylene oxide (PEO) surfactants of small molecular weights,
      with a general chemical formula C12-14H25-29 O(CH2CH2O)nH
      (n=5-12). These surfactants have strong affinities to the surfaces
      of clay and metal hydrates. Therefore, they have a function of
      separating the hydrolyzed species of metal elements, preventing
      them from further agglomeration and sintering during the drying
      and heating processes.<br>

      no such a trend observed in the composites made by the method of
      the current invention. The molecular size of the surfactant is not
      a sole determinant of the pore size of the product solids. During
      heating the surfactant volatilizes, leaving a rigid structure with
      high porosity. The BET specific surface area and porosity data of

      are microporous solids (pore size below 2 nm) with a moderate
      porosity, while the nanocomposites are mesoporous solids. The
      structures of these two classes of solids are also profoundly
      different. The TEM images of the pristine laponite and three
      nanocomposites (as representatives) are given in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Bundles of several clay platelets can be seen in the image
      of pristine laponite in FIG. 3a. They aggregate in a poor
      long-range order. For pillared clays, the clay layers were
      regarded as inert with respect to reaction and almost intact in
      term of chemical composition through pillaring process. The acid
      leaching may result in remarkable changes in composition and
      structure of the clay layers. The extent of the reaction varies
      substantially from clay to clay. FIG. 3b is the image of the
      sample prepared from a solution containing Keggin ions,
      [Al13O4(OH)24]&lt;7+&gt; , and the laponite dispersion,
      Al2O3-composite. In this solid, thin stringy structure of about 1
      and 2 nm thickness are observed, which are singular and paired
      silicate platelets, respectively. It is noted that these platelets
      are entangled but with a separation in the nanometer range. This
      indicates that the platelets are intercalated with nanoparticles
      of alumina. The Keggin ion solution has a weak acidity (pH of
      3.0-3.5), and there is no obvious acid leaching from the laponite
      platelets, according to the results of chemical composition of the
      sample (in Table 12). Substantial loss of magnesium that is in the
      clay layer is an indicative of the acid leaching. Thus, the
      laponite platelets remain intact, in terms of composition and
      framework structure. When a more acidic solution containing sol
      particles of titanium (IV) hydrate, was used, laponite platelets
      are obviously involved in reaction. Most of magnesium in the clay
      platelets was leached out (Table 2). The solids obtained after
      calcination at 500[deg.] C. contains mainly silica and titanium
      dioxide. X-ray powder diffraction pattern (not shown) indicates
      that TiO2 exists in anatase phase and we can see the aggregation
      of crystallites with random orientations in FIG. 3c. The size of
      the anatase crystalites can be estimated from domains of regular
      texture in the image, being about 3-9 nm. Both the x-ray pattern
      and TEM image do not indicate any crystal form of silica or
      silicate although silica accounts for over 50% of the sample mass.
      The silica in the samples is more likely amorphous as reaction
      product of the laponite clay. Similar behaviors were observed for
      other transition metal oxide nanocomposites. Energy dispersing
      x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze the chemical
      compositions at different regions over a sample. At least 5
      regions were taken for one sample and the average region size was
      about 15 nm in diameter. We found no obvious difference from
      region to region and the overall composition of the sample was
      uniform, for all the samples. This means that in these samples
      metal oxide particles homogeneously disperse in exfoliated
      silicate media.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The image in FIG. 3d provides more information on the
      structure of the reaction product derived from laponite. This
      solid was obtained from reaction of laponite suspension with a
      solution containing chromium hydroxyl ions. In this particular
      case, only a small amount of Cr2O3 is left in the product solid
      (Cr2O3 content below 1%), which contains about 80 wt % of silica
      and 6 wt % of MgO, meanwhile most of the Mg content in the
      original laponite has been leached out during the synthesis. This
      solid provides a clear picture of the residue from the original
      laponite after the reaction. The structure of this solid is
      strikingly different from that of the original laponite. Various
      holes ranging from 3-20 nm can be seen in the image. These
      irregular pores reveal that the laponite platelets were seriously
      attacked, not only at edges but also on the basal surface of the
      platelets, leaving a porous framework of silica.<br>

      [0091] &lt;29&gt; Si magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic
      resonance (&lt;29&gt; Si MASNMR) of the samples (FIG. 4) also
      indicate the different structure change in silicate platelets
      caused by the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] &lt;29&gt; Si MASNMR spectrum of laponite displays two
      resonance peaks at -90 and -80 ppm (spectra a). Such chemical
      shifts are correlated to the SiO4 tetrahedras linked with 3 and 2
      other SiO4 tetrahedras (Q&lt;3 &gt; and Q&lt;2 &gt; sites),
      respectively. This is expected for the structure of laponite clay
      layer. In the clay layer most SiO4 tetrahedras are linked to 3
      other SiO4 tetrahedra, being in Q&lt;3 &gt; sites but the
      tetrahedra at the edges of the clay layers are linked to 2 other
      SiO4 tetrahedra and thus form the Q&lt;2 &gt; sites. The smaller
      amount of Q&lt;2 &gt; sites, compared with that of Q&lt;3 &gt;
      sites, is responsible for the low intensity of the peak at -80
      ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The chemical shifts for the Al2O3-composite sample is
      similar to that of laponite, with a major resonance at -91.7 ppm
      (spectra b). This means that the clay platelets remain almost
      intact in the reaction, being consistent with our observation on
      the TEM image. The TiO2-composite and Cr2O3-composite samples show
      substantially different MASNMR spectra. Broad resonance in the
      range from -110 to -80 ppm can be seen, reflecting poor
      short-range order. It also suggests a radical structure change of
      the silicate due to the reaction in the synthesis. The chemical
      shift at -104 ppm (a peak for Cr2O3-composite and a shoulder for
      TiO2-composite) should be assigned to Q&lt;4 &gt; sites where the
      SiO4 tetrahedra linked with 4 other SiO4 tetrahedra. In laponite
      clay structure there should be no Q&lt;4 &gt; sites, and this is
      confirmed by the spectrum of the clay. Thus the Q&lt;4 &gt; sites
      have resulted from the profound structure changes of the silicate
      in the synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] These results suggest that the clay layers could be
      seriously attacked if the acidity of the precursor solution is
      strong. On the other hand, the laponite dispersion with a high pH
      inevitably induces further hydrolysis of the metal hydroxyl
      oligomers in the precursor solution, forming larger species, the
      precursors of metal oxide nanoparticles. These large species most
      likely condense to the surrounding silicate platelets, because
      they carry opposite electric charges. This leads to a composite
      structure in which metal oxide particles of several nanometers in
      size are dispersed among the exfoliated silicate media.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] According to this mechanism, it is possible to alter the
      particle size of the metal oxides by manipulating the acidity of
      the precursor solution. Indeed, as we increased the H&lt;+&gt; /TI
      molar ratio of the precursor solution from 2.0 to 8.0, the mean
      size of anatase particle in the product TiO2-composites increases
      from 3.7 to 9.0 nm. This finding is of significant importance,
      which allows us to effectively tailor the structure of these
      solids for various applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In FIG. 5 catalytic performances for photo-degradation of
      2, 4-dicholorophenol by a TiO2-composite and P25, a commercial
      ultra-fine titanium dioxide powder supplied by Degussa, are
      compared.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The overall photo-catalytic efficiency of the
      TiO2-composite is comparable to that of P25, which is known to be
      the best commercial TiO2 photo-catalyst and has a mean particles
      size of about 25 nm. The catalytic performance of the
      TiO2-composite proves that most of the surface of TiO2 crystals is
      accessible to the various molecules in solution. Furthermore, the
      TiO2-composite contains about 45% of TiO2. Therefore, the activity
      per mass of TiO2 for the TiO2-nanocomposite is superior. Besides,
      it is very difficult to recover P25 powder from water. This could
      leads to a potential difficulty in downstream separation. In
      contrast, the composite catalyst can be readily separated from
      aqueous solutions by filtration. The silicate layers in the
      samples not only act as media allowing TiO2 to disperse in
      nano-crystals but also link the distributed TiO2 nano-crystals to
      large granules which can be recovered easily.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Besides this, we also found that nickel catalysts supported
      on ZrO2-composite and Al2O3-composite exhibit high conversion rate
      for methane reforming with carbon dioxide. The catalyst maintains
      the high activity for over 170 hours, much longer than the
      catalyst supported activated Al2O3.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] These findings highlight the potential of the metal oxide
      composites as advanced materials. These solids can be readily
      granulated to designed shapes and the grains have good mechanical
      strength because of the presence of a silicate framework
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In comparison to the prior art, the method of the current
      invention has a prominent advantage that it can be conducted in
      aqueous system at moderate conditions. Moreover, this synthesis
      utilises the reaction between the clay suspension and the oligomer
      solution to form composite nanostructure with assistance of PEO
      surfactant, being profoundly different from the synthesis of the
      well-known pillared clay materials. Actually, such a synthesis
      route is not limited to laponite, we have prepared composites from
      natural layered clays such as saponite and hectorite. This new
      synthesis technique allows us to design and engineer composite
      nanostructures with desirable pore and surface properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The metal oxide nanoparticles in exfoliated laponite
      produced by the process of the invention are highly porous with
      large surface areas, generally greater than 500-900 m&lt;2&gt; /g.
      The process of the invention also allows the pore framework to be
      tailored to meet use requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The high thermal stability and porosity of the metal oxide
      nanoparticles in exfoliated laponite in addition to their cost
      effective production methods, make them more favourable than the
      currently available pillared clay catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Throughout the specification the aim has been to describe
      the preferred embodiments of the invention without limiting the
