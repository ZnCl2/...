        <div align="left"> AUSTIN, Texas — The ability to create clean,
          safe drinking water using only natural levels of sunlight and
          inexpensive gel technology could be at hand, thanks to an
          innovation in water purification.<br>
          <br>
          According to the United Nations, 30,000 people die each week
          from the consumption and use of unsanitary water. Although the
          vast majority of these fatalities occur in developing nations,
          the U.S. is no stranger to unanticipated water shortages,
          especially after hurricanes, tropical storms and other natural
          disasters that can disrupt supplies without warning.<br>
          <br>
          Led by Guihua Yu, associate professor of materials science and
          mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, a
          research team in UT Austin’s Cockrell School of Engineering
          has developed a cost-effective and compact technology using
          combined gel-polymer hybrid materials. Possessing both
          hydrophilic (attraction to water) qualities and semiconducting
          (solar-adsorbing) properties, these “hydrogels” (networks of
          polymer chains known for their high water absorbency) enable
          the production of clean, safe drinking water from any source,
          whether it’s from the oceans or contaminated supplies.<br>
          <br>
          The findings were published in the most recent issue of the
          journal Nature Nanotechnology.<br>
          <br>
          “We have essentially rewritten the entire approach to
          conventional solar water evaporation,” Yu said. The Texas
          Engineering researchers have developed a new hydrogel-based
          solar vapor generator that uses ambient solar energy to power
          the evaporation of water for effective desalination. Existing
          solar steaming technologies used to treat saltwater involve a
          very costly process that relies on optical instruments to
          concentrate sunlight. The UT Austin team developed
          nanostructured gels that require far less energy, only needing
          naturally occurring levels of ambient sunlight to run while
          also being capable of significantly increasing the volume of
          water that can be evaporated.<br>
          <br>
          “Water desalination through distillation is a common method
          for mass production of freshwater. However, current
          distillation technologies, such as multi-stage flash and
          multi-effect distillation, require significant infrastructures
          and are quite energy-intensive,” said Fei Zhao, a postdoctoral
          researcher working under Yu’s supervision. “Solar energy, as
          the most sustainable heat source to potentially power
          distillation, is widely considered to be a great alternative
          for water desalination.”<br>
          <br>
          The hydrogels allow for water vapor to be generated under
          direct sunlight and then pumped to a condenser for freshwater
          delivery. The desalinating properties of these hydrogels were
          even tested on water samples from the salt-rich Dead Sea and
          passed with flying colors. Using water samples from one of the
          saltiest bodies of water on Earth, UT engineers were able to
          reduce salinity from Dead Sea samples significantly after
          putting them through the hydrogel process. In fact, they
          achieved levels that met accepted drinking water standards as
          outlined by the World Health Organization and the U.S.
          Environmental Protection Agency. <br>
          <br>
          “Our outdoor tests showed daily distilled water production up
          to 25 liters per square meter, enough for household needs and
          even disaster areas,” said Yu. “Better still, the hydrogels
          can easily be retrofitted to replace the core components in
          most existing solar desalination systems, thereby eliminating
          the need for a complete overhaul of desalinations systems
          already in use.”<br>
          <br>
          Because salt is one of the most difficult substances to
          separate from water, researchers have also successfully
          demonstrated the hydrogels’ capacity for filtering out a
          number of other common contaminants found in water that are
          considered unsafe for consumption.<br>
          <br>
          Yu believes the technology can be commercialized and is
          preparing his research team in anticipation of requests from
          industry to conduct scalability tests.<br>
          <br>
          The potential impact of this technology could be far-reaching,
          as global demand for fresh, clean water outpaces existing
          natural supplies.<br>
          <br>
          A patent application has been filed, and Yu has teamed up with
          the university’s Office of Technology Commercialization to
          assist with the licensing and commercialization for this novel
          class of hydrogels.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          Solar vapour generation is an efficient way of harvesting
          solar energy for the purification of polluted or saline water.
          However, water evaporation suffers from either inefficient
          utilization of solar energy or relies on complex and expensive
          light-concentration accessories. Here, we demonstrate a
          hierarchically nanostructured gel (HNG) based on polyvinyl
          alcohol (PVA) and polypyrrole (PPy) that serves as an
          independent solar vapour generator. The converted energy can
          be utilized in situ to power the vaporization of water
          contained in the molecular meshes of the PVA network, where
          water evaporation is facilitated by the skeleton of the
          hydrogel. A floating HNG sample evaporated water with a record
          high rate of 3.2 kg m−2 h−1 via 94% solar energy from 1 sun
          irradiation, and 18–23 litres of water per square metre of HNG
          was delivered daily when purifying brine water. These values
          were achievable due to the reduced latent heat of water
          evaporation in the molecular mesh under natural sunlight.<br>

          The invention relates to a surface interface material or an
          oil-water separation material, in particular to a
          multifunctional superhydrophobic coating and a preparation
          technology thereof by using a hydrogel microstructure as a
          template.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Background technique</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Controlling the surface properties of materials such as
          wettability is one of the main goals of surface science
          research. Surfaces with a water contact angle (CA) greater
          than 150° and a roll-off angle (TA) of less than 10° are known
          as superhydrophobic surfaces [1, 2] and have great application
          prospects such as: waterproof coatings [3-5] Self-cleaning
          surfaces [2], smooth surfaces [6], anti-wetting fabrics [7],
          drag reducing coatings [8] and selective oil/water separation
          [9]. The lotus leaf is an example of a natural
          super-hydrophobic surface, which allows water droplets to bead
          and roll down, causing contaminants to be removed [10-13]. The
          reason is that the microscopic structure of the lotus surface
          can maintain microscopic air bubbles under the water droplets,
          resulting in a macroscopic superhydrophobic effect with a
          contact angle greater than 150[2]. The superhydrophobic and
          self-cleaning properties of natural surfaces have inspired
          people's extensive research interest. To develop artificial
          superhydrophobic surfaces, one needs to understand the
          complementary effects of two key surface parameters, namely
          surface energy and surface roughness [14-16]. According to
          Young's equation, the surface modification treatment using
          chemical groups with low free energy can effectively increase
          the water contact angle of the solid surface. However, even a
          flat substrate with the lowest surface energy has the highest
          water contact angle of only about 120° [17, 18]. It is well
          known that according to the Cassie model [1], the apparent
          contact angle of a rough solid surface can be described by the
          following formula [2]:<br>
          <br>
          Cosθ C =-1+f s (cosθ flat +1) (1)<br>
          <br>
          Where fs is the portion where the solid is in contact with the
          liquid, and θflat is the contact angle of the water on the
          flat solid surface. Therefore, the introduction of the
          micro/nanostructured surface to obtain the appropriate surface
          roughness is a prerequisite for the generation of
          superhydrophobicity. In recent years, methods have been
          developed to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces with
          micro/nanostructures, including top-down and bottom-up
          methods, such as photolithography, chemical vapor/bath
          deposition [3,19,20], and chemical etching [21 , 22],
          particle/nanostructure self-assembly [9, 23, 24], polymer film
          casting [5] and electrospinning [25, 26]. Recently, Volmer et
          al. used a candle ash film as a microstructure template to
          prepare a transparent superhydrophobic surface [19]. However,
          the existing synthesis methods have difficulty in providing a
          universal superhydrophobic coating on substrates of different
          material compositions and sizes, different shapes and
          structures. The main challenge in this field is still how to
          realize low cost and suitable for large scale Surface
          treatment and superhydrophobic coating with stable
          performance.<br>

          <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The purpose of the present invention is to provide a
          superhydrophobic coating in situ using a hydrogel as a
          micro-structured template and a preparation method thereof.
          Another object of the present invention is to provide a
          processing method such as spray coating, ink jet printing,
          screen printing, and the like applicable to the above
          all-solution synthesis.<br>
          It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
          coating technique for synthesizing a coating that can be
          stretched and maintain superhydrophobicity in a stretched
          state. The object of the invention is also to provide
          applications based on this superhydrophobic coating: materials
          and surface coating materials for efficient oil-water
          separation, in particular fast selective oil absorption
          sponges and oil-water selective separation filters.<br>
          <br>
          Based on a hydrogel micro-structured template-based
          multifunctional superhydrophobic coating (Fig. 1), an (alkyl)
          silicate is added to a hydrogel monomer (precursor) solution,
          and the hydrogel monomer is gelled and After the hydrolysis of
          the silicate, it will spontaneously form a silica
          micro-structured film (thickness is not limited, generally
          from 100 nm to micron), and the self-assembled monomolecular
          film with hydrophobic properties is modified after the silica
          micro-structured film is formed. a superhydrophobic coating;
          the hydrogel monomer is aniline or a derivative thereof, at
          least one of pyrrole or a derivative thereof, and the alkyl
          silicate comprises methyl silicate, ethyl silicate, silicic
          acid At least one of propyl, butyl, or tetrachlorosilane; the
          self-assembled monomolecular material includes alkyl
          chlorosilanes, alkyl siloxanes, fluoroalkyl chlorosilanes, or
          fluoroalkyl siloxanes. At least one of the silylating agents.<br>
          <br>
          The mole ratio of the alkyl silicate to the hydrogel monomer
          is 1:15 to 5:1.<br>
          <br>
          A method for preparing a multifunctional superhydrophobic
          coating based on a hydrogel micro-structured template is made
          by in situ template replication of polyaniline or polyaniline
          derivatives or polypyrrole or polypyrrole derivative hydrogel
          nanostructures; at step one In the following, the precursor
          solution is mixed: solution A, an aqueous solution of an
          oxidation initiator; solution B, aniline or a derivative
          thereof or pyrrole or a derivative thereof, and an aqueous
          solution of a doping acid; solution C, alkyl silicate
          (Tetraethyl silicate TEOS) solution. The aniline or pyrrole
          monomer and the aqueous solution of the doped acid are
          polymerized into a polyaniline acidic hydrogel under the
          action of the solution A. The polymerization and gelation of
          the polyaniline are relatively fast, and the three-dimensional
          multi-layered structure is rapidly formed within 3 minutes.
          Gum; After that, the high water content acidic hydrogel makes
          the TEOS in-situ Belle-Hydrolysis reaction to generate a
          silica layer on the polyaniline nanostructure template. In
          step two, a superhydrophobic surface is created on the silica
          microstructure coating by deposition of a silanized material
          such as octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The method of the
          present invention for hydrogels as a micro-structured template
          can be applied to the surface of various materials, and we
          have made stable preparations on various substrates including
          paper, wood, cotton fabric, cement, glass, metal, plastic and
          rubber. Superhydrophobic coating.<br>
          <br>
          The molar ratio of the tetraethyl silicate to the aniline
          monomer is from 1:15 to 5:1, more preferably from 1:2 to 2:1.
          (According to the experimental summary).<br>
          <br>
          The preferred hydrogel monomer is aniline or pyrrole.<br>
          <br>
          The doped acid is especially a polybasic acid. Of course, an
          organic acid such as acetic acid may be used first. The
          preferred polybasic acid is oxalic acid, phytic acid,
          phosphoric acid, polyvinylphosphonic acid, N-sulfonic acid,
          butyl-3-methylimidazole. At least one of a bisulfate salt,
          N-sulfonic acid butyl pyridine hydrogensulfate or
          1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid.<br>
          <br>
          The oxidation initiator is at least one of persulfate, ferric
          chloride, cupric chloride, silver nitrate, hydrogen peroxide,
          chloroauric acid or ceric ammonium nitrate.<br>
          <br>
          The method for synthesizing the superhydrophobic coating may
          specifically include the following steps:<br>
          <br>
          (1) Formulation of a solution A containing an oxidation
          initiator;<br>
          <br>
          (2) Preparation of a monomer containing solution B;<br>
          <br>
          (3) Prepare a solution C containing tetraethyl silicate;<br>
          <br>
          (4) The above solution is mixed, sprayed or troweled to form a
          film, and the hydrogel is left to stand for a while to form a
          hydrogel. The plastic film is covered thereon to keep the
          moisture. After 5 to 12 hours, the plastic film is peeled off
          to dry the moisture.<br>
          <br>
          (5) The coating is treated with a silanizing agent such as
          octadecyltrichlorosilane to treat the coating as
          superhydrophobic.<br>
          <br>
          Wherein, in the steps (1) and (2), the solution A is an
          aqueous solution, the solution B is an aqueous solution or an
          organic solution, and the doping acid is formulated in the
          solution A and/or the solution B.<br>
          <br>
          After the step (4) is finished, the porous nanostructured film
          is removed from the polyaniline at a temperature slightly
          above 250° C. or reacted with concentrated nitric acid to
          remove the polyaniline to obtain a colorless transparent
          micro-nanostructured silica film, and then the steps are
          repeated (5). After the silanization reaction, a
          superhydrophobic film with a transparency of &gt;98% can be
          obtained.<br>
          <br>
          The mixed solution of step (4) can be sprayed or spin-coated
          on a stretchable rubber, fabric, etc. substrate, and the
          superhydrophobic film obtained after step (5) has
          superhydrophobic properties under the condition of large
          mechanical strain. Capacity, contact angle can be stably
          maintained at 150° under 100% strain.<br>
          <br>
          For the protection of the environment, such as oil spill
          clean-up and industrial oil-containing waste water recovery
          applications, there is an urgent need for highly efficient
          oil/water separation materials. The present coating material
          structure can be used for the manufacture of superoleophobic
          adsorbent materials (including covered sponges or flat
          surfaces, etc.). The specific manufacturing steps are as
          follows:<br>
          <br>
          (5) Preparation of solution A containing oxidant;<br>
          <br>
          (6) Preparation of a monomer containing solution B;<br>
          <br>
          (7) Prepare a solution C containing tetraethyl silicate;<br>
          <br>
          (8) The above solution is mixed, the sponge is impregnated,
          the excess solution is extruded, and the hydrogel is formed by
          standing on the surface of the adsorbent material or on the
          surface for a while, and a plastic film is covered thereon to
          keep moisture. After 5 to 12 hours, the plastic film is peeled
          to dry.<br>
          <br>
          (6) Spraying and impregnating silanization reagents such as
          octadecyltrichlorosilane treat the coating as
          superhydrophobic.<br>
          <br>
          Wherein, in the steps (1) and (2), the solution A is an
          aqueous solution (concentration ranging from 0.2 to 2 M), the
          solution B is an aqueous solution or an organic solution
          (concentration ranging from 0.1 to 2 M), and the polybasic
          acid is prepared in the solution A and/or the solution B
          Medium (polybasic acid volume concentration 10% to 90%).<br>
          The super oil-absorbing sponge prepared from the coating
          material of the present invention can absorb up to 40 times
          its own weight of oil (including gasoline, diesel, vegetable
          oil, kerosene, lubricating oil and crude oil) without
          completely absorbing water. The absorbed oil can be recovered
          by simply extruding the sponge. The super oil-absorbing sponge
          has a stable hydrophobicity and a long cycle life. Even after
          50 cycles of extrusion, it retains a high hydrophobicity and
          high absorption capacity of &gt;160° contact angle. Super oil
          absorbent sponges can work in harsh environments. We placed an
          oil-absorbing superabsorbent sponge in an environment where
          the simulated crude oil layer leaked in the natural
          environment, and used an aqueous solution containing 40g·L
          &lt; -1 &gt; sea salt. The container was placed on a shaker to
          simulate the wave environment with an oscillation of 100rpm. .
          For the collection and application of crude oil spills, it is
          best for the sponge to sink into the water without losing its
          superhydrophobicity, and it will not leak oil under the impact
          of the waves if it is placed in seawater for a long time. Our
          sponges resisted oil spills very well, and those that floated
          on the surface of the water for more than 7 days did not sink
          into water nor leaked oil. This indicates that the sponge
          retains its superhydrophobicity and hardly absorbs seawater
          even when it is in contact with seawater. Our super
          oil-absorbing sponges have the following advantages compared
          to other technologies: easy processing, industrial-scale
          production potential, low cost, high absorption capacity,
          excellent cycle performance, long life, and strong
          adaptability, suitable for use in harsh environments Wait.<br>
          <br>
          The coating can be used for the preparation of super
          oleophobic filters. Specific steps are as follows:<br>
          <br>
          (1) Preparation of solution A containing oxidant;<br>
          <br>
          (2)Formulation of a solution B containing precursors
          (monomers) such as aniline and pyrrole;<br>
          <br>
          (3) Prepare a solution C containing alkyl silicate (tetraethyl
          silicate);<br>
          <br>
          (4) The above solution is mixed, and the stainless steel or
          other wire filter (mesh of the filter mesh is in the range of
          50-200 mesh) is impregnated to remove the excess solution, and
          the hydrogel is formed by standing still on the surface of the
          filter for a moment to cover the plastic thereon. The film
          retains moisture, and the plastic film is removed after 5 to
          12 hours to dry the moisture.<br>
          <br>
          (7) Spraying, impregnating silane-containing reagents such as
          octadecyltrichlorosilane to treat the coating into a
          super-hydrophobic filter.<br>
          <br>
          Wherein, in the steps (1) and (2), the solution A is an
          aqueous solution, the solution B is an aqueous solution or an
          organic solution, and the polybasic acid is formulated in the
          solution A and/or the solution B.<br>
          <br>
          Hydrogel-based self-assembling micro-structured
          superhydrophobic coating materials for (coating) surfaces of
          various materials, including paper, wood, cotton fabric,
          cement, glass, metal, plastic and rubber, are prepared Stable
          super-hydrophobic coating that becomes a hydrophobic material,
          adsorbent material, and mesh functionalized material; or
          silica-based transparent super-hydrophobic coating with a
          microstructure on the lens/substrate surface; mixed solution
          ABC, spray coating, spin coating, Scraping, casting, ink-jet
          printing or screen-printing methods on stretchable rubber,
          fabrics, etc. The resulting superhydrophobic film has the
          ability to retain superhydrophobic properties with large
          mechanical strains. Stretch 100 In the case of strain, the
          contact angle can be stably maintained at 150°.<br>
          <br>
          The beneficial effect of the present invention is that the
          prepared superhydrophobic filter can selectively and
          effectively separate oil from water. The super oleophobic
          filter has surface properties similar to lotus leaf, with a
          contact angle of more than 149°. When the filter is placed at
          the oil-water interface, the oil can pass through the filter
          and water cannot pass through. Oils such as gasoline, diesel
          oil, vegetable oil, kerosene, and engine oil were successfully
          separated from the water and the separation efficiency
          exceeded 90%. The water content of the separated oil is less
          than 0.04%. The new oil-water separation filter has low
          manufacturing costs and industrial-scale manufacturing, and
          has great potential advantages for filter processing of oil
          production and oil spills.<br>

          <b> </b><br>
          The superhydrophobic coating is synthesized as follows:<br>
          <br>
          Step 1, configure the solution (A, C) from water, oxidant, and
          silicic acid. The oxidizing agent is preferably ammonium
          persulfate (concentration ranging from 0.2 to 2 M), but other
          oxidizing agents such as ferric chloride, copper chloride,
          silver nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, chloroauric acid, and other
          persulfate derivatives are also used. For example, Na 2 S 2 O
          8 and K 2 S 2 O 8 ; silicic acid (ethyl silicate, such as
          tetraethylorthosilicate, tetraethyl silicate TEOS) solution is
          preferably ethyl orthosilicate, but other silicon Acid
          solutions such as silicon tetrachloride are also used.<br>
          <br>
          Step 2. The monomers and the acid are dissolved in water or an
          organic solvent to constitute a monomer solution B
          (concentration ranging from 0.2 to 2M). In the examples
          monomer aniline, but other carbon-based organic monomers may
          also be used, such as pyrrole, thiophene and aniline
          derivatives such as anisidine, methylaniline, ethylaniline,
          o-alkoxyaniline and 2 ,5-dialkoxyaniline monomers,
          respectively, for the synthesis of polypyrrole, polythiophene,
          polymethoxyaniline, polymethylaniline, polyethylaniline,
          polyalkoxyanilide, poly 2,5- For example, dialkoxyanilines and
          the like. The polymerization of the above polymers under the
          action of an oxide initiator is a prior art.<br>
          <br>
          The effect of polybasic doped acid is preferably phytic acid,
          phosphoric acid and polyvinylphosphoric acid containing a
          phosphate group, but other small molecule acids of
          multifunctionality (functionality ≥ 2, molecular weight ≤ 800)
          can also be used, such as 1, 2,4,5-Benzenetetracarboxylic
          acid, N-sulfonic acid butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen
          sulfate, N-sulfonic acid butylpyridinium hydrogen sulfate and
          the like. The polybasic acid concentration range is 0.1-2M. In
          embodiments, the aniline monomer and phytic acid can be
          dissolved in water after mixing.<br>
          <br>
          Step 3, place the monomer solution in the reaction vessel. The
          capacity of the container can be large or small according to
          actual needs. Large-scale containers can be used to realize
          mass production of polymer hydrogel, and can also be cast into
          different shapes of hydrogel materials in various shapes of
          containers.<br>
          <br>
          Step 4, the silicic acid solution is dissolved in an organic
          solvent to constitute a silicic acid solution (the volume
          concentration of silicic acid is 10% to 90%). In the examples,
          isopropanol, but other organic solvents can also be used, such
          as n-propanol;<br>
          <br>
          In step 5, the oxidant solution and the monomer solution are
          mixed, and then mixed with the silicic acid solution. After
          the mixture is mixed, rapid shaking is performed to uniformly
          mix the aqueous solution and the organic solution.<br>

          Step 6, standing (at least 6h to several days), forming a
          polyaniline hydrogel in a few minutes, at the same time can be
          observed that the solution color turns dark green, there will
          be a small amount of unmixed organic solvent left on the top
          of the gel A layer of plastic film is placed on the surface of
          the gel to prevent evaporation of water, and it is allowed to
          stand for a long time to ensure that silicic acid has enough
          time to hydrolyze to generate silica.<br>
          <br>
          Step 7, purification of the hydrogel. The hydrogel material is
          dialyzed or ion exchanged in deionized water, distilled water
          to remove excess ions. Silica-coated phytic acid-doped
          polyaniline pure hydrogels were finally obtained. In this
          step, the hydrogel can also be dedoped with ammonia to remove
          phytic acid. Dedoping does not destroy the hydrogel structure
          because the porous polyaniline backbone can already retain its
          shape.<br>
          <br>
          Step 8. The hydrogel is dried at room temperature or in a dry
          box (&lt;70° C.) and after thorough drying, the surface is
          modified with a solution with a low surface energy. In the
          examples, octadecyltrichlorosilane is used. Low-surface-energy
          solutions can also be used, such as
          perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane, perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane,
          perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane, and other fluorine-containing
          or chlorosilanes. Phase and gas phase method. In the
          embodiment, the liquid phase treatment method uses n-heptane
          as the solute, and other organic solute such as n-octane,
          n-hexadecane and the like can also be used.<br>

          at room temperature or in a drying oven and treated with an
          octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) solution to obtain a green
          superhydrophobic super-lipophilic sponge with water contact
          angles reached. 164°.<br>

          Separately prepare gasoline, diesel, motor oil, kerosene and
          crude oil. Taking gasoline as an example, in order to
          distinguish between aqueous solutions, use Sudan Blue to dye
          gasoline, and then add 50 ml of gasoline to a beaker of 100 ml
          of deionized water. The gasoline will float on the water and
          the processed sponge will be dropped into a beaker. The sponge
          was found to quickly absorb petrol, floated on the water after
          saturation and did not sink. Then use the balance to weigh the
          sponge, subtract the original net weight of the sponge is the
          sponge's oil absorption capacity. For gasoline, diesel, oil,
          kerosene and crude oil, the treated sponge can absorb oil
          equivalent to 40 times its own weight. After the oil is
          sucked, the oil can be extruded and reused by simply squeezing
          it.<br>

            circulation ability</b><br>
          <br>
          Firstly, 1 ml of an aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate
          oxidizer containing 0.286 g was placed, an aqueous monomer
          solution in which aniline (0.458 ml) and phytic acid (0.921
          ml) were mixed, and isopropyl alcohol (0.5 ml) and ethyl
          orthosilicate (0.263 ml) were disposed. . The three solutions
          are then mixed and shaken immediately after mixing. The mixed
          solution is then poured into a container containing the sponge
          that has been cleaned, and the sponge is squeezed to absorb
          the mixed solution as much as possible. Within a few minutes,
          the polymerization reaction took place and the polyaniline
          hydrogel was formed inside the sponge and on the outer wall.
          The film was covered with a plastic film to keep moisture.
          After 12 hours, the plastic film was removed and the sponge
          was soaked in deionized water for several minutes. A
          hydrogel-covered sponge can be obtained. The sponge is dried
          at room temperature or in a drying oven and treated with an
          octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) solution to obtain a green
          superhydrophobic super-lipophilic sponge. The water contact
          angle is reached. 164°.<br>
          <br>
          Taking gasoline as an example, in order to distinguish between
          aqueous solutions, use Sudan Blue to dye gasoline, and then
          add 50ml of gasoline to a beaker of 100ml of deionized water.
          Gasoline floats on the surface of the water, and the processed
          sponge is thrown into a beaker. The sponge was found to
          quickly absorb petrol, floated on the water after saturation
          and did not sink. Then use the balance to weigh the sponge,
          subtract the original net weight of the sponge is the sponge's
          oil absorption capacity. After the oil is sucked, the oil can
          be squeezed out by simply squeezing it. The squeezed sponge is
          allowed to stand at room temperature. Since the gasoline can
          easily evaporate, the sponge can be easily reused, or the hair
          dryer can be used to accelerate the drying of the sponge.
          Repeat the oil suction 10-50 times with the same sponge and
          measure its contact angle. It can be obtained that the sponge
          retains its superhydrophobic properties after 50 cycles of oil
          absorption, and the contact angle is &gt;150°.<br>

          Firstly, 1 ml of an aqueous solution of ammonium persulfate
          oxidizer containing 0.286 g was placed, an aqueous monomer
          solution in which aniline (0.458 ml) and phytic acid (0.921

          are then mixed and shaken immediately after mixing. The mixed
          solution is then poured into a container where the cleaned
          wire mesh has been placed, and the wire mesh is pressed so
          that it contacts all of the mixed solution as much as
          possible. Within a few minutes, the polymerization reaction
          takes place and the polyaniline hydrogel is formed on the
          outer wall of the steel wire mesh, covered with a plastic film
          to retain moisture, and after 12 hours the plastic film is
          peeled off and the wire mesh is soaked in deionized water for
          several minutes. A hydrogel-coated steel wire mesh can be
          obtained, the steel wire mesh is dried at room temperature or
          in a drying box, and treated with an octadecyltrichlorosilane
          (OTS) solution to obtain a green super-hydrophobic
          super-hydrophilic steel mesh, water The contact angle reaches
          149°.<br>

          Separately prepare gasoline, diesel, motor oil, kerosene and
          crude oil. Taking gasoline as an example, in order to
          distinguish between aqueous solutions, gasoline is dyed with
          Sudan Blue, and then 100 ml of gasoline is added to a beaker
          of 100 ml of deionized water. Place the superhydrophobic wire
          mesh treated in the middle of the mouths of the two containers
          and clamp them with a clip. Pour the mixture of gasoline and
          water from the above container, preferably with a glass rod,
          due to the super-hydrophobic superfluous wire mesh. With
          lipophilic properties, gasoline flows through the wire mesh
          into the lower container and water remains in the upper
          container. For petrol, diesel, oil, and kerosene, the treated
          steel mesh can achieve a separation efficiency of more than
          90%, depending on the mixed solution pouring speed.<br>
