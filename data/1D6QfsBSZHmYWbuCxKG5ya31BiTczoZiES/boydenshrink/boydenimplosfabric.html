<br>
MIT researchers have created a real life 'shrink ray' that can reduce
3D structures to one thousandth of their original size.<br>
<br>
Scientists can put all kinds of useful materials in the polymer before
they shrink it, including metals, quantum dots, and DNA.<br>
<br>
The process - called implosion fabrication - is essentially the
opposite of expansion microscopy, which is widely used by scientists to
create 3D visualisations of microscopic cells.<br>
<br>
Instead of making things bigger, scientists attach special molecules
which block negative charges between molecules so they no longer repel
which makes them contract.<br>
<br>
Experts say that making such tiny structures could be useful in many
fields, including in medicine and for creating nanoscale robotics. <br>
<br>
MIT researchers have created a real life 'shrink ray' that can reduce
3D structures (pictured) to one thousandth of their original size<br>
<br>
'It's a way of putting nearly any kind of material into a 3-D pattern
with nanoscale precision,' said Edward Boyden, an associate professor
of biological engineering and of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT.<br>
<br>
Using the new technique, researchers can create any shape and structure
they want, according to the paper published in Science.<br>
<br>
The method can create lots of different shapes, including tiny hollow
spheres to microscopic chains. <br>
<br>
After attaching useful materials to the polymer 'scaffold', they shrink
it, generating structures one thousandth the volume of the original.<br>
<br>
The researchers shrank hollow linked cubes and an Alice in Wonderland
etching using the method. <br>
<br>
Scientists say the technique uses equipment that many biology and
materials science labs already have, making it widely accessible for
researchers who want to try it.<br>
<br>
Currently scientists are able to directly print 3D nanonscale objects.<br>
<br>
However, this is only possible with specialised materials like polymers
and plastics which have limited applications.<br>

Researchers shrank an Alice in Wonderland etching using the
method.&nbsp; Scientists say the technique uses equipment that many
biology and materials science labs already have, making it widely
accessible for researchers who want to try it<br>
<br>
To overcome this, researchers decided to adapt a technique that was
developed a few years ago for high-resolution imaging of brain tissue.<br>
<br>
This technique, known as expansion microscopy, involves embedding
tissue into a hydrogel and then expanding it.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of research groups in biology and medicine are now using
expansion microscopy as it enables 3D visualisation of cells and
tissues with ordinary hardware.<br>
<br>
The new technique involves reversing the process. <br>
<br>
By doing this, scientists could create large-scale objects embedded in
expanded hydrogels and then shrink them to the nanoscale.<br>
<br>
They call this approach 'implosion fabrication.'<br>
<br>
Just like they did in expansion microscopy, the researchers used a very
absorbent material made of polyacrylate. This is a plastic commonly
found in nappies.<br>
<br>
Scientists can put all kinds of useful materials in the polymer before
they shrink it such as metals, quantum dots and DNA. Pictured is the
machine used to shrink objects <br>
<br>
The polyacrylate forms the scaffold over which other materials can be
attached.<br>
<br>
It is then bathed in a solution that contains molecules of fluorescein,
which attach to the scaffold when they are activated by laser light.<br>
<br>
Then, they use two-photon microscopy to target points deep within the
structure.<br>
<br>
They attach fluorescein molecules to these specific locations within
the gel.<br>
<br>
These acts as anchors that bind to other types of molecules that are in
the structure.<br>
<br>
'You attach the anchors where you want with light, and later you can
attach whatever you want to the anchors,' Dr Boyden said.<br>
<br>
'It could be a quantum dot, it could be a piece of DNA, it could be a
gold nanoparticle.'<br>
<br>
Researchers think these nanobjects could be used to create better
lenses for cell phone cameras, microscopes (stock image), or endoscopes<br>
<br>
Researchers think these nanobjects could be used to create better
lenses for cell phone cameras, microscopes (stock image), or endoscopes<br>
<br>
Once the desired molecules are attached in the right locations, the
researchers shrink the entire structure by adding an acid.<br>
<br>
The acid blocks the negative charges in the polyacrylate gel so that
they no longer repel each other, causing the gel to contract.<br>
<br>
Using this technique, researchers can shrink the objects 10-fold in
each dimension (for an overall 1,000-fold reduction in volume).<br>
<br>
This ability to shrink not only allows for increased resolution, but
also makes it possible to assemble materials in a low-density scaffold.<br>
<br>
This means it can be easily modified and later the material becomes a
dense solid when it is shrunk. <br>
<br>
Researchers think these nanobjects could be used to create better
lenses for cell phone cameras, microscopes, or endoscopes. <br>
<br>
Farther in the future, researchers say that this approach could be used
to build nanoscale electronics or robots.<br>

Although a range of materials can now be fabricated using additive
manufacturing techniques, these usually involve assembly of a series of
stacked layers, which restricts three-dimensional (3D) geometry. Oran
et al. developed a method to print a range of materials, including
metals and semiconductors, inside a gel scaffold (see the Perspective
by Long and Williams). When the hydrogels were dehydrated, they shrunk
10-fold, which pushed the feature sizes down to the nanoscale.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
Lithographic nanofabrication is often limited to successive fabrication
of two-dimensional (2D) layers. We present a strategy for the direct
assembly of 3D nanomaterials consisting of metals, semiconductors, and
biomolecules arranged in virtually any 3D geometry. We used hydrogels
as scaffolds for volumetric deposition of materials at defined points
in space. We then optically patterned these scaffolds in three
dimensions, attached one or more functional materials, and then shrank
and dehydrated them in a controlled way to achieve nanoscale feature
sizes in a solid substrate. We demonstrate that our process, Implosion
Fabrication (ImpFab), can directly write highly conductive, 3D silver
nanostructures within an acrylic scaffold via volumetric silver
deposition. Using ImpFab, we achieve resolutions in the tens of
nanometers and complex, non&#8211;self-supporting 3D geometries of interest
for optical metamaterials.<br>

The present invention enables three-dimensional nanofabrication by
isotropic shrinking of patterned hydrogels. A hydrogel is first
expanded, the rate of expansion being controlled by the concentration
of the crosslinker. The hydrogel is then infused with a reactive group
and patterned in three dimensions using a photon beam through a
limited-diffraction microscope. Functional particles or materials are
then deposited on the pattern. The hydrogel is then shrunk and cleaved
from the pattern.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0003] The ability to assemble custom three-dimensional patterns of
functional materials over millimeter scales with nanometer resolution
would have wide-ranging impact in areas such as photonics and materials
science&lt;1-5&gt;. One approach to this problem would be to assemble
the material at a more accessible length scale before shrinking it to
the desired size. All shrinking methods to date have either been
anisotropic&lt;6-8&gt;, or have relied on compositional changes in the
substrate under extreme conditions&lt;9&gt;, which limits the range of
functional materials that can be used. Here, inspiration is drawn from
the coil-globule transition in polymers: hydrogels are known to undergo
volumetric phase transitions in response to mild environmental changes
that alter the balance of interactions between polymer chains and the
solvent&lt;10-12&gt;. However, to date, the isotropy of this shrinking
process has not been characterized.<br>
<br>
[0004] Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method wherein
precision millimeter to nanoscale fabrication is enabled through
three-dimensional patterning of hydrogels with functional materials
through the use of diffraction-limited microscopy and optionally,
sizing of the patterning through isotropic shrinking.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0005] The present invention provides a method for the assembly of
custom patterns in up to three dimensions of functional materials over
millimeter scales with nanometer resolution. In one embodiment, a
material (e.g., a gel) is photo-patterned with functional materials. In
one embodiment, the photo-patterning can be performed using ordinary
two-photon microscopes.<br>
<br>
[0006] The present invention provides a method for photo-patterning
below the classical diffraction limit. In one embodiment, the custom
three-dimensional patterns of functional materials are assembled at a
more accessible scale and then subsequently shrunk. In one embodiment,
10,000-fold volumetric shrinkage of polyacrylate hydrogels is
sufficiently isotropic to preserve embedded patterns of functional
materials with nanoscale precision. It is demonstrated that
photo-patterning such a gel with functional materials using a
diffraction-limited microscope, and then shrinking it, yields designed
3-D objects with feature sizes in the tens of nanometers. This
technology, termed Implosion Fabrication (ImpFab), supports the
anchoring of nanoparticles, proteins, DNA, and small molecules with
nanoscale precision over length scales of hundreds of microns to
millimeters, and may open up many new possibilities in the programmable
fabrication of complex nanomaterials.<br>

[0011] FIG. 4. Linear shrink factors measured for gels patterned with
fluorescein-cysteamine, with 10&times; and 20&times; gels (n=5 each).
Mean&plusmn;standard deviation is plotted, with dots indicating
individual gels. Fluorescein-cysteamine solution was observed to cause
the 0.0172% crosslinker gels to shrink slightly when delivered in the
expanded state.<br>
<br>
[0012] FIG. 5A-F. Patterning intensity as a function of the laser power
and line scanning. During patterning, bleaching of fluorescein was
observed in the patterned region, followed by fluorescence recovery.
Remarkably, some percentage of fluorophores retained their fluorescence
even after covalently binding to the gel, leaving behind an immediate
visual confirmation of patterning (&#8220;fluorescein ghosts&#8221;) and allowing
us to estimate a lower bound on the concentration of binding sites
produced during patterning. By comparing the brightness of the
patterned region to the background, a lower bound on concentration can
be derived. The concentration of molecules that could subsequently be
bound to the gel, in the functionalization step, as judged from the
fluorescence of Atto 647N-NHS bound to patterns of aminomethyl
fluorescein, was found to be controllable by varying the laser power
used during patterning, or by scanning each line of the pattern
multiple times. Above a certain power, however, the fluorescence of
fluorescein patterned into the gel saturated, and the fluorescence of
Atto 647N bound to the fluorescein decreased. It is unclear whether
this is the result of an effect on the patterning process at higher
laser powers, or a consequence of having very high concentrations of
Atto 647N. The power necessary to observe saturation depended on a
variety of factors, such as the pixel dwell time and the number of
times each voxel was exposed during patterning. The fluorescence of
bound aminomethyl fluorescein observed by excitation at 780 nm
immediately after patterning, given as a signal to background ratio,
for the case of rastering over a single plane (5A), or rastering over a
Z stack with 2 &#956;m Z steps (5B). (5C) An example pattern used to
generate the plots shown in (5A) and (5B); each square corresponds to a
different laser power. (The square in the upper right corner was
excluded from analysis, because it was patterned with an incorrect
laser power.) (5D,5E) The fluorescence of bound Atto 647N after
attachment to the amine groups patterned in (5A) and (5B). (5F) Example

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
[0025] The terms &#8220;a&#8221;, &#8220;an&#8221; and &#8220;the&#8221; as used herein are defined to mean
&#8220;one or more&#8221; and include the plural unless the context is
inappropriate.<br>
<br>
[0026] The present invention provides a method for nanofabrication of
patterns in up to three dimensions of functional materials within a
hydrogel over millimeter scales with nanometer resolution.<br>
<br>
[0027] The terms &#8220;polymer gel material&#8221; or &#8220;swellable polymer gel
material&#8221; generally refer to a material that expands when contacted
with a liquid, such as water or other solvent. The swellable polymer
gel material uniformly expands in three dimensions. Additionally or
alternatively, the material is transparent such that, upon expansion,
light can pass through it.<br>
<br>
[0028] In a first embodiment, the invention provides a method
comprising the steps of:<br>
a) providing a polymer gel material; and<br>
b) infusing the polymer gel material with at least one reactive group;
and<br>
c) illuminating selected voxels within the polymer gel material to
yield a pattern of reactive group sites anchored to the polymer gel
material; and<br>
d) removing excess reactive groups from the polymer gel material; and<br>
e) depositing functional molecules or nanoparticles on the reactive
group sites.<br>
<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, the pattern is three-dimensional.<br>
<br>
[0035] In a preferred embodiment, the polymer gel material comprises a
polyectrolyte. One or more polymerizable materials, monomers or
oligomers can be used, such as monomers selected from the group
consisting of water soluble groups containing a polymerizable
ethylenically unsaturated group. Monomers or oligomers can comprise one
or more substituted or unsubstituted methacrylates, acrylates,
acrylamides, methacrylamides, vinylalcohols, vinylamines, allylamines,
allylalcohols, including divinylic crosslinkers thereof, (e.g., N,
N-alkylene bisacrylamides). Precursors can also comprise polymerization
initiators, accelerators, inhibitors, buffers, salts and crosslinkers.<br>
<br>
[0036] In another embodiment, the reactive group is attached to the
polymer gel material by a reaction between a fluorophore compound and
the polymer gel material.<br>
<br>
[0037] In yet another embodiment, the polymer gel material is
swellable. The swellable polymer gel material may be polyacrylate and
copolymers or crosslinked copolymers thereof. Alternatively or
additionally, the swellable polymer gel material can be formed by
chemically crosslinking water soluble oligomers or polymers. For
example, if the swellable polymer gel material is to be a sodium
polyacrylate polymer material, a solution comprising the monomers
sodium acrylate and acrylamide, and a crosslinker selected from
N,N&#8242;-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS),
N,N&#8242;-(1,2-Dihydroxythylene)bisacrylamide), and (DHEBA)
N,N&#8242;-Bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC) is activated to form sodium
polyacrylate or copolymer thereof.<br>
<br>
[0038] The swellable polymer gel material may optionally be expanded to
yield an expanded material. The rate of expansion may be controlled by
varying the concentration of the crosslinker.<br>
<br>
[0039] In another embodiment, the expanded material may optionally be
shrunk to yield a shrunken material. Doing so increases the density of
the functional molecules and increases the resolution of the pattern.
Shrinking of the expanded material may be achieved by any means known
by a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, shrinking the
expanded material may be achieved by exposing the expanded material to
high salt or hydrochloric acid. Where hydrochloric acid was used to
shrink the expanded material, the shrunken material may be dehydrated.<br>
<br>
[0040] In still another embodiment, the polymer gel material comprises
acrylate and acrylamide as co-monomers.<br>
<br>
[0041] In another embodiment, the crosslinker of the polymer gel
material comprises N,N&#8242;-methylenebisacrylamide.<br>
<br>
[0042] In yet another embodiment, illuminating of the polymer gel
material is performed using a diffraction-limited microscope.
Preferably the type of illumination is 2-photon absorption.<br>
<br>
[0043] In another embodiment, the polymer gel material is stained with
a conjugate comprising biotin. This is done after illuminating the
polymer gel material and formation of the reactive group sites. The
biotin conjugate binds with the amine groups of the fluorophore
compound.<br>
<br>
[0044] In a further embodiment, the polymer gel material is stained
with a reagent comprising streptavidin. The reagent may further
comprise metal nanoparticles such as gold nanoparticles. Excess
streptavidin may be washed out of the polymer gel material.<br>
<br>
[0045] In another embodiment, growth or enhancement of the metal
nanoparticles in situ is achieved through deposition of metal in an
aqueous phase on the metal particles. For example, an enhancement
solution comprising silver may be applied to the polymer gel material
causing deposition or growth of silver on top of the metal
nanoparticles.<br>
<br>
[0046] In yet another embodiment, the metal nanoparticles are sintered.
Sintering methods may comprise application of electrical current across
the metal nanoparticles (FIG. 12), use of a laser (FIGS. 10 and 11),
and plasma etching (FIG. 13).<br>
<br>
[0047] In another embodiment, a portion of the polymer gel material may
be removed. Removal methods may comprise use of a laser. The polymer
gel material may optionally be removed while it is being infused (FIG.
15), or after it has been shrunken and dehydrated (FIG. 14).<br>
<br>
[0048] In another embodiment and as shown in FIG. 16, illuminating the
polymer gel material alters its refractive index and allows writing
refractive index gradients into the polymer gel material.<br>
<br>
[0049] In still another embodiment, the functional materials further
comprise semiconductor nanocrystals passivated with a polymer. Examples
of semiconductor nanocrystals include but are not limited to, cadmium
telluride nanoparticles and cadmium selenide nanoparticles.<br>
<br>
[0050] Other embodiments contemplate multiplex patterning as shown in
FIG. 17, wherein previously described methods are used and repeated on
the same sample of polymer gel material such that the reactive groups
formed between iterations are distinct. This multiplex patterning
therefore allows deposition of distinct functional molecules on the
distinct reactive groups between iterations to the next.<br>
<br>
[0051] In a combined embodiment, the present invention provides a
method for photo patterning below the classical diffraction limit. In
one embodiment, the custom three-dimensional patterns of functional
materials are assembled at a more accessible scale and then
subsequently shrunk.<br>
<br>
[0052] The present invention will be better understood in connection
with the following Examples. However, it should be understood that
these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to
limit the scope of the invention. Various changes and modifications
will be apparent to those skilled in the art and such changes and
modifications including, without limitation, those relating to the
formulations and/or methods of the invention may be made without
departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the
appended claims.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Examples</span><br>
<br>
[0053] As used herein, the term &#8220;swellable material&#8221; generally refers
to a material that expands when contacted with a liquid, such as water
or other solvent. Preferably, the swellable material uniformly expands
in three dimensions. Additionally or alternatively, the material is
transparent such that, upon expansion, light can pass through the
material. Preferably, the swellable material is a swellable polymer or
hydrogel.<br>
<br>
[0054] Polyelectrolyte hydrogels are well known for their ability to
expand and shrink up to &#771;10-fold in linear dimension in response to
changes in temperature, pH, salt concentration, or electric field
strength.&lt;10,13 &gt;Gel expansion was recently shown to preserve,
with nanometer precision, the three-dimensional arrangement of
molecules covalently bound to a gel matrix, likely due to the fine mesh
size ( &#771;1-2 nm) of such polymer gels&lt;14-16&gt;. The question of
whether gel shrinkage could achieve fine resolutions was assessed,
following covalent attachment of materials to targeted sites in the gel
matrix. Polyelectrolyte hydrogels were synthesized via free-radical
polymerization of sodium acrylate (with acrylamide as co-monomer and
N,N&#8242;-methylenebisacrylamide as crosslinker). Dialyzing the sample in
water causes expansion, with the expansion factor set by the
crosslinker concentration (e.g., 0.075% and 0.0172% resulted in gels
that expanded by 5&times; and 10&times; respectively). After dialysis,
expanded gels were infused with fluorescein bearing a reactive group
for further functionalization (e.g., an amine). Two-photon illumination
of a voxel within the gel using a commercial microscope caused
fluorescein to bind at that site in the polymer matrix (FIG. 1A). Sites
illuminated could then be functionalized by attaching molecules or
nanoparticles to the reactive groups anchored to the gel (FIG. 1B).
Finally, the gel was shrunken via exposure to high salt, or to
hydrochloric acid. Acid treated gels were subsequently dehydrated
resulting in an anhydrous state (FIG. 1C). Data showed that the gels,
and the patterns within (FIG. 1D, E), were able to implode consistently
by a linear factor (FIG. 1H) of 10.6&plusmn;0.8 for 0.075% crosslinker
gels (mean standard deviation, n=5 gels), or 20.1&plusmn;2.9 for
0.0172% crosslinker gels (n=4 gels). The final dehydrated gel was
transparent (FIG. 1F), and flexible. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
characterization of the surface of the shrunken gel measured the
surface roughness over a 1&times;1 &#956;m window to be 0.19 nm (root-mean
square (RMS); FIG. 1G).<br>
<br>
[0055] To validate the resolution of implosion fabrication, a test
pattern was designed containing pairs of single-voxel-thick (i.e., as
patterned with a two-photon microscope performing line scans) lines to
assess post-shrink resolution (FIG. 2A, B). Since such post-shrinkage
features are by definition smaller than the diffraction limited voxel
used to do the photopatterning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was
used to assess the resolution post-shrink. 0.075% cross-linker
concentration gel (10&times; implosion factor), and patterned with
fluorescein-cysteamine was used to create SEM contrast, so that 1.4 nm
diameter gold nanoparticles bearing a maleimide group could be added in
the functionalization step.<br>
<br>
[0056] Resolution was estimated by measuring the line width (full width
at half maximum) (FIG. 2E, F, G), and obtained a value of
59.6&plusmn;3.8 nm (mean&plusmn;standard deviation across samples; n=5;
FIG. 2H) for 0.075% cross-linker concentration gels (10&times; shrink).
Within-sample variations for individual lines were estimated
(calculated as the standard deviation across lines within a sample),
and found to be 8.3 nm (averaged across the 5 samples). These errors
include any errors caused by charging of the gels under SEM, which
alters contrast as noted above (FIGS. 7A, 7B). In attempting to measure
the resolution with the 20&times;-shrinking gel (as demonstrated in
FIG. 1), which could potentially push the resolution down to 30 nm or
smaller, it was found that the lines did not present sufficient
signal-to-noise to measure in SEM.<br>
<br>
[0057] The isotropy of the implosion process (FIGS. 2C, 2D) was
estimated by calculating the ratio of the longest diameter of the
patterned circle, to the orthogonal diameter. The percent distortion
thus calculated was 6.8&plusmn;6.9% for 0.075% cross-linker
concentration (mean&plusmn;standard deviation, n=6 gels), and
8.2&plusmn;4.3% for 0.0172% crosslinker concentration (n=4 gels). Thus
the nanoscale resolution achieved over fine scales is matched with good
feature preservation over longer length scales. It was estimated that
binding sites could be patterned into the gel at concentrations around
10-100 &#956;M in the expanded state, leading to a final concentration on
the order of 0.1-1M in the shrunken state (FIGS. 5A-5F), or roughly
10&lt;20 &gt;binding sites per cubic centimeter. It was observed that
altering the index of refraction of the shrunken gel through patterning
(FIG. 6) was possible, potentially attributable the high density of
binding sites.<br>
<br>
[0058] Having established both the resolutions achievable and the
volumes addressable, it was necessary to demonstrate some examples of
fabrication of 3-D patterns created without restrictions on the
connectedness, periodicity, regularity, or aspect ratio of the
patterns. Patterns were fabricated, such as a maze (FIGS. 3A, 3B), and
an image of Alice in Wonderland (FIG. 3E). The generality of the
patterning chemistry of implosion fabrication allows for diverse
materials to be attached to the gel, even in series after a single
patterning step. For example, after first functionalizing aminomethyl
fluorescein patterns with NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide ester)-biotin, a
second functionalization was performed with fluorescent streptavidin,
followed by a third round of biotinylated DNA (FIG. 3C). A
face-segmented cube (FIG. 3D) was fabricated, as an example of a 3-D
pattern. In short, the decoupling of patterning chemistry from
functionalization chemistry enabled by the described modular shrinking
process design can support a wide variety of final fabricated objects,
with the potential for virtually unlimited extension both with more
advanced optics as well as new functional groups.<br>
<br>
[0059] Because diffraction limited optical patterning can go quite
fast, driven by innovations in the field of high speed imaging, it was
anticipated that large volumes could be rapidly patterned with
conventional hardware. Using a commercially available two-photon
microscope which scans femtosecond laser pulses across a sample with
mirror galvanometers, a linear point scanning speed of 40 cm/s was
achieved in expanded gels (using a lens/optical zoom combination that
yielded 0.35 &#956;m spot size); faster scanning using acousto-optic
deflectors, resonant scanners, and other hardware could accelerate the
scanning up to the fundamental limits of laser operation, or enable
random-access scanning or patterning&lt;17&gt;. Even with a
conventional microscope, objects were created with post-shrink
dimensions spanning hundreds of microns to millimeters, with the laser
scanning taking minutes to hours (FIG. 3F), with the speed determined
by the volume and not the complexity of the pattern.<br>
<br>
[0060] Experiments yielded specimens that are shrunken by
10&lt;3&gt;-10&lt;4 &gt;fold in volume, which achieve a final
resolution (as defined as FWHM of shrunken single-voxel lines) of &#771;60
nm. In principle, a combination of super-resolution optical patterning
such as two-photon stimulated emission depletion (STED), followed by
implosion, could improve the post-shrink resolution to &#771;2-5 nm.
Hydrogels have previously been used as substrates for 2-photon
photopatterning with diffraction limited resolution&lt;18-22&gt;,
allowing the current study to potentially extend a variety of earlier
studies with nanofabrication capability. In addition, the functional
materials utilized may be easily extensible beyond the nanoparticles,
small molecules, and biomolecules here used, potentially enabling new
kinds of optical metamaterial or electronic circuit to be
created&lt;23&gt;. The demonstrated ability to create patterns made out
of DNA might rapidly enable implosion fabrication to serve various
roles including extending the range of fabrication of DNA
nanostructures, and enabling creation of new kinds of DNA array for
biotechnology&lt;24-26&gt;.<br>
<br>
[0061] Implosion fabrication combines top-down specification of binding
locations with bottom-up assembly of materials inside the hydrogel.
Implosion fabrication uses only common, commercially available
photopatterning equipment and mild, aqueous chemical processes, yet
achieves nanoscale 3D patterning. Uniquely among nanofabrication
processes, in implosion fabrication, the voxel size is determined by
the shrinkage of the substrate, not by the intrinsic physics of the
patterning process, allowing us to break the diffraction limit for
optical patterning. The ultimate resolution of implosion fabrication
may be improved through further engineering of the hydrogel or the
shrink process. Here, it is already shown that reducing the amount of
crosslinker used in forming the gels allowed an increase in volumetric
shrink factor by an order of magnitude. By tuning the gel components
further, it may be possible to achieve yet greater shrink factors and
hence smaller feature sizes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0062] Growth of 3D Metal Structures
in the Gel&#8212;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0063] Many functional devices can be created out of 3D metal
structures. This includes antennas, electronic circuits, photonic
metamaterials, and resonant cavities (including lasers). A process to
metallize 3D patterns created inside the gel was developed. The gel is
patterned using aminomethyl fluorescein. Following patterning, the gel
is stained with an NHS-biotin conjugate, attaching biotin specifically
to the amine groups on the patterned fluorescein. The gel is then
stained with streptavidin carrying a 1.4 nm gold nanoparticle. Excess
streptavidin is washed out of the gel. A silver enhancement solution is
then applied that deposits silver on top of the gold nanoparticle.
After immersing the gel in the silver enhancement solution, the 1.4 nm
gold nanoparticle grows to approximately 20 nm in diameter. Then, upon
shrinking the gel, the 20 nm nanoparticles come into close contact with
each other (FIG. 8). Testing confirms conductivity across silver
nanowires created in this way (FIG. 9). This opens the way to direct
writing of arbitrary 3D metal structures with &#771;30 nm resolution.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0064] Sintering to Create Solid Metal
Structures&#8212;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0065] The metallization process as described above results in the
creation of very dense patterns of metal nanoparticles. However, the
structures created in the way described above are not yet solid metal.
In order to achieve the creation of solid metal structures, it is
necessary to fuse the nanoparticles by sintering.<br>
<br>
Examples of sintering that are compatible with previously described
methods:<br>
1. Application of electrical current across the metal structure. This
superheats the metal instantaneously, allowing the nanoparticles to
diffuse into each other. Testing shows that applying current of 100
uA-1 mA over 1 second is sufficient to cause sintering. The current may
be applied using a probe station.<br>
2. Illuminating the gel with a titanium sapphire laser at 780 nm. The
laser is focused to a &#771;500 nm spot and scanned across the sample. Using
approximately 60 mW of power at 780 nm, and illuminating each reactive
site for approximately 1 microsecond provided the desired result.
Three-dimensional structures may be sintered this way.<br>
3. Plasma etching&#8212;when an enhanced sample is left inside an oxygen
plasma cleaner/etcher for ten minutes the nanoparticles melt to form a
solid metal structure.<br>
Combined with etching, these methods will allow for the creation of
free standing 3D metal structures which could open up possibilities for
nano- and micro-electromechanical systems. The sintered material can
also be made highly porous, and would thus be suitable for batteries.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0070] Controlled Removal of Gel
Material&#8212;</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0071] The processes described above result in solid metal structures
that are nonetheless contained inside of the gel, which limits their
utility for some applications. It was discovered that gel material may
be selectively removed by exposing it with the 2-photon microscope at
780 nm. Two methods were tested:<br>
1. Material is removed from the gel by exposing the gel to high laser
power after it has been shrunken and dehydrated. This removes the gel
material specifically in the region that was immersed. Experiments
validated that it is possible to release solid metal structures created
as described above from the gel. Experiments also showed that it is
possible to remove material all the way through the gel in this way,
i.e., to create holes in the gel.<br>
2. Material is removed from the gel by exposing the gel with high laser
power ( &#771;100 mW at 780 nm) while the gel is immersed in fluorescein.
This removes the gel material in the region that is exposed, allowing
creation of defined patterns where the gel has been removed. Moreover,
these patterns are preserved through the shrinking process. This may be
done both prior to shrinking and also after shrinking.<br>
<br>
[0074] The first process provides a way to remove functional metallic
structures from the gel following fabrication. The second process
provides a way to create functional patterns on curved surfaces, which
would be useful for the fabrication of functional metamaterials.<br>
<br>
[0075] Alteration of the Refractive Index by Patterning&#8212;<br>
<br>
[0076] One of the most promising applications of Implosion Fabrication
is to the fabrication of optical metamaterials. In order to fabricate
optical metamaterials, it is important to be able to control the
refractive index of the material with sub-wavelength resolution. It was
discovered that the patterning process results in a change in the
refractive index of the gel substrate following shrink (See FIG. 16).
This allows us to directly write refractive index gradients into the
substrate.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0077] Semiconductors&#8212;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0078] For many technological applications, it is important to be able
to create patterns both of metals and of semiconductor materials. This
is important in the electronics industry for the creation of functional
devices such as transistors and LEDs, and also in the photonics
industry, because semiconductors have high indices of refraction and
are thus useful for creating photonic devices in which functional
properties are derived from nanoscale patterning of the index of
refraction.<br>
<br>
[0079] A way to attach semiconductor nanoparticles (specifically
cadmium telluride and cadmium selenide) to the previously described
polymer gel material in defined patterns. The protocol is similar to
the previously described method used to anchor gold nanoparticles to
the gel, but rather than using a streptavidin reagent with an attached
gold nanoparticle, we use a semiconductor quantum dot, that consists of
a semiconductor nanocrystal passivated with a polymer, and
functionalized with streptavidin molecules. This reagent (which is
obtained commercially) is washed into the gel following the
biotinylation step. The presence of semiconductors inside of the gel is
confirmed by fluorescence imaging, since the semiconductor
nanoparticles are fluorescent. Moreover, the nanoparticles remain in
the gel through the shrinking in, for example, 200 mM HCl. At the
moment, however, dehydration appears to be incompatible with this
semiconductor anchoring approach.<br>
<br>
[0080] Semiconductor nanoparticles could be used as optical gain media,
allowing creation of lasers with spatially structured gain media, with
a range of interesting optical effects. They could also be used to
change the index of refraction, allowing for the creation of photonic
metamaterials. Finally, if the semiconductors can be made solid, they
could be used in the creation of electronics.<br>
<br>
[0081] As in the case of the described metal growth process, in which
silver is grown on top of gold nanoparticles in order to create solid
silver structures, solid semiconductor structures may be created in
which a semiconductor would be grown on top of the embedded cadmium
telluride or cadmium selenide nanoparticles.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0082] Multiplexed Patterning&#8212;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0083] Many functional devices are composites of multiple different
materials, and take advantage of the interactions between those
materials. For that reason, it is important for Implosion Fabrication
to be able to pattern multiple different materials into the same
substrate. Patterning of multiple different kinds of Streptavidin into
the polymer gel over subsequent rounds of patterning was achieved. To
do so, previously described methods (without shrinking) were applied
using one kind of streptavidin. The polymer gel is washed again with a
patterning solution and the same methods applied, this time using a
different kind of streptavidin. Testing verified that the first kind of
streptavidin only binds to the patterns created in the first round,
whereas the second kind of streptavidin binds primarily to the patterns
created in the second round.<br>
<br>
[0084] Streptavidin is used to anchor metals and semiconductors into
the gel. Thus, multiple different kinds of streptavidin may be
patterned into the gel in order to pattern metals and semiconductors
simultaneously into the gel.<br>
<br>
[0085] An optional method provides for the attachment of two functional
materials to the polymer gel in parallel rather than successively. To
achieve this, two fluorophores that have orthogonal 2-photon absorption
spectra (i.e., they undergo 2-photon absorption at different
wavelengths) are used. An example of such fluorphores are Fluorescein
patterned at 780 nm and Alexa 350 patterned at 950 nm. Thus, it is
possible to create patterns with one fluorophore using one wavelength,
and with the second fluorophore using a different wavelength. By
attaching different reactive groups to each fluorophore, it will be
possible to attach two distinct functional materials into the gel in
distinct patterns using the previously described methods.<br>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0086] Gel Synthesis:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0087] Gels were synthesized following the protocol outlined in ExM
(9). The monomer solutions are mixed from stock solutions of
10&times;PBS, 5M NaCl, 38% (w/w) sodium acrylate, 50% (w/w) acrylamide,
and 2% (w/w) N,N&#8242;-methylenebisacrylamide in concentrations given below
for the &#8220;Stock I&#8221; (10&times; shrink), &#8220;Stock II,&#8221; and &#8220;Stock O&#8221;
(20&times; shrink) monomer solutions. Solutions were aliquoted and
stored at &#8722;20&deg; C. Prior to casting, monomer solution was cooled to
4&deg; C. to prevent premature gelation. Concentrated stocks of
ammonium persulfate (10% w/w) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
(10% v/v) were diluted 50&times; into the monomer solution. The
resulting gelation solution was then mixed thoroughly and added to a
gel mold that was &#771;0.17 mm tall and &#771;1 cm wide. Molds consisted of a
glass slide for the bottom and a No. 1.5 coverslip for the top, using
two additional coverslips as spacers. The mold was placed at 37&deg; C.
for 1 hour to allow for gelation. Following gel synthesis, the gel was
washed in 500&times; its volume in water on five successive 15 minute
wash steps to ensure full expansion.<br>

 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0089] Following expansion, gels were transferred into a glass-bottom
dish (Mattek, P50G-1.5-30-F) and incubated in patterning solution for
30 minutes, as follows. Following incubation, a coverslip was placed
over the well of the glass-bottom plate and gel and excess patterning
solution was withdrawn, so the coverslip pressed the gel against the
bottom of the plate and reduced drift.<br>
<br>
[0090] For patterning gold nanoparticles or maleimide-activated
fluorophores into the gel, as in FIGS. 2B, 2C,2E-2H, 3F, 4. 6 and 7,
the patterning solution was made by reacting fluorescein-NHS (Life
Technologies, 46409) to cysteamine (Sigma Aldrich, M9768-5G) at 1 mM
concentration in water for at least 30 minutes prior to incubation.<br>
<br>
[0091] For patterning NETS-activated fluorophores or reagents into the
gel, as in FIGS. 1D, 1E, 1H, 3A-3E, and 5A-5F the patterning solution
consisted of 100 &#956;M 5-aminomethyl fluorescein hydrochloride (Life
Technologies, A-1353) in water.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0092] Patterning:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0093] Gels were patterned using an inverted Zeiss LSM 710 confocal
microscope with a Chameleon Ultra II femtosecond pulsed IR laser set to
780 nm, using a 40&times;1.1 NA or 25&times;0.8 NA water immersion
objective. Within the Zen software, custom ROIs were defined for
acquisition. The surface of the gel was identified by a decrease in
fluorescence relative to the external patterning solution. Standard
patterning conditions were 0.79 &#956;s pixel dwell time and a pixel size of
350 nm, amounting to a patterning speed of 44 cm/s. Laser power varied
depending on the intensity of patterning desired. Each line could be
scanned multiple times to increase the patterning intensity, using the
line averaging feature in the Zen software. Prior to and following
patterning, the sample was visualized by excitation at 780 nm using 2%
laser power.<br>
<br>
[0094] For patterns in FIG. 1D, E, 17.7% laser power was used with the
25&times; objective and 1&times; line scanning.<br>
<br>
[0095] For patterns in FIG. 2B, C, each line was scanned either once or
twice using the 40&times; objective, with variable laser power. The
condition was indicated by tick marks above and to the right of the
triangles, as follows: 1 tick mark, 12.5% laser power with 1&times;
line scanning. 2 tick marks, 12.5% laser power with 2&times; line
scanning. 3 tick marks, 17.7% laser power with 1&times; line scanning.
4 tick marks, 17.7% laser power with 2&times; line scanning. 5 tick
marks, 25% laser power with 1&times; line scanning.<br>
<br>
[0096] For patterns in FIGS. 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H, 4 and 6, 17.7% laser power
was used with 2&times; line scanning. To ensure that the patterns were
at the surface of the gel for SEM visualization, the patterns were
generated as Z stacks with 2 &#956;m step size beginning below the surface
of the gel and extending 50 &#956;m into the gel.<br>
<br>
[0097] For patterns in FIGS. 2A and 2D, several different squares were
patterned using 4%, 6%, 8%, 12%, 14%, 16%, 18%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,
40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% laser power, with either 1&times;, 2&times;, or
4&times; line scanning. For patterns in FIGS. 5B and 5E, the same
pattern was used with the same laser intensities, but created a 20 &#956;m
Z-stack with 2 &#956;m spacing. The laser power at the sample was measured
using a power meter (PM100D) and scan head (S170C) from Thor Labs.<br>
<br>
[0098] For patterns in FIGS. 3A, 3B, 3C, 3E, 3F, 17.7% laser power was
used and 1&times; line scanning with the 25&times; objective. Each
pattern was created as a Z stack with 2 &#956;m step size beginning below
the surface of the gel and extending 50 &#956;m into the gel. FIG. 3F was
patterned using the tile scan feature in the Zen software over a period
of approximately 8 hours to achieve a region spanning 6 mm&times;6
mm&times;400 &#956;m in the pre-shrink state.<br>
<br>
[0099] FIG. 3D was patterned using 17.7% laser power and 1&times; line
scanning on the 25&times; objective, in two phases. First, the vertical
lines were patterned using a Z stack with 2 &#956;m step size extending 400
&#956;m into the gel. Subsequently, three planar grids were patterned at the
top, midpoint, and bottom of the Z stack, using the same patterning
conditions.<br>
<br>
[0100] For altering the refractive index, gels were patterned using
17.7% laser power and 2&times; line scanning on the 40&times; objective.<br>
<br>
[0101] For removal of the material while it was still infused with the
patterning reagent, stock II was used for the gel material, and the gel
was patterned with 25% laser power and 2&times; line scanning on the
40&times; objective.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0102] Functionalization:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0103] Each patterning reagent was stained with a specific and
complementary chemistry depending on the functional group patterned
into the gel. Following patterning, the gels were washed five times in
water for fifteen minutes each time to remove excess patterning
solution.<br>
<br>
[0104] For functionalizing fluorescein-cysteamine with
maleimide-activated gold nanoparticles, as in FIGS. 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H and
7, gels were washed twice in 1&times;PBS for 15 minutes each time.
Subsequently, maleimide-functionalized 1.4 nm gold nanoparticles
(Nanoprobes, 2020A) were diluted to 5 &#956;M concentration in 1&times;PBS
and washed onto the gel overnight. Gels were then washed twice in water
for at least 30 minutes each time, transferred to a new container, and
washed in water three more times for at least 30 minutes each time to
remove excess gold.<br>
<br>
[0105] For functionalizing fluorescein-cysteamine with
maleimide-activated Atto 647N, as in FIGS. 2B, 2C, 3F and 6, gels were
washed twice in 1&times;PBS for 15 minutes each time. Subsequently,
Atto 647N-maleimide (Sigma-Aldrich, 05316-1 mg-F) was diluted to 50 &#956;M
concentration in 1&times;PBS and washed onto the gel overnight. Because
Atto 647N is positively charged and thus tends to partition into the
negatively charged gel, gels were then washed twice in 200 mM NaOH for
at least 30 minutes each time, followed by three washes in 1&times;PBS
for 30 minutes each time. Gels were then washed three times in water,
for 15 minutes each time, to remove salt and prepare them either for
imaging or shrinking. When staining with a negatively charged
fluorophore, washes in NaOH and PBS were replaced with washes in water.<br>
<br>
[0106] For functionalizing aminomethyl fluorescein with Atto 647N-NHS,
as in FIGS. 1D, 1E, 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E and 5A-5F, gels were washed
twice in 1&times;PBS for 15 minutes each time. Subsequently, Atto
647N-NHS (Sigma-Aldrich, 18373-1 mg-F) was diluted to 50 &#956;M
concentration in 1&times;PBS and washed onto the gel for at least 4
hours. As above, gels were then washed in 200 mM NaOH twice for at
least 30 minutes each time, followed by three washes in water for 15
minutes. After staining aminomethyl fluorescein with a negatively
charged dye, excess dye could simply be washed out in water.<br>
<br>
[0107] For FIG. 3C, gels were functionalized with biotin NHS (Life
Technologies, 20217) at 1 mM concentration in 1&times;PBS overnight,
followed by three washes in water and two more washes in 1&times;PBS to
remove excess reagent and prepare for the streptavidin
functionalization. Atto 647N-labeled streptavidin (Sigma-Aldrich,
94149-1 mg) was then washed onto the gel at 40 &#956;g/ml in 1&times;PBS
with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin overnight. The gel was then washed in 2.5
mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, three times for at least 1 hour each time to remove
excess streptavidin. Streptavidin functionalized gels could then be
functionalized with DNA by washing the gels in a solution with 10 &#956;M
biotinylated DNA in 1&times;PBS for 3 hours. DNA was subsequently
removed by washing in water 3 times, for at least 15 minutes each time.
Alternatively, gels could be patterned with biotin-4-fluorescein as
described elsewhere (17), in which case a similar protocol was followed
for attachment of streptavidin to the gel.<br>
<br>
[0108] For functionalizing aminomethyl fluorescein with gold
nanoparticles for the purpose of subsequent creation of solid metal
structures, gels were functionalized with biotin NHS (Life
Technologies, 20217) at 100 uM concentration in 1&times;PBS for 3
hours, followed by four washes in water and two more washes in
1&times;PBS to remove excess reagent and prepare for streptavidin
functionalization. Subsequently, the fluoronanogold reagent
(Nanoprobes, #7416) was diluted by a factor of 30 into 1&times;PBS and
washed onto the gel overnight. Subsequently, the gel was washed four
times in 0.1&times;PBS for at least 1 hour each time, and was then
washed twice in water. The LI silver enhancer reagent (Nanoprobes,
#2013) was then washed onto the gel for an a variable amount of time
between 50 and 70 minutes. Gels were then rinsed with water and washed
three times in water, for at least 15 minutes each time.<br>
<br>
[0109] For functionalizing aminomethyl fluorescein gels with
semiconductor nanoparticles, gels were functionalized with biotin NHS
(Life Technologies, 20217) at 100 uM concentration in 1&times;PBS for 3
hours, followed by four washes in water and two more washes in
0.1&times;PBS to remove excess reagent and prepare for streptavidin
functionalization. The QDot 585 streptavidin conjugate (Life
Technologies, Q10111MP) was then diluted by a factor of 50 into
0.1&times;PBS and washed onto the gel for at least 24 hours. The gel
was then washed 3 times in 0.1&times;PBS, and optionally twice in water.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0110] Shrinking:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0111] Gels were shrunken either using acid or using salt. For all gels
in FIGS. 1, 2, 3A, 3B,3D, 3E, 4, 6, and 7, gels were transferred to a
glass container and were shrunken by washing in 2 mM HCl with 0.05%
Tween-20 for 2 hours. Gels were then washed in 20 mM HCl with 0.05%
Tween 20 for 2 hours, or until shrinking had stopped. Finally, gels
were washed in 200 mM HCl for one hour, to remove residual Tween-20.
Gels were then dehydrated for 30 minutes, or until completely dry.
Remarkably, streptavidin remained in the gel during the shrinking
process.<br>
<br>
[0112] For FIGS. 3C and 3D, the gel was shrunken by three washes in
1&times;PBS, for at least 15 minutes each time, to allow imaging with a
standard diffraction-limited microscope.<br>
<br>
[0113] For FIG. 3F, the gel was shrunken (but not dehydrated) by
washing three times in a solution of 1M MgCl2 and 1M CaCl2, for 10
minutes each time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0114] Sintering:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0115] For sintering the gel after shrinking and dehydration, the
shrunken and dehydrated gel was exposed to the 2-photon laser using 5%
laser power, 1&times; line scan, and 0.79 us dwell time at a wavelength
of 780 nm.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[0116] Gel Removal:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0117] For removing the gel after shrinking and dehydration, the
shrunken and dehydrated gel was exposed to the 2-photon laser using 10%
laser power, 4&times; line scanning, and 3.6 us dwell time at 780 nm.
Repeating this exposure would cause more gel material to be removed. By
repeating these exposure conditions many times, it was possible to etch
all the way through the gel.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Imaging:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0118] For FIGS. 1D, 4, 5, 6, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, and 2H, fluorescence and
differential interference contrast imaging in both the expanded and
shrunken states was performed using a Perkin Elmer spinning disk
(CSU-10 Yokogawa) confocal microscope. A Hamamatsu Orca-ER cooled CCD
camera, and either a 10&times;0.3 NA objective or a 40&times;1.15 NA
long working distance water-immersion objective (Nikon) were also used.<br>
<br>
[0119] For FIGS. 1E, 1F, 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E fluorescence imaging in
both the expanded and shrunken states was performed using a Zeiss LSM
710 (1E, F, 3A,D) or Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan (1E-10&times;, 3B). On
the LSM 710, a 25&times;0.8 NA water immersion objective was used. On
the Zeiss LSM 880, a 63&times;1.3 NA oil immersion objective with
Airyscan deconvolution was used.<br>
<br>
[0120] FIGS. 3C and 3F were acquired on a widefield epifluorescence
microscope, using an Andor Neo Zyla and either a 4&times;0.2 NA (FIG.
3F), or 40&times;1.1 NA water immersion (FIG. 3C) objective.<br>
<br>
[0121] When imaging dehydrated gels, gels were mounted on carbon tape
and placed either in 200 mM HCl or mineral oil (according to the
immersion medium of the objective) to eliminate any air gap between the
gel and the coverslip. This did not cause the gel to re-expand.<br>
<br>
[0122] Scanning electron microscope images of the AuNP patterns (FIGS.
2F, 2G, 7A and 7B) were taken using a FE-SEM (UltraPlus, Zeiss) with an
Energy selective Backscattered (EsB) detector. The atomic force
microscopy (AFM) of the gel surface was taken with tapping mode in air
(Cypher ES, Asylum Research) with a silicon probe (AC240TS, Olympus).
The SEM image of the gel surface and cross-section was taken with a
FE-SEM (UltraPlus, Zeiss) with an inlens detector.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Analysis:</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
[0123] FIGS. 1H and 4: Data for FIGS. 1H and 4 were obtained by
comparing the feature sizes of patterns as specified on the patterning
microscope to the size of patterns after shrinking. Samples were chosen
on the basis of the availability of high-resolution optical or SEM
images of the shrunken state, and came from a variety of different
experiments.<br>
<br>
[0124] FIG. 2D: Isotropy was measured for samples into which circles
had been patterned. The isotropy was measured by visually determining
the longest axis of the circle, and comparing the diameter on that axis
to the diameter on the orthogonal axis. A mixture of gels patterned
with aminomethyl fluorescein and fluorescein-cysteamine were used. Gels
were chosen for inclusion in the dataset on the basis of the
availability of images for analysis, prior to measuring the isotropy.
No gels were excluded.<br>
<br>
[0125] FIGS. 2G and 2H: The widths of lines visualized with SEM were
measured by using ImageJ to rotate the image so that the lines were
oriented vertically, and then taking the mean pixel value over the
vertical dimension for a clean segment of line. The average was
performed over the longest clean segment of line available in the
image, usually several hundred pixels. The full width at half maximum
(FWHM) was then measured in pixels, and converted into a distance using
the scale bar provided by the SEM imaging software. The baseline used
in the FWHM measurement was found by linear interpolation between the
baseline levels immediately on either side of the line profile (FIG.
2G). A vertical line was drawn between the highest point in the profile
and the interpolated baseline, and the midpoint of this line was chosen
as the half-maximum. Lines were excluded from our analysis when the
magnitude of the background (for example due to charging) prevented a
determination of the FWHM. In addition, a subset of the lines in the
resolution pattern were excluded in every gel due to a consistent and
reproducible error in the Zen software that caused an extra line to be
patterned directly below those lines, leading to a larger FWHM. It was
reasoned that these lines could be excluded because they represent a
limitation of the software rather than a limitation of the patterning
and shrinking process.<br>
