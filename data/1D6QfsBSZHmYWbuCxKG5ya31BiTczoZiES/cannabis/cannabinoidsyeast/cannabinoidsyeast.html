          without Marijuana</b><br>
        <b> </b><b>by Tim McDonnell</b><br>
        <b> </b><br>
        <i>New research paves the way for cannabinoids without cannabis</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <i> </i><br>
      ...In a paper published today (Complete Biosynthesis of
      Cannabinoids and their Unnatural Analogues in Yeast) in the
      peer-reviewed journal Nature, biochemists at the University of
      California, Berkeley report what some cannabis industry experts
      are describing as a breakthrough in biosynthetic cannabinoid
      production.<br>
      <br>
      By using genetically modified yeast, the Berkeley scientists were
      able to convert simple sugars into the active chemical compounds
      in marijuana...<br>
      <br>
      The new research from the Berkeley scientists centers on the
      identification of a cannabis enzyme that can be transferred into
      yeast DNA so that it metabolizes sugar into cannabinoids instead
      of alcohol and carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Jay Keasling, the biochemist at Berkeley who led the
      research, says his team tested dozens of options before finding
      the right combination of enzyme genes.<br>
      <br>
      Yeast is a good host organism, Keasling says, because its DNA is
      thoroughly documented and because it's already in wide use for
      other commercial applications like beer-making and wine-making.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's as easy as brewing beer," says Keasling<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You feed the yeast sugar, it grows and
      replicates, produces the THC, and secretes it outside the cell so
      that it's floating in the sugar water that the yeast is growing
      in. It comes in high concentrations, and then we purify it away
      and you're left with a very pure white powder."<br>
      <br>
      Keasling filed a patent for this method back in 2017, and has
      since been hammering down the science and working with a Bay Area
      biotech startup, Demetrix, to bring the process from the lab into
      commercial production.<br>
      <br>
      Over the next few years, the company hopes to bring the cost of
      production below $1,000 per kilogram, far below the cost of
      chemically-synthesized cannabinoids (tens of thousands of dollars
      per kilogram) or cannabinoids extracted from a plant (more than
      $5,000 per kilogram), according to Jeff Ubersax, the company's
      CEO.<br>
      <br>
      Biosynthesized cannabinoids aren't yet being produced commercially
      by any company.<br>
      <br>
      And some of Demetrix's competitors remain skeptical that
      Keasling's approach is much different from what others are cooking
      up behind the scenes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're showing how these pieces will all go
      together, which is cool, but I don't know that I would describe it
      as a breakthrough," says Kevin Chen, CEO of Montreal-based
      Hyasynth Bio, which recently received a $7.6 million investment
      from the Canadian cannabis distributor OrganiGram to speed up the
      rollout of its own biosynthetic cannabinoids.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is in the research stage, so it's
      hard to say who will have the first product out."<br>
      <br>
      Ronan Levy, chief strategic officer of another Demetrix
      competitor, New Mexico-based Trait Biosciences, says his company's
      preferred approach is to find ways to induce a cannabis plant to
      produce cannabinoids in every one of its cells, rather than only
      those in the "tricone" (better known as the "bud"), where it grows
      naturally.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Instead of trying to find other organisms, why
      not figure out how to expand on what the plant can do?" he says.
      "Yeast is definitely interesting, we just don't think it makes the
      most sense."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you have a yeast that makes THC. Do you
      schedule this yeast?"<br>
      <br>
      It's unclear whether biosynthesized cannabinoids would be subject
      to the same legal restrictions as plant-derived compounds, since
      federal law applies to the plant and not necessarily to the
      cannabinoids in it.<br>
      <br>
      Cannabis researchers are subject to tight restrictions on where
      they can procure samples, and the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) has approved only one CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, for
      childhood epilepsy.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you have a yeast that makes THC. Do you
      schedule this yeast?" says Piomelli, referring to the DEA, Drug
      Enforcement Administration's drug classification system.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We haven't seen the law at work enough to
      conclude, case by case, what will work. The legal landscape on
      cannabis is so confusing that almost anything goes."<br>
      <br>
      Either way, biosynthesis is poised to change the way we think
      about getting high.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't make insulin from animals anymore,
      and the plant won't be the way forward for industrial production
      of cannabinoids," says Banister.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If big corporations want to move into the
      cannabis space, I think they will be moving in this direction."<br>

      The present disclosure relates to the production of cannabinoids
      in yeast. In one aspect there is provided a genetically modified
      yeast comprising: one or more GPP producing genes and optionally,
      one or more GPP pathway genes; two or more olivetolic acid
      producing genes; one or more cannabinoid precursor or cannabinoid
      producing genes; one or more Hexanoyl-CoA producing genes, and at
      least 5% dry weight of fatty acids or fats...<br>
      <br>
      [00133] The present disclosure provides methods, polypeptides,
      nucleic acids encoding said polypeptides, and genetically modified
      host cells for producing cannabinoids, cannabinoid precursors,
      cannabinoid derivatives (e.g., non-naturally occurring
      cannabinoids), or cannabinoid precursor derivatives (e.g.,
      non-naturally occurring cannabinoid precursors). [00134] Geranyl
      pyrophosphate:olivetolic acid geranyltransferase (GOT, Enzyme
      Commission Number 2.5.1.102) polypeptides play an important role
      in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids, but reconstituting their
      activity in a genetically modified host cell has proven
      challenging, hampering progress in the production of cannabinoids
      or cannabinoid derivatives. Herein, novel genes encoding
      polypeptides of the disclosure that catalyze production of
      cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) from GPP and olivetolic acid have been
      identified, isolated, and characterized. Surprisingly, these
      polypeptides of the present disclosure can catalyze production of
      CBGA from GPP and olivetolic acid in an amount at least ten times
      higher than previously discovered Cannabis polypeptides that
      catalyze production of CBGA from GPP and olivetolic acid (see, for
      example, U.S. PatentApplication Pub. No. US20120144523 and the GOT
      polypeptide, CsPT1, disclosed therein; SEQ ID NO:82 herein). The
      new polypeptides of the present disclosure that catalyze
      production of CBGA from GPP and olivetolic acid are GOT
      polypeptides (e.g., the CsPT4 polypeptide) and can generate
      cannabinoids and cannabinoid derivatives in vivo (e.g., within a
      genetically modified host cell) and in vitro (e.g., cell-free).
      These new GOT polypeptides, as well as nucleic acids encoding said
      GOT polypeptides, are useful in the methods and genetically
      modified host cells of the disclosure for producing cannabinoids
      or cannabinoid derivatives...<br>
      <br>
      [00144] In Cannabis, cannabinoids are produced from the common
      metabolite precursors geranylpyrophosphate (GPP) and hexanoyl-CoA
      by the action of three polypeptides so far only identified in
      Cannabis. Hexanoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA are combined to afford a
      12-carbon tetraketide intermediate by a TKS polypeptide. This
      tetraketide intermediate is then cyclized by an OAC polypeptide to
      produce olivetolic acid. Olivetolic acid is then prenylated with
      the common isoprenoid precursor GPP by a GOT polypeptide (e.g., a
      CsPT4 polypeptide) to produce CBGA, the cannabinoid also known as
      the“mother cannabinoid.” Different synthase polypeptides then
      convert CBGA into other cannabinoids, e.g., a THCA synthase
      polypeptide produces THCA, a CBDA synthase polypeptide produces
      CBDA, etc. In the presence of heat or light, the acidic
      cannabinoids can undergo decarboxylation, e.g., THCA producing THC
      or CBDA producing CBD.<br>
      <br>
      [00145] GPP and hexanoyl-CoA can be generated through several
      pathways (see FIGS.1 and 11). One or more nucleic acids encoding
      one or more polypeptides having at least one activity of a
      polypeptide present in these pathways can be useful in the methods
      and genetically modified host cells for the synthesis of
      cannabinoids, cannabinoid precursors, cannabinoid derivatives, or
      cannabinoid precursor derivatives. [00146] Polypeptides that
      generate GPP or are part of a biosynthetic pathway that generates
      GPP may be one or more polypeptides having at least one activity
      of a polypeptide present in the mevalonate (MEV) pathway. The
      term“mevalonate pathway” or“MEV pathway,” as used herein, may
      refer to the biosynthetic pathway that converts acetyl-CoA to
      isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate
      (DMAPP). The mevalonate pathway comprises polypeptides that
      catalyze the following steps: (a) condensing two molecules of
      acetyl-CoA to generate acetoacetyl-CoA (e.g., by action of an
      acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase polypeptide); (b) condensing
      acetoacetyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to form hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA
      (HMG-CoA) (e.g., by action of a HMG-CoA synthase (HMGS)
      polypeptide); (c) converting HMG-CoA to mevalonate (e.g., by
      action of a HMG- CoA reductase (HMGR) polypeptide); (d)
      phosphorylating mevalonate to mevalonate 5- phosphate (e.g., by
      action of a mevalonate kinase (MK) polypeptide); (e) converting
      mevalonate 5-phosphate to mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate (e.g., by
      action of a phosphomevalonate kinase (PMK) polypeptide); (f)
      converting mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate
      (e.g., by action of a mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MVD)
      polypeptide); and (g) converting isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP)
      to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) (e.g., by action of an
      isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase (IDI) polypeptide) (FIGS.1 and
      11). A geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) polypeptide then acts
      on IPP and/or DMAPP to generate GPP. Additionally, polypeptides
      that generate GPP or are part of a biosynthetic pathway that
      generates GPP may be one or more polypeptides having at least one
      activity of a polypeptide present in the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate
      (DXP) pathway, instead of those of the MEV pathway (FIG.1).<br>
      <br>
      [00147] Polypeptides that generate hexanoyl-CoA may include
      polypeptides that generate acyl-CoA compounds or acyl-CoA compound
      derivatives (e.g., a hexanoyl-CoA synthase (HCS) polypeptide, an
      acyl-activating enzyme polypeptide, a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase
      polypeptide, or a fatty acyl-CoA ligase polypeptide). Hexanoyl-CoA
      may also be generated through pathways comprising one or more
      polypeptides that generate malonyl- CoA, such as an acetyl-CoA
      carboxylase (ACC) polypeptide. Additionally, hexanoyl-CoA may be
      generated with one or more polypeptides that are part of a
      biosynthetic pathway that produces hexanoyl-CoA, including, but
      not limited to: a malonyl CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase
      (MCT1) polypeptide, a PaaH1 polypeptide, a Crt polypeptide, a Ter
      polypeptide, and a BktB polypeptide; a MCT1 polypeptide, a PhaB
      polypeptide, a PhaJ polypeptide, a Ter polypeptide, and a BktB
      polypeptide; a short chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase (SCFA-TE)
      polypeptide; or a fatty acid synthase (FAS) polypeptide (see FIGS.
      1 and 11). Hexanoyl CoA derivatives, acyl-CoA compounds, or
      acyl-CoA compound derivatives may also be formed via such pathways
      and polypeptides.<br>
      <br>
      [00148] GPP and hexanoyl-CoA may also be generated through
      pathways comprising polypeptides that condense two molecules of
      acetyl-CoA to generate acetoacetyl-CoA and pyruvate dehydrogenase
      complex polypeptides that generate acetyl-CoA from pyruvate (see
      FIGS.1 and 11). Hexanoyl CoA derivatives, acyl-CoA compounds, or
      acyl-CoA compound derivatives may also be formed via such
      pathways. <br>

      [00925] Whole-cell broth from cultures comprising genetically
      modified host cells of the disclosure are extracted with a
      suitable organic solvent to afford cannabinoids, cannabinoid
      precursors, cannabinoid derivatives, or cannabinoid precursor
      derivatives. Suitable organic solvents include, but are not
      limited to, hexane, heptane, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, and
      di-ethyl ether, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. The suitable
      organic solvent, such as hexane, is added to the whole-cell broth
      from fermentations comprising genetically modified host cells of
      the disclosure at a 10:1 ratio (10 parts whole-cell broth– 1 part
      organic solvent) and stirred for 30 minutes. The organic fraction
      is separated and extracted twice with an equal volume of acidic
      water (pH 2.5). The organic layer is then separated and dried in a
      concentrator (rotary evaporator or thin film evaporator under
      reduced pressure) to obtain crude cannabinoid, cannabinoid
      precursor, cannabinoid derivative, or cannabinoid precursor
      derivative crystals. The crude crystals may then be heated to 105
      °C for 15 minutes followed by 145 °C for 55 minutes to
      decarboxylate a crude cannabinoid or cannabinoid derivative. The
      crude crystalline product is re-dissolved and recrystallized in a
      suitable solvent (e.g., n-pentane) and filtered through a 1 µm
      filter to remove any insoluble material. The solvent is then
      removed e.g. by rotary evaporation, to produce pure crystalline
      product. In vitro enzyme assay and cell-free production of

      [00926] In some embodiments, genetically modified host cells,
      e.g., genetically modified yeast cells, verified to comprise one
      or more heterologous nucleic acids encoding a GOT polypeptide that
      catalyzes production of cannabigerolic acid from geranyl
      pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid in an amount at least ten times
      higher than a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence set
      forth in SEQ ID NO:82 or a polypeptide comprising an amino acid
      sequence having at least 65% (e.g., at least 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%,
      81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%,
      94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, 99.9%,
      or 100%) sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:100 or SEQ ID NO:110, are
      cultured in 96-well microtiter plates containing 360 µL of YPD (10
      g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L Bacto peptone, 20 g/L dextrose
      (glucose)) and sealed with a breathable film seal. Cells are then
      cultured at 30 °C in a high capacity microtiter plate incubator
      shaking at 1000 rpm and 80% humidity for 3 days until the cultures
      reach carbon exhaustion. The growth-saturated cultures are then
      subcultured into 200 mL of YPGAL media to an OD600 of 0.2 and
      incubated with shaking for 20 hours at 30 °C. Cells are then
      harvested by centrifugation at 3000 x g for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
      Harvested cells are then resuspended in 50 mL buffer (50 mM
      Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M KCl, pH 7.4, 125 units Benzonase) and
      then lysed (Emulsiflex C3, Avestin, INC., 60 bar, 10 min). Cells
      debris is removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C).
      Subsequently, the supernatant is then subjected to
      ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C, Beckman Coulter
      L-90K, TI-70). The resulting membrane fractions of the GOT

      99.8%, 99.9%, or 100%) sequence identity to SEQ ID NO:100 or SEQ
      ID NO:110 are then resuspended in 3.3 mL buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
      10 mM MgCl2, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) and solubilized with a tissue
      grinder. Then, 0.02% (v/v) of the respective membrane preparations
      are then dissolved in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM
      MgCl2, pH 8.5) and substrate (500 µM olivetolic acid, 500 µM GPP)
      to a total volume of 50 µL and incubated for 1 hour at 30 °C.
      Assays are then extracted by adding two reaction volumes of ethyl
      acetate followed by vortexing and centrifugation. The organic
      layer is evaporated for 30 minutes, resuspended in
      acetonitrile/H2O/formic acid (80:20:0.05%) and filtered with
      Ultrafree® -MC columns (0.22 µm pore size, PVDF membrane
      material). Cannabinoids or cannabinoid derivatives are then
      detected via LC-MS and/or recovered and purified. Yeast
      cultivation in a bioreactor<br>
      <br>
      [00927] Single yeast colonies comprising genetically modified host
      cells disclosed herein are grown in 15 mL of Verduyn medium
      (originally described by Verduyn et al, Yeast 8(7): 501-17) with
      50 mM succinate (pH 5.0) and 2% glucose in a 125 mL flask at 30
      °C, with shaking at 200 rpm to an OD600 between 4 to 9. Glycerol
      is then added to the culture to a concentration of 20% and 1 mL
      vials of the genetically modified host cell suspension are stored
      at-80 °C. One to two vials of genetically modified host cells are
      thawed and grown in Verduyn medium with 50 mM succinate (pH 5.0)
      and 4% sucrose for 24 hours, then sub-cultured to an OD600 reading
      of 0.1 in the same media. After 24 hours of growth at 30 °C with
      shaking, 65 mL of culture is used to inoculate a 1.3-liter
      fermenter (Eppendorf DASGIP Bioreactor) with 585 mL of Verduyn
      fermentation media containing 20 g/L galactose supplemented with
      hexanoic acid (2 mM), a carboxylic acid other than hexanoic acid
      (2 mM), olivetolic acid (1 mM), or an olivetolic acid derivative
      (1 mM). A poly-alpha-olefin may be added to the fermenter as an
      extractive agent. The fermenter is maintained at 30 °C and pH 5.0
      with addition of NH4OH. In an initial batch phase, the fermenter
      is aerated at 0.5 volume per volume per minute air (VVM) and
      agitation ramped to maintain 30% dissolved oxygen. After the
      initial sugar is consumed, the rise in dissolved oxygen triggers
      feeding of galactose + hexanoic acid (800 g galactose per liter +
      9.28 g hexanoic acid per liter) at 10 g galactose per liter per
      hour in pulses of 10 g galactose per liter doses (alternatively,
      rather than feeding the genetically modified host cells disclosed
      herein hexanoic acid, olivetolic acid, an olivetolic acid
      derivative, or a carboxylic acid other than hexanoic acid is fed
      to the genetically modified host cells).<br>
      <br>
      [00928] Between pulses, the feed rate is lowered to 5 g galactose
      per liter per hour. Upon a 10% rise in dissolved oxygen, the feed
      rate is resumed at 10 g L&lt;-1&gt;hour&lt;-1&gt;. As genetically
      modified host cell density increases, dissolved oxygen is allowed
      to reach 0%, and the pulse dose is increased to 50 g galacose per
      liter. Oxygen transfer rate is maintained at rates representative
      of full-scale conditions of 100 mM per liter per hour by adjusting
      agitation as volume increased. Feed rate is adjusted dynamically
      to meet demand using an algorithm that alternates between a high
      feed rate and low feed rate. During the low feed rate, genetically
      modified host cells should consume galactose and hexanoic acid,
      or, alternatively, olivetolic acid, an olivetolic acid derivative,
      or a carboxylic acid other than hexanoic acid, and any overflow
      metabolites accumulated during the high feed rate. A rise in
      dissolved oxygen triggers the high feed rate to resume. The length
      of time spent in the low feed rate reflects the extent to which
      genetically modified host cells are over- or under-fed in the
      prior high feed rate pulse; this information is then monitored and
      used to tune the high feed rate up or down, keeping the low feed
      rate within a defined range.<br>
      <br>
      [00929] Over time, the feed rate matches sugar and hexanoic acid,
      or, alternatively, olivetolic acid, an olivetolic acid derivative,
      or a carboxylic acid other than hexanoic acid, demand from
      genetically modified host cells. This algorithm ensures minimal
      net accumulation of fermentation products other than cannabinoids,
      cannabinoid derivatives, cannabinoid precursors, or cannabinoid
      precursor derivatives; biomass; and CO2. In some embodiments, the
      process continues for 5 to 14 days. In certain such embodiments,
      accumulated broth is removed daily and assayed for biomass and
      cannabinoid, cannabinoid derivative, cannabinoid precursor, or
      cannabinoid precursor derivative concentration. A concentrated
      solution of NH4H2PO4, trace metals and vitamins are added
      periodically to maintain steady state concentrations. Example 1–
      Synthesis of Olivetolic Acid or Derivatives Thereof<br>
      <br>
      [00930] The cannabinoid pathway is composed of four biosynthetic
      steps using the precursors hexanoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and geranyl
      pyrophosphate (FIG.1, Box 4)...<br>
      <br>
      Polypeptide Function Original host<br>
      [00937] Multiple polypeptides in pathway 1b require NADH as a
      co-factor. In order to maximize flux through pathway 1b, other
      biosynthetic pathways that compete for NADH supply are modified
      (FIG.1, Box 2). One target can be the ethanol pathway, mediated by
      various alcohol dehydrogenase polypeptides, but may also include
      other pathways that consume NADH, such as the glycerol
      biosynthesis pathway.<br>
      <br>
      [00938] Another route conceived towards hexanoyl-CoA is described
      in pathway 1c: The alfatoxin biosynthetic gene cluster (iterative
      type I PKS) encodes a fatty acid synthase- based mechanism (FasA
      and FasB) for production of hexanoyl-CoA. In some embodiments, a
      heterologous nucleic acid encoding a thioesterase polypeptide and
      a heterologous nucleic acid encoding a CoA ligase polypeptide
      similar to a C6-tolerant thioesterase polypeptide (see BMC
      Biochem.2011 Aug 10;12:44. doi: 10.1186/1471-2091-12-44) and a
      heterologous nucleic acid encoding a HCS polypeptide are expressed
      to facilitate release of hexanoyl- ACP and activate free hexanoate
      to its acyl-CoA compound. Additionally, various type II PKS
      biosynthetic pathways (e.g. benastatin, R1128) contain a FabH-like
      KSIII (e.g. BenQ, ZhuH), AT and ACP component, which are crucial
      for providing and selecting the rare hexanoate PKS starter unit.
      Lastly, the type I PKS pathway for reveromycin biosynthesis
      encodes the fatty acyl-CoA ligase RevS polypeptide and the
      FabH-like KASIII component RevR polypeptide, which are suggested
      to provide hexanoyl-CoA via fatty acid degradation as well as de
      novo fatty acid biosynthesis. [00939] To avoid competitive
      consumption of hexanoyl-CoA via ß-oxidation, the fatty acid
      degradation pathway is engineered to have lowered activity.
      Alternatively, yeast are grown in presence of oleic acid to avoid
      competition for fatty acids as energy source.<br>
      <br>
      [00940] The pathway of four genes encoding the NADH pathway for
      hexanoyl-CoA production, including polypeptides PaaH1, Crt, Ter,
      and BktB, was constructed under the control of Gal1, Gal10, Gal7,
      and TEF2 promoters, respectively. FIG.4. The whole cassette was
      inserted between the upstream and downstream homology region of
      ADE2 and was integrated into the genome of S. cerevisiae using
      CRISPR/Cas9 to generate yXL001 (using Construct 1/pXL044 as shown
      in FIG.4). The pathway of four genes encoding the NADPH pathway
      (including PhaB, PhaJ, Ter, and BktB polypeptides) was introduced
      into to S. cerevisiae in the same way to generate yXL002 (using
      Construct 1/pXL072 as shown in FIG.4). The MCT1 gene under the
      control of Gal1 promoter flanked by the 1622b homology region
      (Construct 2; FIG.4) was introduced into the genome of yXL001 and
      yXL002 using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate yXL003 and yXL004 (FIG.4).<br>
      <br>
      [00941] A cassette encoding TKS and OAC genes under the control of
      Gal1 and Gal10 promoters flanked by ACC1 homology region
      (Construct 4; FIG.5) was introduced into the genome of yXL003 and
      yXL004 using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate yXL005 and yXL006. A
      heterologous nucleic acid encoding a TKS-OAC fusion polypeptide
      under the control of a Gal1 promoter (Construct 5; FIG.5) was
      introduced into yXL003 and yXL004 to generate yXL007 and yXL008.
      The resulting strains were inoculated into 10 mL YP medium
      supplemented with 2% dextrose. After an overnight culture at 30 °C
      and centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 mins, the pellet was
      resuspended into YP medium supplemented with 2% galactose. After
      two days expression, the culture supernatant was extracted with
      equal volume of ethyl acetate, and, after evaporation and
      filtration, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS, which showed the
      production of a significant amount of olivetolic acid (FIG.9 and
      FIG.10).<br>
      <br>
      [00942] CsAAE (Construct 3; FIG.4), TKS, and OAC genes (Construct
      4; FIG.5) were introduced into the genome of S. cerevisiae using
      CRISPR/Cas9 to generate yXL009, which can produce higher level of
      olivetolic acid in the presence of exogenously supplied hexanoate
      (FIG.11).<br>
      <br>
      [00943] In addition, by supplementing the growth medium with
      various aliphatic acids, from C4-C10, various olivetolic acid
      derivatives can be produced from yXL009 (FIG. 11 and FIG.12). Some
      of the olivetolic acid derivatives can be further modified by
      biological or chemical means to covalently attach to other
      compounds. For example, click chemistry can be performed on the
      olivetolic derivative containing alkyne functional group. The
      olivetolic derivative is dissolved in biology grade dimethyl
      sulfoxide (DMSO) and treated with a DMSO solution of crosslinker
      containing an azide group (1.0 equiv.), TBTA (DMSO: tBuOH 1:1),
      CuSO45H2O, sodium ascorbate and HEPES-KOH pH: 7.0 (final
      HEPES-KOH˜250 mM). The reaction is placed on a water bath at 37 °C
      for 12 to 16 hours. Liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
      analysis of the reaction mixture shows reaction completion after
      16 hours to obtain the further modified olivetolic acid.<br>

      [00944] The GPPS large subunit (GPPSlsu) and small subunit
      (GPPSssu) genes from Cannabis sativa under the control of Gal1 and
      Gal10 promoters flanked by ADE1 homology region (Construct 10;
      FIG.7) were introduced into yXL008 and yXL009 to generate yXL010
      and yXL011. A cassette encoding a NphB polypeptide and a THCAS
      polypeptide under the control of Gal1 and Gal10 promoters flanked
      by 1014a homology region<br>
      <br>
      (Construct 12; FIG.8) was introduced into the genome of yXL010 and
      yXL011 to generate yXL012 and yXL013 using CRISPR/Cas9. The
      resulting strains were inoculated into 10 mL YP medium
      supplemented with 2% dextrose. After an overnight culture at 30 °C
      and centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 mins, the pellet was
      resuspended into YP medium supplemented with 2% galactose. After
      two days expression, the culture supernatant was extracted with
      equal volume of ethyl acetate, and, after evaporation and
      filtration, the samples were analyzed by LC-MS, which showed that
      the overexpression of NphB in yXL010 resulted in the production of
      cannabigerolic acid (FIGS.14 and 15). In the presence of a THCAS
      polypeptide, the cannabigerolic acid was transformed into THCA or
      into THC. With yXL013, C4-C10acids were added to the expression
      medium, resulting in the production of cannabigerolic acid
      derivatives, which were then modified by a THCAS polypeptide to
      produce THCA or THC derivatives. Those derivatives can then be
      further modified by chemical reactions (FIG.13). Example 3–
      Synthesis of Cannabinoid Precursors, Cannabinoids, or Derivatives
      of the Foregoing<br>
      <br>
      [00945] To recreate cannabinoid production in microorganisms,
      chassis S. cerevisiae strains were developed containing metabolic
      pathways for the production of (1) GPP through the mevalonate
      (Mva) pathway, (2), olivetolic acid or derivatives, (3) CBGA or
      derivatives, and (4) different cannabinoids or cannabinoid
      derivatives produced by cannabinoid synthase polypeptides.
      Production of GPP<br>
      <br>
      [00946] A GPP-overproducing strain, GTY23, was produced by
      overexpressing Mva pathway genes and introducing a repressible
      promoter on ERG9. A previously described ERG20 F96W-N127W mutant,
      ERG20mut, was added to provide a source of GPP precursor in the
      cell (FIG.16). This strain was used to screen GOT polypeptide
      candidates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Production of Olivetolic Acid or Derivatives Thereof</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00947] Olivetolic acid was produced from sugar by introducing
      genes CsTKS and CsOAC, and pathways to produce hexanoyl-CoA.
      Pathways for the production of hexanoate and hexanoyl-CoA are
      known in the art (e.g., Gajewski et al,“Engineering fungal de novo
      fatty acid synthesis for short chain fatty acid production,”
      Nature Communications 2017). To produce olivetolic acid or its
      derivatives, rather than using hexanoyl-CoA pathways, a previously
      reported acyl-CoA ligase polypeptide, such as a CsAAE1 or CsAAE3
      polypeptide, was introduced and exogenously fed cells hexanoate or
      a carboxylic acid other than hexanoate (FIGS.17-19). These
      pathways allow for the production of non-naturally occurring
      cannabinoids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Production of CBGA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00948] The mother cannabinoid CBGA, or derivatives thereof, was
      produced by a GOT polypeptide. A C. sativa GOT polypeptide was
      identified in the 1990s, yet no report was identified describing
      reconstituting GOT polypeptide activity in vivo. Twenty-five
      polypeptide variants were screened for in vivo production of CBGA
      in strains containing GPP pathways and exogenously fed olivetolic
      acid. These genes were all chromosomally integrated driven by GAL1
      promoters and screened for activity in yeast extract peptone
      galactose (YPG) media. GC-MS and LC-MS analysis demonstrated in
      vivo production of CBGA from a CsPT4t polypeptide (FIGS 26A-C).
      The gene sequence of the CsPT4t polypeptide is referred to as a
      GOT polypeptide (FIG.20). yL444 was the strain used in the
      production of CBGA and expresses the following genotype:
      CEN.PK2-1D {1114a::GAL1p- CsPT4t-TDH1t;
      308a::GAL1p-ERG20(F96W-N127W)-TDH1t; erg9::KanMX_CTR3p- ERG9;

      <b>Production of THCA and CBDA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [00949] Cannabinoid synthase genes have been identified from the
      Cannabis genome (including but not limited to THCA synthase
      (THCAS), CBDA synthase (CBDAS), JP450547, JP454863, JP471546,
      JP452622). To produce THCA and CBDA, the corresponding THCA
      synthase and CBDA synthase, respectively, were introduced into a
      strain producing CBGA containing a heterologous nucleic acid
      encoding a CsPT4t polypeptide. The synthases were introduced as
      N-terminal truncated polypeptides with polypeptide tags, e.g.,
      ProA signal sequence (MIFDGTTMSIAIGLLSTLGIGAEA, from proteinase A
      with UniProt accession number F2QUG8) attached and the
      transcription of both synthases were under the control of GAL10
      promoter. The final plasmid constructs were named as
      pESC-ProA-THCAS and pESC-ProA-CBDAS. Both plasmids were
      transformed individually into the above-mentioned strain, which
      has high CBGA production in the presence of olivetolic acid, to
      give strains yXL046 and yXL047 (FIGS.21-25).<br>
      <br>
      [00950] After confirming the transformation by PCR of THCAS or
      CBDAS, two colonies from each culture were inoculated into a
      defined medium (SC-Leu + 2% Dextrose) and were incubated at 30 °C
      with shaking at 800 RPM. After two-day growth, the cultures were
      back-diluted 1:50 into inducing medium (SC-Leu + 2% galactose + 1
      mM olivetolic acid + CuSO4) and incubated at 30 °C with shaking at
      800 RPM for 4 days. After 4-day incubation, equal volume of ethyl
      acetate was added to the expression cultures and the mixtures were
      subjected to three rounds of bead beating. Then the mixtures were
      then spun down at 5000 RPM and the organic layers were sent for
      LC-MS analysis, which showed the production of THCA and CBGA from
      the corresponding cultures (FIGS.27 and 28). Example 4– Generation
      of a Base Yeast Strain Capable of High Flux to CBGA with
      Olivetolic Acid Feeding<br>
      <br>
      [00951] CBGA production strains were created from wild-type
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (CEN.PK2) by expressing genes of
      the mevalonate pathway polypeptides and a GOT polypeptide under
      control of the GAL1 or GAL10 promoter. The S21 strain comprised
      the following chromosomally integrated mevalonate pathway genes
      from S. cerevisiae: ERG10, ERG13, truncated HMG1 (tHMGR), ERG12,
      ERG8, ERG19, and IDI1. The S21 strain additionally comprised the
      chromosomally integrated pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) from
      Zymomonas mobilis to increase flux from pyruvate towards
      acetyl-CoA.<br>
      <br>
      [00952] To generate additionally strains, a mutant form of ERG20,
      ERG20mut, which preferentially generates GPP was added to the S21
      strain with the following chromosomally integrated GOTs from C.
      sativa: CsPT1 (S164), a truncated CsPT1 (CsPT1_t75, S165), or
      CsPT4 (S29). Constructs used in S29, S164, and S165 are shown in
      Table 11.<br>
      <br>
      [00953] Yeast colonies verified to contain the expected DNA
      assembly comprising one or more heterologous nucleic acids
      disclosed herein were picked into 96-well microtiter plates
      containing 360 µL of YPD (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L Bacto
      peptone, 20 g/L dextrose (glucose)) and sealed with a breathable
      film seal. Cells were cultured at 30 °C in a high capacity
      microtiter plate incubator shaking at 1000 rpm and 80% humidity
      for 3 days until the cultures reached carbon exhaustion. The
      growth-saturated cultures were subcultured into fresh plates
      containing YPGAL and olivetolic acid (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L
      Bacto peptone, 20 g/L galactose, 1 g/L glucose and 1 mM olivetolic
      acid) by taking 14.4 µL from the saturated cultures and diluting
      into 360 µL of fresh media and sealed with a breathable film seal.
      Genetically modified host cells in the production media were
      cultured at 30 °C in a high capacity microtiter plate shaker at
      1000 rpm and 80% humidity for an additional 3 days prior to
      extraction and analysis. Upon completion, 100 µL of whole cell
      broth was diluted into 900 µL of methanol, sealed with a foil
      seal, and shaken at 1500 rpm for 60 seconds to extract the
      cannabinoids. After shaking, the plate was centrifuged at 1000 x g
      for 60 seconds to remove any solids. After centrifugation, 12 µL
      of supernatant was transferred to a fresh assay plate containing
      228 µL of methanol, sealed with a foil seal, shaken for 60 seconds
      at 900 rpm, and analyzed by LC-MS...<br>
