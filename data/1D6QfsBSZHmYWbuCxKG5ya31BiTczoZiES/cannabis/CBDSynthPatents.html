      [0002] The present invention relates to methods for purifying one
      or two cannabinoid compounds using simulated moving bed
      chromatography, wherein the canna- binoid compound(s) is/are
      obtained in the extract and/or the raffinate with the total amount
      of isomeric impurities being below detection level. In particular,
      the present invention relates to methods for the purification of
      cannabidiol, trans-(-)- delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
      cannabidivarin, trans-(-)- delta-9- tetrahydrocannabivarin and
      cannabigerol which have been obtained by enantiopure synthesis.
      Furthermore, the present invention also relates to an extract
      and/or raffinate which is/are obtained or obtainable by the method
      accord- ing to the invention. Since the discovery of the
      endogenous cannabinoid system with its functional significance in
      terms of the regulation and modulation of the immune as well as
      the nervous system, there is an ongoing need for natural and
      artificial canna- binoids for their selective, pharmaceutical
      control. In particular, because of their different medical
      functions, there is a need for targeted, separate stimulation of
      ao the cannabinoid receptors CB1, which are mainly found in
      neurons, in highest density in basal ganglia, in the hippocampus
      and the cerebellum, and of the cannabinoid receptors CB2, which
      are mainly found on cells of the immune sys- tem and on cells that
      are involved in bone formation and bone loss. CA 03023760
      2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905 - 2 - The cannabinoid
      receptors CB1 and CB2 are presumed to be the accepted sites of
      action of molecules with a cannabinoid structure. Even though
      further recep- tors are discussed as potential CB3 receptors, it
      is assumed that the main effects are mediated via CB1 and CB2.
      Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), endogenous
      cannabinoids and a multitude of synthetic cannabinoids connect to
      said receptors and exert through them an effect on the cells
      (Pertwee, R. G. et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2010, 62, 588-631). CB1 and
      CB2 are members of the superfamily of the G protein coupled
      receptors (GPCRs). More precisely, the receptors inhibit the
      adenylate cyclase via the .. heteromeric G protein and activate
      the mitogenically activated protein kinase (Howlett, A. C. et al.
      Pharmacol. Rev. 2002, 54, 161-202; Howlett, A. C. Handb. Exp.
      Pharmacol. 2005, 168, 53-79). In terms of the CB1 receptor it is
      further described that it can modulate potassium flows via ion
      channels of the A-type and calcium flows via N as well as P/Q-type
      channels. Furthermore, CB1 receptors are able to transfer signals
      to the expressing cells via Gs proteins (Glass, M., Felder, C. C.
      J. Neurosci. 1997; 17, 5327-5333; Maneuf, Y. P., Brotchie, J. M.
      J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120, 1397-1398; Calandra, B. et al. Eur. J.
      Pharmacol. 1999; 374, 445-455; Jarrahian, A. et al. J. Pharmacol.
      Exp. Ther. 2004, 308, 880- 886). The ability of CB1 and CB2 to
      transfer signals via Gy0 and further downstream via 2o ..
      inhibition of the adenylate cyclase, is used in the so-called
      [35S]GTP gammaS binding assay and the cAMP assay (Howlett, A. C.
      et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002, 54, 161-202; Pertwee, R. G. Handb.
      Exp. Pharmacol. 2005a, 168, 1-51) to ana- lyze the binding and
      signal transduction of cannabinoids. CB1 receptors have at their
      disposal an orthosteric as well as one or multiple allosteric
      binding site(s), which are considered as potential sites of action
      for ligands (Price, M. R. et al. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005a, 68,
      1484-1495; Adam, L. et al. 17th Annual Symposium of the
      Cannabinoids, 2007, S. 86; Horswill, J. G. et al. J. Pharmacol.
      2007, 152, 805-814; Navarro, H. A. et al. J. Pharmacol. 2009, 156,
      1178-1184). CB1 receptors are mainly found on the terminal ends of
      central and peripheral neurons, where they usually impart an
      inhibition of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters
      (Howlett, A. C. et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002, 54, 161- CA 03023760
      2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905 - 3 - 202; Pertwee, R.
      G., Ross, R. A. Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids, 2002,
      66, 101-121; Szabo, B., Schlicker, E. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005,
      168, 327-365). The distribution of these receptors in the central
      nervous system is in such a way that their activation can
      influence different cognitive processes (e.g. alertness and
      memory, different motor functions und pain perception). CB2
      receptors are mainly localized, as mentioned before, in immune
      cells. Once they get activated, they modulate cell migration and
      the release of cytokines inside and outside the brain (Howlett, A.
      C. et al. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002, 54, 161- 202; Cabral, G. A.,
      Staab, A. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005, 168, 385-423; Pertwee, R.
      G. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2005a, 168, 1-51). There is also some
      evidence that firstly CBI receptors are expressed by non- neuronal
      cells (including immune cells) (Howlett, A. C. et al. Pharmacol.
      Rev. 2002, 54, 161-202) and that secondly CB2 receptors are
      expressed by some cells inside and outside the brain (Skaper, S.
      D. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1996, 93, 3984-3989; Ross, R.
      A. et al. Neuropharmacology 2001a, 40, 221-232; Van Sickle, M. D.
      et al. Science 2005, 310, 329-332; Wotherspoon, G. et al.
      Neuroscience 2005. 135, 235-245; Beltramo, M. et al. Eur. J.
      Neurosci. 2006, 23, 1530-1538; Gong, J. P. et al. Brain Res. 2006,
      1071, 10-23; Baek, J. H. et al. Acta Otolaryngol 2008, 128,
      961-967). Known compounds, which have been proven to have an
      affinity for the aforemen- tioned receptors CBI and CB2, are
      amongst others cannabidiol (CBD) and cer- tain chemical
      derivatives thereof. In particular the active compound
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) from the cannabis plant
      has become a focus of attention in the last couple of years.
      Reduced to only its psycho-active effects in the past, recent
      studies show a more diverse range of effects. Applications in
      cancer and HIV therapy as well as in the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis are found. The (-)-enantiomer has been found to be the
      more active one (Jones, G. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1974, 23:
      439; Roth, S. H., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., 1978, 56: 968;
      Martin, B. R. et al., Life Sciences, 1981, 29: 565; Reichman, M.
      et al. Mol. Pharmacol., 1988, 34: CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO
      2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905 - 4 - 823; Reichman, M. et al., Mol.
      Pharmacol., 1991, 40: 547). Therefore an enantiopure product is
      desirable. Since the isolation of pure trans-(-)-delta- 9-THC from
      cannabis sativa or indica is a very time consuming and expensive
      process (WO 2002/045115 Al), trans-(-)-delta-9-THC is more and
      more synthetically produced under the name dronabinol. This is
      either done in a partially synthetic way by conversion of the
      precursor isolated from the cannabis plant, trans-(-)-
      cannabidiol, to dronabinol (WO 2002/045115 Al) or fully synthetic
      as described in EP 2842933 Bl. Different cannabinoid compounds and
      methods for their manufacture are known io from the prior art.
      Korte et al. (Tetrahedron Letters, 1968, 3, 145-7) describe
      cannabidivarin for the first time and propose a synthesis
      analogous to the one by Petrzilka et al. (Hel- vetica Chimica
      Acta, 1967, 50, 719-723). However, only low yields can be achieved
      this way. Also Crombie et al. (Phytochemistry 1975, 4, 11975)
      describe the synthesis of cannabidivarin in small scale as
      condensation of divarin with para- menthadienol. The synthesis in
      dried CH2C12, saturated with PTSA, however, is not very selec-
      tive and the resulting products are obtained at uneconomical
      proportions. Tetrahydrocannabivarin (here denoted
      delta-1-tetrahydrocannabivarol) is gener- ated the same way at
      higher temperatures and at an uneconomical concentration in a
      multiple compound mixture. WO 2006/136273 describes a method for
      the manufacture of dronabinol ((denot- ed (6a R-
      trans)-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6 ,6,9-trimethy1-3-penty1-6 H-
      dibenzo[b,d]pyran-1-ol, g-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC) in the WO
      document), nowadays according to IUPAC also denoted
      (6aR,10aR)-6,6,9-trimethy1-3-penty1-
      6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-benzo[c]chromen-l-ol or
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, delta-9-THC or A-9-THC) from
      cannabidiol (CBD) via cyclization of cannabidiol (CBD) (2-[1R-3-
      methyl-6-(1-methyletheny1)-2-cyclohexene-1-y1]-5-penty1-1,3-
      benzenediol) to yield delta-9-THC. The described method is
      characterized in that .. cannabidiol (CBD) is provided in an
      organic solvent and is heated and cyclized to delta-9-THC in the
      presence of a molecular sieve. It is stated in WO 2006/136273 CA
      03023760 2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905 - 5 - that
      the used molecular sieve exhibits, besides the drying properties
      that have been described so far, strong catalytic properties,
      which are in the focus of the described conversion. Cyclizations
      that can only be performed in the presence of a Lewis acid
      catalyst are usually significantly slower and deliver worse yields
      of delta-9-THC than cyclizations that are performed in the
      presence of a molecular sieve. Further types of syntheses are
      described in the literature, e.g. by Crombie et al. Chem. Research
      1977, 114, 1301-1345. More recent synthesis methods are disclosed
      inter alia in EP 2314580. The method for the manufacture of canna-
      binoids described therein, is supposed to be applicable to all
      stereoisomers and homologs of cannabinoids and consists of two and
      three chemical synthesis steps, respectively. In a first step,
      alkyl resorcylic acid esters (6-alkyl- 2,4- dihydroxybenzoic acid
      ester) are thereby condensed with unsaturated hydrocar- bons,
      alcohols, ketones (and their derivatives such as enol esters, enol
      ethers and ketals, respectively) to the corresponding
      6-alkyl-2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid esters that are substituted at
      the 3-position. In a second step, the ester function- containing
      intermediates that were produced in the first step are subjected
      to a decarboxylating saponification, giving rise to the
      corresponding ester-free canna- binoids. If necessary, an acid
      catalyzed rearrangement is carried out in a third step. This
      isomerization may be e.g. the ring closure of the pyran ring of
      CBD to give dronabinol, but also the rearrangement of a double
      bond like e.g. the reor- ganization of delta-9 to delta-8-THC or
      an acid catalyzed epimerization like the rearrangement of
      cis-9-ketocannabinoids to the corresponding trans-compounds. US
      5,342,971 describes a method for the manufacture of dronabinol and
      of the related dibenzo[b,d]pyrans. These are produced, according
      to the abstract, through heating of a dihydroxybenzoic acid
      derivative in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst and an inert
      non-polar solvent, in which indeed the dihydroxybenzoic acid is
      soluble, but the Lewis acid catalyst is insoluble or only very
      slightly soluble. .. EP 2842933 B1 discloses a method for
      synthesizing delta-9-THC starting from menthadienol. In a first
      step, menthadienol is reacted with an olivetolic acid ester to a
      cannabidiolic acid ester. This ester is then subjected to a
      transesterification CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173

      [0003] and the product is saponified and decarboxylated to
      cannabidiol. In the last step, cannabidiol is cyclised to

      Analogously, a synthesis of cannabidivarin (CBDV) and

      (VII) cannabidivarin trans-(-)-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabivarin The
      raw product generated by the above mentioned synthesis according
      to EP 2842933 B1 has a delta-9-THC content of 65 - 75 %, as well
      as 20 - 30 % of the isomer delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol as main
      impurity. The purification of trans-(-)-delta-9-THC proves
      difficult because it can not be obtained in crystalline form. Pure
      delta-9-THC is a slightly yellow, air- sensitive resin. Therefore,
      a crystallization as with the related cannabinoids, cannabidiol or
      cannabidivarin is not possible when an enantiopure product is
      desired. Distillation is also not feasible due to the high boiling
      point (about 200 C at 0.02 mbar) and its thermal instability. A
      particular complication is the presence of structurally very
      similar compounds with almost identical chemical and physical
      properties (polari- .. ty, boiling point etc.), which may impede
      purification, such as the two isomers delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol
      and delta-9(11)-tetrahydrocannabinol. H OH A8 -
      Tetrahydrocannabinol A9(11)- Tetrahydrocannabinol The same

      formed. CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905

      [0006] For these reasons, expensive and time consuming
      chromatographic methods are employed. WO 2002/062782 Al discloses
      a method for the production of dronabinol starting with the
      isolation of cannabidiol from fibrous hemp, which is then
      chemically cyclised. According to the examples of WO 2002/062782,
      the resulting reaction mixture comprises up to 86 % of dronabinol,
      which is then isolated chromato- graphically on a silica gel
      column. The solvent is removed and the product is purified by high
      vacuum distillation or crystallization. However, as indicated
      above, distillation of dronabinol is highly inefficient because of
      its thermal instabil- ity and crystallization is only possible
      with an enantiomeric mixture. According to WO 2009/133376 Al,
      delta-9-THC and delta-9-THC carboxylic acid are extracted from
      plant material and then the delta-9-THC carboxylic acid is
      converted to delta-9-THC in the same solvent. For further
      purification, the product is run over a charcoal column, the
      fractions containing delta-9-THC are com- bined, concentrated and
      then purified by reverse phase chromatography. Again, the combined
      fractions containing the product are concentrated, extracted with
      MTBE and filtered. Ethanol is added to the filtrate and the
      solution is concentrat- ed to produce an oil, from which the
      solvent is evaporated. US 2015/0126596 Al relates to methods for
      producing trans-(-)-delta-9-THC and trans-(+)-delta-9-THC in
      several different ways. In one case, the preparation is started
      with an enantiomeric mixture, where the two enantiomers are
      purified together by preparative HPLC and then crystallized as a
      mixture after which, in a resolving step, the (+/-)-enantiomers
      are separated by chiral chromatography. Another way starts also
      with an enantiomeric mixture, which is reacted to a nitro- benzene
      sulfonate, crystallized and reacted back to a clean enantiomeric
      mixture, which is then again separated by chiral chromatography. A
      further way is de- scribed, in which the two separate enantiomers
      are synthesized, mixed for crys- tallization and subsequently
      separated again by chiral chromatography. To purify
      trans-(-)-delta-9-THC by crystallization with the (+)-enantiomer
      and subsequent chiral separation, however, appears to be a very
      complicated purification method, which is bound to result in a
      considerable loss of material and hard to scale up in an efficient
      way. CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO 2017/194173 PCT/EP2016/060905 |EPO

      [0007] Preparative HPLC is only successful on a very small scale
      when large losses of yield are to be avoided. Only small amounts
      of raw product (25 mg) can be sepa- rated into Dronabinol and the
      main impurity, delta-8-THC, as demonstrated in Figures la) and
      1b). Fig. la) shows the preparative HPLC purification of 25 mg raw
      product obtained in the synthesis according to EP 2842933 B1 ,
      wherein the two peaks are dronabinol as main product (larger peak)
      and delta-8-THC as main impurity (smaller peak). Fig. 1 b) shows
      the preparative HPLC purification of 200 mg raw product comprising
      dronabinol as main product and delta-8-THC as main impurity,
      demonstrating that these compounds can not be resolved in this
      quanti- ty. A further chromatographic purification method is super
      critical fluid chromatog- raphy (SFC), in which liquid CO2 is used
      as eluant. The purification of (-)- delta-9- trans-THC by SFC is
      described in WO 2005/061480 Al. This process, however, requires a
      complex constructional setup and is very expensive. Moreover, the
      CO2 evaporates and is lost during processing. Further methods are
      derivatisations of dronabinol or precursors thereof to com- pounds
      which may be crystallized. In order to perform a crystallization,
      the raw product is converted into a crystallizable derivate, which
      is then purified by crys- tallization and finally converted back
      to dronabinol in a chemical conversion step. The most relevant
      methods comprise the derivatisation of delta-9-THC to suitable
      crystallizable salts, subsequent crystallization and thermal
      decarboxylation to dronabinol as described in WO 2013/045115 Al. A
      further option is the derivatisation of raw dronabinol to a
      1-naphtoyl ester, subsequent crystallization and finally
      saponification to pure dronabinol (see WO 2006/007734 Al). In
      summary, the methods to purify cannabinoid compounds available in
      the prior art are fairly complicated, time-consuming and
      expensive. Moreover, certain impurities derived e.g. from
      synthetic preparation steps, which may be structurally very
      similar such as isomers of the desired product, can not be removed
      to a satisfactory degree. This is especially true when the process
      is to be carried out on an economically relevant scale. CA

      [0008] As a result, there is still a need to provide a method for
      the purification of canna- binoid compounds, which is suitable to
      achieve a maximum degree of purity while at the same time allowing
      purification on a large scale in an economically appro- priate,
      i.e. a time and cost efficient way. Simulated moving bed
      chromatography (SMB chromatography) is a continuous process based
      on the true moving bed principle, in which the solid phase moves
      in the opposite direction to the liquid phase and is therefore not
      stationary. Due to this opposing movement two pure compounds can
      be isolated or a pure com- pound can be isolated from a complex
      mixture. io The moving solid phase on which this concept relies,
      however, is technically not feasible and therefore simulated. This
      is implemented by arranging several pre- parative columns
      connected in series and periodically changing the valve setting so
      that a movement of the solid phase in the opposite direction of
      the flow of the liquid phase is simulated. The system is
      continuously fed with a feed mixture comprising the compounds to
      be separated and an eluant while a raffinate and an extract are
      continuously withdrawn from the system. The system is therefore
      divided into four different separation zones, in each of which the
      same number of columns are distributed. The process shown in
      Figure 2 comprises 8 columns in total, but alternatively, only
      four may be used. By periodically switching the feed, eluant,
      extract and raffinate ports in the same direction, each column
      passes through each zone once per cycle. The feed mixture is fed
      into the system between zones II and III, in which the actual
      separation occurs. Zones I and IV are regeneration zones. The
      parameters, which are important for the SMB principle, are the
      periodical change of the position of the ports as well as the
      different flow rates in the four zones. These four flow rates are
      regulated by four pumps. The extract pump in zone II and the
      raffinate pump in zone IV are inside the column circle, the eluant
      and the feed pump are located outside of the column circle. A fine
      regulation is achieved by two needle valves, which regulate the
      ratio between the circle flow and the outlet flow. CA 03023760

      [0009] While the prior art does not provide a process for the
      purification of cannabinoid compounds, which is suitable to
      achieve a purity level comparable to the process according to the
      present invention as described below, in particular when per-
      formed at a preparative scale, it has now been found out, that the
      purification of cannabinoid compounds using a simulated moving bed
      chromatographic system, preferably in combination with one or more
      additional extraction step(s), provides one or two desired
      cannabinoid products with an unexpectedly high degree of purity
      while still allowing the process to be implemented on an
      economically relevant scale. io This finding was unexpected as
      conventional silica gel chromatography of larger amounts of
      dronabinol fails to provide a viable option to separate the
      product from its isomers, while it is on the other hand not
      feasible to scale up reversed phase HPLC chromatography to
      preparative significant amounts. The method according to the
      invention, however, surprisingly compensates both theses prob-
      lems and provides a way to obtain pure product on a large scale.
      It was therefore an objective of the present invention to provide
      a purification method which overcomes the above mentioned
      problems. In particular, it was an objective of the present
      invention to provide a purification process for one or two
      cannabinoid compound(s) from a reaction mixture derived 2o from a
      synthetic preparation process, especially a process as described
      in EP 2842933 B1 . It was also an object of the present invention
      to obtain the desired cannabinoid compound(s) in a degree of
      purity that any of its/their isomers are below a detec- tion level
      and furthermore in enantiopure form. The objectives given above
      are met by a method for purifying one or two can- nabinoid
      compounds comprising the steps: i) providing a mixture comprising
      at least one cannabinoid compound obtained by enantiopure
      synthesis and one or more of its isomers and optionally one or
      more further organic compounds, and CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO

      [0010] ii) simultaneously, a) continuously feeding the mixture of
      step i) through a feed port into a simulated moving bed
      chromatographic apparatus com- prising at least four columns
      connected in series and containing a stationary phase, and b)
      continuously feeding eluant into the apparatus through an eluant
      port, and c) continuously withdrawing the extract through an
      extract port, and d) continuously withdrawing the raffinate
      through a raffinate port, wherein the extract and/or the raffinate
      respectively comprise(s) one purified cannabinoid compound and
      wherein the extract and/or the raffinate comprising one purified
      cannabinoid compound comprise(s) less than 100 ppm, preferably
      less than 70 ppm, particularly preferably less than 50 ppm in
      total of any iso- mer(s) of the purified cannabinoid compound
      present in step i). As described above, SMB chromatography allows
      separation and purification of one or simultaneously two desired
      product compounds, the stronger adsorbing compound is obtained as
      the extract and the weaker adsorbing compound is obtained as the
      raffinate. Advantageously, a mixture comprising at least one
      cannabinoid compound together with at least one of its isomers,
      such as a reac- tion mixture from a synthesis step, may be
      subjected to the method according to the invention to provide
      highly pure products in large yields. The at least one cannabinoid
      compound and its isomer(s) present in the mixture provided in step
      i) are likely very similar in chemical structure and therefore
      also in their physical properties. Consequently, they are
      particularly hard to separate. Using the meth- od according to the
      present invention, however, the cannabinoid compound(s) can
      efficiently be separated from their isomers. CA 03023760

      <br>
      [0011] The one or more further organic compound(s) present in the
      mixture provided in step i) may be any compound(s) selected from
      synthetic starting materials or side products of the synthesis,
      which are not cannabinoid compounds. As the steps a) to d) are
      carried out simultaneously and continuously, the process is very
      time efficient and the required amount of eluant is significantly
      reduced compared to conventional chromatography. Additionally, it
      is advantageous that the solid phase can be used for separation
      during the entire process. This in- creases the efficiency of the
      separation and simultaneously reduces the required amount of
      eluant. Once the adsorption equilibrium is reached, the
      composition of io .. the raffinate and extract do not change
      anymore as long as the respective pa- rameters are not changed.
      The loss of valuable materials is reduced to &lt;5%. As a
      simulated moving bed chromatographic apparatus, any system
      suitable to perform simulated moving bed chromatography may be
      used. The stationary or solid phase may be any material, which the
      skilled person can easily choose according to the nature of the
      mixture and the compounds to be separated. To determine the
      respective flow rates at the different pumps, several methods and
      models are known in the prior art which may be implemented in
      order to achieve an optimal separation of the desired compound(s).
      The desired compound(s) is/are obtained in the extract and/or the
      raffinate in a degree of purity with respect to any isomer of the
      desired cannabinoid com- pound(s), which is preferably below
      detection limit, in particular the total amount of any isomer of
      the cannabinoid compound(s) which was/were present in step i) is
      less than 100 ppm, preferably less than 70 ppm and particularly
      preferably less than 50 ppm. The degree of purity may be
      determined chromatographically using an HPLC apparatus (e.g.
      Knauer HPLC smartline series) and the appropriate USP reference
      standards for dronabinol and its isomers. A Restek - Raptor (ARC -
      18, 2.7 mm, 150 x 4.6 mm) HPLC column may be used together with
      the re- spective USP eluent (45 % methanol, 25 % water, 20 %
      tetrahydrofuran, 10 % acetonitrile) with an eluent flow of 0.8 mL
      / min. .. According to a further aspect the method as described
      above additionally com- prises the step CA 03023760 2018-11-09 WO

      [0012] iii) subjecting the extract and/or the raffinate comprising
      one purified cannabinoid compound to one, two or more further
      extraction step(s), preferably using an oil as the extracting
      agent, wherein the extract and/or the raffinate respectively
      obtained in step iii) com- prise(s) one purified cannabinoid
      compound and less than 100 ppm, preferably less than 70 ppm,
      particularly preferably less than 50 ppm in total of any further
      organic compound(s) present in step i). By subjecting the desired
      cannabinoid compound(s) which is/are contained in the extract
      and/or the raffinate to one or more further extraction step(s),
      impurities io other than the isomers present in step i) can be
      removed. In particular, organic compounds, which may be present
      from the synthetic step such as starting mate- rials or side
      products of the synthesis can be removed to a degree such that
      they are present in an total amount of less than 100 ppm,
      preferably less than 70 ppm, particularly preferably less than 50
      ppm. The extraction agent may be any substance selected from the
      group consisting of cyclohexane, heptane and other oxygen free
      hydrocarbons. Suitable oils to be used as extracting agents are
      selected from the group consist- ing of plant oils with medium
      chain triglycerides, preferably containing the fatty acids capric
      acid and caprylic acid. Advantageously, when using an oil as
      extract- ing agent, the resulting product comprising the desired
      cannabinoid compound ¨ besides being highly pure ¨ is particularly
      stable when kept under argon and in the dark. In particular, the
      medium chain triglycerides mentioned above provide an antioxidant
      effect and therefore enhance the stability of the product. In the
      method according to the invention, the cannabinoid compound(s) to
      be purified may be selected from the group consisting of
      cannabidiol, trans-(-)- delta- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
      cannabidivarin, trans-(-)-delta-9- tetrahydrocannabivarin and
      cannabigerol. Any of these compounds may be obtained by chemical
      synthesis as described in the prior art, which results in reaction
      mixtures comprising one or more canna- binoid compounds such as
      the desired product and its synthetic precursors, as&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      [0013] well as at least one isomer of the product compound(s) and
      further organic com- pounds such as starting materials or side
      products of the synthesis, which are not cannabinoid compounds.
      These mixtures can be purified to a high degree and with good
      yields on a large scale by the method according to the present
      inven- tion. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the method
      according to the invention is used to purify the reaction
      product(s) of the synthesis steps described in EP 2842933 B1 . The
      reaction product(s) to be purified are preferably trans-(-)-
      delta- 9-THC (III) or cannabidiol (II). io According to one
      aspect, in the method according to the present invention step i)
      includes the following step: conversion of menthadienol with an
      olivetolic acid ester to a cannabidiolic ac- id ester of formula
      (IX) OHO 0 'IFIO (IX) wherein Y is an organic residue, preferably
      in a continuous process. According to a further aspect, step i)
      comprises the conversion of a cannabidiolic acid ester of formula
      (IX), wherein Y is an organic residue with an alcohol of the
      formula HO-X, wherein <br>
      <br>
      [0014] X is an aliphatic residue with one, two, three or more than
      three hydroxyl groups, wherein the total number of C-atoms in the
      aliphatic residue X is not greater than 15, and wherein the
      aliphatic residue is - saturated or unsaturated and - branched or
      unbranched, wherein Y is different from X and selected such that
      the alcohol of formula HO- Y, which is generated during the
      conversion, boils at a lower temperature at 1013 hPa than the used
      alcohol of formula HO-X. According to yet another aspect of the
      method according to the invention, the compound generated by the
      conversion of the cannabidiolic acid ester of formula (IX) with
      the alcohol of formula HO-X is treated in such a way that it is
      decarboxylated and saponified to generate cannabidiol (II). In a
      further aspect of the method according to the invention, the
      cannabidiol, which is present after the decarboxylating
      saponification, is cyclised to trans-(-)-
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (III), preferably in the absence of
      halogenated sol- vents. In the synthesis of
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol according to EP 2842933 B1, an 2o
      impurity which is very hard to remove is olivetol, which is
      generated during the synthesis. Surprisingly, when the method
      according to the present invention is used to purify the product
      delta-9-THC in combination with the one or more further extraction
      step(s), any residual olivetol can be removed to such a degree
      that it is no more detectable by conventional HPLC analysis as
      demonstrated in example 3.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      [0015] Therefore the present invention particularly relates to a
      method as described above, wherein the one or one of the further
      organic compound(s) present in step i) is olivetol. Furthermore,
      as already mentioned in the introduction, the raw product
      generated by the synthesis according to EP 2842933 B1 has a
      delta-9-THC content of 65 ¨ 75 %, as well as 20 ¨ 30 A of the
      isomer delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol as main impurity. Furthermore,
      delta-9(11)-tetrahydrocannabinol may be present. Due to the
      structural similarity of the isomers, the desired delta-9-THC is
      very hard to purify from this reaction mixture. io Using the
      method according to the present invention, however, a purity may
      be obtained such that these isomers can no more be detected in the
      product as demonstrated in example 3. Therefore in a particularly
      preferred embodiment, in the method according to the invention,
      the mixture provided in step i) comprises trans-(-)-delta-9-
      tetrahydrocannabinol together with delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol
      and/or delta- 9(11 )-tetrahydrocannabinol. According to a further
      preferred embodiment, the method according to the inven- tion is
      used to purify the reaction product(s) of the synthesis steps
      described in European patent application EP 15156750Ø The reaction
      product(s) to be pun- 2o fied are preferably cannabidivarin (VII)
      or trans-(-)-delta-9- tetrahydrocannabivarin (VIII). According to
      one aspect in the method according to the present invention, step
      i) comprises the conversion of menthadienol of formula (I) with a
      divarinic acid ester of formula (IV), to an ester of formula
      (V),&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      [0016] OH OH 0 OH 0 001 + HO HO 14111 (I) (IV) (V) According to a
      further aspect, in the method according to the invention, step i)
      comprises the transesterification of the ester of formula (V) with
      an alcohol of the formula HO-X, wherein X is an aliphatic residue
      with no, one, two, three or more than three hy- droxyl groups,
      wherein the total number of C-atoms in the aliphatic resi- due X
      is not greater than 15, and io wherein the aliphatic residue is -
      saturated or unsaturated and - branched or unbranched, - acyclic
      or cyclic, with the proviso that the alcohol of formula HO-X is
      selected from the group consisting of cyclohexanol and hexanol in
      case X is an aliphatic residue with no hydroxyl group. According
      to yet a further aspect, in the method according to the invention,
      the compound generated by the conversion of ester of formula (V)
      with the alcohol of <br>
      <br>
      [0017] formula HO-X is treated in such a way that it is
      decarboxylated and saponified to generate cannabidivarin (VII). In
      a further aspect of the method according to the invention, the
      cannabidivarin, which is present after the decarboxylating
      saponification, is cyclised to trans-(-)-
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (VIII), preferably in the absence
      of halogenated solvents. The reaction products of the synthesis
      steps as described in European patent application EP 15156750.0,
      may be purified by the method according to the invention. The
      advantages described above in the context of the purification of
      io the synthesis product(s) according to EP 2842933 apply
      accordingly. Finally, the present invention also relates to an
      extract or raffinate obtained or obtainable in step c) or d) of a
      method as described above, or an extract or raffi- nate obtained
      or obtainable in step iii) of a method as described in the context
      of the corresponding embodiment above. An extract or raffinate
      obtained or obtainable in step c) or d) of a method as described
      above, or an extract or raffinate obtained or obtainable in step
      iii) of a method as described in the context of the corresponding
      embodiment above, comprises the desired cannabinoid compound in a
      degree of purity, in particular with respect to its isomers, which
      could not be achieved by any of the conven- tional processes
      available in the prior art. The following examples describe
      particular embodiments of the present inven- tion, without meaning
      to limit the scope of protection. Example 1: Synthesis of

      flow rate of 24 mL/ min are pumped into a stirred reaction chamber
      via two separate dosing pumps, from the reaction chamber the
      reaction composition runs via a PTFE hose into a stirred solution
      of 1,000 g of sodium bicarbonate. The total reaction time is ca.
      20 min. After termination of the metering the hydro- lyzed
      reaction solution is stirred for a further 30 min. Then the
      hydrolyzed reaction solution is transferred into a 5L jacket
      reaction vessel, the aqueous phase is separated and the solvent
      chlorobenzene is re- moved in vacuo. Ca. 2,000 g of toluene are
      added to the remaining 730 g of raw material and the unreacted
      olivetolic acid ester is extracted through the addition of 1,200 g
      1% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (four times). After
      acidifying with semi conc. sulfuric acid and re-extraction of this
      aqueous phase, ca. 30% (140 g) of non converted olivetolic acid
      ester are recovered. There are ca. 520 g of cannabidiolic acid
      methyl ester in the toluene phase, which corresponds to a
      theoretical yield of ca. 70%. This first intermediate serves as
      starting material for the following transesterification. Step 2:

      solution A), likewise, an adequate amount of
      borontrifluoride*etherate are dissolved in 540g toluene at RT
      (710mL solution B). Solution A and solution B are pumped into a
      stirred reaction chamber via two separate dosing pumps, from the
      reaction chamber the reaction composi- tion runs via a PTFE hose
      into a stirred solution of 1,000 g of sodium bicar- bonate. The
      total reaction time is about 25 mins. After termination of the
      metering the hydrolyzed reaction solution is stirred for about 1
      hour. Then the hydrolyzed reaction solution is transferred into a
      5L jacket reaction vessel, the aqueous phase is separated. The not
      reacted divarinic acid ester is extracted by six times adding
      1.000g of 1% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After acidifying
      with semi conc. sulfuric acid and re-extraction of this aqueous
      phase, ca. 30% (130 g) of non converted divarinic acid ester are
      recovered. In the toluene phase, about 320g cannabidivarinic acid
      methylester (V) are con- tamed, which corresponds to a theoretical
      yield of 50%. This first intermediate serves as starting material

      using a rotary evaporator and the remainder is distilled over a
      thin- film io .. evaporator using a vacuum of ca. 1 mbar and a
      jacket temperature of 230 C. 270 g of cannabidivarin (VII) are
      obtained in the form of a viscous, yellowish oil with a purity of
      85%, which corresponds to a theoretical yield of 85% in relation
      to the used cannabivarinic acid ester. This viscous, yellowish oil
      is then recrystallized in ca. 270 g of n-heptane at ca. 10 C,
      after which 190 g of white to lightly yellow crystallizate with a
      purity of 99% cannabidivarin (VII) are obtained. Step 4:

      within 10 min at ca. 22 C. It is stirred for 20 mins at said
      temperature and then 200 g of ice water are added, the organic
      phase is washed with sodium bicarbonate solution and the solvent
      is removed using a rotary evaporator. The remaining raw material

      3 shows the exemplary chromatogram of LN 703795. The
      chromatographic system is based on a known SMB apparatus of the
      com- pany Knauer (Germany). The system comprises 8 separation
      columns (Knauer Vertex Plus, 250 x 8 mm), as well as the required
      pumps. The column configura- tion corresponds to the standard 2 ¨
      2 ¨ 2 ¨ 2 arrangement. The movement of the individual columns is
      implemented by a 64 port rotary valve. The switching time of the
      valve is 10.81 seconds. The valve and the HPLC columns are located
      in a tempered column oven. The temperature of the chromatographic
      system is to 60 C, preferably 30 C. 15 A solid phase suitable for
      the separation is an RP material (Eurospher ll silica gel, C18P)
      with a grain size of 10 to 100 pm, preferably 20 to 45 pm. The
      solid phase showed no signs of deterioration over a time period of
      two years. This is a further advantage compared to classical
      chromatographic systems. As mobile (liquid) phase / eluant a
      mixture of methanol, tetrahydrofuran and 20 water is used,
      preferably with the composition: methanol (62%), tetrahydofuran<br>
      <br>
      [0024] (17%), water (21%). Furthermore, 0.01% ascorbic acid is
      added to the mixture as antioxidant. The feed mixture comprises
      the above described raw product dissolved in eluant mixture at a
      concentration of 12.5 g/L. The eluant, extract and raffinate pump
      .. each have a maximum flow rate of 50 ml/min, the feed pump a
      maximum flow rate of 10 ml/min. In the process described herein,
      the following flow rates are used: eluant pump (zone 1; 4.4
      ml/min), extract pump (zone 2, 3.2 ml/min), raffi- nate pump (zone
      4, 1.3 ml/min) and feed pump (zone 3, 0.2 ml/min). The flow rates
      are measured with a Humonics Optiflow 520. io The supply of the
      system with eluant and feed solution is done from suitable stock
      containers, which are secured for fire safety. Eluant and feed
      solution are periodically overlaid with argon to keep oxygen from
      the air out. Before entering the system, eluant and feed solution
      are pumped though a deaerator. The SMB process does not need a
      constant supervision. The process described herein may be run
      continuously over several weeks without changing the pa- rameters
      and without having a change in the yield. The particular stability
      of the process allows a 24 hour operation, without needing shift
      workers. Internal con- trols of the process are performed once a
      day. With the process described herein, 0.15 g/ hour of dronabinol
      can continuously be obtained from the raffinate. This corresponds
      to a daily rate of 3.6 g. By upscaling the process from 8 mm to 50
      mm columns, the daily yield can be increased to 144 g of pure
      dronabinol. This corresponds to a yearly production of about 40 kg
      of dronabinol. The raffinate derived from the SMB process has the
      following composition: HPLC-Analysis: raffinate (DAD, in Area-%)<br>

      The invention provides a cannabidiol synthesis method. The method
      includes: taking 2,4-dyhydroxy-6-pentyl methyl benzoate as a raw
      material, and subjecting to ester exchange with N,N-dialkyl
      alcohol amine under potassium hydroxide catalysis; subjecting to
      coupled reaction with (1S,
      4R)-1-methyl-4-(1-methylvinyl)-2-cyclohexene-1-alcohol under Lewis
      acid catalysis; performing acid-base extraction and
      recrystallization to obtain a high-purity key intermediate
      product; subjecting to hydrolysis decarboxylation to obtain crude
      cannabidiol, and subjecting the crude cannabidiol to once
      recrystallization to obtain cannabidiol according with raw
      medicine quality requirements. The cannabidiol synthesis method
      has advantages that raw materials and reagents are cheap and
      commercially easy to acquire, the total yield of the finally
      prepared raw medicine in qualified purity reaches 35-40%, the
      process is improved evidently, and the method has a promising

      The present invention provides a transesterification of
      N,N-dialkylolamine catalyzed by potassium hydroxide with
      2,4-dihydroxy-6-pentyl benzoic acid methyl ester as a raw
      material, and then The coupling reaction of
      1S,4R)-1-methyl-4-(1-methylvinyl)-2-cyclohexene-1-ol is catalyzed
      by Lewis acid, and is obtained by acid-base extraction and
      recrystallization. The key intermediate product of purity is
      hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to obtain crude cannabisdiol. The
      crude product can be recrystallized at one time to obtain
      cannabisdiol which meets the quality requirements of the drug
      substance. The raw materials and reagents in the method of the
      invention are low in price and commercially available, and the
      total yield of the qualified raw materials obtained in the final
      method is up to 35-40%, and the process is obviously improved,
      which has a good industrial application prospect.<br>

      <b>Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b>Cannabinoids are distinguished from L-trans- cannabinol,
      English name (-)-Cannabidiol, which is a very marketable drug
      substance. The structural formula of this compound is:<br>
      [image]<br>
      Currently, cannabidiol is mainly used to protect nerves,
      anti-caries, anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety effects. 2015GW
      Biopharmaceuticals announced that it has updated its clinical
      trial data on pure cannabinol for refractory childhood epilepsy.
      In 2014, the drug has been approved by the US FDA for rare
      diseases and fast-track approval for the treatment of infants.
      Myoclonic epilepsy, which makes the market prospects for this drug
      more widespread. It is cheap, efficient and easy to operate. It is
      suitable for the industrial synthetic production process and will
      greatly promote the application of cannabidiol.<br>
      <b><br>
        US20090036523</b>A1 uses olive alcohol as a starting material
      and is catalyzed by p-toluenesulfonic acid to obtain the target
      product in one step, as follows:<br>
      [image]<br>
      <br>
      However, the reaction system is complicated, and there are many
      isomers and dimers, and the post-treatment is troublesome. It
      requires column chromatography purification and the yield is low,
      only 24%, which is not suitable for scale-up production.<br>
      <b><br>
        WO2006053766</b>A1 utilizes zinc chloride to catalyze the
      synthesis of the target product. This document reports a process
      for obtaining a product without column purification, but the
      purity of the product is only 97.1%, and the yield is only 22%. We
      repeated the test on the literature and found that the largest
      single impurity in the reaction process is dimer, which is more
      than 20%. The impurity needs to be crystallized more than 3 times
      to fall within 0.1% (to meet the requirements of API). When the
      qualified API is finally obtained, the total yield is only 13%,
      and the process cost is high.<br>
      <br>
      <b>US20100298579</b>A1 is prepared by using methyl
      2,4-dihydroxy-6-pentanylbenzoate as a starting material and
      catalyzed by boron trifluoride diethyl ether to prepare a coupled
      methyl ester intermediate (I). The purity of the reaction is one
      step. Slightly higher, isomers and dimers are also significantly
      less than one-step. However, after the coupling, the methyl ester
      intermediate is still only about 75% pure after acid-base
      treatment, and the melting point of the compound may be low and
      cannot be crystallized (intermediate I has not been reported as
      melting point, even if the purity of the column is 98. % of the
      intermediate I was crystallized and eventually could not be
      precipitated as a solid). The methyl ester intermediate I cannot
      be recrystallized and purified by a conventional method, so that
      the chemical purity and the single impurity index requirement as
      key intermediates of the drug substance cannot be achieved.<br>
      [image]<br>
      In addition to the above two chemical synthesis methods, there are
      some reports that can be obtained by biological extraction of
      cannabidiol, but such method steps are cumbersome, and industrial
      production limitations are too large.<br>
