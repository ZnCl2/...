OF

        THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to the field of
      chemical synthesis. More specifically, the present invention
      relates methods of converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.8-THC or
      .DELTA..sup.9-THC. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Recently, public interest in Cannabis as medicine has been
      growing, based in no small part on the fact that Cannabis has long
      been considered to have medicinal properties, ranging from
      treatment of cramps, migraines, convulsions, appetite stimulation
      and attenuation of nausea and vomiting. In fact, a report issued
      by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine
      indicated that the active components of Cannabis appear to be
      useful in treating pain, nausea, AIDS-related weight loss or
      "wasting", muscle spasms in multiple sclerosis as well as other
      problems. Advocates of medical marijuana argue that it is also
      useful for glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,
      migraines, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] Marijuana refers to varieties of Cannabis having a high
      content of .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol (.DELTA..sup.9-THC),
      which is the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana whereas
      industrial hemp refers to varieties of the Cannabis plant that
      have a low content of .DELTA..sup.9-THC. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] Furthermore, .DELTA..sup.9-THC is only one of a family of
      about 60 bi- and tri-cyclic compounds named cannabinoids. For
      example, .DELTA..sup.8-THC is a double bond isomer of
      .DELTA..sup.9-THC and is a minor constituent of most varieties of
      Cannabis (Hollister and Gillespie, 1972, Clin Pharmacol Ther 14:
      353). The major chemical difference between the two compounds is
      that .DELTA..sup.9-THC is easily oxidized to cannabinol whereas
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC does not and is in fact very stable.
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC, for the most part, produces similar
      psychometric effects as does .DELTA..sup.9-THC, but is generally
      considered to be 50% less potent than .DELTA..sup.9-THC and has
      been shown in some cases to be 3-10 times less potent.
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC has also been shown to be more (200%) effective
      an anti-emetic than .DELTA..sup.9-THC and has been used as an
      anti-emetic in children, based on the belief that the side effects
      of .DELTA..sup.9-THC and .DELTA..sup.8-THC, such as anxiety and
      dysphoria, are more prevalent in adults than children (Abrahamov
      et al, 1995, Life Sciences 56: 2097-2102). On the other hand, CBD
      has no activity on its own when administered to humans. It is of
      note that CBD is typically about 2% (0.5-4%) dry weight of hemp
      chaff, .DELTA..sup.8-THC is approximately 0.2% (0.05-0.5%) dry
      weight and .DELTA..sup.9-THC is approximately 0.1% (0.05-0.3%). <br>
      <br>
      [0006] Gaoni and Mechoulam (1966, Tetrahedron 22: 1481-1488) teach
      methods of converting CBD to, among other compounds,
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC and .DELTA..sup.9-THC comprising boiling a
      solution of CBD (3.0 g) in absolute ethanol (100 ml) containing
      0.05% HCl for 18 hours. The solution was then poured into water
      and extracted with ether. The ether solution was washed with
      water, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and evaporated. .DELTA..sup.8-THC
      and .DELTA..sup.9-THC were eluted from the resulting oil and
      separated by chromatography. In another experiment, CBD (3.14 g)
      was dissolved in benzene (100 ml) containing 2 mg/ml
      p-toluenesulphonic acid and boiled for two hours. The reaction
      mixture was poured into water and the upper layer was separated,
      washed with 5% NaHCO.sub.3, then with water, dried and evaporated.
      Elution with pentane-ether (95:5) gave an oily material which was
      subsequently distilled. Percentage yield of .DELTA..sup.8-THC
      (.DELTA..sup.1(6)-THC) was given as 64% of the crude material in
      this paper. The crude oil product, which showed only one spot by
      thin layer chromatography, was purified by vacuum distillation. <br>
      <br>
      [0007] Gaoni and Mechoulam (1964, J Amer Chem Soc 86: 1646) also
      described a method for converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC
      comprising boiling a mixture of CBD in ethanol containing 0.05%
      hydrogen chloride for 2 hours. Percentage yield of
      .DELTA..sup.9-THC (.DELTA..sup.1-THC) was 2% (Mechoulam et al,
      1972, J Amer Chem Soc 94: 6159-6165; Mechoulam and Gaoni, 1965, J
      Amer Chem Soc 87: 3273). Using boron trifluoride, the yield was
      70% (Gaoni and Mechoulam, 1971, J Amer Chem Soc 93: 217-224)
      although purity was not given. <br>
      <br>
      [0008] Clearly, as the cannabinoids are of potential medicinal
      value, improved methods of converting CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC or
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC are needed. <br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</span> <br>
      <br>
      [0043] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific
      terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by
      one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs.
      Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those

      present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now
      described. All publications mentioned hereunder are incorporated
      herein by reference. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DEFINITIONS </span><br>
      <br>
      [0044] As used herein, CBD refers to cannabidiol. <br>
      <br>
      [0045] As used herein, .DELTA..sup.9-THC refers to
      .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol. <br>
      <br>
      [0046] As used herein, .DELTA..sup.8-THC refers to
      .DELTA..sup.8-tetrahydrocannabinol. <br>
      <br>
      [0047] As used herein, "Lewis acid" refers to a powerful electron
      pair acceptor. Examples include but are by no means limited to
      BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O, p-toluenesulfonic acid and boron trifluoride. <br>
      <br>
      [0048] Described herein are methods and protocols for converting
      cannabidiol (CBD) to .DELTA..sup.8-tetrahydrocannabinol
      (.DELTA..sup.8-THC) or .DELTA..sup.9-tetrahydrocannabinol
      (.DELTA..sup.9-THC). As will be appreciated by one knowledgeable
      in the art and as discussed below, the reaction times may be
      varied somewhat, producing product at different yields and
      purities. Furthermore, functional equivalents may be substituted
      where appropriate. <br>
      <br>
      [0049] Specifically, described herein is a method of converting
      CBD to a tetrahydrocannabinol comprising: providing a reaction
      mixture comprising a catalyst in an organic solvent, adding CBD to
      the reaction mixture, mixing said reaction mixture, allowing the
      mixture to separate into an aqueous phase and an organic phase;
      removing the organic phase, and eluting the tetrahydrocannabinol
      from the organic phase. The tetrahydrocannabinol may then be
      combined with suitable excipients known in the art, thereby
      forming a pharmaceutical composition. <br>
      <br>
      [0050] In some embodiments, the tetrahydrocannabinol at
      therapeutically effective concentrations or dosages be combined
      with a pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable carrier,
      excipient or diluent, either biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
      Exemplary examples of carriers include, but are by no means
      limited to, for example, poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate), copolymers
      of lactic acid and glycolic acid, poly(lactic acid), gelatin,
      collagen matrices, polysaccharides, poly(D,L lactide), poly(malic
      acid), poly(caprolactone), celluloses, albumin, starch, casein,
      dextran, polyesters, ethanol, mathacrylate, polyurethane,
      polyethylene, vinyl polymers, glycols, mixtures thereof and the
      like. Standard excipients include gelatin, casein, lecithin, gum
      acacia, cholesterol, tragacanth, stearic acid, benzalkonium
      chloride, calcium stearate, glyceryl monostearate, cetostearyl
      alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax, sorbitan esters,
      polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene castor oil
      derivatives, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters,
      polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylene stearates, colloidol silicon
      dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate, carboxymethylcellulose
      calcium, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, methylcellulose,
      hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,
      hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, noncrystalline cellulose,
      magnesium aluminum silicate, triethanolamine, polyvinyl alcohol,
      polyvinylpyrrolidone, sugars and starches. See, for example,
      Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 1995, Gennaro ed.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0051] In some embodiments, the catalyst is a Lewis acid, for
      example, p-toluenesulfonic acid, boron trifluoride or
      BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O. In some embodiments, the BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O is
      in dry methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexane or other
      organic solvent. In yet other examples, the catalyst may be
      hydrochloric acid in ethanol or sulfuric acid in cyclohexane. <br>
      <br>
      [0052] In some embodiments, a weak base is added to the reaction
      mixture prior to allowing the reaction mixture to separate into
      organic and aqueous phases. The base may be an alkali metal
      hydrogen carbonate or a carbonate of an alkali metal. <br>
      <br>
      [0053] In some embodiments, the organic layer is dried prior to
      eluting. In these embodiments, a suitable drying or dehydration
      compound, for example, MgSO.sub.4 or Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 is used. <br>
      <br>
      [0054] In yet other embodiments, the process may be carried out
      under a nitrogen atmosphere. <br>
      <br>
      [0055] As discussed below, yield is determined by looking at the
      peak area for the isolated compound in the gas
      chromatography--mass spectra analysis of the crude reaction
      product mixture. It is important to note that in the prior art,
      yield is often calculated on the basis of the basis of first
      isolated crude product before final purification. In some
      embodiments of the process, as discussed below, yield is at least
      50%. In other embodiments, the yield is at least 60%. In other
      embodiments, yield is at least 70%. In yet other embodiments,
      yield is 70-85%. <br>
      <br>
      [0056] Purity is also determined by GC-MS and also by analytical
      HPLC. The total ion chromatogram from the GC-MS gives information
      similar to that provided by an FID-GC in that the peak area is
      proportional to the mass of the analytes detected. Total peak area
      and the peak areas of the individual analytes can be compared in
      the GC-MS case as long as the masses are in generally the same
      range. As discussed below, in some embodiments, purity of the
      tetrahydrocannabinols isolated by the process is greater than 90%.
      In yet other embodiments, purity is greater than 95%. In yet other
      embodiments, purity is greater than 97%. In yet other embodiments,
      purity is 98-99%. <br>
      <br>
      [0057] The invention will now be described by means of examples,
      although the invention is not limited to these examples. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE I </span><br>
      <br>
      Conversion of CBD TO .DELTA..sup.8-THC <br>
      <br>
      [0058] CBD (300 mg) was added to dried p-toluenesulfonic acid (30
      mg) in toluene (15 ml), under N.sub.2 atmosphere. In this example,
      the mixture was refluxed (under N.sub.2) for 1 hour, although
      other time periods may also be used, as discussed below. It was
      then diluted with ether (20 ml) and poured into cold water, The
      upper layer was separated, washed with aqueous 5% NaHCO.sub.3,
      then with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and evaporated. The viscous
      oil showed mainly one spot on TLC (using 20% ether in petroleum
      ether as eluent). HPLC, on the crude oil, showed the presence of
      86% .DELTA..sup.8-THC. The oil was chromatographed on a silica gel
      column (6 g). Elution with 5 to 10% ether in petroleum ether gave
      a fraction (244 mg, 81%) of .DELTA..sup.8-THC 98.6% pure. When the
      reaction was carried out using various reflux times showed the
      presence of 79.33% .DELTA..sup.8-THC (15 minutes), 81.7%
      .DELTA..sup.8-THC (30 minutes) and 84.6% .DELTA..sup.8-THC (2
      hours). <br>
      <br>
      [0059] In the example described above, normal phase HPLC
      separation is used wherein the column is for example a silica gel
      and the mobile phase is organic, for example, hexane or ethyl
      ether-hexane. In other embodiments, reverse phase HPLC separation
      is used, wherein the column is for example C18 bonded silica gel
      and the mobile phase is water-methanol or water-acetonitrile. In
      each case, solvent programming is used. <br>
      <br>
      [0060] The p-toluenesulfonic acid is used as a catalyst in the
      above example. It is of note that boron trifluoride could also be
      used as a catalyst, as could a number of other Lewis acids known
      in the art. It is of note that the exact proportion is not
      essential to the reaction proceeding. It is of further note that
      the nitrogen atmosphere does not appear as necessary as during the
      conversion of CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC. It is also of note that
      other solvents may also be used, for example, benzene, but toluene
      has produced the best results so far. <br>
      <br>
      [0061] In other embodiments, anhydrous Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 or another
      suitable drying or dehydration agent known in the art is used in
      place of the MgSO.sub.4. <br>
      <br>
      [0062] In other embodiments, an alkali metal hydrogen carbonate or
      carbonate of an alkali metal is used instead of NaHCO.sub.3. <br>
      <br>
      [0063] The nitrogen atmosphere may prevent oxidation of the
      reaction intermediate, thereby enhancing the yield. Diluting into
      ether first and then adding the water again prevents undue
      exposure to oxidizing conditions. The water still quenches the
      reaction catalyst, but the reaction product is dissolved in the
      toluene and ether and is to some extent protected. That is, it is
      not in as intimate contact with the water and not as susceptible
      to oxidation as it would be if the water were to be added first. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE II </span><br>
      <br>
      Conversion of CBD to .DELTA..sup.9-THC <br>
      <br>
      [0064] BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O (50 .mu.l) was added, under nitrogen
      atmosphere, to ice cold solution of CBD (300 mg) in dry methylene
      chloride (15 ml). The solution was stirred at 0.degree. C. for 1
      hour. Saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO.sub.3 (2 ml) was added
      until the red color faded. The organic layer was removed, washed
      with water, dried over MgSO.sub.4 and evaporated. The composition
      of the oil obtained (determined by HPLC):
      trans-.DELTA..sup.8-isoTHC 27%, .DELTA..sup.9-THC 66.7%. The oil
      was chromatographed on silica gel column (20 g) and eluted with
      petroleum ether followed by graded mixtures, up to 2:98 of ether
      in petroleum ether. The first fraction eluted was the
      .DELTA..sup.8-iso THC (30 mg, 9.5%) followed by a mixture of
      .DELTA..sup.8-iso THC and .DELTA..sup.9-THC (100 mg). The last
      compound to be eluted was the .DELTA..sup.9-THC (172 mg, 57%). The
      purity of .DELTA..sup.9-THC (as determined by HPLC) was 98.7%. <br>
      <br>
      [0065] It is of note that when the reaction was carried in the
      presence of MgSO.sub.4 (120 mg), the composition of the oil
      obtained (determined by FIPLC) was: trans-.DELTA..sup.8-isoTHC
      20.15%, .DELTA..sup.9-THC 56.7%. <br>
      <br>
      [0066] In the example described above, normal phase HPLC
      separation is used wherein the column is for example a silica gel
      and the mobile phase is organic, for example, hexane or ethyl
      ether-hexane. In other embodiments, reverse phase HPLC separation
      is used, wherein the column is for example C18 bonded silica gel
      and the mobile phase is water-methanol or water-acetonitrile. In
      each case, solvent programming is used. <br>
      <br>
      [0067] In other embodiments, anhydrous Na.sub.2SO.sub.4 or another
      suitable drying or dehydration agent known in the art is used in
      place of the MgSO.sub.4. <br>
      <br>
      [0068] In other embodiments, another alkali metal hydrogen
      carbonate or carbonate of an alkali metal is used instead of
      NaHCO.sub.3. <br>
      <br>
      [0069] In other embodiments, BF.sub.3Et.sub.2O is dissolved in
      ethyl acetate, ethanol, hexane or other suitable organic solvent.
      <br>
      <br>
      [0070] In other embodiments, the catalyst is hydrochloric acid in
      ethanol or sulfuric acid in cyclohexane (reaction mixture refluxed
      rather than stirred). <br>
      <br>
      [0071] While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been
      described above, it will be recognized and understood that various
      modifications may be made therein, and the appended claims are
      intended to cover all such modifications which may fall within the
