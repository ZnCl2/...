      <p>The fiber of Cannabis, the "True Hemp", is tightly woven into
        the tapestry of human life. Since earliest times, this great
        plant ally has provided people with cordage, cloth, paper,
        medicine, and inspiration. For all the many benefits it bestows,
        Cannabis hemp is a friendship well worth cultivating. Hemp is
        many things to many people, and it is known by hundreds of
        names. Poets sing its praises, and preachers damn it.
        Executioners hang condemned men with hemp rope, but sailors and
        mountaineers hang onto it for dear life. Doctors prescribe it as
        a medicine, yet prohibitionists proscribe it as a poison. Armies
        and navies make war with hemp, while lovers use it as an
        aphrodisiac. The resinous virtue generates real happiness,
        enlightenment and entertainment, equal in quality and worth to
        the similar joys of love, freedom, and good health --- and it
        complements them all, and it comforts those poor souls who are
        without such blessings. Hemp is a most interesting and
        paradoxical plant, one that defies control and begs
        understanding. Hemp is one of mankind's best (and few) friends
        on Earth, yet it is a prisoner within its own cells, bound in a
        Gordian Knot of laws. Yet again, hemp is Ariadne's Thread, a
        guideline out of the labyrinth of bureaucratic tyranny and into
        a new state of liberty and grace. James Allen expressed the
        sentiment most passionately in the closing words of <i>The
          Reign ofLaw</i> (1900): </p>
      <p>"O Mystery immortal! which is in the hemp and in our souls, in
        its bloom and in our passions, by which our poor brief lives are
        led upward out of the earth for a season, then cut down, rotted,
        and broken --- for Thy long service!" <b>(1)</b> </p>

      <p>Cannabis has been used in medicine since about 2300 B.C., when
        the legendary Chinese Emperor Shen-Nung prescribed <i>chu-ma</i>
        (female hemp) for the treatment of constipation, gout,
        beri-beri, malaria, rheumatism, and menstrual problems. He
        classified <i>chu-ma</i> as one of the Superior Elixirs of
        Immortality. <b>(2)</b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>Ayurvedic physicians regularly use <i>bhang</i> to treat
        dozens of diseases and other medical problems including
        diarrhea, epilepsy, delirium and insanity, colic, rheumatism,
        gastritis, anorexia, consumption, fistula, nausea, fever,
        jaundice, bronchitis, leprosy, spleen disorders, diabetes, cold,
        anemia, menstrual pain, tuberculosis, elephantiasis, asthma,
        gout, constipation, and malaria. Other folk medicine
        applications of cannabis include its use as a stimulant,
        sedative, analgesic and antispasmodic, to induce sleep, as a
        diuretic, and against hydrophobia, blood in the urine,
        arthritis, rheumatism, hay fever, asthma, skin diseases, and
        stomach disorders, and to treat hemorrhoids and burns. <b>(3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis has been widely used in Asia to treat the diseases of
        animals. It is commonly fed to elephants and oxen to relieve
        their fatigue and give them greater endurance and strength. Wild
        hemp leaves are burned in heaps to disinfect stables and barns,
        and to treat respiratory problems. A bolus of hemp flowers,
        sugar and grain is fed to livestock to treat colic,
        constipation, diarrhea, worms, and rinderpest (a form of
        diptheria). The leaves are fed to cattle before they mate, and
        to increase lactation. </p>
      <p>In the second half of the 19th century, after Dr. William
        O'Shaughnessy reported from India on the medical uses of
        cannabis, it became an official member of the pharmaceutical
        repetoire in Europe and America. Cannabis was commonly used as a
        specific to alleviate the symptoms of tetanus, typhus, and
        hydrophobia. It was employed with varying degrees of success in
        the treatment of alcoholism, asthma, bronchitis, constipation,
        dropsy, dysentery, dysmenorrhea and uterine haemorrhage,
        epilepsy, insanity, migraine, palsy, rheumatism, anthrax, blood
        poisoning, incontinence, leprosy, malaria, snakebite,
        tonsilitis, parasites, and a legion of other maladies.<b> (4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dozens of medical uses have been demonstrated for the major
        cannabinoids (THC, CBN, and CBD) and other unique chemicals in
        Cannabis. The cannabinoids find therapeutic applications in
        cases of glaucoma, asthma, alcoholism, opiate addiction,
        insomnia, herpes, migraines, and ulcers. Cannabis is used as a
        diuretic, an anti-asthmatic, anti-convulsant, anti-inflamatory
        and anti-tumor agent, anti-biotic, anti-emetic, anti-depressant,
        and it has applications as an analgesic, anesthetic, and in
        gynecology.<b> (5-10)</b> </p>
      <p>The public health effects of cannabis consumption, particularly
        as relates to crime and insanity, have been examined repeatedly
        by several official panels, beginning with the Indian Hemp Drugs
        Commission in 1893. None of the studies have found reason to
        proscribe cannabis, and a few have recommended its legalization:
        The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission <b>(11-13)</b>; The Canal Zone
        Studies <b>(14, 15)</b>; The LaGuardia Committee Report <b>(16)</b>;
        The Wooton Report <b>(17, 18)</b>; The Schafer Commission <b>(19)</b>;
        The Jamaica Study <b>(20-22)</b>; The Costa Rica Study <b>(23-26)</b>;
        The Greek Study <b>(27-29)</b>; The Coptic Study <b>(30)</b>;
        The Expert Group <b>(31)</b>; and The Relman Committee. <b>(32)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis is non-toxic. No deaths from an overdose of cannabis
        have ever been verified. A few poorly documented reports have
        given cannabis as the cause of death, but closer examination has
        shown the accusations to be untenable. It has been estimated
        that it would be necessary to smoke about 800 marijuana
        cigarettes to kill a human; even then one would probably receive
        a lethal dose of carbon monoxide first. In comparison, only 60
        mg of nicotine or 300 ml of alcohol can kill a person. The LD50
        for THC in animals is between 20-40 mg/kg/iv, or 800-1,400 mg/kg
        orally. <b>(33)</b> </p>
      <p>Driving performance is impaired by marijuana. Judgment,
        concentration, and car- handling skills are affected, and the
        influence may persist for a full day afterwards.<b>(34)</b> </p>
      <p>Marijuana has been a complicating factor in the emergency
        treatment of diabetes. Plasma glucose and insulin levels
        increase after its use. Marijuana should not be used by children
        or pubescent youths, by pregnant or nursing women, by people
        with chronic heart, lung, or liver disease, or by diabetics,
        epileptics, or psychotics. Do not use cannabis with penicillin
        drugs. </p>
      <p>The dust inhaled by soft hemp workers (hacklers and scutchers)
        can cause byssinosis or cannabosis, and otherwise causes more
        chronic lung disease and lower forced expiratory volume (FEV)
        than controls of the same age. A study of 100 Spanish hemp
        hacklers showed the average age of death to be 39.6 years,
        compared to regular farm workers whose average lifespan was 67.6
        years. <b>(35)</b> </p>

      <p><a name="HH13"></a><b>1.3 ~ Hemp in America</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis hemp probably evolved in northern China. It was the
        first fiber plant to be cultivated there at the dawn of human
        society. Cotton from India and Mediterranean flax were not
        introduced until thousands of years later. An abundance of
        archaeological evidence proves the continuous cultivation of
        hemp from prehistoric times, beginning with a 12,000 year old
        Neolithic site at Yuan-shan in Taiwan. <b>(36, 37)</b> </p>
      <p>After a long and illustrious career in Asia, Europe and
        elsewhere, cannabis hemp officially arrived in North America.
        Cannabis had already arrived in prehistoric times, perhaps borne
        by Chinese explorers, birds or storms. The Vikings and other
        ancient seafarers also brought seeds of hemp and other
        vegetables, to be planted in the event of shipwreck. The
        prehistoric Mound-Builders also utilized cannabis. <b>(38, 39)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hemp was so important to the colonists that it was deemed
        mandatory to cultivate the crop. For many years, taxes could be
        paid with clean hemp fiber, and it was a strategic war crop
        during the Revolution. George Washington farmed hemp, and he
        mentioned the plant several times in his writings. In letters to
        his foreman, Washington urged him to "Make the most of the
        hempseed", and "Plant hemp everywhere." Thomas Jefferson also
        grew hemp, and he kept a record of his enterprises and thoughts
        on the subject in his account books, <i>Notes on Tobacco</i>,
        and other writings.<b>(40-44)</b> </p>
      <p>The Civil War later ruined the hemp industry that had developed
        by then. A brief resurgence of hemp cultivation occurred in the
        1870s and 80s, when it was widely grown, especially in Illinois,
        Nebraska, and California. The increasing use of wire cables on
        ships, and the introduction of steamships and metal hulls,
        greatly reduced the demand for hemp rope, sails, and caulking.
        By the turn of the century, the market for hemp was limited to
        cordage, twine and thread. <b>(45, 46)</b> </p>
      <p>Hundreds of hemp-processing machines have been patented since
        Thomas Jefferson recorded his improvements on the mechanized
        hemp-break. Only the design perfected by George W. Schlichten
        worked with the high efficiency required to meet the demands of
        the market. The Schlichten Decorticator promised to
        revolutionize the industry by completely eliminating the need to
        "ret" (rot) hemp. </p>
      <p>It was explained thus to the American public in <i>Popular
          Mechanics Magazine</i> (February 1938), wherein hemp was
        declared to be "The New Billion Dollar Crop": </p>
      <p>"American farmers are promised a new cash crop with an annual
        value of several hundred million dollars, all because a machine
        has been invented which solves a problem more than 6,000 years
        old. It is hemp, a crop which will not compete with other
        American products. Instead, it will displace imports of raw
        material and manufactured products produced by underpaid coolie
        and peasant labor and it will provide thousands of jobs for
        American workers throughout the land. </p>
      <p>"The machine which makes this possible is designed for removing
        the fiber-bearing cortex from the rest of the stalk, making hemp
        fiber available for use without a prohibitive amount of human
        labor. </p>
      <p>"Under old methods, hemp was cut and allowed to lie in the
        fields for weeks until it "retted" enough so the fibers could be
        pulled off by hand. Retting is simply rotting as a result of
        dew, rain and bacterial action. Machines were developed to
        separate the fibers mechanically after retting was complete, but
        the cost was high, the loss of fiber great, and the quality of
        fiber comparatively low. With the new machine, known as a
        decorticator, hemp is cut with a slightly modified grain binder.
        It is delivered to the machine where an automatic chain conveyer
        feeds it to the breaking arms at the rate of two or three tons
        per hour. The hurds are broken into fine pieces that drop into
        the hopper, from where they are delivered by blower to a baler
        or to a truck or freight car for loose shipment. The fiber comes
        from the other end of the machine, ready for baling. </p>
      <p>"From this point on almost anything can happen. The raw fiber
        can be used to produce strong twine or rope, woven into burlap,
        used for carpet warp or linoleum backing or it may be bleached
        and refined, with resinous by-products of high commercial value.
        It can, in fact, be used to replace the foreign fibers which now
        flood our markets... The natural materials in hemp make it an
        economical source of pulp for any grade of paper manufactured,
        and the high percentage of alpha-cellulose promises an unlimited
        supply of raw material for the thousands of cellulose products
        our chemists have developed. </p>
      <p>"It is generally believed that all linen is produced from flax.
        Actually, the majority comes from hemp --- authorities estimate
        that more than half of our imported linen fabrics are
        manufactured from hemp fiber. Another misconception is that
        burlap is made from hemp. Actually, its source is usually jute,
        and practically all of the burlap we use is woven by laborers in
        India who receive only four cents a day. Binder twine is usually
        made from sisal which comes from Yucatan and East Africa. </p>
      <p>"All of these products, now imported, can be produced from
        home-grown hemp. Fish nets, bow strings, canvas, strong rope,
        overalls, damask tablecloths, fine linen garments, towels, bed
        linen and thousands of other everyday items can be grown on
        American farms... The paper industry offers even greater
        possibilities... Hemp will produce every grade of paper, and
        government figures estimate that 10,000 acres devoted to hemp
        will produce as much paper as 40,000 acres of average pulpland.
      </p>
      <p>"One obstacle in the onward march of hemp is the reluctance of
        farmers to try new crops. The problem is complicated by the need
        for proper equipment a reasonable distance from the farm. The
        machine cannot be operated profitably unless there is enough
        acreage within driving range and farmers cannot find a
        profitable market unless there is machinery to handle the
        crop... This new crop can add immeasurably to American
        agriculture and industry."<b>(47)</b> </p>
      <p>An article by George A. Lower in <i>Mechanical Engineering
          Magazine</i> (26 February 1937), also heralded hemp as "the
        most profitable and desireable crop that can be grown". Because
        of publishing schedules, however, the articles had been written
        several months before the passage of the infamous Marijuana Tax
        Act of 1937 effectively destroyed the hemp industry, so the
        promise was not fulfilled. <b>(48, 49)</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp enjoyed a brief comeback as a vital war crop during World
        War Two after the Japanese invaded the Philippines and cut off
        America's supply of abaca. The Nazi invasion of Europe also
        eliminated that source of hemp. The federal government therefore
        sponsored a crash program to produce enough hemp fiber to meet
        America's needs. Farmers received the booklet <i>Hemp: A War
          Crop</i> (1942), which brought them up to date: </p>
      <p>"In normal times rope and twine made from Manila fibers (abaca)
        imported from the Philippines constituted a large portion of the
        supply... Hemp imported from Italy, Russia, France, and Holland,
        together with a small amount grown in Wisconsin and Kentucky,
        was used for medium grade wrapping twine and rope. Because we do
        not have climatic conditions conducive to the growing of Manila
        or jute, it is necessary to increase greatly the production of
        hemp. Thousands of acres in the Midwest will be planted and new
        factories built to handle the crop." <b>(50)</b> </p>
      <p>Thanks to the perseverance of hemp activist and author Jack
        Herer and associates, the unique USDA film <i>Hemp For Victory!</i>
        (1942) was rescued from oblivion and represented on video in
        modern times. The inspiring instructional film was shown to
        groups of farmers across the land, from sea to bounding sea. The
        narrator said: </p>
      <p>"But now, with Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in
        the hands of the Japanese, and shipment from India curtailed,
        American hemp must meet the needs of our Army and Navy as well
        as of our industry. In 1942, patriotic farmers at the
        government's request planted 36,000 acres of seed hemp, an
        increase of several thousand percent. The goal of 1943 is 50,000
        acres of hemp seed... Plans are afoot for a great expansion of a
        hemp industry as a part of the war program. This film is
        designed to tell farmers how to handle this ancient crop now
        little known outside Kentucky and Wisconsin..." <b>(51)</b> </p>
      <p>Hempseed was supplied to some 20,000 contracted farmers, with
        further instructions for cultivation from the federally-financed
        War Hemp Industries, Inc. 42 processing mills were built and
        equipped at a cost of $360,000 each by the Defense Plant
        Corporation. </p>
      <p>In 1943, the Commodity Credit Corporation contracted for
        168,000 acres of hemp straw, and paid $30 to $50 a ton. In
        January 1944, the CCC scaled down abruptly to only 60,000 acres.
        Nor did the CCC contract for any hempseed. The CCC had garnered
        some 500,000 bushels of hempseed in 1943, and the War Production
        Board was confident that Italy could provide for America's
        needs. The surplus hempseed was fed to canaries, who sang its
        praises. The farmers were left holding the bags.<b>(52)</b> </p>
      <p>Since then, the cultivation of cannabis has been severely
        suppressed in the USA. Fortunately, hemp still is welcome at
        home in China, which is the world's biggest supplier of the
        vital fiber and seed. Cultivars have been developed that produce
        less than the legal limit of 0.3% THC, thus enabling the
        development of a fiber market without diversions for drug use.
        The crop also is cultivated for its fiber in France, England,
        Canada, Russia, Romania, Hungary, and some two dozen other
        countries. Over 300,000 hectares of hemp are being planted each
        year. The French strains Fedora, Felina, Ferimon, Fibrimon, and
        Futura are the only registered low-THC hemp cultivars that are
        eligible for farm subsidies from the EU. <b>(53)</b> </p>
      <p>Britain lifted the ban on industrial hemp cultivation in
        February 1993 "to allow UK farmers to gain a share of the market
        currently occupied by our EC partners." A coalition of farmers
        calling themselves Hemcore, Ltd. (Felsted, Essex), immediately
        and successfully grew 600 hectares (1,500 acres) of hemp in East
        Anglia. They have grown over 2,000 hectares since then. The
        primary local use of the fiber is for livestock bedding, because
        the shives are extremely absorbent and they compost easily. Any
        surplus has a ready market. </p>
      <p>In Spring, 1994, Canadian farmers began to plant hemp for fiber
        for the first time since 1937. Alexander Sumach of the Hemp
        Futures Study Group congratulated the nation in the <i>Globe
          and Mail</i>: </p>
      <p>"We are delighted to learn of the rebirth of the Canadian Hemp
        Industry. Farmer Joe Stroebel and engineer Geof Kime planted 20
        hectares... with plump, innocent government-approved hempseed
        from the finest European pedigree... It arrived not a minute too
        soon. </p>
      <p>"The real treat is that Canadians actually beat Americans to
        this great prize. As the [NAFTA] pretty well wiped out the last
        of a once-thriving Canadian textile industry, we should be glad
        that hemp is being planted... There is nothing in NAFTA or
        [GATT] about hemp. There is nothing to stop a great industry
        from taking off from Canadian soil... The Americans will never
        get it together within the decade to grow hemp. Their laws will
        never admit that cannabis has any redeeming quality..." <b>(54)</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 1999, Canadian farmers grew 18,000 acres of hemp --- a
        manyfold increase over the 600 acres grown only a year before.
        Some 750 farmers applied for permits to grow the crop.In April,
        1999, North Dakota became the frst state to legalize the
        cultivation of hemp when Gov. Ed Schafer signed House Bill 1428;
        the House and Senate had approved the measure with an
        overwhelming majority vote. Hawaii followed suit soon after,
        then Minnesota. </p>

      <p><a name="HH14"></a><b>1.4 ~ Hemp Cloth</b> </p>
      <p>The oldest known samples of cloth, found in China and in Asia
        Minor, were made of hemp. Throughout history, the masses of
        Chinese people have worn hempen clothes. The earliest
        archaeological discovery of hemp cloth and rope in Europe,
        dating to the pre-Roman period (600-400 BC), was found near
        Stuttgart, Germany. More recently, the original Levi Strauss
        "jeans" were made of hemp cloth imported from the French city of
        Nimes, from which is derived the word "denim" ("of Nimes"). </p>
      <p>Even Harry Anslinger, the reprobate director of the Federal
        Bureau of Narcotics, acknowledged the excellence of hemp fiber
        in one of his speeches: </p>
      <p>"Now, this hemp is the finest fiber known to mankind. My God,
        if you ever have a shirt made out of it, your grandchildren
        would never see it wear out. You take Polish families. We used
        to see marijuana in the yards of Polish families. We'd go in and
        start to tear it up and the man came out with his shotgun,
        yelling: "These are my clothes for next winter!" </p>
      <p>Hemp fiber is half as strong as silk, one-third stronger than
        flax, and three times stronger than cotton. Hemp cloth wrinkles
        less than linen, irons easily, and it can withstand higher
        temperatures than linen. Hemp cloth is attractive in appearance
        and drape, and it washes well. Hemp cloth shrinks 7-9% with the
        first washing, and it stretches only slightly thereafter. Its
        fineness (85 tex) is lower than flax (32 tex), but extremely
        fine hemp yarn (33 tex) is produced in China. </p>
      <p>The industrial value of the plant is determined by the
        proportion of the primary and secondary fractions of bast fiber,
        and by the length and diameter of the xylem fiber. The quality
        of fiber is determined by the cultivar, weather and other growth
        conditions, harvesting methods, and the particular process used
        for fiber extraction. </p>
      <p>The relatively high levels of lignin, calcium, and magnesium in
        hemp make it difficult to dye and finish by conventional
        methods. The particular qualities of fabric, such as
        anti-shrinking, anti-pilling, crease recovery, and soft
        handling, are produced by pretreatments with toxic chemicals.
        Fortunately, the innovative VUTZ/INOTEX process, developed by
        the Czeck Textile Finishing Research Institute, meets all
        criteria for the eco-labeling of hemp fiber. </p>
      <p>The ultrasonic process developed by ECCO Gleittechnic Gmbh
        produces such fine fiber that many new applications now are
        possible. In addition, a steam explosion method of preparing
        high-purity hemp fibers has been optimized by the Dutch
        Institute for Applied Research. </p>
      <p>Since 1995, several large fashion design houses have introduced
        new hemp products. For example, Adidas offers hempen sneakers
        for skateboarders, and Converse and Vans are manufacturing hemp
        sneakers. Calvin Klein offers hemp bed spreads. Hemp textiles
        are now used in all manner of apparel, from baby diapers to work
        clothes, socks and shoes, and high fashion creations. The
        industrial textile applications include rope, twine, nets,
        canvas, tarpaulins, and geotextiles. </p>

      <p><a name="HH15"></a><b>1.5 ~ Hemp Paper</b> </p>
      <p>The invention of vegetable fiber paper emerged in China during
        the Han Dynasty when people became frustrated with the bulk and
        weight of wooden and bamboo tablets and the expensive rarity of
        <i>zhi </i>(silk
        proto-paper).
        The dynastic history <i>Hou-Han Shu</i> attributes the
        invention of paper in 205 A.D. to Marquis Cai Lun, who was
        Prefect of the masters of techniques during the reign of Emperor
        He Di. Archaeologists, however, have recovered older specimens
        of hemp paper from the Western and Eastern Han periods in
        Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi. Apparently, Cai Lun
        actually supervised the art of papermaking by craftsmen,
        although he also worked to promote its use in the imperial
        bureaucracy. </p>
      <p>Perhaps the oldest specimens of paper extant, dating more than
        a century earlier than Cai Lun, were discovered in a tomb near
        Xian in Shensi province. The pieces were found under three
        bronze mirrors which were wrapped in hemp cloth. The date of the
        tomb is no later than the reign of Wu Di of the Western Han
        Dynasty (140-87 BC). </p>
      <p>In 1916, the USDA published <i>Bulletin</i> # 404: "Hemp Hurds
        As Paper-Making Material" by Lyster Dewey and Jason Merrill. It
        was printed on hemp paper that they produced: </p>
      <p>"Experienced paper makers commented very favorably on the
        running of this furnish and the quality of the paper produced...
      </p>
      <p>"In regard to furnish, there is such a diversity of practice
        that it is difficult to make a comparison, but if the hurd stock
        can be produced as cheaply as soda-poplar stock, the furnish
        used in these... tests should be regarded as satisfactory to the
        book and printing paper industries... </p>
      <p>"Calculations on the raw material and acreage for a permanent
        supply for a pulp mill producing 25 tons of fiber a day for 300
        days per annum, or 7,500 tons per annum, give the comparison
        between hurds and wood: </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>[Table 1.1]</b> <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Comparison of Wood and Hemp Hurds</b> </p>
        <p><img src="11tblhmp.gif" height="135" width="429"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>The most important point derived from this calculation is in
          regard to areas required for a sustained supply, which are in
          the ratio of 4 to 1. Every tract of 10,000 acres which is
          devoted to hemp raising year by year is equivalent to a
          sustained pulp-producing capacity of 40,500 acres of average
          pulp-wood lands. In other words, in order to secure additional
          raw material for the production of 25 tons of fiber per day
          there exists the possibility of utilizing the agricultural
          waste already produced on 10,000 acres of hemp lands instead
          of securing, holding, reforesting, and protecting 40,500 acres
          of pulp-wood land...</b> <br>
        There appears to be little doubt that under the present system
        of forest use and consumption the present supply cannot
        withstand the demands placed upon it. By the time improved
        methods of forestry have established an equilibrium between
        production and consumption, the price ofwood pulp may be such
        that a knowledge of other available raw materials may be
        imperative... </p>
      <p>Semi-commercial paper-making tests were conducted... on hemp
        hurds, in cooperation with a paper manufacturer.... Paper was
        produced which received very favorable comment both from
        investigators and from the trade and which according to official
        tests would be classed as a No. 1 machine-finish printing paper.
        <b>(55)</b> </p>
      <p>In the "Digest of Conversation of Mr. G.W. Schlichten with Mr.
        M.A. McRae..." (3 August 1917), Schlichten (inventor of the
        decorticator) said: </p>
      <p>"The time will come when wood cannot be used for paper any
        more. It will be too expensive or forbidden... Now I tell you,
        that with the production of an annual, with my by-product, every
        acre that I produce in hemp... will preserve 5 acres of
        forest... </p>
      <p>"You see, it takes 12 years before you have an acre grown into
        spruce; in 12 months I have a harvest of 50 tons produced... But
        as far as paper is concerned, it is actually a crime to chop
        down trees to get a small percentage of paper... </p>
      <p>"Another thing is, at the present time you have to locate your
        mill near... the supply in the out of the way country. There are
        long hauls, and then your paper in the roll is shipped from
        there; now here we only need the digester right on the land
        where the hemp is produced... </p>
      <p>"Wood must have the bark, knots, &amp;c, removed. It must then
        be cut into small chips, and sieved. Then it is ready for the
        digester. The preparing of the wood for the digester is a
        considerable part of the total paper making cost. The hurds are
        ready for the digester when, as a by-product, they leave the
        Schlichten machine..." <b>(56)</b> </p>
      <p>Several small hemp paper companies have been established in the
        USA and Canada in the 1990s, i.e.: Tree-Free EcoPaper, Ecosource
        Paper Co., Living Tree Paper Co., Green Man Paper Mill, and
        Earth Pulp &amp; Paper.Their products are free of chlorine, acid
        and ink, and contain no wood. As shown by the archaeological and
        historical record, hemp paper can last for 2,000 years. Acidic
        wood-pulp paper must be neutralized to improve its shelf-life to
        a maximum of about 100 years. Recycled paper does little to
        benefit the environment, except to spare trees (temporarily):
        100 tons of recycled paper generates about 40 tons of toxic
        sludge. </p>
      <p>In the 1990s, only two dozen paper mills, mostly in China and
        India, with a few in Europe, use hemp as a fiber source. The
        estimated volume of world production of hemp paper is about
        120,000 tons/year, increasing annually. By comparison, a typical
        single wood pulp mill produces at least 250,000 tons/year. Most
        hemp fiber pulp is used for cigarette papers, filter papers, tea
        bags, art papers, and paper money. </p>

      <p><a name="HH16"></a><b>1.6 ~ Other Hemp Products</b> </p>
      <p>After more than 60 years of suppression by the USA and other
        governments since 1937, the hemp industry is enjoying a
        renaissance in the 1990s. A study conducted in 1999 by six
        researchers at North Dakota University showed that imports of
        industrial hemp have increased 215% since 1995, when it was
        first available in the USA. Sales of hemp were $5M worldwide in
        1993, increasing to $75M in 1995. Hemptech has estimated that
        sales will exceed $600M by 2001. </p>
      <p>The growth and establishment of cannabis among the world's
        major fiber crops demands a detailed understanding of the
        parameters and conditions and techniques for its optimal
        cultivation and processing. Increased coordination is required
        amongst breeders, universities, industries, merchants,
        financiers, and governments. Integrated management of the
        industry will shorten the chain of value-adding middlemen
        between the farms and markets. </p>
      <p>The industrial development of hemp products depends on a
        guaranteed supply of standard quality raw fiber. The market
        needs governmental subsidization, private investment, certified
        quality control, database management of all parameters of the
        industry (seed, fertilizer, equipment, labor, transportation,
        storage, fiber processing, and the economics --- costs,
        investments, subsidies, and market prices). A logistics support
        system is required to integrate, optimize, stabilize and control
        the industry from the farm to the end product. The novel fiber
        products must be introduced and promoted in new markets. Public
        education about the benefits of cannabis hemp also is
        imperative. </p>
      <p>The International Hemp Association (IHA) was created in 1992 to
        facilitate the communication of factual information about
        cannabis and to promote the use of hemp-based products. </p>
      <p>The Hemp Industries Association (HIA), founded in 1994, agreed
        that finished goods must contain 55% hemp to qualify as True
        Hemp products. Food, cosmetics, and medical products must
        contain at least 10% hemp seed or oil to meet HIA Certification
        Standards. Paper products should contain at least 10% hemp fiber
        to qualify as hemp paper. </p>
      <p>Modern research has developed several excellent new hemp
        products in addition to the traditional uses of hemp for cloth,
        rope and paper. One of the most promising new products, called
        Isochanvre (iso-hemp), is a petrified form of hemp hurds mixed
        with lime and water. The resulting material is fireproof and
        waterproof. Isochanvre improves over time, and it will last for
        centuries. In evidence of this, a bridge dating from the
        Merovingian period (500-751 AD) was found in southern France,
        built with hemp fiber in a manner similar to Isochanvre. This
        unique product supports French agriculture, preserves forests,
        uses no synthetic chemicals, produces no pollution or waste, and
        it is easy to manufacture and use. Isochanvre is 5 to 7 times
        lighter than concrete, has high strength and flexibility, does
        not crack, and requires no maintenance. In fact, it continues to
        petrify, and it becomes stronger as it mineralizes. Isochanvre
        also breathes, thus preventing thecondensation of moisture in
        buildings, and it is self-draining. It is not eaten by termites
        or rodents, does not rot, and it has fungicidal and
        anti-bacterial properties. It does not require painting or other
        finishes. The high thermal inertia of Isochanvre makes it a
        superior insulating material. Attics insulated with Isochanvre
        maintain summer temperatures about 30<sup>o</sup> cooler than
        conventional insulation. </p>
      <p>The French company La Chanvriere also produces Canosmose,
        Canobiote, and Mehabit hemp hurd building materials, plus
        Aubiose horse bedding and Biochat cat litter, which absorbs 250%
        of its weight. </p>
      <p>The German company ECCO Gleittechnic Gmbh has developed
        Iso-Hanf, which is hemp fleece impregnated with sodium silicate
        and borate for fire resistance. The use of Iso-Hanf to reinforce
        concrete increases the flexibility by 30%. The drying
        characteristics and strength of mortar also is improved by
        Iso-Hanf. The viscosity of paint and its resistance to
        detergents is increased by Iso-Hanf, and the number of
        micro-fissures is reduced. ECCO also produces the Setralit
        product line including several automotive applications for hemp
        fiber, such as seat covers, brake lining, and insulation. </p>
      <p>As early as 1929, the Ford Motor Company investigated the
        possibility of using hemp in cars. Officials were sent to visit
        the successful hemp farm of Albert Fraleigh in Alberta, Canada
        before cultivating a 200-acre crop. In 1941, after 12 years of
        research, Henry Ford proudly displayed the first automobile
        "grown from the soil" with a plastic body made from 70% wheat
        straw, hemp and sisal with 30% resin binder. The plastic
        reportedly could withstand a blow 10 times better than steel
        without bending. The only steel in the car was its welded
        tubular frame. </p>
      <p>Estimates range as high as 50,000 for the number of products
        that could be made from hemp fiber and its component cellulose.
        The cannabinoid group of biochemicals offers hundreds of medical
        products. Furthermore, hemp can serve well as a biomass fuel.
        The present and potential industrial uses of hemp are limited
        only by the suppression imposed by the USA and the United
        Nations. The market also is hindered by the lack of a domestic
        supply and by shortages on the international market. Despite the
        relentless recidivistic obstruction imposed by the degenerate
        federal regime, a hemp products industry based on imports has
        begun to develop inthe USA. </p>
      <p>C&amp;S Specialty Builder's Supply (Harrisburg, OR) produces a
        superlative composite fiber-board from hemp. The medium-density
        fiber (MDF) composite boards (CB) are 250% stronger than wood
        MDF-CB, and 300% more elastic.David Seber and William Conde, the
        company's founders, have stated: </p>
      <p>"The composite board industry is one of the fastest growing
        segments of the wood products industry in the United States,
        with annual sales of over one billion dollars, and one whose
        primary raw material is becoming scarce... During the past 20
        years we have seen the misuse and mismanagement of our native
        forests on such a widespread basis that it has caused an
        industry-wide crisis in the lack of raw materials (namely wood)
        that now is destroying this industry... We now believe that wood
        will become a rare commodity that should be used only where it
        can be directly seen or touched, and an alternative product must
        be developed for all other construction type products currently
        made from wood. After a lengthy and detailed survey of the plant
        kingdom and an extensive historical search of the uses of plants
        in civilization, we at C&amp;S have come to the conclusion that
        the absolute best alternative to wood in construction products
        is hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i>). In fact, as far as we can
        tell, hemp has the potential to be vastly superior to wood for
        everything from lumber to plywood to particle board or any other
        composite construction material... Hemp hurds have great
        potential to make glues for composite construction products..."<b>(57)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conservative estimates of novel industrial markets for
        cellulose fibers exceeds 100 kilotons/year --- several times
        more than is produced at present. Another 100 KT/yr could be
        used in reinforced concrete and composite materials, and in all
        types of cardboard, pulp, and paper products. Hemp fiber can be
        used in the production of Compression Molded Parts (CMP),
        caulking and stuffing, and in gaskets, brakes, and clutch
        linings for the transportation industry. The construction
        industry can consume all the hempen fiberboard and insulation
        that can be produced. The fiber also can serve to strengthen
        cement, stucco, bricks, plaster, mortar, and tarboard. Hemp
        fiber can substitute for many non-renewable (and toxic)
        materials such as asbestos. The strength and biodegradability of
        hemp fiber also makes it well-suited for use in geotextiles. </p>

      <p><a name="HH17"></a><b>1.7 ~ Hemp Biodiesel</b> </p>
      <p>Hemp yields about 0.4 tons of seed/acre, which yields about 300
        gallons of oil. The oil can be used alone or with methanol to
        serve as bio-diesel fuel, or it can be mixed with petro-diesel.
        Bio-diesel fuel produces full engine power with much lower
        emissions (and no sulfur) than does petro-diesel. The latter has
        a cetane rating (CR) of about 40. The CR of hempseed oil is 60
        to 100. Sunflower, safflower, and rapeseed yield only up to
        about 110 gallons oil/acre. </p>
      <p>Biodiesel is easily produced by reacting methanol with sodium
        hydroxide to produce sodium methoxide. Use 200 ml methanol and
        3.5 gr NaOH per liter of vegetable oil. The mixture is stirred
        for one hour, then left to settle for several hours. The
        products are biodiesel (upper layer) and glycerine soap. Filter
        the biodiesel (5 microns) before using it. Another method is
        even simpler: blend 10-40% kerosene with vegetable oil; 20%
        kerosene produces a reliable mixture throughout a wide range of
        ambient temperatures. Unadulterated or unreacted vegetable oil
        also can be used, but the engine must be started and cooled down
        using diesel or biodiesel. Therefore a two-tank system and
        switch valve is required. Go to www.veggievan.org for more
        information. </p>
      <p>Hemp stalks can be converted to ethanol (with about 20%
        efficiency by fermentation of hydrolyzed cellulose), into
        methane (by digestion of the stalks, with 50% efficiency), into
        producer gas (by thermal gasification at 85% efficiency) and
        into methanol (by pyrolysis of the stalks, or from producer
        gas). It is estimated that hemp biomass can yield an equivalent
        of 1,300 gal/acre of vehicle fuel. Chopped stalks also can be
        used directly as a boiler fuel. </p>

        manifold. The use of hemp as a substitute for wood reduces the
        extent of deforestation. Hemp is easily biodegradable, so its
        disposal presents no problems of waste management. The plant
        requires relatively little fertilizer in comparison to other
        fiber crops, and it needs little or no treatment with
        pesticides. Hemp benefits the environment and the rural economy
        while providing a sustainable alternative source of fiber for
        paper, textiles, and other purposes. <b>(58)</b> </p>
      <p>America uses as much wood, by weight, as all metals, plastics,
        and cement combined. Much of what little is left of American
        lumber, including old growth, now goes to Japan. About 40% of
        the trees destroyed in America are used to make paper products,
        most of which are not recycled. Soon we will have no choice but
        to use hemp and to recycle as much as possible. David Seber and
        William Conde (founders of C&amp;S Builder's Supply,
        manufacturers of hemp fiberboard) have stated: </p>
      <p>"If we don't [grow hemp] there is a good chance that in 10
        years there will be no forests left on the temperate region of
        the Earth. I think it's the most important issue of our time.
        And it has to be done, because the over-riding issue about the
        forests is not about trees, and it's not even about wood; it's
        about fiber, and how our culture uses fiber... Not only do we
        have the solution to the forests, we have the only really viable
        concept of what sustainability is about... </p>
      <p>"The way to fix the forest is to use advanced composites from
        annual fibers like hemp. Anything you can make out of a tree you
        can make out of hemp. We can leave the forest alone and everyone
        can go back to work." </p>
      <p>In his comments <i>On the Decay of Rents</i> (1670), Sir
        William Coventry gave some sage advise that holds true today: </p>
      <p>"For the changing the use of our land two things occur to me
        most reasonable and most desirable. The one is to encourage the
        planting of wood and severely to punish... the destruction of
        it... The other is to encourage the sowing of hemp and flax,
        which, besides diverting the ground from corn and cattle, would
        employ all the poor that can be found." </p>

      <p><a name="HH19"></a><b>1.9 ~ Other Fiber Crops</b> </p>
      <p>Cannabis is the original and only "True Hemp". In the past
        century especially, several other fiber plants have assumed the
        generic name of "hemp". Manila hemp is abaca (<i>Musa textilis</i>)
        or wild plantain. Sisal hemp is henequen (<i>Agave fourcroydes L</i>.)
        or century plant (<i>Agave Americana</i>), grown in Central
        America. New Zealand flax (phormium, <i>P. tenax</i>) is called
        hemp; Mauritius hemp is furcraea (<i>F. gigantea</i>). Sunn hemp
        is crotolaria (<i>C. juncea</i>). Jute (<i>Corchorus capsularis
          L</i>.) also is known as Indian hemp, not to be confused with
        <i>Cannabis indica</i>, which used to be called Indian hemp, but
        no longer. A species of hibiscus hemp (<i>H. cannabinus</i>)
        grows in India. </p>
      <p>After decades of research, the USDA conveniently ignored the
        proven potential of cannabis hemp and declared kenaf to be the
        best fiber for paper-making. In the USA, however, kenaf can be
        cultivated in bulk only in the southern states of New Mexico,
        Texas, California, and Louisiana. The yield is low in cool
        climates. </p>
      <p>Flax grows well in temperate climates, but the yield per acre
        is less than half that of hemp. Flax exhausts the soil, which
        requires careful preparation for a good crop. It requires a
        relatively low mean temperature and rather cold soil with a very
        regular supply of water; flax does not tolerate drought. Flax
        has specific requirements for fertilization, and the crop must
        be rotated with others that specially condition the soil. Flax
        can be grown only once in 6 to 8 years in the same ground. It is
        sown late, and it grows and matures slowly. Flax is smothered by
        fast-growing weeds, and it is easily blown down. Flax is
        expensive to sow, cultivate, and harvest. </p>
      <p>Cotton is adapted to a wide range of uses, and it spins easily,
        but is not so strong and durable as hemp. Cotton also exhausts
        the soil. </p>
      <p>Ramie (China-grass, <i>Boehmeria</i>) yields only about
        one-fourth as much per acre, compared to hemp. Ramie is confined
        to tropical or semi-tropical climates; dry hot spells or cold
        snaps will kill the crop. </p>
      <p>Sisal and Manila hemp are not suitable for spinning fine
        fabrics, and cannot be grown in American climates. </p>
      <p>Jute produces a yield comparable with hemp, but it requires a
        warm, humid climate, rich loam soil, and lots of rain during the
        growing season. This would limit its cultivation in the USA to
        the southern states. Jute also exhausts the soil, and it
        contains less cellulose than hemp. Jute does not bleach easily,
        and the bleached fibers soon disintegrate. Jute is cheap and
        plentiful and easy to spin, but it is the weakest and least
        durable of the major textile fibers. </p>
      <p>Cannabis hemp grows well throughout most of the US, and it
        requires little fertilizer, insecticides, or attention. None of
        the competitive fiber plants can grow in so many climates as
        cannabis, and none of them compare well with hemp. </p>
      <p>S.S. Boyce, author of the treatise <i>Hemp </i>(1900),
        praised the superiority of hemp in no uncertain terms: </p>
      <p>"Hemp is the king of fiber-bearing plants --- the standard by
        which all other fibers are measured; while none but silk is of a
        finer character, and none other is so universally adapted to a
        wide soil and climatic conditions and the rude arts of the
        semi-barbarous husbandman, and the primitive methods and
        practices attending the preparation of its fiber; yet none is
        more amenable to the care of exact culture, nor better rewards
        the skill of fine-art methods of fiber-manipulation. No plant is
        more susceptible to the processes of producing a fine, white,
        soft and silky fiber, and there is not one to take its place in
        the wide and diversified area of its culture and manufacture...
      </p>
      <p>"No plant is more simple of cultivation and manipulation, none
        more susceptible to the care of the husbandman, none more
        capable of a widely diversified product, and none is more
        universally adapted to American soils and climatic conditions,
        or to supplying raw material of the nature and character
        required by manufacturers of cordage and fine linen fabrics." </p>

          name="HH110"></a><b>1.10 ~ Hempseed &amp; Nutrition</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Legend says
        that Gautama Buddha ate only one hempseed a day for six years
        while he waited for nirvana.Hempseed is eaten by many of India's
        poor people. A mixture called <i>bosa</i> consists of the seeds
        of Eleusine and hemp, and <i>mura</i> is made with parched
        wheat, amaranth or rice, and hempseed. The seeds are said to
        make all vegetables more palatable and complete foods. Sometimes
        it is an ingredient in chutney. <i>Bhang</i> and ripe hempseed
        also is used to flavor or strengthen the formulations of some
        alcohol beverages. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Hempseed has
        served as a primary famine food in China, Australia, and Europe
        as recently as World War Two. Medieval Christian monks ate
        hempseed gruel every day. Even in modern times, mothers of the
        Sotho tribe in South Africa are known to feed their babies with
        ground hempseed in pap. <b>(59)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Hempseed now
        is an ingredient in food products, including flour, cheese, ice
        cream, yogurt, pudding, milk, spreads, candy, and meat
        substitutes. Prices are kept high by the cost of shipping, steam
        sterilization, repackaging, domestic shipping, and old
        equipment. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Hempseed
        contains all the essential amino acids and fatty acids, and is
        considered to be a complete food. The seed or achene contains
        26-31% crude protein, 65% of which is globular edestin and
        albumin that is about 84% digestible. Lysine (the limiting
        protein in edestin) and other components are destroyed by the
        heat generated when hempseed is pressed for its oil. Addition of
        1% lysine hydrochloride will restore the nutritional balance of
        heat-treated edestin. The meal also contains about 6%
        carbohydrates, 5-10% fat, 12% crude fiber, 10% moisture, and 7%
        ash. <b>(60-62)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">T.B. Osborne
        studied hemp edestin and reported on its isolation and
        purification in 1892. Until the passage of the infamous
        Marihuana Tax Act in 1937, edestin was regarded as a standard
        example of the seed globulins (the third most abundant protein
        after collagen and albumin). They are vital to the maintenance
        of a healthy immune system.<b>(63, 64)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The globulin
        edestin in hempseed closely resembles that found in human blood
        plasma, and it is easily digested, absorbed, and utilized. Hemp
        edestin is so completely compatible with the human digestive
        system, that the Czechoslovakian Tubercular Nutrition Study
        (1955) found hempseed to be the only food that can successfully
        treat the consumptive disease tuberculosis, in which the
        nutritive processes are impaired. <b>(65)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">When hempseed
        is fed to poultry on a regular basis, the birds do not go "off
        feed", and they do not require hormones to fatten them. Egg
        production also is increased. Hempseed meal has an effect
        analogous to that of grit in chicken diets inasmuch as the
        gizzard linings are found to be free of corrugations and
        erosions. <b>(66-69)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">John Worlidge
        commented on this in his <i>Systema Agriculturae</i> (1675): </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Hemp seed is
        much commended for the feeding of poultry and other fowl, so
        that where plenty thereof may be had, and a good return for
        fowl, the use thereof must needs be advantageous." </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Curtis Weekes,
        a crop specialist in Alberta, Canada, conducted silage trials
        with hemp and barley silage for two groups of heifer in 2000.
        The found that cattle liked both feeds, and their weight gains
        were equal. The cattle obviously preferred the hemp silage,
        because they licked the hemp feed bunk completely clean, but
        always left some barley silage uneaten. The hemp silage
        contained about 19% protein, and its acid detergent fiber (the
        indigestible part of the plant) was nearly 41%; the barley ADF
        was 28.2%. The hemp also contained more calcium and phosphorus.

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><a
          name="HH111"></a><b>1.11 ~ Hempseed Oil</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The oil of
        hempseed is used in paints, varnishes, inks and lubricants. When
        exposed to air, the fatty acids in hempseed oil form a hard film
        that makes it very useful in the manufacture of paints. The
        cellulose and other organic chemicals in cannabis can serve as
        feedstock for the manufacture of plastics and other synthetic
        substances. The oil has excellent surfactant properties that are
        put to use in several new hygiene products such as soap,
        shampoo, cosmetics and balms. For example, SATIVA Gmbh (Germany)
        manufactures a detergent from hempseed oil and ruptured yeast;
        it removes stains with high efficiency, due to its very low
        surface tension. The detergent is used as an industrial cleaner
        for engines, and to clean petroleum-contaminated soil. It is
        completely bio-compatible and uses no phosphates, enzymes, or
        bleaches. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">30-35% of the
        weight of hempseed is oil containing 80% of the unsaturated
        essential fatty acids (EFA), LA (55%) and LNA (21-25%). These
        are not manufactured by the body, and must be supplied by food.
        The oil also contains about 8% by volume of palmitic, stearic,
        oleic and arachidic acids. The 80% EFAs in hempseed oil is the
        highest total percentage amongst the common plants used by man.
        Flax oil ranks second with 72% EFAs. The EFAs are very sensitive
        to heat, light and oxygen. For this reason, hempseed oil must be
        processed and stored carefully (in the cold, dark, and under
        vacuum) to preserve the potency of the EFAs. The EFA composition
        (% of total oil) of hempseed oil is: 18:3w3 (20%), 18:2w6 (60%),
        18:1w9 (12%), 18:0 (2%), and 16:0 (6%). </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">EFAs are
        precursors to the prostaglandin series (PGE 1,2, &amp; 3). PGE 1
        inhibits the production of cholesterol and dilates blood
        vessels, and it prevents the clotting of blood platelets in
        arteries. A. Kemmoku, <i>et al</i>., found that a diet of
        hempseed causes the serum levels of total cholesterol to drop
        dramatically. Blood pressure also decreases after several weeks
        of eating hempseed, thanks to the steady, adequate supply of
        EFAs.<b>(70-72)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the opinion
        of U. Erasmus, author of <i>Fats that Heal, Fats that Kill</i>,
        the proportions of LA and LNA in hempseed oil are perfectly
        balanced to meet human requirements for EFAs, including
        gamma-linoleic acid (GLA). Unlike flax oil and others, hempseed
        oil can be used continuously without developing a deficiency or
        other imbalance of EFAs. The peroxide value (PV, the degree of
        rancidity) of hempseed oil is only 0.1-0.5, which is very low
        and safe and does not spoil its taste. In comparison, the PV of
        virgin olive oil is about 20, and the PV of corn oil is about
        40-60. <b>(73-76)</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A series of
        studies conducted in 1997 by ARUP Laboratories (Salt Lake City)
        found that hempseed oil contains enough cannabinoids to produce
        a positive result with standard urine drug test procedures. The
        subject felt no psychoactive effects whatsoever. Samples
        continued to test positive for two days after the subject
        stopped ingesting the oil. This new development has thoroughly
        upset the drug-testing industry, which has suggested that
        hempseed oil be banned. The presence of cannabinoids in hempseed
        or oil is due to minute bits of inflorescence that are not
        removed when the seeds are cleaned. <b>(77)</b> </p>
