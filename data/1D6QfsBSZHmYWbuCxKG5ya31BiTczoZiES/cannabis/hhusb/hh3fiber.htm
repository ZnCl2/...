    <blockquote><b>3.1 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH31"></a>Retting</b>
      <p>Hemp bast fiber must be separated from the woody core by
        mechanical means (decortication) or by the process of "retting"
        (rotting). Natural retting is considered to be impractical for
        modern industrial purposes, but this low technology will always
        be appropriate somewhere, and never completely obsolete. </p>
      <p>When hemp begins to rot, dark flecks of fungal colonies appear
        on the bark, continuing until the surface turns to a steel-gray
        color. The most frequently occurring fungi belong to the genera
        <i>Alternaria</i>, <i>Hormodendrum</i>, <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Cephalosporium</i>,
        <i>Phoma</i>, and <i>Trichothecium roseum</i>, which decompose
        the pectin and polyuronide hemicellulose in the stalk. <i>Cephalosporium
        </i>attacks cellulose to a slightly greater extent than other
        fungi. <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> and <i>Clostridium
          felsineum</i> are dominant during retting. Enzyme sprays have
        been developed to facilitate the retting process in a controlled
        manner. <b>(1)</b> </p>
      <p>The ripples in hemp stalks cause the retting action to be
        irregular, beginning in the convex parts. The process starts
        earlier in females than in males, but pectin fermentation
        proceeds more rapidly in male plant. The difference, however, is
        balanced by the end of the process. </p>
      <p>Dew-retting (field-retting) is accomplished by spreading stalks
        on the ground to be exposed to rain and dew. Hemp that is to be
        field-retted should be cut as close to the ground as possible.
        If the stalks are laid out on tall stubble, they will dry out
        quickly when the wind blows under the swath. Retting requires
        about 30% moisture content. Field-drying will decrease the
        humidity to below 20% within a week, or sooner if the crop is
        harvested with a mower crusher. The stalks should be wetted with
        a sprinkler if necessary. The farmer's control of the process is
        otherwise largely limited to turning the hemp at least once to
        promote uniform retting. It must be picked up at the right time
        to prevent over-retting. Turning of the stalks is done with
        poles pushed under the stalks near the head end. The stalks are
        turned over without moving the butts. The work is begun in the
        middle of the field, the first swath being turned over into the
        empty space in the center, and so forth. </p>
      <p>If an early-maturing crop has been cultivated over 1000 feet
        above sea level, then altitude becomes an important
        consideration because the temperature may inhibit or prevent the
        processes of drying and retting. High altitudes tend to be
        sloped, and this too may cause problems. A high, sloped field
        must face south to allow stalks to dry sufficiently on the
        stubble. </p>
      <p>Conditions of temperature and moisture usually are most
        favorable early in the fall. As winter sets in, low temperature
        limits bacterial activity even though adequate moisture is
        present. Hemp can winter up to 4 months without suffering
        serious damage, but often it will be over-retted. Alternate
        freezing and thawing spells gives best results in winter
        field-retting. </p>
      <p>Retting at 20<sup>o</sup> C requires 7-8 days of retting. At 12<sup>o</sup>
        C, 15-17 days are required; at 7<sup>o</sup> C, 30-45 days are
        necessary. The shortest retting period is achieved in 3 days at
        37<sup>o</sup> C. Retting does not occur at all at 5<sup>o</sup>
        C (bacteria are inactivated) or 40<sup>o</sup> C (destruction).
      </p>
      <p>During the 1940s, Lyle Hessler (Kentucky Agric. Exp. Station)
        worked to develop improved methods of retting, summarized as
        follows: </p>
      <p>"Retted hemp fiber is composed of about 80% cellulose and
        lignin, while the remaining 20% or partially soluble fraction is
        made up of N compounds, pectic substances, pentosans, ash, and
        other extractable substances. Unretted hemp fiber consists of
        about 30% of the partially soluble fraction. By retting, part of
        it is removed in order to free the fiber. When the fiber is
        exposed to microbial action, it is weakened and, as a result,
        the breaking strength varies inversely with the length of the
        retting period. Exposure to the sun shortens the time of
        retting. Damage to hemp fiber during retting may occur to a
        greater extent when the fresh green plants are retted than if
        the plants are allowed to cure by shocking; further, the younger
        top part of the plant may readily result in weaker fiber. Winter
        retting compared with fall retting usually has been observed in
        practice, and substantiated by these experiments,&nbsp; to
        result in a better color but weaker fiber. This condition is
        probably due to the slower, longer retting period. The chemical
        composition of winter-retted fiber was lower in the more soluble
        fractions, which indicates more retting... </p>
      <p>"N fertilizers increase the growth of hemp and give greater
        yields of dew-retted hemp fiber, but at the same time the
        quality may be inferior because the fiber is coarser and
        weaker... The cellulose content of the fiber was significantly
        increased where the complete fertilizer was used, but during
        retting the more labile secondary constitutents tend to level
        off in concentration regardless of fertilizer treatment.
        Correlation coefficients show that encrusting material plays a
        part in increasing or decreasing strength of fiber. Fineness of
        fiber as measured by centimeters per gram gave a significant
        positive correlation coefficient of breaking strength.
        Correlation between fiber constituents and fineness was not
        significant. All encrustants showed a negative correlation with
        the primary fiber constituents, cellulose; lignin, protein, and
        ash gave highly significant correlation coefficients, while
        pentosans gave a significant <i>r</i>." <b>(2, 3)</b> </p>
      <p>Hessler also studied the removal of encrustants from dew-retted
        hemp fiber in order to find a more uniform basis for testing: </p>
      <p>"The formation of cellulose nitrate and the detection of degree
        of polymerization and percentage of N may be used as an index to
        encrustant removal and good fiber degradation and quality. NaOH
        and N<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> are good chemicals to use in
        removing encrustants. The former is more effective, but it
        causes some degradation of the cellulose chain. Increasing the
        concentration of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> over the 1% level
        did not give better removal of encrustants, although it caused
        some cellulose degradation. The lower boiling alcohols such as
        methyl, ethyl, butyl, isobutyl and amyl are not very effective
        in removing encrustants; but they do open up the fiber and allow
        other mild reagents to act more effectively. Of the two
        high-boiling alcohols (ethylene glycol and glycerol), ethylene
        glycol was better in the removal of encrustants and caused
        slightly less degradation of cellulose. The higher boiling
        alcohols have a tendency to make the fiber more subject to
        oxidation in bleaching. Increasing the boiling time over one
        hour did not greatly increase the removal of encrustants, but,
        especially in the case of glycerol, it did cause a lowering of
        the degree of polymerization. These tests indicate that
        degumming of bast fibers can be undertaken with a minimum of
        cellulose degradation and that encrustant removal to a common
        cellulose base will result in more uniform physical testing." <b>(4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The end-point of retting is determined by simple tests: </p>
      <p>1. Bend some dried stalks back and forth. The fibers should not
        break when the woody core breaks. The hurd fragments should fall
        free from the fibers when shaken. If retting is incomplete, some
        hurds will adhere to the loose fibers. To test the strength of
        fibers, break some strands. They should break with great
        difficulty and a snap; otherwise, the hemp has been over-retted.
      </p>
      <p>2. Peel the fiber near the base of the stem. If it peels
        easily, it is adequately retted. If retting has been
        insufficient, the fiber will break after only a few inches of
        peeling. </p>
      <p>3. Break several stems all at once in several adjacent areas.
        If the wood separates easily from the fiber, the retting is
        complete. </p>
      <p>4. The reduction in the total uronic content in the stalks
        indicates the progress of retting better than any other means.
        Well-retted hemp has a total uronic content of&nbsp; 5%,
        compared to 10% in unretted bark. Over-retted hemp contains less
        than 5% urones. </p>
      <p>The retted stalks may be picked up by hand and bundled on a
        sloped "buck" rack, but a pick-up binder is most efficient. It
        is important to keep the stalks well butted when bundling them.
        This minimizes problems with tangled stalks at the mill, and
        results in a higher yield with less waste. </p>
      <p>Retting pools must be designed to accommodate the expected
        yield of stalks. S.S. Boyce gave very detailed instructions for
        the various methods of retting in his excellent treatise <i>Hemp</i>
        (1900): </p>
      <p>For this [to accommodate 1-5 acres of harvest] a pool of a size
        to hold 2 to 10 or 12 tons of hemp will be required, although
        these pools are usually 4 or 5 feet deep, 10 to 12 feet long,
        and 5 to 8 feet wide. The sheaves of hemp are packed with the
        butts alternately one way and the other, until the pit is full,
        or all the hemp is used up. It is then weighted down by stones
        and the pit filled with water. The same water may be used over
        several times, until all the hemp is steeped. The method is
        wasteful, the steep-water not being utilized, while the stench
        ... is something unbearable. Nor is the product of much greater
        value than by the more primitive method of spreading the hemp on
        the ground. </p>
      <p>"The best results are obtained when hemp is grown upon a large
        scale and the hemp retted by being steeped in running water.
        Quite often the hemp is placed in crates holding a ton or more
        of stalks, and then weights of stones placed upon them to hold
        the hemp under water for 5 to 8 days, according to the
        temperature of the water. Part of the more modern practice is to
        dig pools 5 to 7 feet deep, which will hold 10 to 25 tons of
        hemp, and into which, if the pits are so situated, a small
        stream of water may be conducted and the overflow allowed to run
        out upon the land as a fertilizer... </p>
      <p>"A later practice is to place the hemp in the water for 4 to 5
        days and then take it out and dry it, returning it again to the
        retting- or steeping-place for 4 to 6 days more. This gives a
        better fiber, of a creamy white color, and a more evenly retted
        product. Or, after first being in the water for 5 to 6 days the
        hemp is dried, and when afterwards [decorticated] the hemp is
        'boiled off'... to completely remove the [lignin, etc.]...
        Another process of retting consists in placing the hemp in tanks
        of convenient size, holding 5 to 10 tons of stalks, which are
        filled with water first impregnated with acid, and then emptied
        and refilled with water containing alkaline preparations, or <i>vice
          versa.</i> In some instances the hemp is first broken or
        decorticated and the fibrous material only subjected to
        steeping. This requires much less space, and after steeping the
        fiber can be hung up to dry. </p>
      <p>"One method of 'boiling off' the fiber before spinning consists
        in first passing the partly water-retted hemp through a
        softening machine consisting of 16 sets of fluted rollers... The
        fiber is then macerated in a nearly boiling solution of
        carbonate of soda and soap, then washed, first in cold water and
        then in water containing a small amount of muriatic acid, and
        again steeped in water containing soda without soap, to remove
        the acid; it is then placed in a solution of one part of acetic
        acid and one part of water and afterward in water alone, and
        dried and again softened. The process is too long, but is well
        rewarded in producing an exceedingly fine, soft, valuable fiber,
        highly adapted to the manufacture of fine linen, lawns and
        laces." <b>(5)</b> </p>
      <p>Such extremely fine hemp thread nearly equals silk. It can be
        hand-spun to such fineness that 600 miles of lace thread can be
        produced from 2-1/2 pounds of fiber. Cotton and wool cannot
        exceed 350 miles per 2-1/2 pounds. Boyce continues: </p>
      <p>" There are three methods of retting hemp practicable where
        hemp is grown upon a large scale in the United States. If not
        grown upon a scale of at least 300 to 500 acres by one planter,
        there should be arrangements for uniting several smaller
        growers, or that the hemp grown upon a smaller scale should be
        disposed of to the middle man prepared to ret the hemp and
        prepare the fiber and properly classify it. There is little
        economy in the small acreage system... where the working up is
        done by others. If there is sufficient profit in raising hemp
        with a yield of 3 to 5 tons of hemp straw or stalks per acre,
        and disposing of them to the middle man or manufacturer of
        fibers... then it may be done so; but it is a division of
        profits against the farmer, as he loses all fertilizing matters
        where the hemp stalks are carted from the farm. </p>
      <p>"The first method is the ordinary water retting. For this
        method a system of square wooden tanks... is constructed.... To
        handle 500 acres of hemp, growing 15 feet high, requires
        preparations to handle 2,500 tons of stalks. If the work of
        retting goes on continuously from March to November... it will
        require the handling of at least 10 tons of stalks per day. If
        there is an interruption [for plowing, planting, and
        harvesting], the capacity should be sufficient to handle 15 or
        20 tons per day --- that is, of emptying tanks holding 20 tons
        and putting the stalks out to dry and refilling the tanks, and
        also taking in 20 tons of dried retted stalks and putting them
        under cover to be broken at a later day... The breaking can be
        done from December to March... </p>
      <p>"To handle 20 tons of hemp stalks per day will require 8
        retting tanks 8 x 15 feet and 5 to 6 feet deep. These should be
        situated upon the more elevated portions of the ranch... or the
        tanks may be so constructed upon timbers as to be moved from
        place to place once a year as the ground around the tanks
        becomes fertilized by water and refuse from handling the hemp.
        The steep-water and the foliage and waste from the hemp are high
        in fertilizing elements... </p>
      <p>"The stalks are held down firmly by cross-pieces and the tanks
        are filled with water... In 6 to 10 days, according to
        temperature, the bark of the hemp stalks will be found to
        readily slip off when the stalks are broken in the hands, and
        the hemp should then be taken from the tanks and dried and and
        put under cover to be broken, shaken from the woody matter and
        baled... </p>
      <p>"The above method will produce a prime cordage hemp for use
        where a strong, serviceable fiber is desired. Another process is
        to take the hemp stalks from the retting vats in 5 days and dry
        them by standing out or spreading, and again returning them to
        the vats for 5 to 8 days longer. This produce a fiber
        corresponding to the best Italian hemps.. and is adapted for
        fine cordage, coarse threads, carpet warps, canvas and similar
        products. </p>
      <p>"Another method is to place false end pieces across the tanks
        some 2 inches from each end of the retting tanks and reaching
        down to within 2 to 4 inches of the bottom. A half-inch stream
        of water is let flow into the tank upon the top. This carries
        all impurities downward and out under the ends of the false ends
        and up and out over the real end, made an inch the lowest, and
        thus maintains a circulation of water which produces a fiber of
        much lighter color, especially if the water used is slightly
        hard and impregnated with lime. </p>
      <p>"After the hemp is retted in water in the tanks for 5 days it
        may be taken out, dried and broken, and will furnish an
        exceedingly strong fiber for many uses. After water retting and
        drying the stalks, they are put under cover to further ripen and
        mellow. In all the work there should be some 6 weeks between the
        time of harvesting the hemp before it is retted, and the same
        length of time between the retting and the breaking, so that
        there will of necessity have to be a storage room for at least a
        supply for the work of 6 weeks. </p>
      <p>"In retting, the tanks are emptied one or more each day, the
        contents put out to dry and again filled, so the work goes on
        steadily. Rain and snow and frosts do not injure the hemp after
        it is retted; in fact, the washing from a rain is an advantage,
        while a sharp frost serves to disintegrate the fibers. </p>
      <p>"Another process is to first break the hemp stalks by passing
        them through a breaking machine [to remove the hurds]... As it
        requires 5 to 6 tons of hemp stalks to yield a ton of fiber, it
        can readily be seen that first breaking the hemp and disposing
        of four-fifths of the weight and bulk leaves a much less amount
        to be handled and very much saves labor in the work; besides, a
        tank holding 5 tons of stalks would hold all the fiber from 25
        tons of stalks. If the hemp is first broken the retting tanks
        may be of much less size, while it is much easier to handle the
        fiber alone than the stalks, and in retting the water attacks
        the fiber evenly on all sides alike, whereas with the stalks the
        water only comes in contact with the outside of the fiber. In
        drying the fiber after it is so retted 25 tons may be hanged may
        be hanged upon an acre of ground if placed upon bars, horses, or
        other frames, for support. After drying in some 4 days, the
        fiber is put under cover to be again run through the breaking
        machine, and is in much finer condition for market. In all this
        work, if the retting tanks are filled with 1 pound of potash lye
        to each hundred pounds of hemp stalks or fiber, the retting will
        be done in 4 days instead of 8. When this is done with the fiber
        alone, the fiber is afterwards put into a solution of muriatic
        acid, 1 pound to 100 gallons of water, and again rinsed in
        water... </p>
      <p>"Instead of potash, some 2 to 4 pounds of neutral soap, free
        from resin, may be used and the hemp fiber retted without the
        use of the acid bath, the fiber being rinsed in soft water. Also
        the retting will be done in 2 or 3 days if the weather is warm,
        and there will be but little of the bad odor attending ordinary
        water retting. If this solution of soap and water is made hot,
        the retting will be done in 12 hours. If perforated steam pipes
        are inserted at the bottom of the tanks and live steam turned in
        for boiling, the retting will be complete in 1 to 3 hours,
        according to the strength of solution used and the degree of
        fineness required. If the hemp which has previously been water
        retted and broken is boiled for half an hour in such a
        saponaceous solution a nearly perfect fiber results. After
        boiling and rinsing and drying, and the hemp has lain 4 to 6
        weeks to mellow, ripen and gain nature and quality, it is run
        through the breaking machine, softened and baled, as is done
        with cotton. </p>
      <p>"The steam can be produced at no cost by using hurds as fuel.
        The ashes of hurds contain about 12% potash, which can be
        extracted with water to make soap, soften water, and ret the
        hemp as described above, besides serving as fertilizer." </p>
      <p>The research conducted by W. Fuller and A. Norman in the 1940s
        investigated various controlled methods of retting, with these
        results: </p>
      <p>"Retting under anaerobic conditions was more rapid than any of
        the aerobic methods, and produced a fiber with more desirable
        characteristics. Retting under anaerobic conditions was most
        rapid if the temperature was kept at 37<sup>o</sup> C, the
        acidity of the solution was kept to a minimum, the solution was
        undisturbed, and an enrichment culture was added initially as
        inoculum in an amount equal to 10% or more of the total tank
        solution... Acid accumulation and consequent retardation of the
        retting process was prevented by aeration, and later return, of
        a portion of the retting solution in a separate tank... Under
        controlled anaerobic conditions about 1/2 of the water-soluble
        constituents and the furfuraldehyde-yielding constituents were
        removed in the first 36 hours. Attack upon the cellulose was
        negligible until after 48 hours... The progress of retting was
        invariably accompanied by an attack on the polyuronide
        hemicelluloses proportionately as great as that upon the
        pectin... There was no indication that <i>Trichothecium roseum</i>
        was any more vigorous in cellulose decomposition than any other
        organisms normally present on hemp straw. </p>
      <p>"The loss in weight of the hemp and production of volatile
        [acetic and butyric] acids may be used to a limited extent as
        indicating the rate and degree of retting on a laboratory scale,
        providing that uniform material of the same source and maturity
        is employed... The reduction in the total uronic content of the
        bark reflected the progress of retting better than that of any
        other constituent. Well-retted hemp bark had a total uronic
        content of about 5-6% as compared to 9-10% of the unretted
        bark." <b>(6)</b> </p>
      <p>J. Kulas and L. Nowackiewicz also studied anaerobic retting: </p>
      <p>"The weight-ratio of water during retting, the rinsing of straw
        after retting and the intensity of spraying during pressing were
        more important for fiber quality more than a change of the water
        during the retting. A weight-ratio of 1:20 during the retting of
        hemp straw gives the best results. Rinsing of the straw with 18
        m<sup>3</sup> water sprayed per ton improves the quality. A
        total quantity of 55 m<sup>3</sup> of water per ton of straw is
        necessary." <b>(7)</b> </p>
      <p>US Patent #1,448,391 describes an improved method of retting in
        which hemp stalks are stacked in superimposed layers in an
        inclined position; after they have been cured, they are
        subjected to moisture while still in stacks but without
        submersion, and they are aerated after retting. </p>
      <p>US Patent #2,457,856 teaches a chemical retting process for
        hemp by immersion in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (0.5%),
        ammonium phosphate (0.5%), and urea (1%) at 50<sup>o</sup> C;
        the bath is then heated to 100<sup>o</sup> C. The xyloid
        material is to be removed by decortication. </p>
      <p>In some parts of Asia, hemp fiber is prepared by soaking the
        stalks in water for a day or two, then steaming them for 3
        hours. Then the fiber is peeled off by hand or by scraping. The
        resulting product is a stiff ribbon which is not well suited for
        spinning. Steam retting results in a considerable loss of fiber,
        and the remaining fiber has weaker tensile strength than
        water-retted hemp. <b>(8)</b> </p>
      <p>Edward Antil added a precaution about fresh-water retting in
        his <i>Observations on the Raising and Dressing of Hemp</i>
        (1777): </p>
      <p>"If the Hemp be rotted in a brook or running water, the sheaves
        must be laid across the stream, for if they be laid down
        lengthways with the stream, the current of water will wash away
        the lint, and ruin the Hemp. It must be laid down heads and
        points, two, four, or six deep, according to the depth of the
        water and the quantity of the Hemp..." </p>
      <p>The anonymous Farmer from Annapolis advised against the
        practice of fresh-water retting in&nbsp; his <i>Essay on the
          Culture &amp; Management of Hemp </i>(1775): </p>
      <p>"Before placing the Hemp in the water, it will be necessary to
        take care that the bundles have not been made too large, and
        that the Hemp is tolerably even at the roots, as well as near
        the top; care however must be had not to bind it too close, an
        error, here, being of more consequence than may be imagined, the
        watering never succeeding thoroughly when the bundles are hard
        tied, the fermentation going on unequally in the several parts,
        as they are more or less confined... </p>
      <p>"We are apt to imagine that a fine clear stream would be fitter
        to accomplish this end, because, at the same time that it
        dissolved, it would also purge and wash it from that gum and
        filth, thereby leaving the hemp in a purer state, but
        experience, against which there is no reasoning, convinces us,
        that the properest places for watering Hemp, are deep ditches,
        or pits of stagnated water, such as mill-ponds, or deep pools,
        where the water is seldom or never changed. The more still and
        putrid the easier it ferments, and penetrates the hemp more
        quickly, as well as more effectually, and though that which is
        watered in a limpid stream will appear far whiter, at the brake,
        than that which is watered in stagnated water, yet, upon minute
        examination, the first will be found inferior in quality to this
        last, it appearing in a manner exhausted and dead as it were,
        and of a pale white, whilst the other appears with a fine lively
        gloss, with a bluish cast that never quits it; for the cloth
        made of this Hemp most readily attains a perfect degree of the
        purest white, whilst the cloth made of the river watered Hemp,
        notwithstanding all the efforts of&nbsp; art, will still retain
        a yellowish cast, and without great care, will increase as the
        linen is used... </p>
      <p>"If possible, [the retting pit] ought to be in such a place...
        that a small quantity of soft water, free from any mineral, may,
        when clear, be let into the pit, near the surface, which, else,
        from the excessive power of the sun at this season, would be
        much warmer at the top, and consequently the Hemp there would be
        sooner watered than at the bottom. Where no fresh water can with
        convenience be admitted, the pit may be shaded by means of a few
        more green boughs... </p>
      <p>"To fit these pools the better and sooner for the purpose, it
        will be necessary to have them dug two or three months before
        they are used, and to throw therein, to rot, succulent weeds or
        plants, which may be taken out immediately when the Hemp is
        ready to be laid in, by which means the water will be stirred up
        from the bottom, and mixed with that at the top... </p>
      <p>"If it is perceived that the Hemp has been taken out too soon,
        it is only permitting to lie a few days longer where it is
        spread, and the dew or rain will not only compleat what the
        water has left undone, but it will also take off some of the
        harshness of the Hemp." </p>
      <p>Lionel Slator made this recommendation in his <i>Instructions
          for Cultivating Flax and Hemp </i>(1775): </p>
      <p>"Unless the Ponds be made in a gravelly soil the bottom of the
        Ponds will be apt to be muddy or foul, which may be injuring to
        the Hemp; therefore, to prevent such Mudd, the Bottom of the
        Ponds may be either flag'd or planked, where there is not a
        solid Bottom of Gravel." </p>

      <p><b>3.2 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH32"></a>Hurds</b> </p>
      <p>"Hurds" are the pieces of the woody core of hemp. Hurds are a
        valuable commodity with many uses, especially such as paper and
        Isochanvre, a petrified form of hurds manufactured by Chenovette
        Habitat in France. </p>
      <p>The value of hemp hurds was recognized by the anonymous Farmer
        from Annapolis: </p>
      <p>"A most considerable advantage comes from the coarse tow, or
        hards, of the first hackling, which, by means of the second
        watering, becomes an object of great utility, being thereby
        excellently prepared to make the best sorts of coarse linens...
        and preferable in strength and quality to imported osnabrigs,
        being greatly superior to the coarse tow prepared in the mill."
      </p>
      <p>Marcandier mentioned a mixture of hemp and wool, known as <i>berlinge,</i>
        that was widely used in France: </p>
      <p>"Hards or Tow, in the modern method of its preparation, being
        equally mixed with Wool, Cotton, Silk or Hair, is with much
        credit and advantage wrought into a variety of hose, caps,
        stuffs, cloths, and many other articles, to the reduction of the
        usual price of the whole, and the consequent encrease of
        commerce... </p>
      <p>"Now this hards, that was formerly an object of
        discouragement... by this new operation becomes a matter of very
        great advantage. By carding them like wool, they produce a fine,
        marrowy, and white substance, the true use whereof was never
        discovered till now. It may not only be used alone, as it is,
        for the making of wadding, which, in many respects, will have
        the advantage of the ordinary sort; but moreover, it may be
        spun, and made into very beautiful thread. It may also be mixed
        either cotton and silk, with wool, and even with hair; and the
        thread, that results from these different mixtures, affords, by
        its vast variety, materials for new essays, very interesting to
        the arts, and of vast utility to several sorts of
        manufactures... </p>
      <p>"The principal advantage that Hemp, intended for these uses,
        will have over wool, grogram yarn, and cotton, is, that it may
        be used without spinning or even combing. It will be in no
        danger from those worms, which commonly eat woolen cloth; and
        the beauty, as well as the lasting nature and the low price of
        it, will render it preferable to any other material. The
        different trials, that have been made of this sort, leave no
        room to doubt of success in other attempts of the kind." </p>
      <p>Japanese Patent #42,193 describes the manufacture of imitation
        cotton from waste hemp: </p>
      <p>"Purified waste hemp fibers are wrapped on a spool to a
        thickness of about 2 cm and one side is then cut to form a
        sheet. These sheets are immersed in NaOH solution at 5-15<sup>o</sup>
        for 20 minutes, neutralized with dilute sulfuric acid treated
        with Marseilles soap and non-drying oil as usual, and loosened
        to a cotton state." </p>
      <p>According to Japanese Patent #42,179, threads of hemp, cotton,
        etc., can be whitened by immersion in a solution of 20 gr BaCl<sub>2</sub>
        or CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 gr of sodium acetate, 1 gr of glycerol or
        phenol, 20 gr of milk and a small amount of gum Arabic in 180 cc
        of water. After drying, the textile is passed through cold
        sulfuric acid, washed with water, then dried in the air by
        heating. </p>
      <p>US Patent #2,450,586 was granted for a process to saccharify
        hurds (and other agricultural residues), which can be treated to
        produce C<sub>5-6</sub> sugars: <br>
        "The cellulosic materials are treated with 1-6% sulfuric acid at
        100-120<sup>o</sup>C to convert pentosans to pentoses and
        furfural. The treated material is washed free of soluble pentose
        and other sugars with additional dilute sulfuric acid. The
        residue is dewatered and dried, then comminuted and mixed with
        0.15-0.55 parts of 80-87% sulfuric acid per part of cellulosic
        material at a temperature below 40<sup>o</sup> C, whereby a
        free-flowing powder is formed. The total amount of both dilute
        and concentrated acid used is not more than 0.35 part/part of
        the original cellulosic material by weight. The acid-mixed
        material is then subjected at a temperature of or below 45<sup>o</sup>
        C for 1-5 minutes to mechanical mastication so as to develop
        continuously-changing directional pressures on the solids in
        excess of 100 lb/sq. in. and just short of the formation of
        dextrose, whereby a pronounced physical and chemical change is
        effected to convert powder to a stiff plastic mass. The
        resulting mixture is then diluted and hydrolyzed to produce
        dextrose." </p>
      <p>Hurds also can serve well as a fuel, and can significantly
        reduce the cost of processing the fiber if used to generate
        steam power to operate the machinery. During World War II, hemp
        mills in the USA dried the damp stalks by conveying them through
        a long, heated drying tunnel before delivering them to the
        decorticator and scutching machinery. The hurds were burned to
        provide heat for the drying tunnel. </p>
      <p>I. Popescu and I. Afusoae discovered another use for hurds: </p>
      <p>"Fermentation can help turn hemp boon [hurds] into a suitable
        product for soil fertilization. During fermentation the boon
        reaches almost the same level of assimilable N, K, Mn and Cu as
        in barnyard manure... </p>
      <p>"Hemp boon will absorb up to 792 mg ammonia/gr of boon in
        ammonium nitrate and sulfate solutions." <b>(10)</b> </p>

      <p><a name="HH33"></a><b>3.3 ~ Decortication</b> </p>
      <p>When retting is complete, the stalks are dried and sorted by
        grades, then crushed in a mechanical decorticator. The classic
        hemp-brake is a manually operated wooden press of intersecting
        boards that break the stalks so the hurds can be removed. The
        operation consists of placing some stems with the butt end first
        across the break, then lowering the upper boards by the handle,
        breaking the stems as the boards intermesh. This is done
        repeatedly as the stems are fed in up to the tips. An
        experienced hemp worker can hand-break about 250 lb of fiber per
        day. </p>
      <p>Thomas Jefferson wrote: "A hand will break 50 or 70 lb a day,
        and even to 150 lb if it is divided with an overseer; divide it
        as prepared." But the work was very tedious, and the slaves
        complained of it. Jefferson proceeded to invent an improved hemp
        break, for which he received US Patent #1. He described it in a
        letter to George Fleming (29 December 1815): </p>
      <p>"Flax is so injurious to our lands and of so scanty produce
        that I have never attempted it. Hemp, on the other hand, is
        abundantly productive and will grow forever on the same spot,
        but the breaking and beating is so slow, so laborious and so
        much complained of by our laborers, that I have given it up...
        But recently a method of removing the difficulty of preparing
        hemp occurred to me, so simple and so cheap. I modified a
        threshing machine to turn a very strong hemp-break, much
        stronger and heavier than those for the hand. By this the cross
        arm lifts and lets fall the break twice in every revolution of
        the wallower. A man feeds the break with hemp stalks... where it
        is more perfectly beaten than I have ever seen done by hand. I
        expect that single horse will do the breaking and beating of 10
        men... </p>
      <p>"Something of this kind has been so long wanted by the
        cultivators of hemp, that as soon as I can speak of its effect
        with certainty, I shall probably describe it anonymously in the
        public paper, in order to forestall the prevention of its use by
        some interloping patentee." <b>(11)</b> </p>
      <p>After breaking hemp, the fiber is "scutched" and "hackled" to
        remove the hurds, broken fibers, and extraneous material. The
        fibers are cut into shorter lengths, then combed to remove short
        and tangled segments. The long fibers are parallelized and
        smoothed in a hackling machine, then repeatedly drawn through
        sets of sharp pins or combs to produce a product ready for wet
        or dry pre-spinning into roving yarn. The low quality scutching
        and hackling tow discarded from the preseding process is shaken
        and carded, etc., or it is "cottonized" to remove the sticky
        pectin and lignin and produce loose bast stock. Then it is wet-
        or dry-spun into coarse yarn, twine, or other specialty products
        such as insulation.. </p>
      <p><i><b>The Schlichten Decorticator</b> --- </i>Hundreds of
        hemp-processing machines, or decorticators, have been patented
        since Thomas Jefferson made his improvements on the hemp break.
        Only the design perfected by George W. Schlichten met the needs
        of the industry. The Schlichten Decorticator promised to
        revolutionize the hemp industry by eliminating the need for
        retting. As described in his U.S. Patent #1,308,376, "The fiber
        produced is at once ready and suitable for carding or combing
        without any further treatment such as degumming or retting, and
        leaving the fiber soft, pliant, adhesive, and in its unimpaired
        natural strength and color..." In 1916, after 18 years of
        development and $400,000 investment, Schlichten tested the
        market for the hemp fiber his machine produced. He sold his
        entire first batch to a spinning plant owned by John D.
        Rockefeller, and was paid a record premium of $100/ton.
        Afterwards the mill offered to buy the exclusive rights to the
        invention, and at a higher price than Schlichten had wanted, but
        he declined the offer. </p>
      <p>Field-dried stalks are introduced to the decorticator on a
        corrugated feed table or through revolving disks that keep the
        stalks separated and straight. The stalks pass through denting
        rollers, then through splitting and spreading rollers. The
        stalks then pass between a series of primary and secondary
        breaker rollers. Next, a high speed rotating coarse comber
        begins to clean the fiber and degums it by separating the
        non-fibrous products along with the short "tow" fibers.
        Corrugated softening rolls then massage the fiber and hold it in
        position for another series of combing and softening rollers.
        Finally, an endless slatted carrier eliminates any remaining
        small waste particles and delivers a continuous, folded "sliver"
        of fiber, ready to be hanked and baled (Fig. 3.1). <b>(12)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The machine came to the attention of the industrialist Henry
        Timken (inventor of the roller bearing) in 1917, and he was very
        impressed by its possibilities. He arranged to meet Schlichten
        and offered him the use of 100 acres of his ranchland in
        Imperial Valley, California, to grow a crop of hemp to test in
        the decorticator. The bumper crop was 14-16 feet tall and
        attracted national attention from coverage by the Pathe, Mutual,
        and Hearst newsreel companies. </p>
      <p>Timken also tried to interest newspaper magnate Edward W.
        Scripps in the idea of making newsprint from hemp hurds. Timken
        called Schlichten's decorticator "the greatest invention in the
        world." Scripps' associates Milton McRae and Edward Chase&nbsp;
        investigated the feasibility of&nbsp; the proposition. In his
        enthusiastic report, Chase wrote: </p>
      <p>"I have seen a wonderful, yet simple, invention. I believe it
        will revolutionize many of the processes of feeding, clothing
        and supplying other wants of mankind. </p>
      <p>"Mr. Schlichten raised 5 tons of hemp stalks to the acre on a
        100-acre patch... He will pay the growers $15 per ton for dry
        hemp stalks delivered to his machine... Thus the farmer gets $75
        an acre for this crop which matures in 100 days. The stubble and
        that part of the leaves and tops which remain on the field
        (containing in excess of 50% of N), are wonderful fertilizer.
        Moreover, the hemp kills all weeds. The farmer's land is left in
        fine condition for immediate planting of other crops. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;"From each ton of dry hemp stalks, costing him $15, Mr.
        Schlichten gets the following: <br>

      <p>McRae waxed eloquent with praise in a letter to Henry Timken
        (11 August 1917) </p>
      <p>"Mr. Schlichten impressed me as being a man of great
        intellectuality and ability... he has created and constructed a
        wonderful machine... </p>
      <p>"[That] Schlichten decorticating business... I believe, is one
        that is worthy of any man devoting his time and money to,
        because it appears to me that the successful development of that
        industry means clothing all the people of the world, eventually,
        at considerably less cost than is now required. </p>
      <p>"You know, Lord Bacon had a theory, or philosophy, that in this
        industrial age the real benefactor of mankind was not one who
        evolved or preached a beautiful theory, but one who assisted in
        clothing and feeding the world more economically than in the
        past... that means shorter working hours, and shorter working
        hours eventually means the spiritual development of the
        world..." </p>
      <p>The Schlichten decorticator remained dormant until the
        mid-1990s, when&nbsp; it was redeveloped by Jim Hill, the
        founder and owner of Hill Agra Sales (Shelburne, Ont.),
        manufacturer and distributor of bulk vegetable harvest
        machinery. Jim Hill described the project in an interview with <i>Hemp

          Magazine</i> (1997): </p>
      <p>"We have it working, and it does what we expect of it. The
        machine is two feet wide and eight feet long. It is on a two
        wheel trailer with jacks on either end. It is hydraulically
        driven. The high and low speed rollers have variable speed
        controls with flow dividers. It can be run by a tractor of 60
        horse power using the hydraulic pump on the tractor. </p>
      <p>"The [Fibre X Model 1460] machine will do approximately [3-4
        tons] per hour. We have worked on other designs for fiber
        extraction. The Schlichten model is only one of several we have
        been working on... </p>
      <p>"Basically, what I've done is to study the Schlichten papers,
        patents and drawings. The way that machine is drawn up, there is
        no possible way that the machine could work, based on that
        drawing. Back in those days, people changed their drawings from
        the original machine, so that they couldn't be copied. They
        never trusted anybody... </p>
      <p>"The original machine that he built required four people to
        operate. That means two people putting the stalks in at one end,
        one person shoveling the hurds out from underneath, and a fourth
        person who had to be a good mechanic in order to keep the
        machine working. There were no bearings. The thing probably
        sounded like a flock of canaries when it was running. So,
        between oiling it and keeping the hemp from tangling up in the
        shafts, he must have been a very busy fellow... </p>
      <p>"Our main goal was to maintain all the advantages he had built
        into his unit; such things as holding the rollers apart from one
        another, and having them spring loaded. Obviously, we had to put
        a high grade bearing in and have it protected against wrapping
        up in the fibers going through. Instead of putting an inside
        bearing, we put an external bearing that actually has its shaft
        continue over the mounting plate. This means that there is no
        chance of getting fibers caught in the bearing... </p>
      <p>"Two people can run it. Operating this machine is more just a
        question of watching it to make sure that the material flows
        smoothly. It can be hand fed, or machine fed. There are all
        kinds of developments that can be added to this machine. The
        hurds that come out underneath the machine can be dropped on a
        conveyor and blown off into large plastic bags for later use.
        Our idea for the decorticator is that it should be used out in
        the field. This puts the dust right back in the ground for
        fertilizer... </p>
      <p>"The decorticator is portable so you can move it from field to
        field instead of moving all the material to a central location
        for processing. That means that several growers can get together
        and buy the equipment and handle this as any other crop. After
        that, you can handle the product output many different ways. You
        can upgrade your product at the farm gate and have that value
        ready to ship out as goods. This will allow the growers to
        realize more of the profit available from their crop." </p>
      <p>Austrian company Rohemp also manufactures a mobile hemp breaker
        which separates field-retted hemp into fiber and hurds at a rate
        of about 1 ton/hour and produces round bales of straw. </p>

      <p><b>3.4 ~&nbsp;<a name="HH34"></a>Hemp Fiber Technology</b> </p>
      <p>The certified classification and value of hemp stalks is
        determined by the quantity and quality of the long fibers in
        particular. Fine fibers are most valuable. The content of fine
        fibers is indicated by a numerical index that is determined by
        the ratio of the length and diameter of the stalk. Grade I
        stalks are no more than 0.4 inches (10 mm) thick along at least
        60 inches (150 cm, 85%) of the plant's length. Grade II stalks
        have a maximum thickness of 0.5 inch (12 mm) and a minimum
        technical length of 40 inches (100 cm). Grade III stalks are a
        maximum 0.6 inch (14 mm) thick and 25 inches (60 cm) minimum
        technical length. The maximum moisture content for all three
        grades is 16%. </p>
      <p>No matter what the method of cultivation, all hemp must undergo
        some primary processing near the farm. Schlichten-type
        decorticators or "mini-mills" with 50-300 tons daily capacity
        would be ideal. </p>
      <p>Several modern technical developments have made hemp fiber
        processing more economical and eco-friendly. Traditional methods
        of retting can pollute the environment and are subject to
        failure. The new methods produce high yields of standard-quality
        fiber at competitive prices for industrial purposes. The
        absorptive properties, temperature stability, etc., can be
        modified by pre-treatments such as drying, carbonizing,
        impregnation, and mineralization. A very efficient method of
        steam explosion (STEX) that produces high-quality hemp fiber has
        been developed in Europe. STEX enables the production of
        custom-made fibers that meet special requirements for singular
        products. The parameters of the process can be steered to
        optimize the objective qualities of the resultant fibers. It is
        possible to produce yarns of Nm 10-15 fineness (the running
        length of thread per gram of yarn weight) without making any
        special modifications of the process. Even after cottonization,
        steam-treated hemp has a value of about 60 cN/tex (cotton has a
        value of about 35 cN/tex). </p>
      <p>Cleaned fibers (70 mm) are pre-treated with alkali and
        introduced to a reaction vessel. High-pressure steam (up to 12
        bar, 175 psi) is injected to penetrate between the bast fibers
        and dissolve the lignin, pectin, etc., for 30 minutes or less.
        The pressure is released suddenly to explode the fiber bundles
        without causing disintegration of single cells. The additives
        and other substrate ingredients are blown out and collected for
        extraction and recycling. The resultant fibers are washed,
        rinsed, and dried with hot air. Then the fibers are opened with
        a saw-tooth opener and any remaining dust or wood is removed
        with a multi-stage cleaner. Lesser amounts of dyes and other
        chemicals are required for further processing because the STEX
        process produces very high purity fibers. </p>
      <p>The Xymax Corporation has perfected a patented process using
        steam explosion to reduce plant material to cellulose,
        hemicellulose, and lignin. The "Xylanizer" produces "cottonized"
        or flock hemp that can be refined by existing
        cotton/wool-processing equipment. It also produces "BondoMass",
        an inexpensive plastic-like wood which is stronger and more
        flexible than lumber. Xylanized cellulose also produces twice as
        much ethanol as fermentation processes, and the residue can be
        made into paper pulp at a lower cost than from wood. The only
        byproduct is steam. <b>(13)</b> </p>
      <p>Ecco Gleittechnic Gmbh (Germany) has demonstrated a novel
        ultrasonic breakdown method and apparatus to remove dirt,
        lignin, and pectin from hemp straw. The resultant fiber is of
        high purity and consistency, "a completely new type of natural
        fiber" possessed of "extremely high and fast water absorption,
        and a high degree of whiteness [70]." Only 1% hydrogen peroxide
        is necessary to reach 90 degrees of whiteness. The process
        replaces the retting process and mechanical decortication, and
        it excludes the degradation of cellulose caused by chemical
        treatments. The lignin and pectin can be recovered for other
        uses, such as binders for particle boards. </p>
      <p>Alcell Technologies, a division of Repap, has experimented with
        pulping whole hemp stalks. Separating the longer fibers before
        processing them is too expensive. Alcell's technology
        fractionizes the fibers in a Thermo-Mechanical Pulping (TMP)
        process to produce both newsprint and high-quality wood paper
        from a single source of fiber. </p>
      <p>Hurds are useful as papermaking material, but they contain more
        lignin than the bark. Therefore, hemp bark is more valuable than
        hurds for papermaking. The lignin must be removed in the
        papermaking process. Delignification generally is done with
        chlorine, which is the major source of pollution from pulp
        mills. Digestion with sodium hydroxide at about 170<sup>o </sup>C
        also promotes delignification. Hydrogen peroxide provides a
        superior alternative, producing high quality pulp with minimal
        pollution. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;novel chemi-mechanical hemp pulping technology developed
        by the Dutch ATO-DLO allows fiber length to be adjusted, and
        eliminates the need for a hollander beater. The process uses a
        twin-screw extrusion pulping machine that combines shear forces
        and small amounts of alkali and catalyst to remove only about
        50% of the lignin. Thus, hemp paper can be manufactured at a
        lower cost than from wood. <b>(14)</b> </p>
      <p>The closed-cycle Alcohol-Ammonia-Sulfite (AAS) pulping process
        makes possible the production of hemp pulp without pollution.
        AAS pulping can use the woody core to produce long bast fibers
        with very low levels of lignin, and it does not require that the
        bast fiber and woody shives be separated beforehand. The
        selectivity and "soft" conditions of AAS-pulping enable bast
        fiber pulping to be separated into low-lignin long fibers and
        high-lignin short fibers. The AAS-pulping process produces hurd
        pulp equal in quality and superior in yield to wood kraft pulp,
        and it is about 15% brighter. Its breaking length also is very
        high. </p>
      <p>The AAS process uses aqueous ethyl or methyl alcohol (water
        65:35 alcohol vol %) as a solvent, but polyols (glycerine,
        diethylene glycol, etc.) or cellosolves (ethylene glycol
        monoethyl ether, etc.) can be used, though they are more costly.
        The process cooks the shives with ammonia-sulfite (1:0.2-2.5 %
        by weight) in aqueous alcohol at 150-185<sup>o</sup> C for
        75-180 minutes. The liquor to shive ratio is from 4-4.5:1 The
        ammonia consumption is 5-25% of the weight of raw material. The
        alcohol, water, and by-products (alcohol, acetone, ethyl
        acetate, etc.), can be recovered for recycling. The yield varies
        from about 55-68%. </p>

      <p>A wide range of lignin content has been reported for hemp, from
        a low of 4-8% to a maximum of 30%. The dry weight of male hemp
        is 13-16% lignin; females contain 23-25%. As many as 4
        chlorinations are necessary to delignify hemp cellulose. If the
        residual lignin exceeds 0.8%, the fiber is brown and hard to
        handle. In comparison, straw contains about 15% lignin,
        sugarcane bagasse about 20% lignin, bamboo is about 23% lignin,
        jute is 11% lignin, and retted flax is 2% lignin.<b>(15, 16)</b>
      </p>
      <p>When viewed under a polarization microscope, interference
        colors appear in the orthogonal position, which are different
        for flax and hemp. </p>
      <p>A typical analysis of hemp fiber gives: Ash (0.8%), hygroscopic
        water (8-9%), aqueous extract (3.5%), fat and wax (0.%),
        cellulose (78%), lignins and pectins (9.5%). The woody core
        contains about 7.7% glucan, 6.7% xylan, 1.2% mannan, and 2.1%
        lignin. The bast fibers contain about 6.7% glucan, 1.5% xylan,
        1.9% mannan, and 4% lignin. </p>

      <p><a name="HH35"></a><b>3.5 ~ Hemp Paper Manufacture</b> </p>
      <p>Most of the few hemp pulp paper mills each produce about 5
        kilotons/year of specialty papers for cigarettes, filters,
        insulation, security and art. Hemp paper is superior to pulp in
        most respects, but the paper industry is not equipped to handle
        hemp pulp, and the cultivation of hemp is not yet extensive
        enough to supply the market. </p>
      <p>The pulp and paper industry also does not use hemp hurds for
        several technical&nbsp; reasons. Hurds are relatively difficult
        to delignify. Unbleached hurd pulp produced by conventional
        processes gives lower yields and has higher Kappa numbers than
        hardwood pulp. The fiber length of hurd pulp is only half as
        long as hardwood pulp. Hurd pulp has an extremely low rate of
        drainage and low mechanical and papermaking properties when
        prepared by conventional methods. These factors are of little
        importance when AAS pulping is used. </p>
      <p>The production of paper from hemp hurds is a relatively simple
        process. The hurds must be sorted or screened according to size
        so as to ensure uniform quality of the finished fibers. Smaller
        pieces are reduced sooner than large hurds by the caustic
        cooking process, and the over-treated hurds result in a lower
        yield of cellulose fiber, and a mixture of over- and
        under-treated fibers. The hurds must be sieved to remove dirt
        before cooking. </p>
      <p>Such preparations are unnecessary if the Schlichten
        decorticator, AAS pulping, or steam explosion is employed.
        Edward Chase pointed out the advantages of Schlichten&#8217;s
        mechanically decorticated hurds in his report to Howard Scripps:
      </p>
      <p>"On page 22 of [USDA] <i>Bulletin </i>#404, paragraph 2, you
        will note: </p>
      <p>"The weight of hurds which are capable of being charged into a
        rotary (digester) is a decidedly unfavorable factor. </p>
      <p>"(This in comparison with the weight of a cubic foot of wood as
        now charged into the digesters at the paper mills.) This would
        not be the case with the hurds from the Schlichten machine...
        Dry hurds in hydraulically pressed bales would weigh about as
        much per cubic foot as wood. </p>
      <p>"You will also note that the bales of hurds from the retted
        hemp must be covered, which would not be the case with the
        Schlichten hurds. Also, hurds from retted hemp must be screened
        or sorted, and the various sizes treated separately and
        differently. None of this work is necessary with the Schlichten
        hurds..." </p>
      <p>The following excerpts from a "Digest of Conversation of Mr.
        G.W. Schlichten with Mr. M.A. McRae..." (3 August 1917),
        illustrate the enormous potential of hemp hurds for purposes of
        paper production: </p>
      <p>"In speaking about the rise in price of paper, etc., Mr.
        Schlichten said ... </p>
      <p>"I came in contact with Mr. Merrill [sic] of the Paper Plant
        Investigation Bureau of the Agriculture Department; he is the
        head of it... I gave to Merrill some hurds... The hemp hurds is
        a practical success and will make paper of a higher grade than
        ordinary news stock. The Government has made on a large and
        practical scale paper --- a beautiful sheet --- and I can show
        you governmental reports printed on paper made from hemp
        hurds... This paper has been made from hurds produced from the
        fermented [retted] hemp... but I produce from the unfermented
        stock, and therefore the inner part is more valuable for paper
        stock because it has a certain amount of natural glue contained
        in it, which acts in the cooking as a natural binder for the
        fiber... </p>
      <p>"In the cooking and beating of these hurds, less caustic soda,
        resin, and ... clay will be needed than when ground wood is
        used; </p>
      <p>"Sulphite must be mixed with ground wood pulp, but not with
        [hurd] pulp... </p>
      <p>The USDA report by Merrill states: </p>
      <p>"This comparison, satisfactory in many respects, develops two
        factors which are decidedly unfavorable to hemp hurds, namely,
        raw-material storage and digester capacity, and they must be
        taken into full account in considering the paper-making value of
        this material... Material progress was being made at the
        conclusion of this preliminary work... </p>
      <p>"Calculations on the raw product and acreage for a permanent
        supply for a pulp mill producing 25 tons of fiber a day for 300
        days per annum, or 7,500 tons per annum, give the comparison
        between hurds and wood...<b>"</b> </p>

      <p><b>The most important point derived from this calculation is in
          regard to areas required for a sustained supply, which are in
          the ratio of 4 to 1. Every tract of 10,000 acres which is
          devoted to hemp raising year by year is equivalent to a
          sustained pulp-producing capacity of 40,500 acres of average
          pulp-wood lands. In other words, in order to secure additional
          raw material for the production of 25 tons of fiber per day
          there exists the possibility of utilizing the agricultural
          waste already produced on 10,000 acres of hemp lands instead
          of securing, holding, reforesting, and protecting 40,500 acres

      <p>Paper is manufactured by "cooking", the process by which
        fibrous raw matrials are reduced to cellulose pulp by chemical
        treatment with alkali. The most satisfactory results are
        obtained with sufficient caustic solution (29.5% sodium
        hydroxide at a concentration of 107 gr/liter having 84%
        causticity) to supply 25-30% actual NaOH (calculated from the
        dry weight of hurds in the charge). Merrill used a larger amount
        of caustic than was necessary in his experiments because his
        steam supply was problematic. The batches were contained in a
        rotary charger at 1/2 rpm. After 5 minutes, steam (120 psi) was
        admitted at such a rate that the charge was heated to 170<sup>o</sup>
        C in 1 hour. The heating was continued 5 hours, then the steam
        pressure was released, and the stock was emptied into a tank to
        be drained and washed. </p>
      <p>The cooked stock, brown in color, was washed for 1 hour in a
        cylinder covered with 60-mesh wire cloth so as to remove dirt
        and chemical residues. The water was drained off, the stock was
        steam-heated to 40<sup>o</sup> C, and a solution of 11.3%
        chlorine bleaching solution and 1/2 pint of sulfuric acid was
        added, equivalent to 10% of the weight of the fiber. The mixture
        was bleached overnight, then drained and washed. If the color
        was not sufficiently white, more bleach was added, and the
        process was repeated. </p>
      <p>The best results in the process of furnishing in a beating
        engine was obtained with a charge of 16.5% sulphite, 22.3% soda
        poplar, and 61.2% hurd stock loaded with 22% clay and 1.38%
        resin size. The furnish was given a hard brush for 1 hour and
        given a blue tint before it was run on a papermaking machine
        with no problems whatsoever. Merrill commented that,
        "Experienced paper-makers commented very favorably on the
        running of this furnish and the quality of the paper produced,"
        which was classed as a No. 1 machine-finished printing paper.
        The USDA <i>Bulletin</i> No. 404 was printed on the hempen
        paper they produced. The bulletin then continues with a proviso:
      </p>
      <p>"The weight of a cubic foot of hurds is about 5.4 lb compared
        to 8.9 lb/cu ft for poplar-chips charge. This represents a
        cooking charge of 60% of the weight of a poplar-chips charge,
        yielding about 38% as much fiber as a wood charge. The smaller
        weight of a hurd charge constitutes one of the main objections
        to the use of hemp hurds in paper manufacturing, but the weight
        of the charge can be increased by steaming or tamping. The
        relatively high cost of hemp fiber pulp is due to the
        inefficient processes currently used to produce pulp. In
        addition, hemp is harvested once a year --- usually in August
        --- and it needs to be stored until used at the mill, resulting
        in higher costs." </p>
      <p>Cooking of hemp fibers with water gives a product which can be
        used for Kraft paper. Digestion with sodium hydroxide gives a
        pulp containing as much as 20% pentosans. The Ritter-Kellner
        method is more suitable: the fiber is cooked at 140-150<sup>o</sup>
        for 12-13 hours with 4% sulphite liquor to produce pulp
        containing about 64% crude cellulose of which 10% is pentosans<b>(18)</b>
      </p>
      <p>As explained above, hemp fiber is not entirely practical for
        paper-making when it is subjected to soda and sodium
        anthraquinone pulpings. Furthermore, the bast and woody fibers
        of hemp are so different from each other that it is impractical
        to pulp them together. The qualities of hemp fiber are different
        from other pulp materials; it requires special beating and
        refining processing and equipment. The process is much less
        efficient when conventional papermaking machinery is modified
        for hemp pulp. For example, it is not worthwhile to use a disk
        refiner, whereas low-speed hollanders are suitable. It is also
        characteristic of hemp pulp that the "freeness" increases during
        the papermaking process. It must be watched closely to prevent
        over-beating. </p>
      <p>Hollander beaters impair the drainage properties of hemp pulp
        to such extent that the paper-making machine must be run at a
        slower speed in order to dewater properly. Thermo-Mechanical
        Pulping (TMP) eliminates the need for hollander beater. TMP
        employs mechanical shear forces combined with small amounts of
        alkali and catalysts.Wade Chute, Senior Research Engineer of
        Agrifibres at the Alberta Research Council, made a comparative
        study of the properties of mechanical pulps made from hemp bast
        fiber and whole-stalk mechanical pulps. Significant problems
        were encountered with fiber tangling and plugging of the refiner
        inlet. The primary processing procedure was therefore made
        particularly aggressive to prevent recurrence of the problem,
        but this manner of processing caused excessive damage to the
        fibers, resulting in significantly lower quality results than
        were expected. Chute found that whole-stalk mechanical pulps are
        weaker than bast fiber pulps, resulting in lower tear strength
        because short hurd fibers are present. More refining energy is
        required to process whole stalk hemp pulps, compared to bast
        fiber pulps. </p>
      <p>The French BiVis process, developed in 1975, uses a twin-screw
        extruder to cut the long bast fibers to a length that
        conventional papermakers can handle without adversely affecting
        the drainage. The BiVis rocess has been adapted to handle hemp
        fiber efficiently with an overall yield of 75-80% w/w (compared
        to about 50% efficiency for chemical pulping). The process uses
        hydrogen peroxide (40 kg/ton) and alkali (50 kg/ton) to produce
        chlorine-free paper with 82 point brightness. Water consumption
        is 12 m<sup>3</sup>/ton,
        and most of the waste is biologically degradable. </p>
      <p>US Patent #982,170 describes an electrified preparation of hemp
        for the manufacture of paper: </p>
      <p>"Hemp is cut into small pieces, then boiled in 0.5-8% sulfuric
        acid. Immerse the hemp in a solution of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and
NaCl,
and

        subject it to the action of an electric current." </p>
      <p>US Patent #2,099,400 describes "An improved method of producing
        bleached pulp from hemp tow (hurds)": </p>
      <p>"[Subject] the tow to a cooking operation in a digester with a
        solution of water of approximately 2-1/2 to 4 times the dry
        weight of the fiber, and 14% to 20% sodium hydroxide and 1% to
        4% sulfur, the quantitites of the chemicals employed in the
        solution being based on the dry weight of tow; then wash the
        cooked fiber to remove shive fiber and water soluble impurities,
        and bleach the fiber." </p>
      <p>Sadly, the mass-production of hemp paper probably will not
        become established as a major industry until the insatiable
        demand for wood has utterly decimated the forests of the world
        (circa 2020 AD) and there is no other alternative. </p>
      <p>A "Market Analysis for Hemp Fiber as a Feed Stock for
        Papermaking" was suppressed by the Justice Department in 1997
        after an anonymous chemical engineer, employed by a public
        institution in Wisconsin, released the paper. A bootleg copy was
        obtained and published "in the name of academic freedom" in <i>Hemp
          Magazine</i> (May 1998), excerpted here: </p>
      <p>"The value of bast fibers as a component in paper pulp is
        widely acknowledged. An analysis of the bast fibers shows that
        they are composed of 70% cellulose and 8% lignin. Given that
        this material is chemically quite different than the hurds, it
        likely would have to be processed separately, but would likely
        have a 70% yield to fiber. If one does a weighted average of 50%
        yield for the hurds and 70% for the bast fibers, one obtains a
        value of 55% fiber yield from retted hemp stalks: (0.25)(70%) +
        (0.75)(50%) = 55%... </p>
      <p>"Making assumptions about hemp yield per acre (3.9
        tons/acre/year) and the pulp yield per ton of retted hemp (55%),
        one can estimate the number of acres of hemp required per year
        to meet the current Wisconsin demand: </p>
      <p>(3,178 tons pulp/day (360 days/yr) = 533,000 acres (3.9 tons
        hemp/acre/yr)(0.55 tons pulp/tons/hemp). </p>
      <p>"The price of bleached pulp varies widely, $300 to $1000/ton,
        due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Give this wide
        variation estimating the value of hemp fiber is rather
        difficult. It is likely that fiber formed from the hurds will be
        viewed as similar to hardwood fiber. The current price of bleach
        pulp is near $425/ton. The production costs will be similar to
        the production cost of fiber from wood. In fact, an implicit
        assumption of the following analysis is that only minor
        modifications to a pulp mill would be required to switch from
        wood to hemp. A recent analysis of the pulp making process
        suggests that the raw material, chemical and energy costs for
        pulping and bleaching wood chips is $233/ton of ECF bleached
        pulp. Of this cost, $155 was the cost of the wood chips,
        assuming wood chips cost $55/ton. If one includes a 50% increase
        in the cost/ton to account for labor, overhead and capital, one
        finds that the break even point is likely near $350/ton. If one
        assumes that the average yield from the hemp fibers would be
        55%, then a direct replacement for wood chips would suggest a
        value of $75/ton for the retted hemp stalks. This price is based
        on numbers that were generated in 1993. If one uses the chemical
        price index to adjust this to 1997 one gets a value of
        $85/ton... A more realistic future value is likely $100-125. </p>
      <p>"It is likely that the bast fibers would be reviewed as a
        higher value material on the pulp market. If, for example, one
        were able to produce fibers similar to cotton linters or cotton
        rags, then the market would likely offer $1000/ton of fiber. To
        translate this value to a price of the raw materials one must
        make several assumptions. If one assumes that the processing
        costs are the same as that for wood, $195/ton, that the yield to
        fiber is 70%, and that the required profit margin is $100/ton
        processed, the paper company could pay $500/ton for the bast
        fibers: ($1000-$295)/1.43 tons hemp/ton fiber = $493/ton hemp. </p>
      <p>"If one uses a value of $100/ton for hurds and $500/ton for
        bast fibers, the estimated market value of retted hemp stalks is
        $200/ton. A study of hemp cultivation in Iowa suggested an
        average yield of 3.9 tons/acre. Combining the market price and
        the yield per acre one obtains a crop value of $780/acre. Since
        the production, storage and transportation costs will be similar
        to those of corn, $300/acre, a farmer could make a profit of
        $480/acre growing hemp. If the farmer were to only market the
        fiber, however, the profit drops to $190/acre... </p>
      <p>"The profitability, for the farmer, hinges on the separation of
        the bast fibers from the hurds and the selling of the bast
        fibers at a higher price. For the purpose of this analysis, it
        was assumed that the paper industry would use the bast fibers,
        but it is also likely that other markets, e.g., textiles and
        building materials, could be found for them. Furthermore, one
        must develop markets for both the hurds and the bast fibers, if
        this enterprise is to be viable." </p>
