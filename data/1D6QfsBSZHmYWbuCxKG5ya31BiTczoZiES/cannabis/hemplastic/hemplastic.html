        </b><b>Introduction</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        ZEO is a privately held, Australian-based company that has
        developed and patented a revolutionary eco-friendly industrial
        material, derived from raw cellulose – the most abundant source
        of fibre on the planet.<br>
        <br>
        Pure cellulose extracted from recycled and reclaimed papers,
        industrial hemp, discarded natural fabrics, waste and renewable
        plants, is sustainably transformed into a strong, durable,
        flexible base material called ZEOFORM™.<br>
        <br>
        Similar in look, feel and function to a dense hardwood, ZEOFORM
        can be sprayed, moulded or formed into infinite shapes, sizes,
        colours and variations – including specialised substrates for
        unique applications in any industry requiring woods, plastics
        and resins for manufacturing.<br>
        <br>
        ZEOFORM is truly 100% eco-friendly – with no glues, binders,
        chemicals or additives of any kind. A unique patented process
        produces a beautiful, versatile, extremely strong material for
        thousands of products used every day, worldwide.<br>
        <br>
        While rapidly diminishing resources of wood, and environmentally
        damaging petrochemical derivatives are untenable as source
        materials into the future, ZEOFORM converts waste into a
        UNIVERSAL Material that will replace most plastics, woods and
        composite materials used in manufacturing today.<br>
        <br>
        ZEOFORM has been called ‘The Holy Grail of eco-materials‘, as
        its universal application is limited only by our imagination.
        Guided by sustainable business principles, and dedicated to
        positive planetary change, the global directive of ZEOFORM is –
        ‘Making Form Sustainable‘.<br>
        <br>
        Zeoform is a revolutionary material that changes everything.
        Made from cellulose fibres and water – and absolutely nothing
        else, our patented process converts cellulose fibres into an
        industrial strength moulding material capable of being formed
        into an unlimited array of products. Zeoform is 100% non-toxic,
        biodegradable, compostable and ‘locks up’ carbon into beautiful,
        functional forms. A perfect solution for emerging hemp
        industries and bio-waste nations!<br>

        A process for producing a work piece includes providing raw
        material which is cellulose-containing and fibrous, which is not
        any part of a tree, and which is selected from the group
        consisting of, crude plant fibers, pure cellulose, waste paper,
        and waste cardboard; adding water to the raw material; finely
        chopping the raw material in a machine by continuously grinding
        the raw material with a total energy expenditure of at least 0.5
        kWh/kg, based on dry weight of the raw material, into a
        microfiber pulp having an increased internal fiber surface and
        an increased degree of interlinking; forming the microfiber pulp
        to provide a shaped green body; and drying the shaped green body
        by removing water therefrom to harden the shaped green body and
        form a work piece, wherein the shaped green body is hardened
        into the work piece by drying only without admixture of bonding
        agents to the microfiber pulp and without use of external
        pressure, and wherein the work piece has characteristics which
        depend on degree of grinding to produce the microfiber pulp and
        which range from (a) paper carton-like to (b) wood-like to (c)
        horn-like, the work piece having a specific gravity which ranges
        up to that of pure cellulose, 1.5.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The invention concerns a process for producing blanks or molded
        bodies with similar characteristics as wood from one or more
        cellulose-containing, fibrous raw material, e.g. pure cellulose,
        but also crude fibers or the complete plant or other
        constituents of hemp, flax, reed, cotton, straw, etc., as well
        as old cardboard and waste paper, through specific processing of
        said fibers to form a microfiber pulp which is then dried, if
        necessary after first draining and forming it, as well as the
        diverse use of said microfiber pulp as bonding or matrix
        material for taking up filler materials.<br>
        <br>
        The objective is an economical production of the aforementioned
        materials, bodies and molded parts having good technical
        properties, if possible based on ecological criteria.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        In the patents CH 254243, DE 4207233 A1, EP 402866 A2, U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,935,924 A, as well as GB 2066145 A, it is suggested using
        beaten cellulose or microcellulose pulp as bonding agent,
        filter, speaker membrane or as thickening and reinforcing agent
        for paper products. These patents appear to oppose individual
        claims of the patent under consideration. The process suggested
        in the CH 254243, however, requires extremely long, uneconomical
        processing times and the resulting, gelatinous slime has a
        consistency that makes the drainage of water very difficult. In
        addition, higher densities and strength can be obtained with
        this process only by using pressure (at least 4 kg/cm&lt;2&gt;)
        and heat (above 100[deg.] C.).<br>
        <br>
        Basically, considerably lower strengths are achieved on the
        basis of this Swiss patent and other already known processes
        than with our process.<br>
        <br>
        Thus, according to the DE 4207233 A1, waste paper is beaten and
        stirred and, following the introduction of air, is dried to
        filtering bodies with low strength. It is significant that the
        inventor considers it necessary to admix the fiber pulp with
        calcium oxide powder, as is mentioned several times in this
        patent, in order to obtain firmness and stability for the filter
        block through a post-curing. The introduction of air into the
        fiber pulp thus refers to an obviously hardly processed base
        material with extremely low bonding properties.<br>
        <br>
        The word "microcellulose" by itself generally does not define
        either the degree of shortening, squeezing, fibril removal,
        hydration or the adjusted fractional composition of the fibers,
        which are critical for the internal cross-linkage, matting and
        bonding properties.<br>
        <br>
        It is significant that the EP 402866 A2 also does not address
        the fineness via these bonding properties, but via the filtering
        characteristics of the material, that is to say whether the
        material is adjusted finely enough to prevent certain particles
        (e.g. bacteria and the like) from passing through the filter.<br>
        <br>
        The fact that the use of polymers as raw material is also
        suggested for these filters, in the cited examples as well as
        the claims, serves as further proof that the refinement function
        has another purpose as well as has a very different qualitative
        and quantitative cause. Thus, the processing clearly does not
        serve to increase the hydrogen bonding between fibers.<br>
        <br>
        The U.S. Pat. No. 3,935,924 A appears to deal only with
        carbon-fiber reinforced fine paper with somewhat increased
        bonding properties for speaker membrane production.<br>
        <br>
        All the aforementioned patents use only pure cellulose, but not
        cheap crude fibers or other plant constituents. Refiners are
        used only for shortening of cellulose fibers to make these
        suitable for further processing, e.g. in a "high pressure
        homogenizer." This high-pressure pulping in an expansion nozzle
        results in totally different fractional compositions and
        defibration degrees. The same is true for the GB 2066145 A. The
        pulp produced with this process has considerably lower bonding
        properties. It is significant that the suggestion is only for
        using this pulp as reinforcement for paper, but not for the
        bonding of wood replacement products such as furniture panels
        or, following the drying, as synthetic material replacement.
        Adding approximately 40% highly processed micro pulp, produced
        according to our process, as suggested in table IX of this
        patent specification, provides the paper with the properties of
        wood veneer, which is too hard for paper, is brittle and
        unusable in this function. The conclusion can be drawn from this
        as well that substantial differences to the present patent
        exist.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        In contrast to the processes suggested in said patents, the
        process in the present patent permits an economical realization
        for the intended applications. This concerns the processing
        expenditure as well as the options for the raw material
        selection, the drainage times and the suggested processing paths
        for a product realization. Beyond that, the microfiber pulp
        produced with this process results in work pieces with higher
        strength values, which can surpass those of hardwood, without
        having to use bonding and flux agents or external pressures,
        given a suitable raw material selection and corresponding
        processing. Specific gravities of up to 1.5 can be achieved in
        this way. The light-weight and porous variants also have
        excellent strength values.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        This is achieved through a continuous grinding, chopping and
        defibration of the cellulose fiber or cellulose-containing fiber
        in the refiner, wherein a total energy expenditure of at least
        0.5 kWh/kg, but ideally 2-2.5 kWh/kg are necessary with a
        laboratory refiner RO-Escherwys. (In order to determine the
        actual grinding capacity, the no-load capacity must be deducted
        from the total energy consumption. Thus, a different ratio
        between no-load capacity to grinding capacity results if
        machines with a higher capacity or other suitable fiber chopping
        and defibration machines are used, and the above-defined total
        energy consumption must be adapted accordingly.) In this way, a
        moldable microfiber pulp with very diverse fiber lengths and the
        tiniest fibril sizes develops, which pulp has the characteristic
        of hardening to form an ecological, subsequently deformable
        fiber material with high density (up to a specific gravity of
        1.5) and strength without the admixture of adhesives or chemical
        additives and without the use of pressure, simply through drying
        and the associated shrinkage.<br>
        <br>
        External pressures and forces applied after the grinding above
        all serve to effect a quick preliminary drainage, the forming
        and holding of the form and do not represent a premise for
        achieving high material strengths. Furthermore, the strengths
        and densities of the material, as well as the structural fiber
        arrangements of the work pieces are controlled by varying the
        raw fiber material used, the amounts of grinding energy and the
        selected grinding tools, but also the processes used for the
        prior drainage, forming and drying.<br>
        <br>
        Strength, hardness and formability of the material increase with
        increasing refinement of the cellulose fiber structure. However,
        if the fibers are chopped to be extremely small, the strength
        can be further increased through reinforcement with longer
        fibers (addition of preferably less than 15% dry substance). The
        highest strengths can be achieved with an extremely fine-ground
        microfiber pulp, which is reinforced with a thin net of fibers
        with varied lengths in a balanced fiber-length distribution. In
        this case, the extremely fine-ground microfiber pulp provides
        good bonding-but also good flux-and thus forming
        characteristics; the reinforcement distributes the pressure,
        pull, or shear forces onto larger areas and prevents a short
        break over a small area.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Processing:</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The plastic properties of the microfiber pulp depend directly on
        its water content.<br>
        <br>
        The microfiber dry substance content between 1-15% is very
        suitable for pumping into water-permeable forms (step 1).
        Microfiber pulps with this consistency can also be pressed into
        rigid, impermeable forms, stamped or rolled. In particular,
        fiber pulps with higher material density are predestined for
        these processes (step 2).<br>
        <br>
        The following operational steps can be selected, for example, to
        produce dimensionally accurate products: step 1; then increasing
        the material density in the blank or the board through simple
        drying; subsequently step 2. Depending on the desired
        dimensional accuracy, this step can also be repeated several
        times with continued drying in respectively reduced forms that
        correspond to the shrinkage. Or step 2 and again step 2, as in
        the above, if necessary also several times. Following respective
        prior drainage, e.g. in a screen conveyor press or other
        suitable device, step 2 can be carried out even with very high
        material densities, depending on the desired form for the work
        piece, and if necessary a dry substance content of up to 90%.<br>
        <br>
        For hollow bodies, in particular larger hollow bodies, a mandrel
        is recommended, which is positioned inside the blank and holds
        the shape during the drying. Housings and containers of any
        type, from a film container to a furniture piece, can be
        produced in this way.<br>
        <br>
        The material can also be reshaped after the drying or, following
        the drying and renewed wetting. Thus, boards or form blanks can
        be wetted again inside a climate chamber with water-vapor
        saturated air-possibly also directly in a water bath-in a
        process lasting several hours or days (depending on the
        thickness and desired degree of deformation). The material
        absorbs water during this and becomes plastic, flexible and
        deformable. With suitable devices, it can be formed, bent,
        stamped, rolled, blanked, etc.<br>
        <br>
        The shaped body then hardens again through simple drying to the
        previous density, strength and hardness.<br>
        <br>
        With lower material densities, boards, profile sections and
        more, as well as batches of these, can be produced in continuous
        production lines, comprising a prior drainage section and/or
        subsequent drying section. Extrusion presses that start with
        higher material densities can also lead to the desired result.<br>
        <br>
        The material weight can be reduced continuously from the
        specific gravity of the cellulose itself (approximately 1.5) by
        the inclusion of air or other gas bubbles, but also in general
        through adding light-weight flux materials. This can be done
        until a degree of lightness is reached that falls below that of
        the styrofoam packaging material. The spectrum of density and
        strength thus extends from values that are approximately those
        of glass-fiber reinforced synthetic materials to wood-like
        characteristics (range: between hard tropical wood and balsa
        wood) and up to the highly porous light-weight materials with
        good insulating capacity. The inclusion of gas can be achieved
        through various foaming methods (vortexing or injection of air
        through nozzles or similar devices), the addition of gasifying
        agents, through fermenting and more, but also through (partial)
        blocking of the shrinkage with the aid of reinforcements,
        through incomplete grinding of the fiber pulp, through freezing
        methods, excessive heating, etc. The transition from these
        light-weight materials to the dense hard material is realized
        continuously here through varying the amounts-and/or-the
        temperature parameters during the freezing, and if necessary
        also the drying.<br>
        <br>
        Filler materials can be added by simply mixing them in (best
        method for low material densities) before or after the grinding,
        wherein the distribution must be watched carefully, but in any
        case before the drying is completed. It is possible to obtain
        varied material characteristics by using the most varied filler
        materials, which can be included in the basic material matrix of
        microfibers, but also through the raw material selection. Thus,
        silicates can be added to inhibit fire; graphite is suitable for
        increasing the mechanical gliding ability, but also the
        electrical conductivity; the aesthetic valence can be varied and
        increased with coloring agents, and the material can be realized
        to be heavier, lighter, insulating or with high heat
        conductivity and the like. The desired work piece
        characteristics are achieved through the quantitative ratio of
        these material admixtures.<br>
        <br>
        Also, the different quantity shares of plants and fibers used
        can be processed more or less and parts thereof (those processed
        more) can function as bonding agents, while others (those less
        processed) can serve as reinforcement and drainage felt.
        Strength, specific gravity, insulation value and other technical
        characteristics are adjusted via the quantity shares, the
        respective degree of processing as well as the mechanically
        obtained approximation of the fiber particles prior to the
        drying.<br>
        <br>
        All these "secondary materials" derived from the microfiber base
        material, which can be produced through admixtures, raw material
        selection and process variations in the aforementioned way, are
        also claimed in the herein presented patent.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Hemp fiber is ground in a watery solution (8% dry substance)
        until the microfiber pulp has a pudding-like consistency. This
        microfiber pulp is pumped into permeable forms and drained to
        25% dry substance. The body is then dried to 85% dry substance
        and subsequently provided with its shape in a respective
        stamping mold.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Waste paper is ground in a watery solution (7% dry substance)
        until microfiber pudding results. This material is drained in a
        screen conveyor press to form a rope with 40% dry substance. If
        necessary and depending on the later desired form, it can also
        be drained to a considerably higher material density. The
        resulting solid material pulp is pressed into a form and,
        following an intermediate drying to up to 90% dry substance, is
        subsequently restamped once or several times if necessary. The
        resulting formed parts are then dried completely.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Following a shortening to make it usable for processing, hemp
        straw is ground in a watery solution (6% dry substance) until a
        pudding-like substance results. This substance is then dried to
        form rigid boards with 75-90% dry substance (possibly after
        prior drainage to 40-60% and/or during continued rolling). The
        board is then dried completely for a direct usage of the board,
        or glasses, disposable dishes &amp; cutlery, bowls, cassettes,
        relief doors and the like are produced with the aid of stamping
        and punching tools.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Cellulose, waste paper or secondary cotton cut is ground in a
        watery solution (5% dry substance) until a pudding-like
        micro-cellulose fiber pulp results. This pulp is pumped into a
        permeable form containing a drying mandrel, and is briefly
        drained of water. Following the drying on the mandrel, the blank
        with approximately 80% dry substance is given its final form in
        a metal mold.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Hemp straw or waste paper is ground in a watery solution (7% dry
        substance) until a microfiber pulp results. This pulp is formed
        into a thick board and-if necessary after prior drainage-is
        foamed by introducing gas. A thin layer of non-foamed microfiber
        pulp is subsequently applied to the top and bottom of the board
        and the molded piece, which is clamped between air-permeable
        grids to retain the stability of the form, or is held in shape
        in a drying tunnel through rolling, is then dried at 40-90[deg.]
        C. The resulting multilayer board is light-weight, has good
        insulating properties, but at the same time is also firm and has
        hard surfaces.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        50% hemp fiber, 48% hemp cellulose &amp; 2% earth pigment are
        ground in a watery solution (8% dry substance) until a
        pudding-like fiber pulp results. This pulp is then reinforced
        with layers of hemp fiber (fiber length: 1.0 cm-30.0 cm; 10%
        total dry substance) and is applied to a ball-shaped paraffin
        form. Following the drying and hardening, the formed part is
        opened by drilling and the paraffin is subsequently melted and
        removed through heating. Hollow balls or similar molded parts
        with high strength can be produced in this way.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Hemp straw or hemp shavings are shortened to be usable for
        processing. Subsequently, [1/3] of the plant material mass is
        subjected to high processing, [1/3] to moderate processing,
        [1/3] is simply slightly defibered and all shares are
        subsequently mixed together homogeneously. The first third forms
        the "adhesive matrix," the second third an "interlinking and
        drainage felt," and the third one serves as "blocking and filler
        material" as well as reinforcement. By increasing the highly
        processed shares, the material becomes more wood-like, firmer
        and denser, by reducing the degree of processing or the highly
        processed shares, the material becomes light-weight and heat as
        well as sound damping. All types of boards as well as blanks and
        molded parts, housings, packagings, etc. can be produced from
        this fiber pulp.<br>
        <br>
        The variant with shavings contains hardly any long-fiber shares.
        If reinforcing is necessary, these can be added at a percentage
        share that is not too high.<br>

        A cellulosic composition comprising fibres having a length
        weighted average fibre length ("LWAFL") of 0.25 to 0.40 mm.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0001] The disclosure relates to cellulosic compositions that
        are useful as structural building components for objects
        including, but not limited to, buildings, furniture, car parts,
        coffins, cabinets &amp; cases, electronic housing, structural
        building pillars, beams, boards, sheets, veneers, chairs,
        musical instruments, and toys.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
        <br>
        [0002] Large amounts of waste generated in the pulp and paper
        processing industry are typically disposed to landfill. Disposal
        to landfill, however, is becoming increasingly problematic due
        to the environmental constraints associated with land
        availability and land/soil contamination. As such, there is
        significant pressure to reduce the amount of waste disposed to
        landfill, one means of reduction being recycling.<br>
        <br>
        [0003] Recycling of paper and textile materials requires the
        breakdown of such materials into fibres or fibre-like material
        which may then be reformed into material to provide paper and
        paper-like products. As an alternative to reforming into
        material to provide paper and paper-like products, a recycling
        process has previously been developed for producing moulded
        pieces out of cellulose fibres in which the specific gravity of
        the moulded pieces approaches that of pure cellulose, 1.5. The
        process involves finely chopping and grinding cellulose fibres
        in the presence of water into micro-fibres prior to forming a
        fibre-water mixture in which the cellulose fibre content is
        about 1-15% by weight. The process subsequently involves shaping
        and drying the mixture of cellulose fibres and water into the
        moulded pieces. Details of the process and the moulded pieces
        produced by the process are set out in <b>U.S. Pat. No.

        <br>
        [0004] Efforts have continued in the production of cellulosic
        based compositions derived from pulp and paper processing waste
        and plant fibres which have high load bearing capacities and the
        ability for use as structural components.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
        <br>
        [0005] The disclosure provides a cellulosic composition
        comprising fibres having a length weighted average fibre length
        (“LWAFL”) of 0.25 to 0.40 mm.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] Preferably, 0.28 to 0.38 mm.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The disclosure also provides a cellulosic composition
        comprising, by weight:<br>
        (a) 15% to 25% fibres of a length weighted average fibre length
        of 0.001 mm to 0.2 mm;<br>
        (b) 40% to 60% fibres of a length weighted average fibre length
        of 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm;<br>
        (c) 8% to 35% fibres of a length weighted average fibre length
        of 0.5 mm to 1.2 and<br>
        (d) less than 3% fibres of a length weighted average fibre
        length of 1.2 mm to 2.0 mm.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] The length weighted average fibre length (“LWAFL”)
        provides a measure of the average length of the fibres in a
        sample of fibres which is weighted by the length of the
        individual fibres. The LWAFL gives emphasis to the longer fibers
        in the sample and imparts less emphasis to the shorter fibers
        and fines. The LWFAFL is sometimes referred to as just the
        weighted average fibre length or “WAFL”. The LWAFL can be
        compared to other measures of the average length of the fibres
        in a sample such as the arithmetic or numerical average (AFL)
        and the weight weighted average fiber length (WWAFL). These
        averages are obtained through the following calculations:<br>
        <br>
        [mathematical formula][mathematical formula][mathematical
        formula]<br>
        <br>
        where<br>
        x=bin #<br>
        l=bin median length<br>
        n=bin fiber count<br>
        N=total number of fibers counted<br>
        <br>
        [0017] Preferably, the composition has a Water Retention Value
        (WRV) of 600% to 2000%, more preferably, 700% to 1300%.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] The water retention value (WRV) is defined as the amount
        of water that participates in the swelling of the fibrous
        material and that which is not released under the application of
        a centrifugal force. The WRV is also highly correlated to the
        bonding ability of kraft fibers. The test to determine the WRV
        is carried out by placing a pad of moist fibers in a centrifuge
        tube that has a fritted glass filter at its base. The centrifuge
        is accelerated at 3000 g for 15 minutes to remove water from the
        outside surfaces and lumens of the fiber. The remaining water is
        believed to be associated with submicroscopic pores within the
        cell wall. The centrifuged fibers are weighed, dried at 105° C.,
        and then reweighed. The WRV can then be calculated from the
        ratio of the water mass to the dry mass. The apparatus used to
        measure the WRV is shown schematically in FIG. 1.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] In an embodiment, the composition comprises, by weight:<br>
        (a) 15% to 25% fibres of a length weighted average fibre length
        of 0.001 mm to 0.2 mm;<br>
        (b) 45% to 55% fibres of an a length weighted average fibre
        length of 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm;<br>
        (c) 20% to about 30% fibres of a length weighted average fibre
        length of 0.5 mm to 1.2 mm and<br>
        (d) less than 1% fibres of a length weighted average fibre
        length of 1.2 mm to 2.0 mm.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] The cellulosic composition may be in a wet or dry state.<br>
        <br>
        [0025] In an embodiment, the cellulosic composition are dried in
        the form of pellets, granules or powders. In the dry state, the
        cellulosic composition may be conveniently stored and
        transported.<br>
        <br>
        [0026] The dry pellets, granules or powders may be mixed with
        water to form mouldable, fine pulps that may be dried to create
        materials for use as structural components.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] The mouldable, fine pulps may be moulded using any
        suitable method including, but not limited to, spray molding,
        injection molding, extrusion or three stage molding. The moulded
        or green articles may be subsequently dried to form a product<br>
        <br>
        [0028] The density of the product produced from a composition
        according to the disclosure may be from 0.5 g/cm3 to 1.5 g/cm3.
        The tensile modulus of the product may be from 3500 MPa to 10800
        MPa and the tensile strength may be from 27 MPa to 115 MPa.<br>
        <br>
        [0029] Whilst functional additives (such as dyes and pigments
        for colouring, resins and waxes for waterproofing, lime, fire
        retardants including natron silicate, glues, metal powders and
        graphites for electrical conductivity, latex for flex and
        waterproofing, fillers and very long fibres of 1.5-6.0 mm in
        length for increased tensile strength) may be added to the pulp
        of dry cellulosic powders/granules/pellets mixed with water,
        there is no need for the addition of any functional additives or
        the application of pressure to dry and harden the pulp.<br>
        <br>
        [0030] In an embodiment, the composition may be prepared by any
        one or combination of processing methods including, but not
        limited to, ultra friction grinding, high pressure homogenizing,
        cryo grinding, extrusion, steam explosion, ultra sonic
        treatment, enzyme-fibre separation, high consistency/medium
        consistency/low consistency refining, chemical treatment or
        whitewater fines recovery.<br>
        <br>
        [0031] Components of the composition may be prepared separately
        and mixed together. In an embodiment, two or more intermediary
        compositions with different fibre length distributions may be
        prepared and mixed in the required proportions to form the
        compositions defined above.<br>
        <br>
        [0032] Various raw materials may be used in the preparation of
        the compositions as described herein, including, but not limited
        to, short/ultra short cellulose fibres/fines recovered from
        waste streams, for example, recovered paper, recovered fines in
        whitewater from paper &amp; pulp processing and recovered cotton
        fibers. Additional raw materials may also include any cellulosic
        fibers used in pulp &amp; paper processing and various plant
        fibers having a high cellulosic content, for example, hemp,
        flax, cotton, abaca, sisal and jute.<br>

          <br>
        </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
        <br>
        [0039] Embodiments provide cellulosic composition made up of
        fibres having different specific lengths, a high degree of
        fibrillation and a high water retention capacity. These
        composition may be subsequently moulded and dried to produce
        finished wood-like or horn-like articles of high strength and
        which therefore can be used as load bearing products.<br>
        <br>
        [0040] The composition comprise fibres having a length weighted
        average fibre length (“LWAFL”) of 0.25 to 0.40 mm, preferably
        0.28 to 0.38 mm. The fibre lengths in the composition are
        distributed in a skewed bell curve, with the composition
        comprising, by weight:<br>
        (a) 15% to 25% fibres of a length weighted average fibre length
        of 0.001 mm to 0.2 mm;<br>
        (b) 40% to 60% (preferably 45% to 55%) fibres of a length
        weighted average fibre length of 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm;<br>
        (c) 8% to 35% (preferably 20% to 30%) fibres of a length
        weighted average fibre length of 0.5 mm to 1.2 and<br>
        (d) less than 3% (preferably less than 1%) fibres of a length
        weighted average fibre length of 1.2 mm to 2.0 mm.<br>
        <br>
        [0045] Thus the composition consists of a significant amount of
        fines (fibre length &lt;0.2 mm) mixed with short length fibres
        (fibre length of 0.2-1.2 mm).<br>
        <br>
        [0046] Additionally, the composition has a high degree of
        fibrillation indicated by a high Water Retention Value (WRV) of
        600-2000%, preferably, 700-1300%.<br>
        <br>
        [0047] The composition is prepared by any one or combination of
        processing methods including, but not limited to, ultra friction
        grinding, high pressure homogenizing, cryo grinding, extrusion,
        steam explosion, ultra sonic treatment, enzyme-fibre separation,
        high consistency/medium consistency/low consistency refining,
        chemical treatment or whitewater fines recovery.<br>
        <br>
        [0048] Components of the composition may be prepared separately
        and mixed together. In some embodiments, two or more
        intermediary compositions with different fibre length
        distributions are prepared and mixed in the required proportions
        to form the composition.<br>
        <br>
        [0049] Various raw materials may be used in the preparation of
        the composition, including, but not limited to, short/ultra
        short cellulose fibres/fines recovered from waste streams, for
        example, recovered paper, recovered fines in whitewater from
        paper &amp; pulp processing and recovered cotton fibers.
        Additional raw materials may also include any cellulosic fibers
        used in pulp &amp; paper processing and various plant fibers
        having a high cellulosic content, for example, hemp, flax,
        cotton, abaca, sisal and jute.<br>
        <br>
        [0050] The composition may be dried for transport and/or storage
        in the form of pellets, granules or powders. From these forms,
        the compositions may be re-wetted to form moldable, fine pulps.
        Alternatively, the compositions may be prepared as a pulp and
        used directly in a molding process. The compositions as a pulp
        may be moulded by any moulding operations known to persons
        skilled in the art, for example, spray molding, injection
        molding, extrusion or three stage molding. The moulded or green
        articles may be subsequently dried to form a product.<br>
        <br>
        [0051] Advantageously, the composition can be used to create a
        material with appropriate hardness, strength and ductility to be
        used as a structural material yet remains (as a wet pulp)
        capable of being readily handled during processing and
        manufacture of articles from the composition, including very
        large articles. Furthermore, the composition does not require
        excessive energy to produce and is therefore economically
        viable.<br>
        <br>
        [0052] Accordingly when molded and dried, the composition can be
        used to create structural and industrial components such as
        coffins, electronic housings, structural building pillars,
        beams, boards, sheets, veneers, boxes, chairs, cabinets, cases
        and other furniture, car parts and toys.<br>
        <br>
        [0053] It will be appreciated that due to a variation in the
        compositions of the raw materials in terms of, for example,
        lignin content, ash content, OH bonding capacity and degree of
        entanglement/fibrillation, as well as the choices of fibre
        processing parameters, the physical properties of the final
        product produced from the composition will vary. For example,
        the density may vary from 0.5 to 1.5 g/cm3, the tensile modulus

        </b><b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Fibre Furnish and Degree of Fibrillation</b><br>
        <br>
        [0054] Five samples (A to E) based on waste paper, RCW80
        de-inked recovered waste paper from Amcor, and one sample (F)
        based on hemp cellulose, Hempcell B from Celesa in Spain, were
        subjected to grinding in a high consistency 22? refiner. The
        fibre (solids) content in the pulp was 16 wt % and the flow rate
        of pulp through the refiner was approximately 200 L/min. The
        specific energy (the amount of energy transferred from the
        refiner's motor to the fibre) input was for each of the Samples:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Sample A&nbsp; 1.8 kWh/kg<br>
        &nbsp; Sample B&nbsp; 1.8 kWh/k<b>g</b><br>
        &nbsp; Sample C&nbsp; 1.8 kWh/kg<br>
        &nbsp; Sample D&nbsp; 1.6 kWh/kg<br>
        &nbsp; Sample E&nbsp; 2.0 kWh/kg<br>
        &nbsp; Sample F&nbsp; 1.9 kWh/kg<br>
        <br>
        [0055] The specific edge load (the amount of energy applied
        across one meter of refiner plate's bar edge and transferred to
        the pulp in one second) was between 4-8 Ws/m at the beginning of
        the refining process and this load was gradually reduced to
        between 1-4 Ws/m by the end of the process.<br>
        <br>
        [0056] The fibres were processed until the spread of the average
        fibre length matched a known “bell curve”. From experience and
        knowing the process inputs, this occurs after a certain time
        period of processing. However, the fibres may be sampled to
        confirm that they have this distribution of fibre lengths.<br>
        <br>
        [0057] A light microscope and a Norval Wilson stain was used on
        the prepared slides containing dispersed fibre samples and
        images were taken of each sample as depicted in FIGS. 2 to 7. As
        can been seen from these Figures, a high degree of fibrillation
        is observed for the six samples and most of the fibres were
        broken or cut into very small fragments.<br>
        <br>
        Suspension Properties: Morphological Properties as Well as
        Resistance to Dehydration and Swelling Behaviour<br>
        <br>
        [0058] 0.2 g (dry weight) of each Sample A-F after the grinding
        process described above were strongly diluted by pre-suspending
        in water, stirring, and subsequently filling with water to 5000
        ml. From this suspension, 25 ml were taken (corresponding to 1.0
        mg (dry weight) fibrous material) and photographed. The
        photographs were subsequently analysed (double determination)
        using FibreLab 3.0? equipment to determine the
        fibre-morphological properties and distribution parameters for
        the separated and suspended fibres, including the fibre length.
        The results for fibre length are provided in Table 1 below.<br>

        <br>
        [0059] The results in Table 1 show that all samples (A to F)
        contain extremely shortened fibres. The arithmetic average of
        the measured fibre lengths is skewed somewhat by the presence of
        fines (&lt;0.2 mm). This can be mathematically corrected
        (reduced), by weighting the lengths and masses, i.e. by
        referring to the LFAFL or WWAFL.<br>
        <br>
        [0060] In practice the length weighted average fibre length
        (LFAFL) is typically used for the comparison of fibrous
        materials with one another. From the values of the LFAFL for all
        Samples in Table 1, it can be seen that similar values are
        obtained for all Samples based on wastepaper (A to E) with a
        slightly shorter value for the Sample based on hemp cellulose
        (F).<br>
        <br>
        [0061] The results shown in Table 2 below are an evaluation of
        the distribution of fibre lengths within certain length ranges.
        The majority of fibres of all six Samples (A to F) after
        processing are 0.2-0.5 mm, which is considered to be the short
        fibre or fibre fragment range. This is also shown graphically in
        FIGS. 8-13. Each of these Figures (for respective samples)
        contains two graphs. The top graph in each of FIGS. 8-13 shows
        the distribution of fibres having lengths of &lt;0.06 mm whilst
        the lower graph in each of these Figures shows the distribution
        of fibres having lengths of &gt;0.1 mm.<br>

        The fines content of the ground samples were investigated
        further by determining the fraction of the fines (fibres &lt;0.2
        mm) in each Sample based on the arithmetic average fibre length
        (AFL). This fraction for each Sample is compared to the length
        weighted fraction of fines (as per Table 2) is shown in Table 3
        below. As can be seen from Table 3, the fines content of all
        Samples (A to F) is very high. The hemp cellulose Sample F,
        notably contained markedly more fine material than the
        wastepaper samples (A to E).<br>

        [0062] Further measurements of the diameter, wall thickness and
        calculated (curvature) parameters using the Fibrelab equipment
        show that samples A to E derived from wastepaper have similar
        values whereas sample F derived from hemp cellulose has smaller
        fibre dimensions and a smaller curvature. This result
        corresponds with the fibre lengths determined as well as with
        the fibre fragments present.<br>

        Determination of the Water Retention Capacity (WRC) According to
        Zellcheming Fact Sheet IV/33/57<br>
        <br>
        [0063] All Samples A to F (after grinding described above) were
        homogenised by mixing prior to sampling for determination of
        their Water Retention Capacity (WRC).<br>
        <br>
        [0064] The Samples of fibrous material were dehydrated (to a
        solids content of approximately 25 wt %) on a G2 frit in the
        absence of a vacuum and transferred to a swell tube (according
        to DIN 53814). The swell tube was filled to approximately
        two-thirds capacity (resulting in a solids content of
        approximately 0.150 wt %). The swell tube was sealed with a plug
        and subjected to a centrifugal force of 3000 g for 15 minutes.
        Six parallel determinations were performed.<br>
        <br>
        [0065] The water not participating in the swelling of the fibres
        was removed from the fibrous material by the centrifugation. The
        swelling water and the water retention capacity were
        gravimetrically determined by drying the fibrous material at
        105° C. until a constant mass solids content was achieved. The
        results are shown in Table 5.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TABLE 5</b><br>
        Water Retention Capacity<br>

        tion Capacity<br>
        <br>
        The values of the water retention capacity are extremely high
        and atypical particularly compared to commercially available,
        strongly ground celluloses. The higher WRC generally equates to
        a denser material which when moulded and dried into a final
        product results in a product which has a lower tear or tensile
        strength but a higher load bearing capacity and Young's modulus.
        A preferred range for Water Retention Capacity is generally
        between 700 and 1200% as above this range, the low tear strength
        makes it difficult to form sheets—as was found with Sample C.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Material Properties: Physical/Strength Properties</b><br>
        <br>
        [0066] Samples A to F were ground as described above and mixed
        with water in a mixer to a solids concentration in the range
        between 0.3 and 0.4 wt % (3 to 4 g/L) as per Table 8 below.<br>

        [0067] The objective was to produce test sheets with an average
        grammage of mA of 80±2 g/m&lt;2&gt;, for use in subsequent
        strength testing according to the Rapid-Köthen method (in
        accordance with ISO 5269-2). It is noted that due to the very
        low dehydration capability of all of the Samples, the ISO 5269-2
        test specifications had to be adapted by reducing the volume of
        filling water in the cylinder and varying the period of drop and
        suction to suit the required conditions for sheet forming for
        each of Samples A to F.<br>
        <br>
        [0068] After producing the test sheets for each of the Samples,
        the test sheets were acclimatised in standard climate conditions
        (23 C.°/50% relative air humidity).<br>
        <br>
        [0069] The grammage of the acclimatised test sheets was ten
        determined according to DIN EN ISO 536. The results of the
        grammage testing are shown in Table 9.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TABLE 9</b><br>

        <br>
        [0070] Due to the characteristics of the materials it was very
        difficult to produce test sheets with uniform grammage. This was
        especially the case of sample C wherein the targeted value (80±2
        g/m&lt;2&gt;) could not be realised despite repeated
        corrections. This is due to the very high Water Retention
        Capacity (WRC) of the Samples. In order to compensate for the
        non-uniformity in grammage between the test sheets, the strength
        values have been corrected with respect to grammage.<br>
        <br>
        [0071] The test sheets were subjected to thickness and apparent
        sheet density testing, the results of which are shown in Table
        10.<br>
        <br>
        <b>TABLE 10</b><br>

        density<br>
        <br>
        [0072] By virtue of the high proportion of very short, fine
        fibres, the thickness at the grammage strived for was small and
        the density very high. This corresponds to the normal behaviour
        at high packing densities that are achieved with very short
        fibres.<br>
        <br>
        [0073] The test sheets were subjected to tensile testing
        according to DIN EN ISO 1924-2, the results of which are shown
        in Table 11 below.<br>
        <br>
        [0074] The values for breaking force, elongation, breaking
        length and Young's modulus determined from this testing are not
        corrected with respect to the grammage, but are corrected with
        respect to the breaking length (represented as the Tensile
        Index):<br>

        <br>
        [0075] From the results in Table 11, the tensile strength,
        expressed as tensile index, corresponds to that of ground
        cellulose. Whilst the tensile strength values for the Samples
        differ, there is little variation in the Young's modulus of the
        Samples which is high. The high Young's modulus of each of the
        Samples is indicative that the Samples can withstand tensile
        loads elastically for long periods of time. Without wishing to
        be bound by theory, it is expected that this is due to the high
        amount of fibrillation of the fibres and the subsequent linkages
        between the fibrillated fibres.<br>
        <br>
        [0076] The test sheets were cut into strips and subjected to
        tear resistance testing according to DIN EN 21974. The results
        are shown in Table 12. The resistance to tearing is not
        corrected according to the grammage, only according to the tear
        index.<br>
        <br>

        <br>
        [0077] The tearing strength of all samples, measured on
        “standard” celluloses, is at a very low level, i.e. the
        resistance to tear is low. This can be attributed primarily to
        very short fibres.<br>

        <b>Background</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        The applicant has previously developed a process for producing
        moulded pieces out of cellulose fibres in which the specific
        gravity of the moulded pieces approaches that of pure cellulose,
        1.5. The process involves finely chopping and grinding cellulose
        fibres in the presence of water into micro-fibres prior to
        forming a fibre-water mixture in which the cellulose fibre
        content is about 1-10% by weight. The process subsequently
        involves shaping and drying the mixture of cellulose fibres and
        water into the moulded pieces. Details of the process and the
        moulded pieces produced by the process are set out in United
        States Patent 6,379,594. It would be useful to be able to grind
        and chop the cellulose fibres into micro- fibres at one location
        and readily transport the micro- fibres to another location
        where they are used to form the moulded pieces . For example,
        one manufacturer may produce the micro-fibres for distribution
        to various other manufacturers to use in producing the moulded
        pieces at different sites. However, it is generally not
        economically viable to store or transport the cellulose
        micro-fibres when in the fibre- water mixture because: a) a wet
        mixture will biodegrade or otherwise deteriorate in storage
        unless it is treated before being stored, which is both
        difficult and costly; and b) transporting the fibre-water
        mixture requires the transportation of large volumes of water
        which has an unacceptable economic cost and environmental
        impact. Summary of the Disclosure<br>

        <b>Detailed Description of Embodiments</b><br>
        <br>
        A method of granulating cellulose fibres from a solid-liquid
        mixture of cellulose fibres and water has been developed by the
        applicant. By granulating the cellulose fibres, the fibres can
        be stored for long periods without risk of biodegradation or
        other deterioration and readily transported between a site where
        the cellulose fibres are prepared for use in forming an article
        and another site or sites where the articles are formed, without
        needing to also transport large volumes of water. Generally, the
        method involves the steps of separating the mixture into wet
        fibres and water and forming the wet fibres into a plurality of
        wet granules which are dried.<br>
        <br>
        The solid-liquid mixture to be granulated has a solids content
        of 1-30% by weight. The majority of the solids content and
        typically all of the solids content in the mixture is cellulose
        fibres, which have been ground and/or chopped into micro-fibres
        (0.01-0.5mm in length) .<br>
        <br>
        A fraction of the solids content in the mixture may be a pigment
        or other colorant .<br>
        <br>
        The solid-liquid mixture to be granulated may be prepared by any
        suitable method for refining (ie. grinding and/or chopping) the
        cellulose fibres, such as LC/HC refining, ultra friction
        grinding, high pressure homogenizing, extruding, steam
        explosion, ultra sonic treatment, enzymatic fibre separation and
        chemical treatment for example. In a particular embodiment, the
        solid-liquid mixture is prepared in accordance with the
        processes described in US 6,379,594.<br>
        <br>
        In one embodiment, the method of the present invention involves
        physically separating water out of the mixture comprising water
        and cellulose fibres by passing the mixture through a screw
        separator. The screw separator comprises a screw which rotates
        about its longitudinal axis and is located in a cage. The
        mixture enters one end of the screw separator and is passed
        through the screw separator by the rotation of the screw. As
        this occurs, water is removed from the mixture by passing
        through the cage. The dewatered mixture exits the other end of
        the screw as wet granules having a solids content of 10-50% by
        weight, preferably 20-50% by weight, more preferably 30- 40% by
        weight. The separated water may or may not be collected for
        recycling.<br>
        <br>
        The action of the screw causes the cellulose fibres to be
        curled. Advantageously, this acts against the cellulose fibres
        from binding together. This is desirable because if the
        cellulose fibres bind together they form strong interlinking
        bonds which are difficult to break without re-grinding and/or
        re-chopping, thus making it difficult to later use the granules
        by re-mixing with water and shaping to form articles. In other
        embodiments, the mixture is first separated into wet fibres and
        water by centrifuge, capillary extraction or by passing the
        mixture through a pressure filter, oscillating filter or any
        other suitable filter. After this separation step, the wet
        granules are formed from the wet fibres using a granulator.<br>
        <br>
        After the wet granules are formed, they are dried by heating the
        granules to a maximum temperature of 220&lt;0&gt;C, preferably
        to a temperature of 140&lt;0&gt;C to 160&lt;0&gt;C, to evaporate
        the remaining water. The produced granules having a specific
        gravity of 0.2-1.0, preferably 0.2-0.7, more preferably 0.2-0.4
        and a water content of approximately 6-12% by weight.<br>
        <br>
        In another variation, the method for granulating cellulose
        fibres comprises spray drying the mixture comprising water and
        cellulose fibres. Any suitable spray drying process may be
        utilised and typically involves spraying the mixture through at
        least one nozzle. The mixture has a solids content of 1-20% by
        weight when fed into the spray drier, preferably 1-6%, and is
        typically pre-heated to about 16O&lt;0&gt;C. The granules
        produced by the spray drying are a plurality of powder-like
        particles. The granules formed in the spray drying process may
        be subsequently pelletised to form larger granules (pellets)
        using any suitable pelletising process. Typically, this involves
        compacting multiple portions of the spray dried mixture in
        dies.. However, in a further variation the dried granules are
        not pelletised but are left in the form of the powder-like
        particles.<br>
        <br>
        The granules which may be in the form of pellets or powder
        produced according to the above embodiments may be packaged and
        transported as desired. They may also be used subsequently in a
        method for forming an article. This method comprises firstly
        mixing the granules with water to form a solid-liquid mixture
        comprising cellulose fibres and water. The granules may be left
        to soak in the water for a period of time, preferably for 1-12
        hours, more preferably 3-6 hours. This is to enable the
        cellulose fibres to completely distribute into the water.
        Pigments or other colorants may be added to the mixture
        comprising water and cellulose fibres.<br>
        <br>
        Once the cellulose fibres have been adequately mixed into the
        water, the solid-liquid mixture can then be shaped into the
        article and hardened by drying. Generally, the steps of shaping
        and hardening the article are carried out in accordance with the
        steps of shaping and hardening the work pieces (articles) as
        described in United States Patent US6,379,594.<br>
        <br>
        <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        In the following Examples, compositional percentages are weight
        percentages unless otherwise specified.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        A mixture of cellulose fibres and water was prepared firstly by
        dissolving Amcor RCW80 recovered wastepaper (shown in Figure 1)
        in water at 25&lt;0&gt;C under stirring conditions of 30rpm for
        10 minutes in a drum mixer (shown in Figure 2) . The cellulose
        concentration in the mixture was 15%. This mixture (pulp) was
        then refined in a HC Andritz 22" refiner (shown in Figure 3) in
        accordance with the methods described in US6379594. Refining was
        conducted for different periods of time to prepare different
        samples. Sample 1 (Sl) was prepared by refining the pulp for 30
        minutes and Sample 2 (S2) was prepared by refining the pulp for
        50 minutes. A photograph of S2 as a wet pulp is shown in Figure
        4.<br>
        <br>
        The viscosity, compositional and dimensional properties of the
        refined samples were ascertained by conventional methods and are
        set out in Table 1 below. Table 1 : Refined Sample Properties<br>
        <br>
        &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="004009369-imgf000010_0001" /&gt;<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        Sl was dewatered in a fan separator (shown in Figure 5) having a
        screen slot size of 0.1mm. The fibre content at the outlet of
        the fan separator was 36%. The stiff pulp from the outlet of the
        fan separator was then run through a fluid bed drier,
        specifically a Kason Double-Deck Circular Vibratory Fluid Bed
        Processor (shown in Figure 6) together with a second stream of
        Sl which was not dewatered (having a fibre concentration of 15%)
        . The batch running temperature during operation of the fluid
        bed drier was 160°. The granules produced by the fluid bed drier
        had a moisture content of 9% and are shown in Figure 7.<br>
        <br>
        To demonstrate the workability of the dried Sl granules, they
        were then "regenerated" (rewetted) by mixing with water in a
        high friction mixer (shown in Figure 8) at 600rpm for 60 minutes
        to produce a fibre and water mixture having a fibre content of
        15%. This mixture was then formed into a solid article in
        accordance with the processes described in US6379594. Various
        physical properties of this article produced from the
        regenerated Sl granules were compared to that of an article
        produced from the original as-formed Sl, set out in Table 2
        below. Table 2<br>
        <br>
        &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="004009369-imgf000011_0001" /&gt;<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Although the article produced from the regenerated S2 granules
        had satisfactory properties for use as a structural material, it
        was noted that the elasticity (Young Modulus) of the regenerated
        Sl granules was less than that of the as-formed Sl. Without
        wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this was due
        to insufficient mixing of the dry granules with the water in the
        high friction mixer which does not sufficiently disentangle the
        fibres from the entanglement that occurs as they are formed into
        the dry granules .<br>
        <br>
        It was also found that the specific gravity of the dried
        granules should preferably not exceed 0.4. Again without wishing
        to be bound by theory, it is believed that granules which are
        created with a high density have greater fibre entanglement and
        thus are more difficult to disentangle upon regeneration by
        mixing with water, thus making the mixing process longer and
        less, economical.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
        </b><b> </b><br>
        S2 was dewatered using a fluid press to increase the fibre
        content to 48% prior to being dried using a Gea swirl fluidizer
        (shown in Figure 9) . The air inputted to the swirl fluidizer
        had a temperature of 160&lt;0&gt;C. Dried granules of fibres
        were produced by the swirl fluidizer having a moisture content
        of 10%, and are shown in Figure 10.<br>
        <br>
        To demonstrate the workability of the dried S2 granules, they
        were then "regenerated" (rewetted) by mixing with water in a
        high friction mixer at 600rpm for 60 minutes to produce a fibre
        and water mixture having a fibre content of 15%. This mixture
        was then formed into a solid article in accordance with the
        processes described in US6379594. Various physical properties of
        this article produced from the regenerated S2 granules were
        compared to that of an article produced from the original as-
        formed S2, set out in Table 3 below.<br>
        <br>

        &lt;img class="EMIRef" id="004009369-imgf000012_0001" /&gt;<br>
        <br>
        Although the article produced from the regenerated S2 granules
        had satisfactory properties for use as a structural material, it
        was noted that the elasticity (Young Modulus) of the regenerated
        S2 granules was less than that of the as-formed S2. Without
        wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this was due
        to insufficient mixing of the dry granules with the water in the
        high friction mixer which does not sufficiently disentangle the
        fibres from the entanglement that occurs as they are formed into
        the dry granules .<br>
        <br>
        Example 4 S2 was first diluted by mixing in additional water to
        reduce the fibre content of the composition to 6% for suitable
        processing in a spray dryer. This watery composition of S2 was
        then pre-heated to 160&lt;0&gt;C prior to being spray dried by a
        Gea Mobile Mino Spray Dryer (shown in Figure 11) at a feed rate
        of 4L/hr to the nozzle and an atomization pressure of 1.6bar.
        The outlet temperature from the spray dryer was 95&lt;0&gt;C.
        Granules in the form of a dry powder (shown in Figure 12) were
        produced and were found to have a moisture content of 8%.<br>
        <br>
        To demonstrate the workability of the dried S2 powder granules,
        they were then "regenerated" (rewetted) by mixing with water in
        a high friction mixer at 600rpm for 30 minutes to produce a
        fibre and water mixture having a fibre content of 15%. This
        mixture was then formed into a solid article in accordance with
        the processes described in US6379594. The E modulus (elasticity)
        and density of this article produced from the regenerated S2
