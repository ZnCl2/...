      </div>
      <br>
      Today, 40% of the food grown goes to waste. So we challenged
      ourselves to work with nature to find a solution. The result? A
      way to use plants to keep produce fresher, longer.<br>
      <br>
      Apeel adds a layer of plant-derived protection to the surface of
      fresh produce to slow water loss and oxidation — the factors that
      cause spoilage. It sounds simple, but it took a lot of figuring
      out.<br>

      Tired of throwing away spoiled produce?<br>
      <br>
      Apeel Sciences says it has gotten to the root of the problem and
      developed a technology that can double or possibly triple the
      shelf life of many types of produce, including avocados.<br>
      <br>
      Apeel CEO James Rogers, who founded the Santa Barbara,
      California-based company in 2012, said Apeel’s plant-derived
      technology gives produce an extra “peel” that slows the rate of
      water loss and oxidation, the primary causes of spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      “We use food to preserve food,” Rogers said of the edible coating
      that's applied to produce. "You can’t see it, you can’t taste it,
      you can’t feel it, but by precisely controlling the combination of
      plant materials that we use with these formulas, we’re able to
      slow down the rate that a piece of fruit ages.”<br>

      Embodiments described herein relate generally to plant extract
      compositions and methods to isolate fatty acid esters derived from
      crosslinked polyesters. Particular embodiments are directed to
      methods of preparing compositions of fatty acid esters by treating
      crosslinked polyesters or other crosslinked networks with an acid
      and an alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Common agricultural products are susceptible to degradation
      and decomposition (i.e., spoilage) when exposed to the
      environment. Such agricultural products can include, for example,
      eggs, fruits, vegetables, produce, seeds, nuts, flowers, and/or
      whole plants (including their processed and semi-processed forms).
      Non-agricultural products (e.g., vitamins, candy, etc.) are also
      vulnerable to degradation when exposed to the ambient environment.
      The degradation of the agricultural products can occur via abiotic
      means as a result of evaporative moisture loss from an external
      surface of the agricultural products to the atmosphere and/or
      oxidation by oxygen that diffuses into the agricultural products
      from the environment and/or mechanical damage to the surface
      and/or light-induced degradation (i.e., photodegradation).
      Furthermore, biotic stressors such as, for example, bacteria,
      fungi, viruses, and/or pests can also infest and decompose the
      agricultural products.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Conventional approaches to preventing degradation,
      maintaining quality, and increasing the life of agricultural
      products include refrigeration and/or special packaging.
      Refrigeration requires capital-intensive equipment, demands
      constant energy expenditure, can cause damage or quality loss to
      the product if not carefully controlled, must be actively managed,
      and its benefits are lost upon interruption of a
      temperature-controlled supply chain. Special packaging can also
      require expensive equipment, consume packaging material, increase
      transportation costs, and require active management. Despite the
      benefits that can be afforded by refrigeration and special
      packaging, the handling and transportation of the agricultural
      products can cause surface abrasion or bruising that is
      aesthetically displeasing to the consumer and serves as points of
      ingress for bacteria and fungi. Moreover, the expenses associated
      with such approaches can add to the cost of the agricultural
      product.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The cells that form the aerial surface of most plants (such
      as higher plants) include an outer envelope or cuticle, which
      provides varying degrees of protection against water loss,
      oxidation, mechanical damage, photodegradation, and/or biotic
      stressors, depending upon the plant species and the plant organ
      (e.g., fruit, seeds, bark, flowers, leaves, stems, etc.). Cutin,
      which is a biopolyester derived from cellular lipids, forms the
      major structural component of the cuticle and serves to provide
      protection to the plant against environmental stressors (both
      abiotic and biotic). The thickness, density, as well as the
      composition of the cutin (i.e., the different types of monomers
      that form the cutin and their relative proportions) can vary by
      plant species, by plant organ within the same or different plant
      species, and by stage of plant maturity. The cutin-containing
      portion of the plant can also contain additional compounds (e.g.,
      epicuticular waxes, phenolics, antioxidants, colored compounds,
      proteins, polysaccharides, etc.). This variation in the cutin
      composition as well as the thickness and density of the cutin
      layer between plant species and/or plant organs and/or a given
      plant at different stages of maturation can lead to varying
      degrees of resistance between plant species or plant organs to
      attack by environmental stressors (i.e., water loss, oxidation,
      mechanical injury, and light) and/or biotic stressors (e.g.,
      fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] Embodiments described herein relate generally to plant
      extract compositions and methods to isolate cutin-derived
      monomers, oligomers, and/or their esters, and mixtures thereof, in
      particular for applications in agricultural coating formulations.
      Particular embodiments are directed to methods of preparing
      compositions of fatty acid esters by treating crosslinked
      polyesters or other crosslinked networks with an acid and an
      alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In a first aspect, a method of preparing a composition
      comprising fatty acid esters includes providing a crosslinked
      polyester comprising fatty acids, treating the crosslinked
      polyester with an acid and an alcohol, and removing the acid and
      the alcohol to isolate the resulting fatty acid esters.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In a second aspect, a method of preparing a composition
      comprising esters includes providing a crosslinked network
      including hydrolyzable or transesterifiable bonds, treating the
      crosslinked network with an acid and an alcohol, and removing the
      acid and the alcohol to isolate the resulting esters.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In a third aspect, a method of preparing a composition
      comprising cutin-derived monomers, oligomers, esters, or
      combinations thereof includes providing cutin obtained from plant
      matter, and treating the cutin with a solvent, thereby causing the
      cutin to decompose into the cutin-derived monomers, oligomers,
      esters, or combinations thereof. The method further includes
      removing the solvent to isolate the cutin-derived monomers,
      oligomers, esters, or combinations thereof. The resulting
      composition is characterized as being in the form of a solid
      powder with little or no coloration.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In a fourth aspect, a method of forming a protective
      coating on a substrate includes obtaining fatty acid esters,
      wherein the obtaining of the fatty acid esters comprises treating
      a crosslinked polyester comprising fatty acids with an acid and an
      alcohol, and removing the acid and alcohol to isolate the
      resulting fatty acid esters. The method further includes causing
      the fatty acid esters to be applied to a surface of the substrate
      to form the protective coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In a fifth aspect, a method of preparing a composition
      comprising cutin-derived monomers, oligomers, esters, or
      combinations thereof from cutin-containing plant matter includes
      obtaining cutin from the cutin-containing plant matter and adding
      the cutin to a solvent comprising an acid and an alcohol to form a
      first mixture. The method further includes removing the solvent to
      isolate the cutin-derived monomers, oligomers, esters, or
      combinations thereof. The resulting cutin-derived monomers,
      oligomers, esters, or combinations thereof can comprise one or
      more compounds of Formula I:<br>

      wherein R&lt;1&gt;, R&lt;2&gt;, R&lt;3&gt;, R&lt;4&gt;,
      R&lt;5&gt;, R&lt;6&gt;, R&lt;7&gt;, R&lt;8&gt;, R&lt;9&gt;,
      R&lt;10&gt;, R&lt;11&gt;, R&lt;12&gt;, m, n, and o are as
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Methods and formulations described herein can each include
      one or more of the following steps or features, either alone or in
      combination with one another. The crosslinked polyester or
      crosslinked network can be naturally occurring. The crosslinked
      polyester or crosslinked network can be derived from plant matter.
      The crosslinked polyester or crosslinked network can be cutin. The
      cutin can be derived from plant skins. Treating the crosslinked
      polyester or crosslinked network with the acid and the alcohol can
      include suspending or dissolving the crosslinked polyester or
      crosslinked network and the acid in the alcohol to form a
      solution. The acid can be a strong acid. A concentration of the
      acid in the solution can be greater than 100 μmol/L. The solution
      can further comprise a non-reactive secondary solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The crosslinked polyester or crosslinked network can
      contain endogenous water. Treating the crosslinked polyester with
      the acid and the alcohol can further comprise heating the
      crosslinked polyester, the acid, and the alcohol. Heating the
      crosslinked polyester, the acid, and the alcohol can comprise
      refluxing the polyester, the acid, and the alcohol at the boiling
      point of the alcohol. The polyester, the acid, and the alcohol can
      be heated in a sealed vessel above the boiling point of the
      alcohol. The alcohol can comprise ethanol, methanol, propanol,
      glycerol, isopropanol, or combinations thereof. The alcohol can be
      a primary or secondary alcohol. Removing the acid can comprise
      neutralizing the acid. Removing the alcohol can comprise
      evaporating the alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The acid can be sulfuric acid, triflic acid, hydrochloric
      acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, para-toluenesulfonic
      acid, or a combination thereof. The acid can be catalytic. The
      acid can be utilized in superstoichiometric amounts. A molar ratio
      of the alcohol to the fatty acids can be greater than 1. The fatty
      acids of the crosslinked polymer or crosslinked network can
      comprise 16-hydroxy hexadecanoic acid, 9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic
      acid, 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid, 18-hydroxysteric acid,
      18-hydroxy-(9Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid, 9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxy
      octadecanoic acid, 9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid, or a
      combination thereof. The resulting fatty acid esters can comprise
      ethyl 16-hydroxyhexadecanoate, ethyl 9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate,
      ethyl 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate, ethyl 18-hydroxyoctadecanoate,
      ethyl 18-hydroxy-(9Z)-octadec-9-enoate, ethyl
      9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoate, ethyl
      9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoate, or a combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The method can be characterized as only requiring a single
      step to obtain the resulting fatty acid esters from the
      crosslinked polyester or crosslinked network. The fatty acid
      esters formed by any of the methods described herein can be
      applied to the surface of a substrate to form a protective
      coating. The substrate can be an edible substrate. The substrate
      can be a piece of produce. The substrate can be plant matter.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] The biopolyester cutin forms the main structural component
      of the cuticle that composes the aerial surface of most land
      plants and plays a significant role in providing plants a
      protective barrier against both abiotic and biotic stressors. The
      thickness, density, as well as the composition of the cutin (i.e.,
      the different types of monomers that form the cutin and their
      relative proportions) can vary by plant species, by plant organ
      within the same or different plant species, and by stage of plant
      maturity. These variations can define the amount, degree, or
      quality of protection (and degree of plasticity) offered by the
      cutin layer to the plant or plant organ against environmental
      and/or biotic stressors. Cutin is formed from a mixture of
      polymerized mono- and/or polyhydroxy fatty acids and embedded
      cuticular waxes. Among the hydroxy fatty acids, polyhydroxy fatty
      acids (e.g., dihydroxy fatty acids or trihydroxy fatty acids),
      once esterified, can in some cases form tightly bound networks
      with high crosslink density and lower permeability as compared to
      monohydroxy fatty acids and can thereby provide better protection
      against environmental stressors.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Embodiments described herein relate generally to plant
      extract compositions and to methods of preparing plant extract
      compositions that include fatty acid esters (monomers and/or their
      oligomers) derived from cutin or other crosslinked polyesters. In
      particular, methods described herein allow for generation of fatty
      acid esters directly by treating a crosslinked polyester (e.g.,
      cutin) which includes a mixture of polymerized mono- and/or
      polyhydroxy fatty acids with an acid and an alcohol. Compositions
      which include the resulting fatty esters can, for example, be
      subsequently applied to other plant or agricultural products in
      order to form a protective material (e.g., a coating) over the
      products, or to enhance or modify existing coatings (either
      naturally occurring or deposited coatings) which are on the outer
      surface of the products. The applied coatings can, for example,
      serve to protect the products from biotic stressors such as
      bacteria, fungi, viruses, and/or pests. The applied coatings can
      also (or alternatively) serve to increase the shelf life of
      produce without refrigeration, and/or to control the rate of
      ripening or respiration of produce.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Conventional methods for producing fatty acid esters
      typically involve performing a first step (or series of steps) to
      isolate fatty acids (e.g., fatty acid monomers and/or oligomers)
      and then subsequently perform a second step (or series of steps)
      to convert the fatty acids to esters, for example via Fischer
      esterification. Methods described herein provide for a process for
      generating fatty acid esters directly from a polyester such as
      cutin, without the need to first isolate the fatty acid
      monomers/oligomers. Accordingly, methods of preparing a
      composition comprising fatty acid esters can include (i) providing
      a crosslinked polyester (e.g., cutin) comprising fatty acids, (ii)
      treating the polyester with an acid and an alcohol, and (iii)
      removing the acid and alcohol to isolate the resulting fatty acid
      esters. In particular embodiments described herein, the
      crosslinked polyester is cutin derived from plant matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As used herein, “plant matter” refers to any portion of a
      plant, including, for example, fruits (in the botanical sense,
      including fruit peels and juice sacs), leaves, stems, barks,
      seeds, flowers, peels, or roots.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A first method 100 for treating (e.g., depolymerizing)
      cutin to obtain a plant extract composition is illustrated in FIG.
      1. The method 100 includes first treating plant matter to at least
      partially separate a cutin-containing portion from a
      non-cutin-containing portion of the plant matter (step 102).
      Treating the plant matter can include, for example, thermal
      treating of the plant matter. The thermal treating can include,
      for example, heating the plant matter (e.g., with steam, in water
      or in another solvent), freezing the plant, subjecting the plant
      matter to cyclic thermal treatments, or drying. The plant matter
      can include any suitable plant matter or other agricultural
      product such as, for example, fruits (including fruit peels and
      juice sacs), leaves, stems, barks, seeds, flowers, peels, or
      roots. In some embodiments, the plant matter can include
      agricultural waste products such as, for example, tomato peels,
      grape skins, apple peels, pepper peels, lemon peels, lemon leaf,
      lime peels, lime leaf, orange peels, orange leaf, orange fruit,
      clementine leaf, clementine fruit, mandarin leaf, mandarin fruit,
      pea seeds, grapefruit peels, grapefruit leaf, grapefruit seeds,
      papaya peels, cherry fruits, cranberry skins, coffee cherries,
      grass clippings, or any other plants or portions of plants that
      can yield any embodiment of the plant extract compositions
      described herein. In some embodiments, the plant matter can be a
      fruit (e.g., a tomato, cranberry, or grape) and the
      cutin-containing portion can be a peel of the fruit (e.g., a
      tomato peel or cranberry skin or grape skin) such that the boiling
      can at least partially separate the peel from the fruit. The fruit
      can be washed to remove surface residue, waxes, or other debris
      before operation 102. Furthermore, the fruit can be cut into
      halves, quarters, or small pieces or ground to finer pieces and
      then boiled until the peels or skins are visibly separated from
      the fruit pulp.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The method 100 can optionally include mechanically
      processing the plant matter to at least partially separate the
      cutin-containing portion from the non-cutin-containing portion of
      the plant matter (step 104). The mechanical process can be
      performed before and/or after thermal treatment of the plant
      matter (i.e., 102) (e.g., boiling of the plant matter in water) to
      facilitate separation of the cutin-containing portion from the
      non-cutin-containing portion of the plant matter. Suitable
      mechanical processes can include, for example, centrifugation,
      (ultra)sonication, pressing, ball milling, grinding, etc. In some
      embodiments, mechanical separation can include separating a fruit
      peel from the fruit pulp. In some embodiments, mechanical removal
      of the pulp might not be performed and the fruit skins (e.g.,
      waste fruit skins left over after processing of the fruit) may be
      macerated, blended, cut, shredded, food processed, or otherwise
      subjected to some other mechanical treatment operation to
      physically break down the fruit skins into smaller or finer
      pieces. In some embodiments, a plurality of intermediate
      mechanical processes can be used to obtain the plant extract
      composition. For example, a mechanical step can be used to
      separate the cutin from the non-cutin-containing portion, as
      described herein, or be used to augment any other operation
      included in the method 100. Such mechanical processes can include
      any of the mechanical processes described herein such as, for
      example, centrifugation, sonication, (ultra)sonication, milling,
      grinding, filtration, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The cutin-containing portion is then optionally heated
      (e.g., boiled) in a mixture of ammonium oxalate and oxalic acid to
      separate the cutin from the non-cutin-containing portion (step
      106). Optionally this process can also be achieved (or assisted)
      using enzymes capable of breaking down polysaccharides or pectin.
      For example, the cutin can include the cuticular layer of the
      plant matter. The heating in the ammonium oxalate and oxalic acid
      mixture disrupts the pectinaceous glue that attaches the cuticle
      to the underlying cells of the plant matter and helps release the
      cuticle. Furthermore, this step disrupts the pectinaceous glue
      that is found within primary cell walls and between plant cells
      (e.g., in the middle lamella that binds neighboring cells), aiding
      in the isolation of a cutin-containing portion. In this manner,
      the ammonium oxalate and oxalic acid solution can facilitate at
      least partial chemical detachment of remaining debris from the
      cutin-containing portion of the plant (e.g., removal of any
      remaining pulp from the fruit peel). The heating can be performed
      at any suitable temperature (e.g., 35 degrees Celsius, 50 degrees
      Celsius, 55 degrees Celsius, 60 degrees Celsius, 65 degrees
      Celsius, 70 degrees Celsius, 75 degrees Celsius, 80 degrees
      Celsius, 85 degrees Celsius, 90 degrees Celsius, 95 degrees
      Celsius, or 100 degrees Celsius, inclusive of all ranges and
      values therebetween) and for any suitable time (this process can
      be accelerated if carried out under elevated pressure). For
      example, in some embodiments, the cutin-containing portion can be
      heated in the mixture of ammonium oxalate and oxalic acid at a
      temperature of about 75 degrees Celsius for about 24 hours. In
      some embodiments, the portion of the plant, for example, the fruit
      peel, after treatment with the ammonium oxalate and oxalic acid
      solution, can be isolated by filtration and dried (e.g., air-dried
      under ambient conditions, oven-dried or freeze-dried) to remove
      any residual water.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In some embodiments, the cutin can optionally be treated
      with an enzyme (step 108). For example, the cutin can be treated
      with an enzyme such as a carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme to digest
      or otherwise remove carbohydrates (e.g., cellulose or pectin)
      attached to or embedded within the cutin. Such enzymes can
      include, for example, naturally derived or synthetic cellulases,
      pectinases, and hemicellulases. The enzymatic degradation can be
      used before, after, or otherwise in place of step 106 to obtain
      the cutin from the non-cutin-containing portion. In some
      embodiments, the reverse process may be employed, wherein the
      cutin is treated with an enzyme that can at least partially
      depolymerize the cutin to yield any combination of cutin-derived
      oligomers and cutin-derived monomers and to leave behind the
      non-cutin-containing components, which could be filtered out or
      otherwise separated. Such enzymes can include, for example,
      cutinases, esterases, or lipases.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Optionally, the cutin is refluxed or subjected to soxhlet
      extraction in at least one suitable solvent (e.g., chloroform
      and/or methanol) to remove soluble waxes or polar impurities from
      the cutin (step 110). For example, the cutin can be refluxed or
      subjected to soxhlet extraction only in chloroform, refluxed or
      soxhlet extracted in chloroform followed by refluxing or soxhlet
      extraction in methanol, refluxed or subjected to soxhlet
      extraction only in methanol, or refluxed or subjected to soxhlet
      extraction in a mixture of chloroform and methanol, or any other
      suitable solvent(s) (or combinations thereof) in which the wax
      and/or polar components are soluble. In some embodiments, the
      cutin can be refluxed in a dilute solution of a strong base (e.g.,
      potassium hydroxide in water or in alcoholic solvent), or a
      solution of a moderately strong or weak base (e.g., potassium
      carbonate in water or in alcoholic solvent) to remove soluble
      pigmented impurities. Alternatively, removal of residual waxes and
      remaining soluble components can be achieved using supercritical
      CO2 or supercritical H2O. The refluxing can be performed at any
      suitable temperature and for any suitable length of time. For
      example, in some embodiments, the cutin can be refluxed in
      chloroform at about 60-65 degrees Celsius for about 24-36 hours to
      remove any wax and/or non-polar compounds embedded in the cutin.
      This can be followed by refluxing in methanol at 65-70 degrees
      Celsius for about 4-12 hours, for example, to remove any polar
      organic components (e.g., flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides)
      present in the cutin. The completion of the operation can be
      determined by the clarity of solvents. For example, the process
      can be monitored with instrumentation (e.g., NMR, GC-MS, React-IR,
      FTIR, spectrophotometry, etc.) configured to analyze the clarity
      of the solvents and can continue until a predetermined clarity is
      achieved. Each of the chloroform and/or methanol extraction
      processes can be performed in any apparatus capable of refluxing
      (i.e., recirculating and/or recycling) the solvents such as, for
      example, a reaction flask equipped with a condenser, a Soxhlet
      apparatus, a Kumagawa extractor, an ultrasound assisted extractor,
      a robot automated extractor, or any other suitable extraction
      apparatus. Such an apparatus can, for example, reduce the amount
      of solvent used in the extraction process. Any other solvent or
      combinations thereof (i.e., a binary or ternary mixture) can be
      used to wash out undesired impurities. Suitable solvents can
      include, for example, diethyl ether, dichloromethane, hexane,
      petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, isopropanol, ethanol,
      acetonitrile, supercritical carbon dioxide, supercritical water,
      water, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, multiple
      extraction steps in one or more solvents can also be performed. In
      some embodiments, intermediate enzymatic treatment steps can also
      be performed between the solvent extraction processes, for
      example, to liberate undesired compounds from the cutin. The
      solution obtained after operation 110 can include a relatively
      pure sample of the cutin included in the portion of the plant
      along with any residually attached or embedded polysaccharides
      (e.g., cellulose), plant metabolites (e.g., flavonoids), and/or
      proteins.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The cutin is then heated in a base solution (e.g., metal
      alkoxide or metal hydroxide dissolved in a solvent such as ethanol
      or methanol or water or combinations thereof) to at least
      partially depolymerize the cutin and obtain a plant extract
      including a plurality of cutin-derived monomers, oligomers, or
      combinations thereof (step 112). The pH of the solution can, for
      example, be in a range of about 10 to 14, for example in a range
      of 12 to 14. The metal alkoxide can include, for example, sodium
      methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium iso-propoxide, sodium
      n-propoxide, sodium iso-butoxide, sodium n-butoxide, potassium
      methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium iso-propoxide, potassium
      n-propoxide, potassium iso-butoxide, or potassium n-butoxide. The
      metal hydroxide can include, for example, Group I or Group II
      metal hydroxides, such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium,
      rubidium, or cesium hydroxide. Also included are precursors or
      compounds that will generate alkoxide or hydroxide in a suitable
      reaction medium (such as neat metals (e.g., sodium metal) or
      oxides in methanol, or ammonia in water). Refluxing of the cutin
      in the presence of the metal alkoxide or metal hydroxide can be
      performed at any suitable temperature and for any suitable length
      of time such as, for example, at about 65 degrees Celsius for
      about 24 hours. In some embodiments, the temperature and/or the
      refluxing time can be such that the cutin is only partially
      depolymerized to yield a predetermined combination of oligomers
      and monomers. In some embodiments, the temperature and/or the
      refluxing time can be adjusted such that the cutin is mostly
      depolymerized by the metal alkoxide or metal hydroxide into a
      plurality of cutin-derived monomers and/or oligomers. In some
      embodiments, the refluxing in the metal alkoxide or metal
      hydroxide can be performed in a mixture of the metal alkoxide or
      metal hydroxide and a solvent, for example, methanol, ethanol,
      hexane, toluene, etc. In some embodiments, the solvent can include
      methanol. The concentration of metal alkoxide, solvent, and/or the
      pH of the solution can, for example, facilitate the preservation
      of the depolymerized cutin components in monomeric form, which can
      prevent oligomerization or repolymerization of the liberated cutin
      monomers included in the plant extract. Although an acid catalyst
      for the reaction (utilizing methods further described below) could
      be used in place of the base catalyst, base catalysts are commonly
      used for transesterification of oils, as in many cases the
      reaction rate can be higher than that for an acid catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In efforts to obtain fatty acid ester products (or
      oligomers thereof) from the depolymerization step 112 of method
      100, the refluxing of the cutin in the presence of the metal
      alkoxide was carried out by the inventors of the present
      disclosure in anhydrous reagents and anhydrous solvents (e.g.,
      ethanol) in a closed, nitrogenous atmosphere. Specifically, cutin
      obtained from tomato pomace was refluxed in a solution comprising
      sodium ethoxide (prepared by dissolving sodium in ethanol)
      according to the process described in Example 2 below in order to
      favor ester formation over saponification and acid formation. The
      expected reaction is schematically represented in FIG. 2A for the
      case of an anhydrous solution comprising sodium ethoxide dissolved
      in ethanol. Referring to FIG. 2A, cutin 202 is represented by a
      crosslinked network of polyhydroxy fatty acids, where R and R′
      represent adjacent fatty acid units. Depolymerization of the cutin
      202 by the sodium ethoxide present in the EtOH in the absence of
      water is expected to form isolated ethyl esters 204, as shown in
      FIG. 2A.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 2B is a schematic representation of the
      depolymerization reaction for the case where water is present in
      the solution. In this case, the reaction produces both ethyl
      esters 204 and carboxylic acid 206. As further shown in FIG. 2B,
      the base in the solution causes the carboxylic acid 206 to be
      converted to carboxylate 208. If enough water is present in the
      solution, substantially all of the depolymerized product is driven
      to the carboxylic acid 206 and then converted to the carboxylate
      208 by the base in the solution, such that no measurable
      concentration of ethyl esters 204 is present in the resulting
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors of the
      current disclosure observed that despite extensive drying and/or
      other efforts to ensure that no water was present in the reaction
      during cutin depolymerization according to Example 2, the
      apparently dry cutin appeared to contain sufficient endogenous
      water to result in all of the depolymerized product being shunted
      to the carboxylate 208. Consequently, no substantial concentration
      of esters 204 could be detected in the resulting extract
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A second method 300 for depolymerizing cutin to obtain a
      plant extract composition is illustrated in FIG. 3. Steps 302,
      304, 306, 308, and 310, in which cutin is obtained from plant
      matter, are the same as steps 102, 104, 106, 108, and 110,
      respectively, of method 100 in FIG. 1. However, in step 312 of
      method 300, the cutin is refluxed in an acid and an alcohol
      (rather than a base and an alcohol as in step 112 of method 100)
      in order to obtain a plant extract composition including
      cutin-derived monomers and/or oligomers.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The specific reaction associated with the second method
      300, and specifically with step 312, is schematically represented
      in FIG. 4 for the case of a solution comprising an acid dissolved
      in ethanol. The reaction in FIG. 4 assumes the presence of water
      in the solution (e.g., endogenous water contained within the
      cutin). Similar to FIG. 2, in FIG. 4 cutin 202 is represented by a
      crosslinked network of polyhydroxy fatty acids, where R and R′
      represent adjacent fatty acid units. Depolymerization of the cutin
      202 in the acidified solution in the presence of water is expected
      to form ethyl esters 204 and carboxylic acid 206 in a state of
      equilibrium with one another, thus producing a plant extract
      composition including fatty acid esters (e.g., ethyl esters 204).
      In step 312 of method 300, due to the absence of a base catalyst,
      the carboxylic acid 206 is not converted to a carboxylate, as in
      method 100 and corresponding FIG. 2B. Consequently, the reaction
      is expected to produce a composition comprising a mix of ethyl
      esters 204 and carboxylic acid 206, where the product distribution
      approximately reflects the ratio of esterification partner to
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In efforts to obtain a composition including fatty acid
      esters (or oligomers thereof) by way of method 300 (and in
      particular by utilizing step 312 of method 300), the inventors of
      the subject matter in the current application refluxed cutin
      obtained from tomato pomace in a solution comprising sulfuric acid
      dissolved in ethanol according to the process described in Example
      3 below. Results are illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6. As shown in
      Example 3 and FIGS. 5 and 6, the process resulted in the
      production and isolation of ethyl 10,16-dihydroxyhexdecanoate
      (herein “EtDHPA”).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] It was found through extensive experimentation that a
      larger amount of acid than predicted from catalytic calculations
      was needed to ensure high yields of products. For instance, under
      refluxing conditions, an increase in both crude isolate and
      purified isolate was seen when increasing the equivalence of
      sulfuric acid used from 0.1 to 0.25 to 0.5 to 1 to 2 equivalents,
      from negligible material to 8.1% isolated yield, over the course
      of 48 hours. Furthermore, the reaction could additionally be
      accelerated by sealing the system to generate pressure, such that
      the reaction could be conducted above the atmospheric boiling
      point of the solvent (see Example 4). A further increase in crude
      isolate and purified isolate yields was seen when the temperature
      was increased from reflux (78° C.) to 100° C. to 120° C., with one
      equivalent of acid, up to 14% isolated yield. However, without
      wishing to be bound by theory, there appears to be an upper limit,
      after which the isolated yield appears to decrease, as seen in
      FIGS. 5 and 6 (120° C., 2 eq. H2SO4, 48 hrs).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] While EtDHPA 204 (in FIG. 4) can be produced by method 300
      of FIG. 3 with ethanol utilized as the alcohol and with a cutin
      source (or other crosslinked polymer) that includes
      10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid (or esters thereof) as a building
      block of the crosslinked network, other types of ethyl esters can
      be produced by method 300 using cutin from plant sources (or other
      crosslinked polymers/networks) that are formed of different
      molecular building blocks. For example, cutin from tomatoes tends
      to have a high proportion of C16 fatty acids (e.g., fatty acids
      having a carbon chain length of 16) such as that of FIGS. 7A, 7C,
      7E, and 7G, where FIG. 7A shows the chemical composition of
      10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid (700 in FIG. 7A), FIG. 7C shows
      the chemical composition of 9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoic acid (704
      in FIG. 7C), FIG. 7E shows the chemical composition of
      9,10,16-trihydroxyhexadecanoic acid (708 in FIG. 7E), and FIG. 7G
      shows the chemical composition of
      9,10-epoxy-16-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (712 in FIG. 7G).
      Accordingly, ethyl esters that can be produced by method 300 using
      cutin from tomatoes can include ethyl 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate
      (800 in FIG. 8A), ethyl 9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (804 in FIG.
      8C), ethyl 9,10,16-trihydroxyhexadecanoate (808 in FIG. 8E),
      and/or ethyl 9,10-epoxy-16-hydroxyhexadecanoate (812 in FIG. 8G).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] On the other hand, cutin from cranberries tends to have a
      high proportion of Cis fatty acids (e.g., fatty acids having a
      carbon chain length of 18) such as that of FIGS. 7B, 7D, 7F, and
      7H, where FIG. 7B shows the chemical composition of
      10,18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (702 in FIG. 7B), FIG. 7D shows
      the chemical composition of 9,18-dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (706
      in FIG. 7D), FIG. 7F shows the chemical composition of
      9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (710 in FIG. 7F), and FIG. 7H
      shows the chemical composition of
      9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (714 in FIG. 7H).
      Accordingly, ethyl esters that can be produced by method 300 using
      cutin from cranberries can include ethyl
      10,18-dihydroxyoctadecanoate (802 in FIG. 8B), ethyl
      9,18-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (806 in FIG. 8D), ethyl
      9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoate (810 in FIG. 8F), and/or ethyl
      9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoate (814 in FIG. 8H).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Furthermore, alcohols other than (or in addition to)
      ethanol can be used in the method 300 of FIG. 3, which can result
      in other types of esters being produced. For example, using
      methanol as the alcohol can result in the production of methyl
      esters such as methyl 10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (900 in FIG.
      9A), methyl 10,18-dihydroxyoctadecanoate (902 in FIG. 9B), methyl
      9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (904 in FIG. 9C), methyl
      9,18-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (906 in FIG. 9D), methyl
      9,10,16-trihydroxyhexadecanoate (908 in FIG. 9E), methyl
      9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoate (910 in FIG. 9F), methyl
      9,10-epoxy-16-hydroxyhexadecanoate (912 in FIG. 9G), and/or methyl
      9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoate (914 in FIG. 9H). Or, using
      glycerol as the alcohol can result in the production of glyceryl
      esters (e.g., 1-glyceryl or 2-glyceryl esters). For example,
      1-glyceryl esters that can be produced include 2,3-dihydroxypropyl
      10,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (1000 in FIG. 10A),
      2,3-dihydroxypropyl 10,18-dihydroxyoctadecanoate (1002 in FIG.
      10B), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl 9,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (1004 in
      FIG. 10C), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl 9,18-dihydroxyhexadecanoate (1006
      in FIG. 10D), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl 9,10,16-trihydroxyhexadecanoate
      (1008 in FIG. 10E), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl
      9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadecanoate (1010 in FIG. 10F),
      2,3-dihydroxypropyl 9,10-epoxy-16-hydroxyhexadecanoate (1012 in
      FIG. 10G), and/or 2,3-dihydroxypropyl
      9,10-epoxy-18-hydroxyoctadecanoate (1014 in FIG. 10H). 2-glyceryl

      heteroaryl.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In some implementations, R is selected from —H, —CH3, or
      —CH2CH3. The method 300 described herein can be used to produce
      one or more of the following methyl ester compounds:<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The method 300 described herein can also be used to produce
      one or more of the following ethyl ester compounds:<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The method 300 described herein can also be used to produce
      one or more of the following 2-glyceryl ester compounds:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The method 300 described herein can also be used to produce
      one or more of the following 1-glyceryl ester compounds:<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In some embodiments, the acid included in the solution used
      to depolymerize the crosslinked polyester is a strong acid. As
      used herein, a “strong acid” is one for which substantially all of
      the acid ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is
      sufficient solvent). A strong acid has a pKa&lt;−1.74.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In some embodiments, the polyester, the acid, and the
      alcohol are heated in a sealed vessel above the atmospheric
      boiling point of the alcohol. This sealed vessel can allow higher
      temperatures to be reached, which can allow for shorter reaction
      times and/or less acid needed to obtain the product.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The fatty acid esters obtained by way of method 300 can be
      used in a variety of applications. For example, they can be
      applied directly to a plant or other agricultural product to form
      a protective coating, as further described below. Or, the esters
      may serve as starting material for further chemical
      transformations, for example for the production of free fatty
      acids. Although free fatty acids can be extracted from crosslinked
      polymers such as cutin using other methods (e.g., using method 100
      of FIG. 1), forming free fatty acids via transesterification of
      esters obtained by way of method 300 can result in more highly
      purified product. For example, when methods 100 and 300 are each
      used to depolymerize cutin, the resulting crude extract in both
      cases is an oil. However, purification of the extract obtained by
      method 300 results in product which is a solid powder with little
      or substantially no coloration, and when dissolved in a solvent
      produces a solution with a low viscosity. On the other hand,
      purification of the extract obtained by method 100 results in
      product which remains oily with substantial coloration, and when
      dissolved in a solvent produces a solution with a substantially
      higher viscosity.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In some embodiments, the plant extract composition can be
      applied directly to a portion of a plant, e.g., to form a
      protective coating on the plant. In some embodiments, the plant
      extract composition can be heated to modify the physical and/or
      chemical properties of the composition prior to and/or during
      and/or after the application process. In some embodiments, the
      plant extract composition can be dissolved and/or suspended in a
      solvent, in aqueous solutions, or in a carrier liquid to form the
      coating. The solvent can include any polar, non-polar, protic, or
      aprotic solvents, including any combinations thereof. Examples of
      solvents that can be used to dissolve the plant extract
      compositions described herein include water, methanol, ethanol,
      isopropanol, butanol, acetone, ethyl acetate, chloroform,
      acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl
      ether, any other suitable solvent or a combination thereof.
      Aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions of such plant extract
      compositions can be suitable for coating on agricultural products,
      for example, forming a coating on the agricultural product. For
      example, the aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions can be
      applied to the surface of the agricultural product, after which
      the solvent can be removed (e.g., by evaporation or convective
      drying), leaving a protective coating formed from the plant
      extract composition on the surface of the agricultural product.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In some embodiments, the coatings can be configured to
      change the surface energy of the agricultural product. Various
      properties of coatings described herein can be adjusted by tuning
      the crosslink density of the coating, its thickness, or its
      composition. This can, for example, be used to control the
      ripening of postharvest fruit or produce. For example, coatings
      formed of plant extract compositions that primarily include
      bifunctional or polyfunctional cutin monomer units can, for
      example, have higher crosslink densities than those that include
      monofunctional cutin monomer units. Thus, plant extract
      composition coatings formed from bifunctional or polyfunctional
      cutin monomer units can in some cases result in slower rates of
      ripening as compared to coatings formed from monofunctional
      monomer units.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In some embodiments, an acid or a base can be added to the
      coating formulation to achieve a desired pH suitable for coating
      the agricultural product with the plant extract composition
      coating. In some embodiments, additives such as, for example,
      surfactants, emulsifiers, thickening agents, nonionic polymers,
      waxes, or salts can be included in the coating formulation. In
      some embodiments, weak acids, ions, or non-reactive molecules can
      be included in the coating formulation to control or adjust the
      properties of the resulting films or coatings. In some
      embodiments, pH stabilizers or modifiers can also be included in
      the coating formulation. In some embodiments, the coating
      formulation can include additional materials that are also
      transported to the surface with the coating, or are deposited
      separately and are subsequently encapsulated by the coating (e.g.,
      the coating is formed at least partially around the additional
      material), or are deposited separately and are subsequently
      supported by the coating (e.g., the additional material is
      anchored to the external surface of the coating). Examples of such
      additional materials can include cells, biological signaling
      molecules, vitamins, minerals, pigments, aromas, enzymes,
      catalysts, antifungals, antimicrobials, and/or time-released
      drugs. The additional materials can be non-reactive with surface
      of the agricultural product and/or coating, or alternatively can
      be reactive with the surface and/or coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In some embodiments, the coating can include an additive
      configured, for example, to modify the viscosity, vapor pressure,
      surface tension, or solubility of the coating. In some
      embodiments, the additive can be configured to increase the
      chemical stability of the coating. For example, the additive can
      be an antioxidant configured to inhibit oxidation of the coating.
      In some embodiments the additive can be added to reduce or
      increase the melting temperature or the glass-transition
      temperature of the coating. In some embodiments, the additive can
      be configured to reduce the diffusivity of water vapor, oxygen,
      CO2, or ethylene through the coating or enable the coating to
      absorb more ultra violet (UV) light, for example to protect the
      agricultural product (e.g., any of the products described herein).
      In some embodiments, the additive can be configured to provide an
      intentional odor, for example a fragrance (e.g., smell of flowers,
      fruits, plants, freshness, scents, etc.). In some embodiments, the
      additive can be configured to provide color and can include, for
      example, a dye or a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
      color additive. In some embodiments, the additives can include
      sweeteners, color additives, flavors, spices, flavor enhancers,
      fat replacers, and components of formulations used to replace
      fats, nutrients, emulsifiers, bulking agents, cleansing agents,
      stabilizers, emulsion stabilizers, thickeners, flavor or
      fragrance, an ingredient of a flavor or fragrance, binders,
      texturizers, humectants, pH control agents, acidulants, leavening
      agents, anti-caking agents, antifungal agents, antimicrobial
      agents, antioxidants, and/or UV filters. In some embodiments, the
      coating can include a photoinitiator, which can initiate
      crosslinking of the coating on exposure to an appropriate light
      source, for example, UV light.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In some embodiments, any of the plant extract composition
      coatings described herein can be flavorless or have high flavor
      thresholds, e.g. above 500 ppm, and can be odorless or have a high
      odor threshold. In some embodiments, the materials included in any
      of the coatings described herein can be substantially transparent.
      For example, the plant extract composition, the solvent, and/or
      any other additives included in the coating can be selected so
      that they have substantially the same or similar indices of
      refraction. By matching their indices of refraction, they may be
      optically matched to reduce light scattering and improve light
      transmission. For example, by utilizing materials that have
      similar indices of refraction and have a clear, transparent
      property, a coating having substantially transparent
      characteristics can be formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Any of the coatings described herein can be disposed on the
      external surface of an agricultural product using any suitable
      means. For example, in some embodiments, the agricultural product
      can be dip-coated in a bath of the coating formulation (e.g., an
      aqueous or mixed aqueous-organic or organic solution of the plant
      extract composition). The deposited coating can form a thin layer
      on the surface of an agricultural product, which can protect the
      agricultural product from biotic stressors, water loss, and/or
      oxidation. In some embodiments, the deposited coating can have a
      thickness of less than about 1500 nm, such that the coating is
      transparent to the naked eye. For example, the deposited coating
      can have a thickness of about 10 nm, about 20 nm, about 30 nm,
      about 40 nm, about 50 nm, about 100 nm, about 150 nm, about 200
      nm, about 250 nm, about 300 nm, about 350 nm, about 400 nm, about
      450 nm, about 500 nm, about 550 nm, about 600 nm, about 650 nm,
      about 700 nm, about 750 nm, about 800 nm, about 850 nm, about 900
      nm, about 950 nm, 1,000 nm, about 1,100 nm, about 1,200 nm, about
      1,300 nm, about 1,400 nm, or about 1,500 nm, inclusive of all
      ranges therebetween. In some embodiments, the deposited coating
      can be uniformly deposited over the agricultural product and free
      of defects and/or pinholes. In some embodiments, the dip-coating
      process can include sequential coating of the agricultural product
      in baths of coating precursors that can undergo self-assembly or
      covalent bonding on the agricultural product to form the coating.
      In some embodiments, the coating can be deposited on agricultural
      products by passing the agricultural products under a stream of
      the coating formulation (e.g., a waterfall of the liquid coating).
      For example, the agricultural products can be disposed on a
      conveyor that passes through the stream of the coating
      formulation. In some embodiments, the coating can be misted,
      vapor- or dry vapor-deposited on the surface of the agricultural
      product. In some embodiments, the coating can be configured to be
      fixed on the surface of the agricultural product by UV
      crosslinking or by exposure to a reactive gas, for example,
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In some embodiments, the plant extract composition coating
      can be spray-coated on the agricultural products. Commercially
      available sprayers can be used for spraying the coating or
      precursors of the coating onto the agricultural product. In some
      embodiments, the coating formulation can be electrically charged
      in the sprayer before spray-coating on to the agricultural
      product, such that the deposited coating electrostatically and/or
      covalently bonds to the exterior surface of the agricultural
      product.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The coatings formed from plant extract compositions
      described herein can be configured to prevent water loss or other
      moisture loss from the coated portion of the plant, delay
      ripening, and/or prevent oxygen diffusion into the coated portion
      of the plant, for example, to reduce oxidation of the coated
      portion of the plant. The coating can also protect the coated
      portion of the plant against biotic stressors, such as, for
      example, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and/or pests that can infest
      and decompose the coated portion of the plant. Since bacteria,
      fungi and pests all identify food sources via recognition of
      specific molecules on the surface of the agricultural product,
      coating the agricultural products with the coating containing the
      plant extract compositions can deposit molecularly contrasting
      molecules on the surface of the portion of the plant, which can
      render the agricultural products unrecognizable. Furthermore, the
      coating can also alter the physical and/or chemical environment of
      the surface of the agricultural product making the surface
      unfavorable for bacteria, fungi or pests to grow. The coating can
      also be formulated to protect the surface of the portion of the
      plant from abrasion, bruising, or otherwise mechanical damage,
      and/or protect the portion of the plant from photodegradation. The
      portion of the plant can include, for example, a leaf, a stem, a
      shoot, a flower, a fruit, a root, etc. In some embodiments, the
      coating can be used to coat fruits and, for example, delay
      ripening of the fruit.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Any of the coatings described herein can be disposed on the
      external surface of an agricultural product using any suitable
      means. For example, in some embodiments, the agricultural product
      can be dip coated in a bath of the coating composition (e.g., an
      aqueous solution of hydrogen-bonding organic molecules). The
      coating can form a thin layer on the surface of agricultural
      product, which can protect the agricultural product from biotic
      stressors, water loss, and/or oxidation. In some embodiments, the
      deposited coating can have a thickness of less than about 2
      microns, for example less than 1 micron, less than 900 nm, less
      than 800 nm, less than 700 nm, less than 600 nm, less than 500 nm,
      less than 400 nm, less than 300 nm, less than 200 nm, or less than
      100 nm, such that the coating is transparent to the naked eye. For
      example, the deposited coating can have a thickness of about 50
      nm, 60 nm, 70 nm, 80 nm, 90 nm, 100 nm, 110 nm, 120 nm, 130 nm,
      140 nm, 150 nm, 200 nm, 250 nm, 300 nm, 350 nm, 400 nm, 450 nm,
      500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm, or about 1,000 nm
      inclusive of all ranges therebetween. The deposited coating can
      have a high degree of crystallinity to decrease permeability, such
      that the coating is conformally deposited over the agricultural
      product and is free of defects and/or pinholes. In some
      embodiments, the dip coating process can include sequential
      coating of the agricultural product in baths of precursors that
      can undergo self-assembly or covalent bonding on the agricultural
      product to form the coating. In some embodiments, the coatings can
      be deposited on agricultural products by passing the agricultural
      products under a stream of the coating (e.g., a waterfall of the
      liquid coating). For example, the agricultural products can be
      disposed on a conveyor that passes through the stream of the
      coating. In some embodiments, the coating can be vapor deposited
      on the surface of the agricultural product. In some embodiments,
      the coating can be formulated to be fixed on the surface of the
      agricultural product by UV cross-linking or by exposure to a
      reactive gas, for example, oxygen. In some embodiments, the
      coating can be applied in the field before harvest as an
      alternative to pesticides.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In some embodiments, the fatty acid esters and/or oligomers
      thereof are dissolved in a suitable solvent (e.g., water, ethanol,
      or a combination thereof) prior to coating the agricultural
      product. In some embodiments the process of disposing the
      composition on the agricultural product comprises dip-coating the
      agricultural product in a solution comprising the plurality of
      cutin-derived monomers, oligomers, or combinations thereof. In
      some embodiments the process of disposing the composition on the
      agricultural product comprises spray-coating the produce with a
      solution comprising the plurality of fatty acid esters and/or
      oligomers thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In some embodiments, any of the coatings can be spray
      coated on the agricultural products. Commercially available
      sprayers can be used for spraying the coating or precursors of the
      coating onto the agricultural product. In some embodiments, the
      coatings can be electrically charged in the sprayer before spray
      coating on the agricultural product, such that the coating
      covalently bonds to the exterior surface of the agricultural
      product.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In some embodiments, the coating can be deposited on the
      agricultural product such that the coating is unbound to the
      surface of the agricultural product. In some embodiments, one or
      more components of the coating, for example, the hydrogen-bonding
      organic molecule, can be covalently (or hydrogen) bonded to at
      least a portion of the surface of the agricultural product. This
      can result in improved coating properties such as, for example,
      higher durability, tighter control of coating permeability and
      thickness. In some embodiments, multiple layers of the coating can
      be deposited on the surface of agricultural product to achieve a
      durable coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Any of the coatings described herein can be used to protect
      any agricultural product. In some embodiments, the coating can be
      coated on an edible agricultural product, for example, fruits,
      vegetables, edible seeds and nuts, herbs, spices, produce, meat,
      eggs, dairy products, seafood, grains, or any other consumable
      item. In such embodiments, the coating can include components that
      are non-toxic and safe for consumption by humans and/or animals.
      For example, the coating can include components that are U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) approved direct or indirect food
      additives, FDA approved food contact substances, satisfy FDA
      regulatory requirements to be used as a food additive or food
      contact substance, and/or is an FDA Generally Recognized as Safe
      (GRAS) material. Examples of such materials can be found within
      the FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, located at
      “http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm”,
      the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference
      herein. In some embodiments, the components of the coating can
      include a dietary supplement or ingredient of a dietary
      supplement. The components of the coating can also include an FDA
      approved food additive or color additive. In some embodiments, the
      coating can include components that are naturally derived, as
      described herein. In some embodiments, the coating can be
      flavorless or have a high flavor threshold of below 500 ppm, are
      odorless or have a high odor threshold, and/or are substantially
      transparent. In some embodiments, the coating can be configured to
      be washed off an edible agricultural product, for example, with
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In some embodiments, the coatings described herein can be
      formed on an inedible agricultural product. Such inedible
      agricultural products can include, for example, inedible flowers,
      seeds, shoots, stems, leaves, whole plants, and the like. In such
      embodiments, the coating can include components that are
      non-toxic, but the threshold level for non-toxicity can be higher
      than that prescribed for edible products. In such embodiments, the
      coating can include an FDA approved food contact substance, an FDA
      approved food additive, or an FDA approved drug ingredient, for
      example, any ingredient included in the FDA's database of approved
      drugs, which can be found at
      “http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm”,
      the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by
      reference. In some embodiments, the coating can include materials
      that satisfy FDA requirements to be used in drugs or are listed
      within the FDA's National Drug Discovery Code Directory,
      “http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/default.cfm”, the
      entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by
      reference. In some embodiments, the materials can include inactive
      drug ingredients of an approved drug product as listed within the
      FDA's database,

      <br>
      [0090] Embodiments of the coatings described herein provide
      several advantages, including, for example: (1) the coatings can
      protect the agricultural products from biotic stressors, i.e.
      bacteria, viruses, fungi, or pests; (2) the coatings can prevent
      evaporation of water and/or diffusion of oxygen; (3) coating can
      help extend the shelf life of agricultural products, for example,
      postharvest produce, without refrigeration; (4) the coatings can
      introduce mechanical stability to the surface of the agricultural
      products eliminating the need for expensive packaging designed to
      prevent the types of bruising which accelerate spoilage; (5) use
      of agricultural waste materials to obtain the coatings can help
      eliminate the breeding environments of bacteria, fungi, and pests;
      (6) the coatings can be used in place of pesticides to protect
      plants, thereby minimizing the harmful impact of pesticides to
      human health and the environment; (7) the coatings can be
      naturally derived and hence, safe for human consumption. Since the
      components of the coatings described herein can in some
      embodiments be obtained from agricultural waste, such coatings can
      be made at a relatively low cost. Therefore, the coatings can be
      particularly suited for small scale farmers, for example, by
      reducing the cost required to protect crops from pesticides and
      reducing postharvest losses of agricultural products due to
      decomposition by biotic and/or environmental stressors.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In some embodiments, the treating of the crosslinked
      polymer and/or forming of the plant extract composition is carried
      out by a first party, while the application of the plant extract
      composition to an agricultural product to form a protective
      coating over the agricultural product is carried out by a second
      party different from the first party. For example, a manufacturer
      of the plant extract compositions (i.e., a first party) can form
      the compositions by one or more of the methods described herein.
      The manufacturer can then sell or otherwise provide the resulting
      plant extract composition to a second party, for example a farmer,
      shipper, distributor, or retailer of produce, and the second party
      can apply the composition to one or more agricultural products to
      form a protective coating over the products. Alternatively, the
      manufacturer can sell or otherwise provide the resulting plant
      extract composition to an intermediary party, for example a
      wholesaler, who then sells or otherwise provides the plant extract
      composition to a second party such as a farmer, shipper,
      distributor, or retailer of produce, and the second party can
      apply the composition to one or more agricultural products to form
      a protective coating over the products.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In some cases where multiple parties are involved, the
      first party may optionally provide instructions or recommendations
      about the extract composition, either written or oral, indicating
      one or more of the following: (i) that the composition is intended
      to be applied to a product for the purpose of coating or
      protecting the product, to extend the life of the product, to
      reduce spoilage of the product, or to modify or improve the
      aesthetic appearance of the product; (ii) conditions and/or
      methods that are suitable for applying the compositions to the
      surfaces of products; and/or (iii) potential benefits (e.g.,
      extended shelf life, reduced rate of mass loss, reduced rate of
      molding and/or spoilage, etc.) that can result from the
      application of the composition to a product. While the
      instructions or recommendations may be supplied by the first party
      directly with the plant extract composition (e.g., on packaging in
      which the composition is sold or distributed), the instructions or
      recommendations may alternatively be supplied separately, for
      example on a website owned or controlled by the first party, or in
      advertising or marketing material provided by or on behalf of the
      first party.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In view of the above, it is recognized that in some cases,
      a party that manufactures a plant extract composition according to
      one or more methods described herein (i.e., a first party) may not
      directly form a coating over a product from the extract
      composition, but can instead direct (e.g., can instruct or
      request) a second party to form a coating over a product from the
      extract composition. That is, even if the first party does not
      coat a product by the methods and compositions described herein,
      the first party may still cause the plant extract composition to
      be applied to the product to form a protective coating over the
      product by providing instructions or recommendations as described
      above. Accordingly, as used herein, the act of applying a plant
      extract composition to a product (e.g., a plant or agricultural
      product) also includes directing or instructing another party to
      apply the plant extract composition to the product, or causing the
      plant extract composition to be applied to the product.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The following examples describe plant extract compositions
      and methods for obtaining the same. These examples are only for
      illustrative purposes and are not meant to limit the scope of the
      present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0095] In each of the examples below, all reagents and solvents
      were purchased and used without further purification unless
      specified. All reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of
      nitrogen with commercial grade solvents unless otherwise stated.
      Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC)
      carried out on 0.25 mm E. Merck silica gel plates (60 Å, F-254)
      using UV light as the visualizing agent and an acidic mixture of
      anisaldehyde, ceric ammonium molybdate, or basic aqueous potassium
      permanganate (KMnO4), and heat as developing agents. NMR spectra
      were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz and/or Varian VNMRs 600
      MHz instruments and calibrated using residual un-deuterated
      solvent as an internal reference (eg. CHCl3@ 7.26 ppm &lt;1&gt;H
      NMR, 77.16 ppm &lt;13&gt;C NMR). The following abbreviations (or
      combinations thereof) were used to explain the multiplicities:
      s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet, br=broad.
      Mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Waters Xevo UPLC equipped
      with a Cis column and a ESI TQD MS. Absolute ethanol was dried to
      low residual water according to the procedures in Purification of
      Laboratory Chemicals (7thed.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1: Method for Preparing Tomato Pomace Prior to
        Depolymerization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] Tomato pomace obtained from a commercial tomato processing
      facility was milled in a cutting mill, and sifted to give
      different particle size distributions (eg. &gt;500 μm, 250-500 μm,
      125-250 μm, etc.). The fraction corresponding to 250-500 μm was
      sequentially extracted with CHCl3 overnight in a Soxhlet extractor
      and with methanol overnight in a Soxhlet extractor to remove the
      surface waxes and other soluble components, followed by drying
      under vacuum (&lt;1 torr). The washed pomace was then lyophilized
      overnight (&lt;0.02 torr) to remove water, and then stored in a
      desiccator before use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: Method for Preparing a Composition from Tomato
        Skin/Peel Treated in a Base and an Alcohol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0097] A general procedure for base catalyzed depolymerization is
      as follows. To depolymerize the dried and washed pomace, an
      ethanolic solution including a stoichiometric excess (relative to
      tomato pomace) of sodium ethoxide was prepared in an oven dried
      three neck round bottom by adding 2 eq. sodium metal (rel. to
      tomato pomace, assuming that the mass is entirely composed of
      cutin polymer) to 250 mL anhydrous ethanol under a nitrogen
      atmosphere. The mixture was stirred under nitrogen until the
      sodium had completely dissolved, after which 10.0 g of the tomato
      pomace (250-500 m in size) was added against a counter-flow of
      nitrogen. The mixture was refluxed under nitrogen for 48 hours,
      followed by cooling the reaction to room temperature and quenching
      it with 3 mL glacial acetic acid to a pH of about 7. The resulting
      solution was filtered using Grade 1 Whatman filter paper to remove
      any leftover solids and the filtrate was collected. Any excess
      solvent was removed from the filtered solution by rotary
      evaporation. The crude isolate was dried under high vacuum
      (&lt;0.1 torr), and was analyzed by UPLC and NMR. The crude
      isolate was found to contain (9)10,16-dihydroxypalmitic acid, with
      no evidence of ethyl ester formation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3: Method for Preparing a Composition from Tomato
        Skin/Peel Treated in an Acid and an Alcohol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0098] To 250 mL of absolute ethanol was added sulfuric acid (7.36
      g, 4.00 mL, 75.0 mmol) and tomato pomace (10.0 g, 500 m-250 m in
      size) with stirring. The reaction was then heated to reflux for 48
      hours. Once complete, the reaction was cooled and the solution
      neutralized to pH 7 with ̃70 mL sat. NaHCO3(aq). The neutralized
      mixture was then filtered through a Buchner funnel and Grade 1
      Whatman (70 mm) filter paper. The filtrate was dried by sequential
      rotary evaporation and high vacuum (&lt;0.1 torr). When the crude
      material was dry, it was taken up in ethyl acetate (140 mL) and
      three forward extractions were conducted with H2O (2×160 mL) and
      brine (160 mL). The organic layer was separated, and the combined
      aqueous phases were extracted with an additional 200 mL ethyl
      acetate, and the organic phases combined, and dried with MgSO4.
      The solvent was removed with rotary evaporation and high vacuum,
      yielding 3.35 g (avg.) of crude isolate.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The crude isolate from the ethanolysis was dissolved in
      methanol, and three times the mass of the crude isolate in Celite
      545 was added. The methanol was removed by rotary evaporator and
      dried Celite admixture transferred to a cellulose extraction
      thimble. Glass wool was placed on top of the material to ensure it
      stayed in the thimble. The material was extracted in a Soxhlet
      extractor for 20 hours under nitrogen with 600 mL of heptane.
      After 20 hours, the Soxhlet apparatus and contents were cooled.
      The Soxhlet apparatus was then dismantled, and the round bottom
      was placed in a fumehood overnight, which allowed a first crop of
      ethyl 10,16-dihydroxyhexdecanoate (EtDHPA) to precipitate out of
      the heptane. The round bottom was then placed in a 2° C. fridge
      overnight, giving a second crop of EtDHPA. The second crop was
      then filtered and transferred to a scintillation vial. Both crops
      were dried by sequential treatment with a rotary evaporator and
      high vacuum (&lt;0.1 torr), resulting in a yellowish (first
      crop)/white (second crop) powder. Both crops were analyzed by NMR
      and UPLC/ESI MS, matching the expected spectra for EtDHPA; yield
      (combined crops): 0.76 g. &lt;1&gt;H NMR (600 MHz, Chloroform-d) δ
      4.11 (q, J=7.1 Hz, 2H), 3.63 (t, J=6.8 Hz, 2H), 3.57 (s, 1H), 2.27
      (t, J=7.6 Hz, 2H), 1.66-1.51 (m, 6H), 1.49-1.25 (m, 21H), 1.24 (t,
      J=7.1 Hz, 3H). See FIG. 12 (UPLC) and FIG. 13 (NMR).<br>

      <b>Example 4: Method for Preparing a Composition from Tomato
        Skin/Peel Treated in an Acid and an Alcohol at High Temperatures</b><br>
      <br>
      [0100] To a thick-walled sealed tube containing 250 mL of absolute
      ethanol was added sulfuric acid (7.36 g, 4.00 mL, 75.0 mmol),
      followed by tomato pomace (10.0 g, 500 m-250 m in size). The
      reaction was then heated to temperatures greater than the
      atmospheric boiling point of ethanol, such as 100° C. or 120° C.
      for 24 or 48 hours. Once complete, the reaction was cooled and the
      solution neutralized to pH 7 with ̃70 mL sat. NaHCO3(aq.). The
      neutralized mixture was then filtered through a Buchner funnel and
      Grade 1 Whatman (70 mm) filter paper. The filtrate was dried by
      sequential rotary evaporation and high vacuum (&lt;0.1 torr). When
      the crude material was dry, it was taken up in ethyl acetate (140

      at each of the different temperature and time conditions are
      plotted in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The crude isolate obtained from the ethanolysis was

      oligomers, and mixtures thereof for application in agricultural
      coating formulations, and in particular, to methods of preparing
      plant extract compositions that include functionalized and
      non-functionalized fatty acids and fatty esters (as well as their
      oligomers and mixturesthereof), which are substantially free from
      accompanying plant-derived compounds (e.g., proteins,
      polysaccharides, phenols, lignans, aromatic acids, terpenoids,
      flavonoids, carotenoids, alkaloids, alcohols, alkanes, and
      aldehydes) and can be used in agricultural coating formulations.<br>

      </div>
      <b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b>A method of forming a material structure from structural units
      contained within a liquid solution in a spray head is described.
      The liquid solution includes a solvent and a solute, the solute
      comprising a plurality of the structural units, the structural
      units including monomer units, oligomer units, or combinations
      thereof. The method comprises forming droplets of the liquid
      solution including the structural units, and spraying the droplets
      on a substrate, thereby substantially increasing the reactivity of
      the structural units within the droplets relative to the
      structural units within the liquid solution in the spray head. The
      increase in reactivity can result from the droplets containing an
      excess of a particular ion, the ion excess resulting from a
      voltage applied to conductive walls of the device which dispenses
      the droplets. The material structure is then formed on the
      substrate from the more highly reactive structural units within
      the droplets.<br>

        <b> APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR TREATMENT AND INSPECTION OF PRODUCE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Described herein are conveyor systems and application units which
      can be used to transport and simultaneously treat, or to
      facilitate treatment and inspection of produce, agricultural
      products, or other items. The conveyor systems and application
      units can be configured to allow products to be simultaneously
      rotated as they are moved along a packing line, which can
      facilitate the uniform application of spray coatings and/or allow
      the products to be uniformly blow dried while they are moved.
      Exemplary conveyor systems and application units can include a bed
      formed of a plurality of rollers and a rotation inducing device
      that causes the rollers to rotate while they are laterally
      transported, thereby causing the products lying on top of the bed
      to rotate during transport.<br>
