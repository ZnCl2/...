        <b>Abstract</b> -- A reversible thermoelectric converter
        includes first and second quantum well diodes and an electrical
        connection between the first and second quantum well diodes
        without a thermal barrier between them. Each quantum well diode
        includes first and second electrodes wherein electrons are
        quantized in discrete energy levels and a dielectric layer
        providing a potential barrier between the first and second
        electrodes. When electrons in the first quantum well diode have
        a higher temperature than the electrons in the second quantum
        well diode, electric voltage fluctuations resulting from
        transitions of the electrons between the energy levels in the
        first quantum well diode are coupled from the first quantum well
        diode to the second quantum well diode.; The reversible
        thermoelectric converter can be operated for power conversion of
        thermal energy to electric energy, as a heat pump or a
        refrigerator, or as an amplifier. A planar array of reversible
        thermoelectric converter elements provides a desired output
        voltage and current. </p>

      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to reversible thermoelectric power
        conversion devices, and more particularly, to reversible
        thermoelectric converters which utilize quantum well diodes.
        More specifically, the invention relates to devices for
        converting the thermal energy of hot electrons to electric
        energy and for pumping heat from low temperature regions to high
        temperature regions, and to applications of such devices. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Devices for converting thermal directly to electric energy have
        been extensively investigated. The most commonly utilized
        devices have been thermionic converters working from high
        temperature sources and silicon cells utilizing the input
        thermal energy of solar radiation. Such devices have limited
        operating temperature ranges. In addition, the efficiencies for
        the direct conversion of solar energy to electricity that are
        required to be competitive with conventionally generated
        electricity in many U.S. markets over the next few decades have
        not yet been achieved. These required efficiencies range from
        the lowest efficiency requirement of 10% module efficiency for
        flat plate modules to the highest efficiency requirement of 25%
        module efficiency for concentrated solar energy. These required
        efficiencies are reported by E. A. DeMeo et al in Proceedings of
        the 21st Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
        Photovoltaic Specialists Conference--1990, Kissimmee, May 21-25,
        1990 (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, New
        York, 1990), pp. 16-23. </p>
      <p>A reversible thermoelectric converter having a high operating
        efficiency is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,004,210 issued Jan.
        18, 1977 to Yater. The disclosed device comprises a first layer
        of microcircuit modules for converting thermal energy into
        electric voltage fluctuations, a second layer of microcircuit
        modules for receiving the electric voltage fluctuations and a
        third layer between the first and second layers. The third layer
        is a thermal barrier, such as a vacuum. Electric voltage
        fluctuations are capacitively coupled from the first layer
        across the thermal barrier to the second layers. The first and
        second layers operate at different temperatures. The
        microcircuit modules can be Schottky barrier diodes or quantum
        or tunnel diodes. The reversible thermoelectric converter
        disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,004,210 has the potential to
        achieve efficiencies as high as 90%. The thermal barrier
        transmits electric voltage fluctuations and prevents cooling,
        radiation losses and lead conduction losses. </p>
      <p>The theoretical basis for the operation of reversible
        thermoelectric converters is described by J. C. Yater in
        Physical Review A, August 1979, pages 623-627, J. C. Yater in
        Physical Review A, July 1982, pages 522-538 and by J. C. Yater
        in Solar Cells, Vol. 10, August 1983, pages 237-255. These
        articles describe efficiencies up to 99% of the Carnot cycle
        efficiency and describe physically realizable diode designs,
        including thin film, quantum effect and thermionic, that can
        enable high power output and high efficiency to be achieved. All
        of the previously disclosed reversible thermoelectric converters
        known to applicants include a separate thermal barrier between
        the hot and cold layers of the circuit. </p>
      <p>Quantum size effects in thin metal films is described by R. C.
        Jaklevic et al in Physical Review B, Vol. 12, No. 10, Nov. 15,
        1975, pages 4146-4160. Devices involving quantum effects are
        described by F. Capasso et al in "Quantum Electron Devices",
        Physics Today, February 1990, pages 74-82. A typical quantum
        well diode includes a thin dielectric layer between two thin
        metal layers. Electrons in the metal layers are quantized into
        discrete energy levels in a direction perpendicular to the metal
        surface. The dielectric layer forms a potential barrier. </p>
      <p>It is a general object of the present invention to provide
        improved reversible thermoelectric converters. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide an
        improved reversible thermoelectric converter including a thin
        film quantum well diode for directly converting thermal energy
        of hot electrons to electric energy. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide
        reversible thermoelectric converters with improved efficiency of
        conversion of solar energy to electrical energy. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of the present invention to provide
        hot electrons for the reversible thermoelectric converter from
        different heat sources including fossil, nuclear and geothermal
        heat sources. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the present invention to provide
        efficient operation of the reversible thermoelectric converter
        at low temperatures. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>According to the present invention, these and other objects and
        advantages are achieved in a reversible thermoelectric converter
        comprising a first device, or element, and a second device, or
        element. The first and second devices are electrically connected
        together without a thermal barrier between them. The first and
        second devices each comprise first and second regions wherein
        electric carriers are quantized in discrete energy levels, and a
        third region that provides a potential barrier between the first
        and second regions. Preferably, the first and second devices
        each comprise a quantum well diode. Preferably, the first region
        of each device comprises a first thin metal film, the second
        region comprises a second thin metal film and the third region
        comprises a thin dielectric film. The first and second thin
        metal films are sufficiently thin that the electrons in each
        metal film are quantized in discrete energy levels. </p>
      <p>The apparatus in accordance with the invention is capable of
        performing several energy conversion functions. In a first
        energy conversion function, thermal energy is converted into
        electric energy. Thermal energy, typically in the form of
        radiation such as solar energy, is applied to the first device,
        causing the electrons in the first device to be raised to a
        higher temperature and to higher energy levels. The thermal
        energy is converted by the first device into electric voltage
        fluctuations. The electric voltage fluctuations are coupled to
        the second device wherein the electrons are maintained at a
        lower temperature. The electric voltage fluctuations are
        converted by the second device to electric energy which is
        provided at output terminals. </p>
      <p>In a second energy conversion function of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter of the present invention, thermal
        energy from an external source is applied to the first device
        and is converted by the first device into electric voltage
        fluctuations. The electric voltage fluctuations are coupled to
        the second device and are converted to thermal energy at a
        higher temperature than the temperature of the external source.
        In this mode, the apparatus operates as heat pump or as a
        refrigerator. </p>
      <p>In a third energy conversion function of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter, cyclically varying energy is applied
        to the first device and is converted into electric voltage
        fluctuations. The electrons in the first device have a
        relatively low temperature. The second device receives thermal
        energy at a constant level and converts the thermal energy to
        electric voltage fluctuations. The electrons in the second
        device have a relatively high temperature. The electric voltage
        fluctuations are coupled between the first and second devices.
        The apparatus includes output terminals for providing cyclically
        varying electric energy having the same waveform and a higher
        energy level than the cyclically varying energy received by the
        first device. </p>
      <p>According to another aspect of the present invention, a
        reversible thermoelectric converter array comprises a substrate
        and one or more reversible thermoelectric converter array
        elements formed on the substrate. Each array element comprises a
        first quantum well diode, a second quantum well diode, and means
        for electrically connecting the first diode to the second diode
        without a thermal barrier between them. The array preferably
        includes spaced-apart lower electrodes formed on the substrate,
        a dielectric film formed on the lower electrodes, and
        spaced-apart upper electrodes formed on the dielectric film and
        overlying at least part of the lower electrodes to form a series
        array of electrodes. The electrodes are preferably thin metal
        films. </p>
      <p>The reversible thermoelectric converter array elements can be
        connected in series on the substrate to provide a desired output
        voltage. Multiple arrays can be connected in parallel to provide
        a desired output current. </p>
      <p>The first diode and the second diode of each array element can
        each comprise a number of electrode pairs connected in series
        and means for applying successively larger voltage increments to
        the electrode pairs of the first and second diodes. In one
        embodiment, the means for applying successively larger voltage
        increments comprises auxiliary electrodes for applying electric
        fields to the electrode pairs of the first and second diodes and
        means for applying voltages to the auxiliary electrodes. In
        another embodiment, the first diode of an array element is
        formed on a first substrate portion and the second diode is
        formed on a second substrate portion such that the first and
        second diodes can be physically separated during operation. </p>
      <p>The array can include a thermal reservoir associated with each
        of the array elements. The thermal reservoir is advantageous
        when the array is used in an enclosed environment. The thermal
        reservoir can comprise spaced-apart metal electrodes disposed in
        close proximity to the electrodes of the first and second diodes
        and electrically isolated therefrom. </p>
      <p>According to a further aspect of the invention, there is
        provided a two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter
        comprising a power conversion stage for receiving thermal energy
        and converting the thermal energy to electric energy, and a heat
        pump stage. The power conversion stage includes a first quantum
        well diode and a second quantum well diode connected as
        described above. The heat pump stage reduces the temperature of
        the second quantum well diode in the power conversion stage. The
        heat pump stage includes a third quantum well diode and a fourth
        quantum well diode connected as described above, and means for
        supplying a DC voltage to the heat pump stage sufficient to
        reverse the contact potential across the quantum well diodes.
        The heat pump stage reduces the temperature of the electrons in
        the second quantum well diode of the power conversion stage and
        thereby increases the efficiency of the power conversion stage.

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The basic reversible thermoelectric converter of the present
        invention comprises two nonlinear circuit elements with an
        electrical connection between the two circuit elements. The two
        circuit elements are typically quantum well diodes operating
        such that the electric carriers of the two diodes have different
        temperatures. The physical process of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter is that of a heat engine using a
        reversible thermodynamic process to convert thermal energy into
        electric energy or to convert electric energy into thermal
        energy or to combine both processes within one reversible
        thermoelectric converter circuit. The reversible process of the
        circuit is operated as an ordered succession of equilibrium
        states. </p>
      <p>The classical reversible thermoelectric converter, as disclosed
        in U.S. Pat. No. 4,004,210, is based on classical thermodynamics
        and includes a discrete and separate thermal barrier between the
        hot and cold diodes. The theory of the reversible processes of
        the classical circuit shows that the incoming energy
        fluctuations in the form of increments of thermal energy are
        converted into electromagnetic energy without, in the limit, any
        irreversible losses occurring, such as heat losses across the
        thermal barrier. In the limit, the intrinsic efficiency for the
        classical circuit approaches that of the Carnot cycle
        efficiency, E=1-T.sub.c /T.sub.r, where T.sub.c is the circuit
        temperature and T.sub.r is the source temperature. For solar
        energy, the source temperature is the temperature of the sun. </p>
      <p>The reversible thermoelectric converter of the present
        invention uses a quantum reversible thermodynamic cycle. The
        separate thermal barrier of the classical circuit is replaced
        with a quantum well potential thermal barrier within the thin
        film electrodes of a quantum well diode. Input hot electrons to
        the electrodes of the quantum well diode are the result of input
        energy fluctuations such as from photogenerated electrons or
        input hot electrons over a conservative potential barrier. A
        conservative potential barrier is defined as a potential barrier
        where the transmission probability for a barrier crossing by a
        particle is a function of the energy of the particle and where
        the barrier crossing is reversible and no dissipative energy
        loss occurs for the particle barrier crossing. In comparison
        with the classical circuit, the quantum reversible
        thermoelectric converter of the present invention provides
        improved performance, reduced cost, simplified manufacturing and
        expanded applications. </p>
      <p>A reversible thermoelectric converter in accordance with the
        present invention is shown schematically in FIG. 1. A diode 10
        is connected to terminals 12 and 14 by conducting leads 16 and
        18, respectively. A diode 20 is connected to terminals 22 and 24
        by conducting leads 26 and 28, respectively. Terminals 12 and 22
        are connected by a conducting lead 30 or by a capacitor (not
        shown). Diodes 10 and 20 are quantum well diodes as described
        below. For a typical power conversion process, the incoming
        thermal energy in the form of hot electrons, such as hot
        electrons which are photogenerated by incoming solar energy, are
        applied to the diode 10. When the converter is used in a power
        conversion process, terminals 14 and 24 are the output terminals
        of the circuit for supplying electric energy. </p>
      <p>A quantum well diode is shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Conducting
        films 40 and 42 are separated by a dielectric layer 44 which
        serves as a diode barrier. The device is typically formed on a
        glass substrate 46. The layers 40, 42 and 44 have thicknesses in
        a range of a few angstroms to several hundred angstroms to
        insure that the electron energy levels are quantized. In a
        preferred embodiment, layer 42 is an aluminum film, barrier
        layer 44 is aluminum oxide and layer 40 is a copper film. </p>
      <p>The use of state of the art evaporation techniques results in a
        variation in the thickness of about 10%, or approximately 10
        atomic layers, in the aluminum and copper films. However, a
        thickness variation approaching only one atomic layer is
        required for effective separation of energy levels in the
        quantum wells of the diode. The existence of electronic standing
        wave energy levels in thin metal films resulting from the
        quantized nature of the crystalline structure of the film has
        been described in the aforementioned article by R. C. Jaklevic
        et al. The standing waves reduce the spread that would otherwise
        occur in the quantized energy levels. These standing wave energy
        levels, called lattice commensurate states, have a potential for
        applications in optoelectronics, since these thin metal films
        have extremely large absorption and emission strengths at
        appropriate wavelengths. </p>
      <p>The quantum well diodes used in the reversible thermoelectric
        converter of the present invention include thin film metal
        quantum wells separated by a thin dielectric tunneling barrier.
        The average potential of a conduction electron in a bulk metal
        in vacuum at zero temperature is shown in FIG. 4A. A potential
        well of depth V.sub.o in the metal rises rapidly near the metal
        boundaries to zero. As stated by R. Eisberg and R. Resnick in
        Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and
        Particles, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York 1974, pp.
        442-444, the energy levels at energy E in a bulk metal increase
        in electron density proportional to E.sup.1/2 and are filled up
        to the Fermi level E.sub.F. The electron work function W.sub.o
        is the difference between the potential well depth V.sub.o and
        the Fermi level E.sub.F. Thus, V.sub.o =W.sub.o +E.sub.F, where
        V.sub.o =0 in the vacuum outside the metal. </p>
      <p>When a thin metal film has a thickness in the range of about
        100 angstroms, a quantum size effect of the film thickness
        results from quantized electron motion in a direction
        perpendicular to the plane of the metal film. The quantum size
        effect gives rise to a series of discrete bound states in the
        potential well as shown in FIG. 4B. The energy levels E.sub.n of
        the bound states are given by E.sub.n =3.76 (n/a).sup.2
        .times.10.sup.-3 electron volts, where n is the energy level and
        a is the thickness of the well times 10.sup.6 centimeters. For
        example, for a well thickness of 60 angstroms, a=0.6. There are
        approximately 15 energy levels in a well depth of approximately
        10 electron volts, and the Fermi energy E.sub.F is approximately
        equal to 9 electron volts. </p>
      <p>One of the advantages of the metal quantum well for solar
        energy conversion is the high absorption of solar photons, which
        are in the energy range of one electron volt. The high
        absorption for transitions between energy levels near the top
        level of the quantum well results from two factors. One factor
        is the oscillator strength, which is a measure of the absorption
        strength for transitions between energy levels in the quantum
        well. The other factor is the carrier density or population of
        electrons in each energy level. The oscillator strength for
        transitions between energy levels 14 and 15 of the above example
        is approximately 12, which is more than an order of magnitude
        larger than that attainable from the most heavily doped
        semiconductor quantum wells. The carrier density for these
        energy levels is on the order of 10.sup.15 electrons per square
        centimeter, which is several orders of magnitude larger than
        that available from the most heavily doped semiconductors. Since
        the absorption strength for specific transitions is proportional
        to the oscillator strength of a specific transition, such as the
        1 volt transition from energy level 14 to energy level 15, times
        the population of the electrons for the transition, there is a
        huge advantage in the use of metal quantum wells for absorbing
        solar energy photons over semiconductor quantum wells. </p>
      <p>An energy level diagram for the potential energy levels of two
        quantum well diodes connected together is shown in FIG. 4C. Each
        quantum well diode includes two quantum wells in thin metal
        films with different work functions. In each quantum well diode,
        the metal films are separated by a thin dielectric tunnel
        barrier. The energy level diagram of FIG. 4C corresponds to the
        reversible thermoelectric converter shown in FIG. 1. Diode 10
        and diode 20 each comprises a copper film with a work function
        W.sub.c and an aluminum film with a work function W.sub.a
        separated by an aluminum oxide dielectric barrier. When the
        diodes are connected, the Fermi levels become the same
        throughout the circuit, and the work function difference,
        W.sub.c -W.sub.a, is the contact potential V.sub.c between the
        copper and aluminum quantum wells that exists across the
        aluminum oxide diode barrier. The electrons in diodes 10 and 20
        are assumed to have the same temperature in the energy level
        diagram of FIG. 4C. </p>
      <p>The Fermi levels become equal when the most energetic electrons
        in the aluminum film, which has a lower work function, flow into
        the copper film. The electron flow fills the energy levels in
        the copper film just above its Fermi level and depletes the
        energy levels in the aluminum film until equilibrium is reached.
        Equilibrium is reached when the highest filled energy levels in
        the copper and aluminum films are at the same energy and the
        total energy of the circuit is minimized. For the equilibrium
        state, the aluminum films become positively charged and the
        copper films become negatively charged. A potential difference,
        or contact potential, of V.sub.c =1 millivolt between the copper
        and aluminum films results. </p>
      <p>The energy level diagram for quantum well diodes 10 and 20 when
        the electrons in diode 10 are heated is shown FIG. 4D. The
        number of electrons at a higher temperature and a higher energy
        level than the Fermi level is much larger at the higher
        temperature. When the electrons in diode 10 are heated, the
        current flows in the opposite direction through diode 10 as
        compared with the case of reaching equilibrium at the lower
        temperature for diode 10. In the energy level diagram of FIG.
        4D, it is assumed that the temperature T.sub.r of electrons in
        diode 10 is 6000.degree. K. and that the temperature T.sub.c of
        electrons in diode 20 is 300.degree. K. The new equilibrium for
        diode 10 results in the voltage across diode 10 becoming V.sub.i
        =(T.sub.r /T.sub.c)V.sub.c =20 millivolts. The increased voltage
        across diode 10 raises the Fermi level of the copper film of
        diode 10 so that there is an output voltage V.sub.o at the
        terminals 14 and 24 of the circuit of V.sub.o =V.sub.i -V.sub.c
        or V.sub.o =(1-T.sub.c /T.sub.r)V.sub.i. As a result, the output
        voltage V.sub.o is 19 millivolts for the equilibrium state when
        T.sub.r =6000.degree. K. and T.sub.c =300.degree. K. </p>
      <p>Thus the electrons in each of the electrodes 40 and 42 are
        distributed in discrete energy levels determined by the
        temperature of the electrons and the material of the electrode.
        As the electrons are heated, they are distributed in higher
        energy levels and have a greater probability of crossing the
        potential barrier to the other electrode. </p>
      <p>Applications of the reversible thermoelectric converter of the
        present invention are shown schematically in FIGS. 5-8. In FIG.
        5, the reversible thermoelectric converter is used for
        conversion of thermal energy to electric energy. Thermal energy
        P.sub.in is applied to quantum well diode 10. The thermal
        energy, which can be in the form of solar energy, is converted
        in diode 10 to hot photoelectrons at the temperature T.sub.r of
        the source. The electrons in diode 20 are at a low temperature
        T.sub.c relative to diode 10. The output electric energy
        P.sub.out appears at terminals 14 and 24. </p>
      <p>Operation of the reversible thermoelectric converter as a heat
        pump is shown in FIG. 6. Thermal energy is absorbed by quantum
        well diode 20 at low temperature T.sub.c and thermal energy is
        given off by quantum well diode 10 at a higher temperature
        T.sub.r. The diode 10 is typically located in a region 50 of
        essentially constant temperature T.sub.r. </p>
      <p>The reversible thermoelectric converter used as a heat pump
        differs from the use of the reversible thermoelectric converter
        for power conversion in that means is used to reverse the
        current through the diodes 10 and 20. Current reversal can be
        obtained by applying a voltage from a DC source 52 between the
        output terminals 14 and 24. Alternatively, a voltage can be
        applied between the terminals of diode 20 to obtain current
        reversal. The current reversal occurs when the voltage applied
        by DC source 52 has a larger magnitude and opposite polarity as
        compared with the open circuit output voltage of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter. The ratio of the open circuit voltage
        to the contact potential across the diode electrodes is given by
        (T.sub.r /T.sub.c -1). </p>
      <p>The reversible thermoelectric converter shown in FIG. 1 can be
        used to provide an AC power output. For AC operation, the
        current through the reversible thermoelectric converter is
        reversed cyclically so that the converter generates a cyclic
        electric or thermal power output. A cyclic input can be applied
        between the terminals 22 and 24 of the cold diode 20 so as to
        generate a cyclic output with the same waveform as the input.
        The frequency of the cyclic output power can be as great as the
        frequency corresponding to the relaxation time of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter, which can be less than 10.sup.-14
        second. When a cyclic or AC input is used, the reversible
        thermoelectric converter can function as an amplifier. </p>
      <p>Use of the reversible thermoelectric converter as an amplifier
        is shown schematically in FIG. 7. An AC signal P.sub.in is
        applied to quantum well diode 20 at a low temperature T.sub.c
        and input thermal energy is applied to quantum well diode 10 at
        a high temperature T.sub.r. The AC signal P.sub.in can be in the
        form of thermal energy, such as optical photons, or in the form
        of electric energy, such as a voltage applied across terminals
        22 and 24 of diode 20. The output electric energy P.sub.out is
        an AC signal with the waveform of the input signal P.sub.in. The
        amplification factor is given by (T.sub.r.sup.2
        /T.sub.c.sup.2)-1, where the input AC signal is applied to the
        cold diode at temperature T.sub.c in the form of thermal or
        electrical energy. </p>
      <p>By way of example, an input signal of 6 microwatts with a
        bandwidth of 1 gigahertz is applied to diode 20 either as
        thermal energy or electric energy, and thermal energy is applied
        to diode 10. A signal-to-noise ration of 60 dB is obtained for
        the input signal for a temperature T.sub.c of the cold diode 20
        of 300.degree. K. For a temperature T.sub.r of hot electrons in
        diode 10 of 6000.degree. K., the amplification of the input
        signal is 26 dB, which gives an output signal of 2.4 milliwatts.
        The amplified output signal also has a 60 dB signal-to-noise
        ratio. </p>
      <p>Use of the reversible thermoelectric converter as a
        refrigerator is shown in FIG. 8. In this case, thermal energy is
        transferred out of a low temperature region 54 at temperature
        T.sub.c containing quantum well diode 20, and thermal energy is
        given off by quantum well diode 10 at a higher temperature
        T.sub.r. A DC source 56 connected between output terminals 14
        and 24 causes the normal direction of current in the reversible
        thermoelectric converter to be reversed, as described above in
        connection with the heat pump of FIG. 6. The refrigeration cycle
        shown in FIG. 8 is similar in concept to the heat pump cycle
        shown in FIG. 6 and described above. </p>
      <p>The quantum well structure in the quantum well diode contains
        the thermal energy of the hot electrons throughout the period of
        time required for the input thermal energy to be converted to
        electric energy by reversible electron transitions between
        energy levels. The quantum well diode serves a similar function
        for the heat pump process. The elimination of the requirement
        for a separate thermal barrier in the reversible thermoelectric
        converter of the present invention permits low cost, state of
        the art fabrication of the converter from thin films of common
        materials such as, for example, copper and aluminum. </p>
      <p>The inherent difference between the classical reversible
        process and the quantum reversible process is that for the
        quantum reversible thermoelectric converter, the reversible
        process includes quantum size effects. As a result, circuit
        performance is based on quantum statistics. This difference
        results in a significant difference in performance. </p>
      <p>All real processes are irreversible and are accompanied by an
        increase in entropy. However, processes using either classical
        or quantum statistics are defined as reversible processes when,
        in the limiting case, the entropy increase for the process
        becomes arbitrarily small and when the process is constituted of
        a succession of ordered equilibrium states. </p>
      <p>The significant different in performance is the rate at which
        the system moves through the succession of equilibrium states.
        To approach the limiting case for the classical reversible
        process, the system is constrained to move with infinite
        slowness through the succession of equilibrium states. For a
        quantum reversible process, the movement through the succession
        of equilibrium states can occur at the rate of spontaneous
        fluctuations. Therefore, the rate of succession of equilibrium
        states for the quantum reversible process can, as stated by W.
        Band in Quantum statistics, D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., New
        York, 1955, pp. 38-40, in the limit, proceed at a finite speed
        depending only on the fluctuation spectrum of any equilibrium
        state. </p>
      <p>The fluctuation spectrum of the reversible process includes
        frequencies up to optical frequencies. The rate of the
        succession of equilibrium states for the conversion of solar
        energy is within this fluctuation spectrum and is controlled by
        the incoming of increments of solar thermal energy. These
        increments, in the range of an electron volt of energy, are in
        the form of photogenerated hot electrons at the source
        temperature T.sub.r incoming to the electrodes of the quantum
        well diode that is operating as the hot diode in the reversible
        thermoelectric converter. </p>
      <p>The thermal energy of each hot electron is transferred into an
        increment of electromagnetic energy in the quantum reversible
        thermoelectric converter by transition between the energy levels
        of the quantum wells at the equilibrium state for the
        temperature T.sub.r. This increment of electric energy of the
        equilibrium state is directed converted into an incremental
        electric energy output with an efficiency approaching that of
        the Carnot cycle by transitions between the energy levels of the
        quantum wells in the electrodes of the cool quantum well diode
        at circuit temperature T.sub.c. </p>
      <p>Transitions over a wide range of energy level differences in
        the quantum wells are involved in the transformation of
        approximately one electron volt of thermal energy into the
        electric energy output. The electric energy output consists of
        many electrons of lesser energy and at a corresponding smaller
        output voltage as given by the output voltage of the equilibrium
        state of the quantum reversible thermoelectric converter. The
        electromagnetic energy stored in the higher energy levels of the
        quantum wells in the quantum well diodes from incoming thermal
        energy, develops as the output voltage of the quantum reversible
        thermoelectric converter. The output voltage V.sub.0 for the
        equilibrium state is given by </p>
      <p>where V.sub.i is the voltage across the hot diode receiving the
        incoming thermal energy and V.sub.c is the voltage across the
        cold diode. The Boltzmann factor for the ratio of V.sub.i to
        V.sub.c at the equilibrium state is </p>
      <p>where T.sub.r is the temperature of the source and T.sub.c is
        the temperature of the cold diode. From these equations, the
        output voltage V.sub.0 for the equilibrium state is given by </p>
      <p>This analysis of the intrinsic power conversion process is
        limited to the energy conversion in the quantum wells of the
        quantum well diodes for the equilibrium state. The practical
        irreversible extrinsic losses of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter and the external solar energy collection system are
        determined on a cost effective basis for each application.
        However, the potential intrinsic reversible efficiency of the
        quantum well diode is a constant factor for each application,
        for each level of solar energy intensity ranging from below the
        level of direct sunlight up to the level for maximum
        concentration, and for each environment within the structural
        and electrical limits on temperature of the materials in the
        quantum well diodes. </p>
      <p>The conversion of thermal energy of each hot electron into
        electromagnetic energy occurs in a time interval that is short
        compared to the relaxation time of dissipative loss sources.
        These loss sources include the dissipative losses from the
        collisions of incoming hot electrons with the crystal lattice of
        the quantum well diodes. The power conversion process and all
        other processes in the reversible thermoelectric converter are
        essentially nondissipative for all interactions, since the
        crystal lattice effectively performs a function of an adiabatic
        thermal barrier. The relaxation time for the transition between
        equilibrium states is sufficiently short so that all the
        processes for the quantum reversible thermoelectric converter of
        the invention approach reversibility. A reversible process is a
        process with an ordered succession of equilibrium states for
        which no dissipative losses occur during the transitions between
        equilibrium states. For the quantum statistics applicable to the
        transitions between energy levels in quantum wells, the
        succession of ordered equilibrium states can occur at a finite
        speed. Therefore, a statistical reversible process can be
        achieved for transitions between the energy levels of quantum
        wells. A reversible circuit element is a circuit element with no
        inherent dissipative losses to prevent the circuit element from
        being a component of a reversible process. A reversible cycle is
        an idealized abstraction in classical thermodynamics, since the
        system is required to move with infinite slowness through a
        succession of equilibrium states in order for the process to be
        reversible. This is not the case for the reversible cycle of the
        present invention, since this reversible cycle is based on
        quantum statistics controlling the energy transitions. As
        discussed in more detail below, the reversible process requires
        that the conversion of thermal energy into electric energy
        occurs in a time that is short compared to the thermal
        relaxation time of the dissipative loss sources. </p>
      <p>It has been demonstrated that tunnel diodes can rectify an
        optical frequencies, and recent work has shown that the electron
        photon thermalization times of hot electrons in devices can be
        longer by two or three orders of magnitude than the hot electron
        barrier crossing time in a tunnel diode. The analysis of the
        barrier crossing time shows the potential for this time to be as
        short as 10.sup.-15 second for tunnel diodes. For the
        measurements being recorded, this barrier crossing time is
        estimated to be of the order of 10.sup.-15 second for a 10
        angstrom thick barrier crossing by a ballistic electron with a
        10.sup.8 cm per second velocity. The response time of the
        quantum reversible thermoelectric converter can be computed
        using the relaxation times of the quantum well diodes. To the
        first order in the expansion of the fluctuation spectrum of the
        reversible thermoelectric converter with electrically equivalent
        hot and cold diodes, the relaxation time t.sub.r is given by </p>
      <p>where T.sub.c is the temperature of the cold diode, C is the
        capacitance of the quantum well diode and A is the saturation
        current for the electrodes of the hot diode. The relaxation time
        t.sub.r is a function of the temperatures T.sub.r and T.sub.c
        for the conversion of solar energy by the quantum reversible
        thermoelectric converter T.sub.r can be as low as 10.sup.-15
        second. This relaxation time is short compared to the relaxation
        time of all dissipative loss sources including the dissipative
        losses from the collisions from incoming hot electrons within
        the crystal lattice of the quantum well diodes. </p>
      <p>The design of the quantum well diodes for the reversible
        thermoelectric converter is a function of the application, and
        the effective temperature and intensity of the source of hot
        electrons. Several applications of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter are discussed below. In an example of a thin film
        metallic quantum well diode suitable for the conversion of solar
        energy concentrated up to 10.sup.7 watts per square meter, layer
        42 (FIGS. 2 and 3) is an evaporated aluminum film having a
        thickness of 140 angstroms, barrier layer 44 is evaporated
        aluminum oxide having a thickness of 12 angstroms and layer 40
        is an evaporated copper film having a thickness of 100
        angstroms. For this energy conversion application, metal
        electrodes are specified since amounts of power as large as
        concentrated solar energy can be delivered by the quantum
        reversible thermoelectric converter. The high power output
        capability results from the large electron carrier density of
        metals, which can be orders of magnitude larger than the most
        heavily doped semiconductors. </p>
      <p>For the electrodes of the quantum well diodes, high
        conductivity metals such as copper, aluminum silver, gold,
        nickel and magnesium provide high carrier densities, large
        oscillator strengths for the energy level transitions and low
        resistance to the output current. For the dielectric material of
        the diode barrier in the quantum well diodes, dielectric
        materials such as Al.sub.2 O.sub.3, SiO.sub.2 and SiO can be
        used. As discussed above, a contact potential V.sub.c =1
        millivolt for copper and aluminum electrodes using concentrated
        solar radiation input intensity is sufficient to obtain a
        practical output voltage with minimum transmission and
        thermalization losses. The contact potential can be varied by
        selection of metals with different work functions. </p>
      <p>For the power conversion of thermal energy having lower
        intensity than concentrated solar energy, the thickness of the
        metal film electrodes can be reduced. Reducing the thickness of
        the electrodes to below 100 angstroms increases the oscillator
        strength, reduces the carrier density and decreases the
        thermalization loss rate for the quantum energy states. As the
        thickness of the diode electrode is reduced, the quantum well
        size decreases and the lifetime of the quantum states is
        lengthened. This increases the thermalization time for lattice
        states so as to further reduce thermalization losses. </p>
      <p>The thermalization time for the quantum states of the quantum
        well diode is also a function of temperature. As described
        below, the heat pump process can be combined with the power
        conversion process in a two-stage reversible thermoelectric
        converter to reduce the temperature of the cold diode in the
        power conversion stage so as to increase the thermalization time
        and thereby reduce thermalization losses. The decrease in
        temperature of the cold quantum well diode increases the
        lifetime of the crystal lattice states and decreases the time
        constant of the quantum well diode, which enables the conversion
        time of the thermal energy to be decreased. </p>
      <p>In order to reduce thermalization loss during energy conversion
        in the reversible thermoelectric converter, the energy
        conversion time t.sub.c can be controlled relative to the
        thermalization time t.sub.ep of all loss sources. Specially, the
        conversion time t.sub.c must be less than the thermalization
        time t.sub.ep. The conversion time t.sub.c is the time that
        energy is stored in the quantum wells of the quantum well diode.
        The conversion time for the reversible conversion of incoming
        thermal energy into output electrical energy must be less than
        the expected lifetime of the quantum states in the quantum well
        diodes. The energy conversion time t.sub.c for an output voltage
        V.sub.o, to deliver an output power P.sub.o is given by: </p>
      <p>where C is the capacitance across the quantum well diodes. As
        indicated in Equation (3) above, the output voltage V.sub.o is
        proportional to the voltage V.sub.c across the cold diode, which
        is the contact potential of the quantum well diode. Equations
        (3) and (5) show that the conversion time t.sub.c is a function
        of the diode contact potential V.sub.c. Thus, the conversion
        time t.sub.c can be reduced by lowering the contact potential
        V.sub.c. Also, for the lower input power levels, the conversion
        time t.sub.c can be maintained less than the thermalization time
        t.sub.ep and the reversible power conversion process can be
        maintained by lowering the contact potential V.sub.c as the
        power level P.sub.o decreases. In general, the voltage V.sub.c
        across the cold diode can be varied in order to maintain the
        conversion time t.sub.c less than the thermalization time
        t.sub.ep by varying the design of the quantum well diode, or by
        applying a suitable voltage to the quantum well diode. </p>
      <p>The discussion thus far has been directed primarily to input
        thermal energy in the form of solar energy at a source
        temperature of 6000.degree. K. It will be understood that the
        reversible thermoelectric converter of the present invention can
        be utilized at a variety of different intensity levels and
        photon energy levels with appropriate scaling. When the input
        thermal energy has a lower temperature, the quantum well
        dimensions are scaled in width and/or depth so that the
        transitions between energy levels near the top of the quantum
        wells are at energy levels corresponding to the energy of the
        photons of the incoming radiation energy. </p>
      <p>Scaling the depth of the quantum wells can be accomplished by
        selecting a material for the diode electrodes with lower
        electron densities. Semiconductor materials can be used in place
        of metals to provide lower electron densities. For example, by
        using heavily doped gallium arsenide, the electron carrier
        density is approximately 10.sup.13 electrons per square
        centimeter. For electrodes having a thickness of 80 angstroms,
        the quantum well depth is approximately 0.3 electron volt. This
        quantum well has three energy levels with transitions between
        energy levels of approximately 0.1 electron volt. This
        transitions are at approximately one-tenth of the energy and
        equivalent temperature of solar photons. The smaller depth
        quantum wells have a maximum absorption strength for much lower
        temperatures. However, there is a decrease in the carrier
        density of the semiconductor quantum well by a factor of 100 and
        a decrease in the oscillator strength by a factor of 10 in
        comparison with metal quantum wells. In addition, a reduction in
        the number of energy levels reduces the number of transitions
        required to transform the incoming voltage of the hot electrons
        down by a factor of 100 to the millivolt levels of the output
        voltage of the reversible thermoelectric converter. </p>
      <p>A preferred technique for absorbing lower temperature photons
        in the quantum wells of the quantum well diodes is to increase
        the thickness of the metal quantum wells. For the example
        described above wherein the metal quantum wells have thicknesses
        of 100 angstroms and 140 angstroms, the transitions between the
        energy levels at the top of the 10 volt metal quantum wells is
        approximately 0.2 volt and 0.3 volt. The thickness of the
        electrodes is increased so as to maximize the absorption
        strength for the temperature of the heat source. Then for the
        selected thickness, Equation (5) is used to determine the value
        of contact potential V.sub.c that is required to maintain
        reversible power conversion for the lower temperature heat
        source. </p>
      <p>The lifetime of the individual quantum state is in the range of
        from approximately 10.sup.-12 second to longer values as a
        function of the quantum well size and the carrier density. For
        the quantum reversible thermoelectric converter, the time
        required for conversion of thermal energy of hot electrons to
        electric energy can be two or three orders of magnitude shorter
        than the estimated lifetime of energy levels of the electron
        standing waves. </p>
      <p>The absorption strength of the metal quantum well diode is
        orders of magnitude better than that for semiconductor solar
        cells. This result follows the order of magnitude improvement in
        the oscillator strength at the required quantum energy levels
        for metallic quantum well diodes in comparison with
        semiconductor diodes. This result, in turn, follows from the
        increase in the dipole moments for the adjacent commensurate
        states in the quantum well diodes in comparison with the
        oscillator strength between adjacent energy levels in
        semiconductor diodes. The large increase in both the absorption
        strength of the thin metal electrodes of the quantum well diode
        and the orders of magnitude increase in the density of electrons
        in the thin metal electrodes of the quantum well diode enables
        the reversible thermoelectric converter of the present invention
        to be orders of magnitude smaller than an equivalent
        semiconductor solar cell. </p>
      <p>A series of experiments was undertaken to determine the
        performance potential of the quantum reversible thermoelectric
        converter of the present invention. Tests were performed with a
        quantum well diode, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, that is designed
        for use in concentrated solar energy. The circuit is shown in
        FIG. 1. Diodes 10 and 20 were fabricated in accordance with the
        example described above, including a 12 angstrom layer of
        aluminum oxide between a 140 angstrom layer of aluminum and a
        100 angstrom layer of copper. Hot electrons were photogenerated
        by nanosecond pulses of visible light directed at diode 10. The
        pulses of light were generated by a Nd:YAG laser. </p>
      <p>The reversible hot electron transitions between the quantum
        well energy levels for a hot electron temperature of
        6000.degree. K. develop a maximum output voltage of 20
        millivolts for the equilibrium state. The available power output
        from the active area of the quantum well diode is 10.sup.7 watts
        per square meter. The intrinsic efficiency of the conversion of
        thermal energy of the hot electrons to electromagnetic energy is
        computed from the measured maximum output voltage of 20
        millivolts and the measured contact potential of the quantum
        well diodes of 1 millivolt. </p>
      <p>The contact potential is obtained from the values of the
        maximum output voltage of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter with each of the quantum well diodes in a separate
        heat reservoir over a range of temperature differences between
        diodes 10 and 20 of 100.degree. K. These measurements are made
        for temperatures of the separate reservoir for diodes 10 and 20
        in the range of 300.degree. K., then from Equation (3) for the
        output voltage, the value of the contact potential is given by
        the measured values of T.sub.r, T.sub.c and V.sub.0 over this
        range of temperatures for diodes 10 and 20. This value of
        contact potential is used in the equation for the value of
        V.sub.0 for the equilibrium state. </p>
      <p>The intrinsic efficiency of the conversion process at the
        equilibrium state output voltage of 20 millivolts is given by </p>
      <p>where V.sub.i is input voltage to diode 10 and where </p>
      <p>Equation (6) gives the power conversion efficiency of the
        increment of electric energy from each hot electron. This
        equation is in terms of voltage only, since the output charge is
        equivalent to the input charge for each voltage transition for
        each ordered succession of incremental changes in the
        equilibrium state. From Equations (6) and (7), the intrinsic
        efficiency is given by </p>
      <p>Using the measured output voltage V.sub.0 of 20 millivolts and
        the measured contact potential V.sub.c of 1 millivolt, the value
        obtained for E is 95%. This is the same value for E as given by
        the Carnot limit, E=(1-T.sub.c /T.sub.r), where T.sub.c is
        300.degree. K. for the cold diode and where T.sub.r is
        6000.degree. K. for the temperature of the source of the
        photogenerated hot electrons. </p>
      <p>The above test used diodes with active diode areas of 10.sup.-4
        cm.sup.2 as convenient to the fabrication and the tests. In the
        theory of the quantum reversible process, the output voltage is
        not dependent on the area of the diode electrodes. The test
        results do not support the existence of any electron
        thermalization process in which any significant fraction of the
        hot electrons is first thermalized to an equilibrium temperature
        for electrons. This thermalization process is not compatible
        with the experimental results, since approximately 10.sup.13
        watts per square meter of input power is needed to heat the
        thermalized electrons to the electron temperature of
        6000.degree. K. for an electron photon thermalization time of
        10.sup.-12 seconds. This electron thermalization process is also
        not a physically realizable process for this input power, since
        the material of the diode is destroyed in less than 10.sup.-12
        seconds by this intensity of incoming photons. This power is 6
        orders of magnitude larger than the test power for the
        conversion process of 10.sup.7 watts per square meter that was
        used in the experiment. These results support the conclusion
        that the thermal energy of the hot electron is directly
        converted into electromagnetic energy before any electron
        thermalization occurs. </p>
      <p>In summary, the measurements of power conversion by the
        reversible processes of the reversible thermoelectric converter
        of the present invention support the predicted theoretical
        results that the conversion occurs in a time less than the
        relaxation time of the energy levels of electron standing waves
        in the quantum well diodes. This conclusion is supported by the
        energy considerations for quantum size effects, heat equation
        results and laser power input. These experimental results also
        support the theoretical result that the thermodynamic cycle of
        the quantum reversible thermoelectric converter is reversible. </p>
      <p>An example of a planar array of reversible thermoelectric
        converter devices for the conversion of solar energy to electric
        energy is shown in FIG. 9. The array includes parallel,
        spaced-apart strip electrodes 102, 104 and 106 formed on a glass
        substrate 108. A dielectric barrier layer 110 is formed over
        electrodes 102, 104 and 106. Parallel, spaced-apart strip
        electrodes 112 and 114 are formed on barrier layer 110.
        Terminals 116 and 118 formed on substrate 108 are attached to
        electrodes 102 and 106, respectively. Reflecting layers 120 and
        122 are formed on portions of strip electrodes 112 and 114 to
        reflect the incoming solar energy from the cool diode in the
        reversible thermoelectric converter. </p>
      <p>In a first embodiment of the planar array, electrodes 102, 104
        and 106 are aluminum films, dielectric barrier 110 is an
        aluminum oxide layer, and electrodes 112 and 114 are copper
        films. A schematic diagram of the first embodiment of the planar
        array of FIG. 9 is shown in FIG. 9A. </p>
      <p>Electrodes 102 and 112 separated by barrier layer 110
        constitute a first diode 113, and electrodes 104 and 112
        separated by barrier layer 110 constitute a second diode 115.
        The first and second diodes 113, 115 have the same electrical
        configuration as the diodes 10 and 20 of FIG. 1 and form a first
        reversible thermoelectric converter array element. The
        electrodes 104 and 114 separated by barrier layer 110 constitute
        a third diode 117, and electrodes 114 and 106 separated by
        barrier layer 110 constitute a fourth diode 119. The third and
        fourth diodes 117, 119 have the same electrical configuration as
        the diodes 10 and 20 of FIG. 1 and form a second reversible
        thermoelectric converter array element. The first and second
        reversible thermoelectric converter array elements are connected
        in series between terminals 116 and 118, as shown in FIG. 9A. </p>
      <p>The first embodiment of the planar array shown in FIG. 9A
        comprises a series connection of two reversible thermoelectric
        converter array elements between terminals 116 and 118. The
        array structure shown in FIG. 9 can be extended to provide
        additional reversible thermoelectric converter array elements
        connected in series and can be extended in a direction
        perpendicular to the plane of FIG. 9 to add reversible
        thermoelectric converter array elements in parallel. The output
        voltage from terminals 116 and 118 increases linearly as the
        number of reversible thermoelectric converter array elements
        connected in series increases, and the current output from
        terminals 116 and 118 increases linearly as additional
        reversible thermoelectric converter array elements are added in
        parallel. </p>
      <p>The output power from terminals 116 and 118 increases linearly
        as the total active area of the array elements increases for a
        constant power input per unit area. From the experimental
        results discussed above, the power output available per square
        centimeter of active area of the quantum well diodes in the
        planar array shown in FIG. 9 is one kilowatt for concentrated
        solar energy input. </p>
      <p>A second embodiment of the planar array, wherein the first
        diode of the reversible thermoelectric converter comprises a
        multiple electrode diode having n pairs of electrodes and the
        second diode comprises a multiple electrode diode having n pairs
        of electrodes, is shown in schematic form in FIG. 9B. A first
        multiple electrode diode 123 comprises diodes 124, 125, 126 and
        127 connected in series. A second multiple electrode diode 128
        comprises diodes 129, 130, 131 and 132 connected in series. The
        multiple electrode diode 123 corresponds to diode 10 shown in
        FIG. 1, and multiple electrode diode 128 corresponds to diode 20
        shown in FIG. 1. Each of the diodes 124-127 and 129-132
        comprises a pair of electrodes. Thus, n=4 for multiple electrode
        diode 123 and n=4 for multiple electrode diode 128. Multiple
        electrode diodes 123 and 128 can be fabricated on the same
        substrate or on different substrates. One significant advantage
        of fabricating multiple electrode diodes 123 and 128 on separate
        substrates is that the multiple electrode diodes can be in
        different locations. Thus, the multiple electrode diode 123 can
        be located in a hot environment to receive incoming radiation,
        and the multiple electrode diode 128 can be located in a cold
        environment. </p>
      <p>In order to implement the multiple electrode diodes 123 and 128
        shown in FIG. 9B, fixed voltage increments must be added to each
        pair of electrodes. For example, diode 126 must operate at a
        higher voltage than diode 127, diode 125 must operate at a
        higher voltage than diode 126, etc. The voltage increments can
        be achieved in several ways. Typically, the electrode pairs of
        each diode are fabricated of the same metal, such as copper.
        Thus, referring again to FIG. 9, electrodes 102, 104, 106, 112
        and 114 are all fabricated of the same metal. </p>
      <p>In a first technique for obtaining voltage increments,
        successively larger doses of ions are implanted in the
        electrodes of each diode in the multiple electrode diode. For
        example, a given number of ions is implanted in electrodes of
        diode 127, a larger number of ions is implanted in the
        electrodes of diode 126, a still larger number of ions is
        implanted in the electrodes of diode 125, etc. </p>
      <p>In the ion implantation technique, ions such as aluminum ions
        are implanted in an insulating layer adjacent to one of the
        electrodes of each successive pair of electrodes. For example,
        with reference to FIG. 9, the increments of charge provided by
        the implanted ions can be implanted in the substrate layer 108
        adjacent to electrodes 102, 104 and 106. In this configuration,
        the electrodes can all be of a common metal such as copper,
        since the implanted ions apply the electric field for the series
        contact potential of each pair of electrodes. The field lines of
        the applied electric field from the charges of the implanted
        ions run from electrode 102 to electrode 112, then to electrode
        104, then to electrode 114 and then to electrode 106. The
        electric field lines cause a contact potential as shown in FIG.
        9C. </p>
      <p>According to a second technique for obtaining the voltage
        increments in the multiple electrode diode, the metal electrodes
        of each diode are doped with atoms of a different material to
        change the ratio of electrons to atoms of the dopant material in
        the metal film. The number of atoms added to the metal film is
        successively increased in diodes 127, 126, 125, etc. </p>
      <p>One example of doping electrodes with atoms of a different
        material to obtain voltage increments involves using a
        bismuth-lead alloy for the electrodes of the diodes in the
        series array and increasing the percentage of bismuth in each
        successive pair of electrodes. This raises the Fermi level for
        each successive pair of electrodes, since bismuth has five
        electrons per atom and lead has four electrons per atom. Thus,
        the required increment of voltage is added to each pair of
        electrodes. </p>
      <p>According to a third technique for obtaining voltage
        increments, materials with successively larger work functions
        are used in the diodes of the multiple electrode diode. Thus,
        for example, the electrodes in diode 126 have a larger work
        function than the electrodes in diode 127, etc. </p>
      <p>According to a fourth technique for obtaining voltage
        increments, electric fields are applied to the diodes in the
        multiple electrode diode to achieve the required voltage
        increments. This technique is described below in connection with
        FIGS. 14 and 14A. It will be understood that the techniques
        described above for providing voltage increments in the multiple
        electrode diode can be used separately or in combination. </p>
      <p>Energy level diagrams for the reversible thermoelectric
        converter of FIG. 9B are shown in FIGS. 9C and 9D. In order to
        simplify the energy level diagrams, each electrode shown in
        FIGS. 9C and 9D represents the electrodes of adjacent diodes
        connected by a conducting lead of the same metal having no
        resistance. The electrodes of diodes 127, 126, 125 and 124 are
        represented by E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5, respectively. Similarly,
        the electrodes of diodes 129, 130, 131 and 132 are represented
        by E5, E6, E7, E8 and E9, respectively. In FIG. 9C, the energy
        levels are shown for the diodes connected in series with fixed
        negative increments of voltage V.sub.ci between the quantum
        wells of the diodes 124-127 of the multiple electrode diode 123.
        Fixed positive voltage increments V.sub.ci are added between the
        quantum wells of the diodes 129-132 of multiple electrode diode
        128. The voltage increments are provided in accordance with the
        techniques described above. The contact potential V.sub.c of
        each of the multiple electrode diodes 123 and 128 is the sum of
        the voltage increments C.sub.ci. </p>
      <p>The energy level diagram of FIG. 9C represents a case where no
        radiation is applied to the hot diode of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter. The sum of the four voltage increments
        V.sub.ci is the effective contact potential V.sub.c of the
        series connection of the four pairs of electrodes. The effective
        contact potential is V.sub.c for multiple electrode diode 123
        and for multiple electrode diode 128. The conversion time
        t.sub.c is reduced by n.sup.2 =16 for the example given where
        n=4. </p>
      <p>The energy level diagram of FIG. 9D illustrates a case where
        thermal energy is input to each of the diodes 124-127 in
        multiple electrode diode 123. The thermal energy increases the
        temperature of the electrons in the quantum wells of the
        electrodes 124-127 so that the ratio of the temperature T.sub.r
        of the multiple electrode diode 123 to the temperature T.sub.c
        of the multiple electrode diode 128 is T.sub.r /T.sub.c =3.
        Substituting this ratio into equation (2) gives the ratio of
        V.sub.ii to V.sub.ci in the energy level diagram, where V.sub.ii
        is the input voltage to each pair of electrodes resulting from
        the input of thermal energy. As shown in FIG. 9D, the resulting
        output voltage V.sub.o of the multiple electrode diode 123 and
        multiple electrode diode 128 is V.sub.o =2V.sub.c. </p>
      <p>The series connection of reversible thermoelectric converter
        array elements as shown in FIG. 9 permits independent control of
        output voltage and contact potential in the diodes of each array
        element. By using array elements connected in series, the
        desired array output voltage V.sub.oa can directly be obtained.
        The relation between the power output and the voltage output of
        each array element enables the reversible power conversion to be
        achieved by the planar array shown in FIG. 9 for each
        application. </p>
      <p>The requirements for the planar array to achieve reversible
        power conversion are 1) a conversion time t.sub.c must be less
        than the thermalization time t.sub.ep, and 2) the voltage to
        current ratio must be sufficient for the transmission of the
        power output of the first diode to the second diode of the array
        element with a minimum heat loss. </p>
      <p>To meet the first requirement for each array element the value
        of V.sub.ii.sup.2 /P.sub.ii is maintained less than the value of
        2t.sub.ep /C, where V.sub.ii is the input voltage to each pair
        of electrodes, P.sub.ii is the power input to each pair of
        electrodes, and C is the capacitance of each pair of electrodes
        in the array element. This requirement follows from equation (5)
        and the requirement that the conversion time t.sub.c be less
        than the thermalization time t.sub.ep. </p>
      <p>To meet the second requirement for each array element, the
        value of the ratio V.sub.o.sup.2 /P.sub.o is maintained greater
        than the value R, where V.sub.o is the output voltage, P.sub.o
        is the output power of the array element and R is the resistance
        of the conducting lead between the first and second diodes of
        the array element. This limit on the minimum value of V.sub.o
        insures that the heat power loss in the conducting lead between
        the first diode and the second diode of the array element is
        minimized. </p>
      <p>To meet the second requirement for each array element, the
        first diode and the second diode of each array element can be
        comprised of a series array of n pairs of electrodes, with each
        pair of electrodes meeting the requirement for maintaining the
        ratio of V.sub.ii.sup.2 /P.sub.ii less than the value of
        2t.sub.ep /C and the second requirement for maintaining the sum
        of the output voltage from the n pairs of electrodes greater
        than the value of R, the number n of pairs of electrodes must be
        larger than the value given by RC/t.sub.ep. </p>
      <p>The input voltage to each pair of electrodes is V.sub.i /n, and
        the energy stored in each pair of electrodes is proportional to
        (V.sub.i /n).sup.2, where V.sub.i is the input voltage to an
        array element. In the series array, the total stored energy for
        each pair of electrodes is reduced by a factor of n.sup.2 for a
        given output voltage V.sub.o for each array element, and the
        conversion time t.sub.c for each array element is reduced by a
        factor of n.sup.2 in comparison with the configuration where a
        single pair of electrodes is used for the first diode and a
        single pair of electrodes is used for the second diode to
        provide an output voltage V.sub.o. </p>
      <p>In designing an array of reversible thermoelectric converters,
        the contact potential V.sub.ci is selected to maintain the
        conversion time t.sub.c less than the thermalization time
        t.sub.ep as discussed above. Then the number n of electrodes for
        the multiple electrode diode 123 and the multiple electrode
        diode 128 to obtain the desired output voltage V.sub.o is
        selected. The configuration shown in FIG. 9B comprises a single
        thermoelectric converter array element that is functionally
        equivalent to FIG. 1. Multiple array elements of the type shown
        in FIG. 9B can be connected in series as shown in FIG. 9A to
        provide increased output voltage. The number of array elements
        connected in series is selected to obtain a desired array output
        voltage V.sub.oa. </p>
      <p>The above-described technique for selecting contact potential
        V.sub.ci, the number n of pairs of electrodes in each array
        element and number of array elements in series is applicable to
        all energy intensity levels and all temperature levels. This
        technique permits operation of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter of the invention at relatively low intensity levels
        and low temperature levels. At lower temperature levels, the
        technique can be used in conjunction with the above-described
        technique for increasing the thickness of the quantum wells of
        the quantum well diodes as a function of the incoming energy so
        as to maximize the absorption strength of the quantum well
        diodes. </p>
      <p>A further option with respect to the planar array described
        above is to increase the fraction of the planar array area that
        is used by the multiple electrode diode 123 (that corresponds to
        diode 10 in FIG. 1). This is achieved by increasing the contact
        potential increment V.sub.ci for the multiple electrode diode
        128 (which corresponds to diode 20 in FIG. 1) up to the limit
        established by the ratio of the input temperature T.sub.r to the
        cold reservoir temperature T.sub.c. The ratio of the energy
        stored in the multiple electrode diode 123 to the energy stored
        in the multiple electrode diode 128 is given by the temperature
        ratio T.sub.r /T.sub.c. The increase in the contact potential
        increment V.sub.ci up to the limit set by the ratio T.sub.r
        /T.sub.c in turn establishes a limit of the ratio of the areas
        of the multiple electrode diode 123 to the area of the multiple
        electrode diode 128. </p>
      <p>A second option with respect to the planar array is to increase
        the output voltage V.sub.o by increasing the number n of pairs
        of electrodes without an increase in the output current of the
        array element. The increase in the ratio of the output voltage
        to the output current permits the multiple electrode diodes 123
        and 128 to be separated, while maintaining a minimum resistive
        loss. Thus, the multiple electrode diode 123 for receiving
        thermal energy for the power conversion or heat pump process has
        maximum area at the receiving location. The configuration with
        separated hot and cold diodes is preferred in applications such
        as positioning the hot diode inside a furnace, and the cold
        diode outside the furnace, or the hot diode on a home roof and
        the cold diode inside the home. </p>
      <p>A further option with respect to the planar array is to use
        different numbers of pairs of electrodes in the hot multiple
        electrode diode 123 and the cold multiple electrode diode 128 so
        as to transform the voltage-to-current ratio of the input energy
        of the hot electrons to the required voltage-to-current ratio of
        the output energy. This configuration can be used to transform
        the energy of optical photons incoming to the multiple electrode
        diode 123 to energy outgoing from the multiple electrode diode
        128 with a voltage level ranging from below one millivolt to the
        electron voltage level of optical photons. </p>
      <p>A nonplanar reversible thermoelectric converter circuit is
        shown in FIG. 10. In the nonplanar circuit, the quantum well
        diodes are fabricated in a vertical stacked array. A quantum
        well diode comprising electrode layers 136 and 138 separated by
        a barrier layer 140 corresponds to diode 10 in FIG. 1. A quantum
        well diode comprising electrodes 142 and 144 separated by a
        barrier layer 146 corresponds to diode 20 in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The upper diode is separated from the lower diode by a barrier
        layer 148. Barrier layer 148 can be an insulating layer of thick
        dielectric material such as aluminum oxide; a capacitance layer
        of thin dielectric material such as aluminum oxide; a
        nondissipative conducting layer such as indium tin oxide; or a
        layer with conducting energy bands or resonant quantum well
        tunneling at the low and ambient electron energy levels. The
        layers of the nonplanar reversible thermoelectric converter
        shown in FIG. 10 are evaporated on a glass substrate 150. The
        terminals of the reversible thermoelectric converter are
        terminal 152 for electrode 136, terminal 154 for electrode 138,
        terminal 156 for electrode 142 and terminal 158 for electrode
        144. </p>
      <p>In the nonplanar reversible thermoelectric converter of FIG.
        10, electrode 136 can be a 100 angstrom evaporated copper film,
        barrier layer 140 can be a 12 angstrom evaporated aluminum oxide
        film, electrode 138 can be a 140 angstrom evaporated aluminum
        film, barrier layer 148 can be a 700 angstrom deposited indium
        tin oxide transparent conducting film, electrode 142 can be a
        280 angstrom evaporated aluminum film, barrier layer 146 can be
        a 12 angstrom evaporated aluminum oxide film and electrode 144
        can be a 140 angstrom evaporated copper film. Terminal 154 is
        typically connected to terminal 156. For this embodiment of the
        invention, 1 kilowatt of output power is available per square
        centimeter of active area of the quantum well-diodes. </p>
      <p>For both planar and nonplanar reversible thermoelectric
        converter circuits, it is understood that layers can be used
        over the top layer or under the bottom layer of the first diode
        in the reversible thermoelectric converter circuit for
        concentration, antireflection or trapping of incoming solar
        .energy, or for the conduction of circuit current. The radiation
        resistant and heat resistant common metals used in the quantum
        wells of the reversible thermoelectric converter circuit permit
        a wide selection of additional layers as to shape, flexibility
        and texture. These options also include the use of minimum size
        solar concentrators, antireflection coatings and textured solar
        trapping cover glasses and substrates. </p>
      <p>The transparent conduction layers can include conduction layers
        that can also function as antireflection coatings and trapping
        layers such as, for example, an indium tin oxide layer which can
        be added over the top electrodes of the first diode. Also,
        conduction and trapping layers can be added under the bottom
        electrodes of the first diode in the planar array of FIG. 9.
        When the conduction and trapping layer for the nonplanar array
        is under the bottom electrode of the first diode, the conduction
        layer functions as the barrier layer 148 shown in FIG. 10. </p>
      <p>The conduction layers for trapping of incoming radiation of any
        wavelength and intensity can meet the widest range of
        applications and environments. In addition to the options for
        trapping, these options include options for maximizing the power
        conversion of a wide spectrum of intensities and wavelengths of
        incoming thermal radiation. </p>
      <p>One of these options is adding pairs of electrodes over the top
        electrodes and under the bottom electrodes of the first diode of
        the planar or nonplanar array elements, where the added pairs of
        electrodes are connected in series and are spaced by transparent
        conduction layers to provide additional trapping path length.
        Each pair of electrodes has the required fixed increment of
        contact potential for the series array, and each pair has the
        required thickness of the quantum well for each electrode pair
        to provide the required absorption band. </p>
      <p>For each application and environment, trapping layers can be
        added as a supplement or as an alternative to the conduction
        layers. One alternative or supplement is a textured substrate to
        increase the trapping path length, as described in the
        aforementioned article in Solar Cells. In this trapping option,
        the planar arrays are placed on the surface of a grating array
        which makes a steep angle with the incoming radiation so as to
        achieve the required multiple reflections with the required
        longer path length. The trapping path length of the incoming
        radiation is a function of the angle of the surface of the
        grating array. </p>
      <p>Another alternative or supplementary option to supply an added
        trapping layer is disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No.
        4,004,210. Micrometer size curved reflecting surfaces are used
        to direct and focus incoming thermal radiation through
        micrometer size holes or slits to trap the radiation in a cavity
        between the trapping layer and the top electrode of the first
        diode in the planar array. For this option, the added path
        length of the trapped radiation is a function of the
        concentration level of the incoming thermal radiation that is
        obtained by the curved reflecting surfaces. </p>
      <p>Any of the above options or combination of options for added
        layers can be added to the reversible thermoelectric converter
        circuit of the present invention. The requirements of the
        application and environment determine the options, if any,
        needed to achieve the maximum performance. </p>
      <p>An important application of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter is as an electro-optical amplifier. One embodiment of
        this application is a two-stage amplifier in which a first stage
        serves to cool the input of a second stage as shown in FIG. 11.
        A reversible thermoelectric converter includes second stage
        quantum well diodes 10 and 20 as shown in FIG. 1. A cooling
        stage includes quantum well diode 160 connected in parallel with
        diode 20 at terminal 22 by conducting lead 162 and connected to
        terminal 164 by conducting lead 166. The performance equations
        for the two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter show that
        as the effective input temperature of diode 20 is lowered by the
        cooling stage, the gain of the second stage comprising diodes 10
        and 20 is increased. The analysis shows a potential gain in
        power of up to 40 dB for the two-stage reversible thermoelectric
        converter as the input temperature of diode 20 is lowered to
        60.degree. K. The cooling stage, including diodes 20 and 160 in
        FIG. 11, enables the two-stage amplifier to amplify incoming
        energy that is below the noise level at room temperature. </p>
      <p>The cooling stage also enables the amplifier circuit to obtain
        a 40 dB increase in the signal level so that signal levels below
        the noise level at room temperature can be amplified for signal
        levels and signal frequencies approaching that for an optical
        amplifier. To obtain this gain, a ratio of 100 must be
        maintained between the temperature of the hot electrons in diode
        10 and the temperature of the cold electrons in diode 20. This
        ratio is obtained at a 60.degree. K. temperature of cold
        electrons in diode 20 when the electrons in diode 10 are heated
        to a temperature of 6000.degree. K. by applied electrical energy
        or by incoming visible thermal radiation. To maintain this
        temperature for diode 20, diode 160 and diode 20 are operated as
        a heat pump so as to cool diode 20. The heat pump acts as a
        refrigerator device for diode 20. A DC current is applied from
        terminal 24 through diode 20 and diode 160 to terminal 164. The
        power input to the refrigeration cycle is given in part by the
        product of the input DC current and the contact potential
        V.sub.c across diode 20. The other part of the power input to
        the refrigeration cycle is the heat energy input to diode 20
        from the heat reservoir in thermal contact with diode 20. For a
        refrigeration cycle operating between the 300.degree. K.
        temperature of diode 160 and the 60.degree. K. temperature of
        diode 20, the coefficient of refrigeration performance for the
        reversible thermoelectric converter is given by 60.degree.
        K./(300.degree. K.-60.degree. K.) so that for this operating
        range, the coefficient of refrigeration performance is 1/4. The
        power input for the heat pump P.sub.hp is given by P.sub.hp
        =4P.sub.h, where P.sub.h is the heat power required to be
        removed from diode 20. </p>
      <p>One important group of applications of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter of the present invention is for power
        conversion where the heat source is fossil fuel, nuclear,
        geothermal, waste heat, or any other fuel source. In this case,
        the temperature of the immediate environment can approach the
        maximum temperature generated by the fuel. In general, these
        applications are referred to as furnace applications. The
        physical environment is such that the reversible thermoelectric
        converter is located where the temperature is higher than room
        temperature T.sub.c =300.degree. K., where T.sub.c is the
        temperature of the thermal reservoir for the cold diode 20. An
        example of the location of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter is in the wall of a furnace so as to intercept the
        maximum amount of thermal radiation at the highest temperature,
        and also to maintain a close thermal contact with the thermal
        reservoir for diode 20. The reversible thermoelectric converter
        is protected by a multilayer thermal conduction and convection
        shield comprised of closely-spaced thin film layers which are
        transparent to the incoming thermal radiation. </p>
      <p>In the furnace application, the heat sources have temperatures
        in a range from 6000.degree. K. down to temperatures below
        400.degree. K. The design of the quantum well diodes for each
        application must be in accordance with the design principles
        discussed above for different temperatures and intensity levels.
        The material and thickness of the electrodes of the quantum well
        diodes are selected to provide quantum level energy transitions
        for maximum oscillator strengths at the energy level of the
        incoming photons from the furnace. </p>
      <p>The protective thermal barrier, if needed for protection from
        the environment, is a lightweight, thin film thermal barrier
        layer designed to serve as a protective layer against damage
        from the heat source. The thermal barrier is placed to enable
        the reversible thermoelectric converter to intercept the maximum
        amount of thermal energy at the highest temperature from the
        heat source and to approach the maximum efficiency of the
        highest temperature, while maintaining the temperature of the
        cold diode at T.sub.c =300.degree. K. The protective shield
        intercepts negligible thermal heat on all exposed surfaces other
        than the active area of diode 10 by the use of such reflective
        materials as the reflective layers 120, 122 shown in FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>In a first furnace embodiment, the reversible thermoelectric
        converter is used at the highest temperature potentially
        available from sources of thermal radiation, a solar furnace. A
        planar array, which can be fabricated in accordance with the
        above example for solar radiation, is coated with an oxide
        coating, such as aluminum oxide having a thickness of 500
        angstroms, to protect the array for extended periods. For lower
        temperature ranges of 1000.degree. K. to 2000.degree. K., a thin
        transparent film such as quartz can be used for protection. </p>
      <p>When the reversible thermoelectric converter is operated in an
        AC mode within a thermal barrier enclosure, such as a furnace
        environment as described above, each diode operates
        alternatively as a heat source and a heat sink for the other
        diode. Thus, a thermal reservoir is required for each diode. The
        transported thermal energy is the same for the power conversion
        cycle from diode 10 to diode 20 and for the heat pump cycle from
        diode 20 to diode 10. The same amount of heat is removed from
        the thermal reservoir of diode 20 during the heat pump cycle as
        the amount of energy that is added to the thermal reservoir
        during the power conversion cycle. </p>
      <p>In order to provide high AC power output at low AC frequencies,
        a larger thermal reservoir than that provided by the electrodes
        of the quantum well diodes is required. The larger thermal
        reservoir can be metal layers contiguous to a potential barrier
        that is deposited on the electrodes of the quantum well diodes.
        These metal layers operate as a source and a sink for hot
        electrons in the heat pump cycle. </p>
      <p>An embodiment of a planar array of reversible thermoelectric
        converters having thermal reservoirs for the power conversion
        process inside a thermally-insulated enclosure such as a furnace
        environment is shown in FIG. 12. Metal strips 202, 203, 204 and
        205 are deposited on a substrate 210, which can be glass. The
        metal strips 202, 203, 204 and 205 can, for example, be aluminum
        having a thickness in the range of 100 angstroms to 10
        micrometers. The substrate 210 is flexible and is supported in
        tension inside the thermal enclosure within the furnace to
        minimize heat loss by conduction. A potential barrier 212 is
        deposited over metal strips 202, 203, 204 and 205. The potential
        barrier 212 can, for example, be an aluminum oxide dielectric
        film having a thickness of 10 angstroms. The remaining elements
        of the planar array are fabricated on potential barrier 212. The
        remainder of the planar array, including aluminum electrodes
        102, 104 and 106, aluminum oxide barrier layer 110, copper
        electrodes 112 and 114, terminals 116 and 118 and reflecting
        aluminum layers 120 and 122, has the same configuration
        described above in connection with FIG. 9. </p>
      <p>The metal strips 202, 203, 204 and 205 are the thermal
        reservoirs for the respective diodes of the planar array. The
        potential barrier 212 allows the transfer of hot electrons to
        and from electrodes 102, 104 and 106. The volume and specific
        heat required for metal strips 202, 203, 204 and 205 for a
        specific application are determined from the power output and
        the AC frequency. From the frequency and the power output, the
        amount of heat stored during the heat cycle is determined. As
        the thickness of the metal strips 202, 203, 204 and 205
        increases, the frequency of the AC power conversion can be
        decreased to the range of commercial AC transmission. </p>
      <p>For AC operation within a thermal enclosure such as a furnace,
        some energy loss occurs during the fraction of the power
        conversion-heat pump cycle that is used for operation of the
        heat pump cycle. The energy loss and the options for reducing
        such loss are a function of the AC frequency and the power
        output in each furnace environment. At the highest AC conversion
        frequencies where the period of the AC conversion cycle and the
        circuit response time are less than the electron thermalization
        time, all incoming energy is converted into electric energy
        output during each AC period before any loss from electron
        thermalization occurs. Therefore, the maximum use of available
        energy in the furnace environment is achieved. </p>
      <p>The same result can be obtained for lower AC frequencies by
        reducing the fraction of the period of the AC conversion cycle
        required for the heat pump cycle. By scaling the dimensions of
        the electrodes or the current collection grid of the quantum
        well diodes in an array of reversible thermoelectric converters,
        the current capacity of the reversible thermoelectric converter
        circuit can be increased by the amount needed to transport the
        thermal energy from diode 20 during a short heat pump cycle
        needed to maintain the temperature of diode 20 at the level of
        the outside cool reservoir. Alternatively, mechanical, optical
        or electro-optical techniques can be used to block absorption of
        the incoming thermal radiation from the reversible
        thermoelectric converter during the brief intervals required for
        the heat pump cycle to remove thermal energy from diode 20. </p>
      <p>The available location within the furnace determines the size
        and shape of the power conversion reversible thermoelectric
        converter array. In one embodiment, two thin, lighweight, flat
        arrays are supported in tension, back-to-back by a thin
        supporting frame of a heat resistant material such as tungsten.
        One array performs power conversion, and the other array acts as
        a heat pump. The reversible thermoelectric converter arrays are
        protected within a thermal enclosure such that the temperature
        of the array approaches the maximum temperature of the source
        while the arrays are thermally protected against unusable
        convection heat by transparent, closely-spaced thin films in
        front of the active areas of the quantum well diodes. The arrays
        are also thermally protected against unusable wavelengths of
        incoming thermal radiation using a thin layer that is closely
        spaced in front of the active areas of the quantum well diodes.
        The thin layer can be covered with a radiation absorbing metal
        film to convert the unusable wavelength of thermal radiation
        into a usable wavelength. </p>
      <p>A schematic diagram of a two-stage reversible thermoelectric
        converter suitable for use in a furnace environment is shown in
        FIG. 13. It will be understood that each reversible
        thermoelectric converter is typically implemented as a planar
        array as described above. A reversible thermoelectric converter
        comprising diodes 220 and 222 performs the power conversion
        function, and a reversible thermoelectric converter comprising
        diodes 224 and 226 performs the heat pump function. Diodes 220
        and 222 are connected to output terminals 230 and 232,
        respectively, and are connected to each other via terminals 234
        and 236. Diodes 224 and 226 are connected to output terminals
        240 and 242, respectively, and are connected to each other via
        terminals 244 and 246. Power conversion terminals 230 and 232
        provide output power as described above. A DC source is
        connected to terminals 240 and 242 to reverse the normal
        direction of current flow through diodes 224 and 226. Diodes 222
        and 224 are enclosed in a quasi-static heat reservoir 250 at a
        temperature T.sub.o, diode 220 is enclosed in a quasi-static
        heat reservoir 252, and diode 226 is enclosed in a quasi-static
        heat reservoir 254. Diodes 220, 222 and 224 together with heat
        reservoirs 250 and 252 are enclosed within a quasi-static heat
        reservoir 256. </p>
      <p>The heat reservoir 256 is the thermally-insulated enclosure
        formed by thermal barriers and thermal shields inside the
        furnace. The volume within the thermally-insulated enclosure
        acts as a quasi-static heat reservoir for operation of the power
        conversion cycle of the reversible thermoelectric converter
        within the furnace. The wavelengths of incident thermal
        radiation absorbed by diode 220 are the only significant
        incoming or outgoing thermal heat to the interior of the heat
        reservoir 256. Within the heat reservoir 256, heat reservoir 252
        operates as a heat reservoir for diode 220 during the power
        conversion cycle. Heat reservoir 250 operates as a heat
        reservoir for diodes 220 and 224 during the power conversion and
        heat pump cycles. Heat reservoir 254, which is at the cool
        temperature of the output power for the power conversion-heat
        pump cycle, operates at the output temperature T.sub.c. The
        output temperature T.sub.c of diode 226 and the temperature
        T.sub.r of the heat source for the incoming radiation determine
        the power conversion efficiency for the power conversion cycle.
      </p>
      <p>In the furnace applications of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter, resistive losses in the connecting leads can be
        significant. In order to minimize such losses, it is desirable
        to minimize the length of conducting leads and to maximize the
        voltage generated by the reversible thermoelectric converter.
        The contact potential V.sub.c of the quantum well diode is a
        function of the different work functions of the materials used
        in the electrodes. The output voltage of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter can be increased as shown in FIGS. 9,
        9A, 9B, 9C and 9D and described above. </p>
      <p>A series array of quantum well diodes having voltage increments
        added by an applied electric field is shown in FIG. 14. An
        equivalent circuit diagram is shown in FIG. 14A. The
        configuration shown in FIGS. 14 and 14A corresponds to one of
        the multiple electrode diodes 123 or 128 shown in FIG. 9B and
        described above. </p>
      <p>Auxiliary electrodes 270, 271 and 272 are deposited on glass
        substrate 108. A terminal 276 is in electrical contact with
        electrode 270, and a terminal 278 is in electrical contact with
        electrode 272. The auxiliary electrodes 270, 271 and 272 and
        terminals 276 and 278 can be an aluminum film 200 angstroms
        thick. The planar array including electrodes 102, 104, 106, 112
        and 114, dielectric layer 110 and terminals 116 and 118, as
        described above in connection with FIG. 9, is positioned over
        electrodes 270, 271 and 272. The planar array is separated from
        electrodes 270, 271, 272 by an insulating layer 274, which can
        be an aluminum oxide layer having a thickness of 500 angstroms.
        The electrodes 102, 104 and 106 are aligned with electrodes 270,
        271 and 272, respectively and preferably have the same
        dimensions. </p>
      <p>A schematic diagram of the planar array of FIG. 14 is shown in
        FIG. 14A. As discussed previously in connection with FIG. 9,
        electrodes 102, 104, 106, 112 and 114 define series-connected
        diodes 280, 281, 282 and 283. A high impedance resistor 284 is
        connected between electrodes 271 and 270, and a high impedance
        resistor 285 is connected between electrodes 271 and 272. A
        voltage applied between terminals 278 and 276 results in
        successively larger voltages applied to electrodes 270, 271 and
        272. Thus, equal increments of electric field are applied to
        diodes 280-283. The electrodes 102, 104, 106, 112 and 114 are
        typically of the same metal, such as copper. The configuration
        shown in FIGS. 14 and 14A represents one multiple electrode
        diode of a reversible thermoelectric converter, such as diode 10
        in FIG. 1. A similar configuration is used for the second
        multiple electrode diode of the reversible thermoelectric
        converter. Two multiple electrode diodes as shown in FIGS. 14
        and 14A can be used to form an array element of a reversible
        thermoelectric converter. The array elements can be connected in
        series as shown in FIG. 9A to obtain an increased output
        voltage. </p>
      <p>For applications where there is a requirement for time-varying
        voltage increments that are added by an applied electric field,
        the time constant of the RC circuit of the auxiliary electrodes
        shown in FIGS. 14 and 14A can be varied to meet this
        requirement. As an alternative to a discrete component circuit,
        a high impedance resistive film connected to terminals 276 and
        278 can be used to replace the auxiliary electrodes 270, 271 and
        272 shown in FIG. 14 and the high impedance resistors 284 and
        285 shown in FIG. 14A. The capacitance between each localized
        region of the resistive film and the series planar array applies
        the electric field to add the voltage increments when a voltage
        is applied between terminals 276 and 278. </p>
      <p>To permit the resistive film RC circuit or the discrete
        component RC circuit of FIG. 14 to be used as one of the layers
        in the protective, trapping or antireflection layers on the top
        of a series planar array, an insulating transparent protective
        layer such as aluminum oxide is deposited over the planar array.
        A transparent resistive film or a transparent discrete RC
        circuit is deposited over the transparent protective layer. The
        terminals for the transparent resistive film or the transparent
        discrete component RC circuit are located adjacent to terminals
        116 and 118 and over electrodes 102 and 106, respectively. </p>
      <p>In a second option having the lowest RC time constant using a
        capacitance circuit, the voltage increments are obtained by an
        applied electric field which adds a voltage increment to each
        electrode pair that is inversely proportional to the capacitance
        across each quantum well electrode pair. In the second option of
        the series planar array, the auxiliary electrodes 270 and 272
        and the terminals 276 and 278 are used. The voltage applied
        between terminals 276 and 278 is capacitively coupled by
        auxiliary electrodes 270 and 272 to electrodes 102 and 106,
        respectively, of the planar array. </p>
      <p>In the second option, with the auxiliary electrodes on either
        the top layer or the bottom layer of the planar array, the
        response time to the voltage that is applied between terminals
        276 and 278 can be as short as the response time of the
        reversible thermoelectric converter of the present invention.
        The time constant of each option of the series planar array is
        given by the product of the total series resistance times the
        total series capacitance of the n pairs of electrodes connected
        in series. The time constant is independent of the number of
        array elements in the series planar array, since the series
        resistance increases in proportion to the number of pairs of
        electrodes, and the series capacitance decreases in proportion
        to the number of pairs of electrodes. The time constant for the
        planar array circuit therefore reduces to the conversion time
        t.sub.c for the reversible thermoelectric converter as given by
        Equation (5), so that the value of t.sub.c can be maintained at
        a value less than 10.sup.-12 seconds. </p>
      <p>In the second option, the n pairs of electrodes, each pair with
        a capacitance C, are connected in series to terminals 276 and
        278 with a capacitance C.sub.0 between auxiliary electrodes 270
        and 272 and electrodes 102 and 106, respectively, as shown in
        FIG. 14. The total sum of the voltage increments added to the
        pairs of electrodes is given by the ratio C.sub.0 /(C.sub.0
        +C/n) times the voltage applied between terminals 276 and 278.
        As a result of the fast response time with maximum efficiency,
        together with the ultra light weight of the planar arrays, the
        second option is preferred for the power conversion of solar
        energy in space for applications such as the amplification and
        broadcasting of high frequency power output for high definition
        television (HDTV) or for directed beams of output solar power or
        environmental data using radio waves. </p>
      <p>In the second option, as well as in all embodiments for adding
        varying voltage increments to the series arrays of reversible
        thermoelectric converters, when the electrodes of the series
        planar array are made of the same metal, with the same Fermi
        level and the same work function, the polarity of the contact
        potential V.sub.c is reversed when the applied electric field is
        reversed, resulting in a reversal of the output voltage V.sub.0.
        Thus, an AC output voltage can be obtained, using any of the
        embodiments for adding varying increments of voltage to a series
        array, by a periodic reversal of the voltage applied to
        terminals 276 and 278. </p>
      <p>For applications of the second option to high frequency output
        power or signals, two series arrays as shown in FIGS. 14 and 14A
        are connected as shown in FIG. 1 to form an array element of a
        reversible thermoelectric converter. AC voltage inputs of
        opposite polarity at the required output frequency are applied
        to the terminals 276 and 278 of the two series arrays. The
        maximum amplitude of the AC voltage input to terminals 276 and
        278 for the two series arrays is given by Equation (5) as the
        maximum value of V.sub.0 for which the conversion time is less
        than the electron thermalization time. </p>
      <p>For applications of the second option to amplifying incoming
        signals, a DC voltage is applied between terminals 276 and 278.
        The DC voltage meets the same condition for the maximum value
        given by Equation (5) for V.sub.0 for the amplified output
        voltage of the maximum incoming signal. The DC voltage is used
        as the applied input voltage to terminals 276 and 278 of the
        first and second multiple electrode diodes of a reversible
        thermoelectric converter. The incoming AC signal is applied to
        terminals 276 and 278 of the cold first multiple electrode diode
        at temperature T.sub.c. The solar energy is incident on the hot
        second multiple electrode diode at temperature T.sub.r. </p>
      <p>For an extended series and parallel connection of reversible
        thermoelectric converter array elements, each comprised of first
        and second multiple electrode diodes as shown in FIGS. 14 and
        14A, a desired output voltage can be obtained from the series
        connection of array elements and a desired output current can be
        obtained from the parallel connection of array elements. For an
        extended array in which the intensity and temperature of the
        input thermal energy are varying with time over the area of the
        total planar array, the voltage applied to each section of the
        array can be varied as required to achieve optimum performance
        for each section of the array. </p>
      <p>Also, optimum performance can be achieved for each section of
        the planar array using variable applied voltage to control the
        contact potential in the planar array structure of FIG. 9. A
        transparent auxiliary electrode is affixed to the top of the
        planar array, and an auxiliary electrode is affixed to the
        bottom of the planar array shown in FIG. 9. In this
        configuration, the reflecting layers 120 and 122 and the
        electrodes are fabricated of the same metal, and the contact
        potential of the array element corresponds to the voltage
        applied between the auxiliary electrodes. </p>
      <p>For each section of an array using planar arrays as shown in
        FIGS. 14 and 14A and described above, the application of a
        varying voltage between the terminals 276 and 278 permits the
        total contact potential of n pairs of electrodes to be varied in
        proportion to the applied voltage. Also, for each section of an
        array using the planar array structure shown in FIG. 9 in which
        the work function of each electrode is the same, the application
        of a varying voltage between auxiliary electrodes above and
        below the planar array permits the contact potential for each
        diode of the array section to be varied in proportion to the
        applied voltage. </p>
      <p>For all of the array embodiments using electrodes fabricated of
        the same metal, AC output power can be obtained without storing
        thermal energy during the AC cycle. </p>
      <p>The variable contact potential options described above are in
        addition to the fixed contact potential options, such as
        obtained by the use of implanted ions or metal alloys. The fixed
        increments of contact potential are used for applications that
        do not require variable applied contact potential. Examples of
        applications of variable applied contact potential are to vary
        the contact potential V.sub.c as a function of varying
        temperature and/or intensity of the input thermal energy, or to
        vary the contact potential V.sub.c to obtain AC output power
        without storing thermal energy during the AC cycle. </p>
      <p>In the furnace application, the cool diode of the reversible
        thermoelectric converter can be separated from the hot diode, so
        that the hot diode is located on the inside surface of the
        furnace wall and the cool diode is located outside the furnace
        in thermal contact with the cold heat reservoir. This separation
        is achieved by increasing the voltage to current ratio of the
        series array as described above. For example, with reference to
        FIG. 13, where diodes 224 and 226 remove power conversion heat
        loss from diode 222, diode 226 can be removed from the furnace
        environment to a cold reservoir. In a similar manner, diodes 222
        and 226 can be removed from the furnace environment, and diode
        224 can be placed in close thermal contact with diode 220 so as
        to operate either in a power conversion-heat pump cycle or in a
        dual thermal band power conversion cycle. This configuration is
        used for obtaining maximum efficiency and/or the maximum power
        output for the power conversion cycle. Operating in the heat
        pump cycle, the diode 224 improves power conversion performance
        by lowering the temperature of diode 220. Operating in the dual
        thermal band power conversion cycle, diode 224 improves power
        conversion performance by increasing available power output for
        a second lower temperature band of incoming heat through heat
        reservoir 256. For the dual thermal band power conversions
        cycle, diode 220, which converts the high temperature heat band,
        uses series array electrodes of high temperature metals such as
        tungsten to intercept all the incoming thermal radiation in the
        high temperature band. Diode 224, which converts the lower
        temperature band, is in close thermal contact with diode 220 and
        uses a series planar array of electrodes designed for the lower
        temperature range. Diode 224 can also include thermal reservoirs
        for the power conversion process, corresponding to metal strips
        202-205 in FIG. 12, and has a series planar array of electrodes
        for adding voltage increments corresponding to that shown, for
        example, in FIG. 14. The use of thermal reservoirs allows the
        reversible transfer of hot electrons to and from the electrodes
        of diode 220 and the electrodes of diode 224. The ability to
        vary voltage increments applied to the series array,
        corresponding to that shown in FIG. 14, permits the performance
        of the two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter for a power
        conversion-heat pump cycle or for a dual thermal band power
        conversion cycle to be optimized. The option to generate AC
        output power can be used in the furnace environment for
        transmission of conversion energy outside the furnace
        environment, using either thermally insulated conducting leads
        or capacitive coupling of the conversion energy between heat
        reservoirs. </p>
      <p>The planar array of reversible thermoelectric converters of the
        present invention can be utilized in a lightweight, highly
        efficient space module array for solar energy conversion or as
        an amplifier. For the space environment, no thermal insulation
        of the space module array is required, except for the nonactive
        surfaces that are exposed to direct sunlight. The absorption of
        solar energy by the nonactive surfaces is minimized by a
        reflective surface coating such as aluminum. The low temperature
        space environment enables the power conversion-heat pump
        thermodynamic cycle for the reversible thermoelectric converter
        to be operated near maximum efficiency. The incident solar
        energy that is absorbed by the nonactive area of the array is
        very small, and the power loss due to the incremental change in
        temperature is not a significant factor in the power output.
        Planar arrays of reversible thermoelectric converters with a
        thin film construction can be supported with a lightweight
        structure and can be unfurled in space. The ultra light weight
        of the space module array is evident from the fact that the
        weight of a 100 square meter space array, including supporting
        booms, can be as little as 10 kilograms, as described by J. C.
        Yater in Applied Optics, February 1975, pages 526-536, in
        connection with supporting a film of similar size in synchronous
        orbit. The three millimeter diameter quartz booms supporting one
        square meter panels of arrays have a bending moment well below
        the critical bending moment. At this diameter, the ratio of boom
        weight to array weight is small. The space support structure for
        the thin film planar arrays can be several orders of magnitude
        lighter than the support structure for a comparable thin film
        planar array on Earth. For a space structure using 100 rows of
        100 panels, each of one square meter, the total power can be
        larger than 10 megawatts. The weight of the square space array
        can be as little as 20 kilograms, not including the weight
        required for interconnection as a power relay of solar energy or
        as a power source for signal relay of digital high definition TV
        signals. </p>
      <p>A second embodiment of the space module uses a two-stage
        reversible thermoelectric converter as shown in FIG. 13, which
        can operate reversibly using little or no concentration of solar
        energy. In this case, the space module comprises three
        submicrometer thick substrates supported in tension by
        millimeter diameter booms. The first substrate supports the
        series array first diode corresponding to diode 220 in FIG. 13.
        The second substrate is in thermal contact with the first
        substrate and supports both the series array second diode
        corresponding to diode 222 in FIG. 13 and the cold series array
        first diode of the heat pump corresponding to diode 224 in FIG.
        13. </p>
      <p>The third substrate is not in thermal contact with the second
        substrate and supports the series array second diode of the heat
        pump cycle corresponding to diode 226 in FIG. 13. The inner
        surface of the third substrate has a thermally reflective layer
        adjacent to the second substrate and has a thermally emissive
        layer on the outer surface so as to operate as the heat
        reservoir for the series array second diode of the heat pump
        cycle. </p>
      <p>Using DC power from the power conversion cycle, the heat pump
        cycle operates between the cryogenic temperature of the second
        substrate and the temperature of the third substrate of
        approximately 160.degree. K. The Carnot efficiency limit for
        this power conversion-heat pump cycle of the intercepted solar
        energy is 97%. The operation of the reversible power
        conversion-heat pump cycle using components at cryogenic
        temperatures minimizes heat losses, including transmission
        losses of the output power. </p>
      <p>Either of the power conversion space modules described above
        can be used by attaching the power conversion space module to
        the two-stage amplifier shown in FIG. 11 for operation in a
        combined power conversion-amplifier cycle to broadcast radio
        waves, such as HDTV signals. Preferably, the two-stage space
        module corresponding to FIG. 13 is used. Signals received by a
        dipole filament array antenna are applied between terminals 22
        and 24 of diode 20 of the two-stage amplifier shown in FIG. 11.
        The received radio wave signals are amplified using solar energy
        input to heat the electrons in diode 10 to a temperature of
        6000.degree. K. Also, the input DC power from the two-stage
        space module output terminals, corresponding to terminals 230
        and 232 in FIG. 13, is applied to terminals 24 and 164 of the
        two-stage amplifier shown in FIG. 11 to cool diode 20. </p>
      <p>The amplified received signal at output terminals 14 and 24 of
        the two-stage amplifier shown in FIG. 11 is applied between
        terminals corresponding to terminals 276 and 278 of the series
        array first diode shown in FIG. 14, wherein the planar array
        first diode corresponding to diode 220 in FIG. 13 is implemented
        as shown in FIG. 14. Also, an amplified received signal of equal
        amplitude and opposite polarity is applied between the terminals
        corresponding to terminals 276 and 278 of a separate planar
        array second diode, also implemented as shown in FIG. 14. The
        planar array second diode corresponding to diode 222 in FIG. 13
        is implemented as shown in FIG. 14. The applied signal modulates
        the AC waveform of the space module output power delivered
        between output terminals corresponding to output terminals 230
        and 232 in FIG. 13. The output power is delivered to a
        transmitting antenna, such as a dipole filament array antenna.
        The transmitted signal can be the combined power output of an
        array of one square meter space modules. </p>
      <p>An application of the reversible thermoelectric converter of
        the present invention for power conversion and heat pump cycles
        is shown in FIG. 15. Panels 302, each comprising planar arrays
        of reversible thermoelectric converters with a series/parallel
        configuration as described above, are mounted on a roof 304 of a
        home 306. The panels 302 are mounted by steel wires 308
        connected to brackets 310 attached to roof 304. A power output
        cable 312 is connected to a distribution box 314 and to a power
        storage means 316. Each panel 302 contains a power
        conversion-heat pump module comprising planar arrays of
        reversible thermoelectric converter circuits. The output voltage
        is 120 volts, and the maximum power output is on the order of
        several hundred watts. The only additional items required for
        the operation of the power conversion-heat pump cycle shown in
        FIG. 15 are an AC signal control and a DC signal control
        connected in series with the output of the panel array. The AC
        signal control delivers the power required to reverse the output
        current direction. The AC and DC controls allocate a portion or
        all of the power to DC power such as for storage of DC power. </p>
      <p>The planar array and the power conversion-heat pump cycles of
        the reversible thermoelectric converter of the present invention
        have applications for the energy needs of the home. In one
        option, the planar arrays mounted in panels on the home roof as
        shown in FIG. 13 can comprise only the first diode (diode 10,
        FIG. 1) of the reversible thermoelectric converter. The planar
        array second diode (diode 20, FIG. 1) is placed in a separate
        location to enable the power conversion heat loss to be directed
        inside the home when needed for heat or to be directed outside
        the home when not needed for heat. When the first and second
        diodes are separated, the AC needs of the home can be obtained
        by operating with AC power output, without storing heat energy
        during the AC cycle. When there is no solar energy input, the
        roof first diodes and the second diodes can be operated in the
        heat pump cycle for air conditioning in warm weather, or as a
        heat pump in cold weather. </p>
      <p>The two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter shown in FIG.
        13 and described above can be used in the home configuration.
        The heat pump function is performed by diode 224 in FIG. 13
        operating in thermal contact with the second diode of the home
        roof configuration. The diode corresponding to diode 224 is
        positioned to transport thermal energy to the inside of the
        home. The two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter can also
        be operated to cool the second diode of the home roof power
        conversion configuration to the low temperature that is required
        in the power conversion-heat pump cycle. The two-stage
        reversible thermoelectric converter can also be used to help
        maintain power conversion as the solar intensity decreases. </p>
      <p>An application of the reversible thermoelectric converter of
        the present invention in heating and air conditioning ducts is
        shown in FIGS. 16A and 16B. Insulated ducts 330 and 332 run
        side-by-side with one duct carrying heated air and the other
        duct carrying cooled air. Openings are formed in ducts 330 and
        332, and a reversible thermoelectric converter assembly is
        mounted between the ducts. Quantum well diode arrays 334 are
        mounted within duct 332, and quantum well diode arrays 336 are
        mounted within duct 330. Diode array 334 corresponds to diode 10
        in FIG. 1, and diode array 336 corresponds to diode 20. The
        diode arrays are fabricated on substrates 338 which can be
        flexible films of glass or quartz. The diode arrays 334 and 336
        are mounted in slots in a plastic or ceramic support frame 340
        positioned between air ducts 330 and 332. The diode arrays 334
        and 336 are clamped in position by metal contacts 342 attached
        to support frame 340. Outer surfaces 344 of support frame 340
        facing air ducts 330 and 332 are coated with a thermal reflector
        such as aluminum. Diode arrays 334 and 336 are connected in
        series by conducting leads 346 and 348 in the configuration
        shown in FIG. 1 and are connected to output terminals 350 and
        352. </p>
      <p>For the reversible thermoelectric converter of the invention
        operating in the heat pump cycle, the first and second diodes
        can comprise n pairs of electrodes as described above in
        connection with FIGS. 9-9D, 14 and 14A. The ability to operate
        at low heat intensity and low temperatures, the ability to
        separate the first and second diodes of the heat pump, and the
        ability to utilize the various array configurations described
        above can be applied to the heat pump configurations. </p>
      <p>The heat pump configuration can be utilized in automobiles. In
        this case, a series array first diode is mounted in the
        upholstery of the seats and/or the ceiling of the automobile,
        and the series array second diode is placed in an area of the
        automobile exposed to the outside air. This configuration can be
        used to heat or cool the automobile efficiently. </p>
      <p>The configuration shown in FIGS. 16A and 16B can also be
        utilized in the power conversion of thermal energy in a high
        temperature or furnace environment. For this application, the
        required number of pairs of electrodes for the diode array 334
        and the required number of pairs of electrodes for the diode
        array 336 are selected to permit separation of diode arrays 334
        and 336, while minimizing the dissipative thermal conduction
        loss. Insulated duct 332 carries unheated gas inside the
        transparent wall of duct 332 facing diode array 334. The walls
        of duct 332 can be of quartz film spaced from diode array 334 to
        permit air flow for cooling of the transparent film and diode
        array 334. The duct 330 is a rigid non-transparent duct carrying
        cooled gas or cooled liquid for removing power conversion heat
        loss so as to maintain a cool temperature of the diode array
        336. Either AC or DC operation can be utilized. The AC output
        can be transported over longer distances by using step-up
        transformers at the output of terminals 350 and 352. </p>
      <p>When cooling gas flow is not utilized in duct 332, the diode
        array 334 can be constructed of high temperature material, such
        as tungsten for the metal electrodes and aluminum oxide for the
        substrate. For operation between the temperature of the source
        of incoming radiation and the cold temperature of diode array
        336, there are no dissipative heat losses in diode array 334. </p>
      <p>The rate of incoming heat conduction to diode array 334 can be
        minimized by using spaced layers of quartz material for the
        transparent wall of duct 332 facing diode array 334. The
        equilibrium temperature of the crystal lattice in diode array
        334 is thereby minimized so that a moderate temperature is
        maintained. The equilibrium temperature depends on thermal
        equilibrium for the radiation of the metal electrode crystal
        lattice in the direction back to the heat source being equal to
        the heat conduction through the transparent wall of duct 332
        facing diode array 334. An increase in the voltage to current
        ratio by increasing the number n of electrode pairs in diode
        array 334 enables the heat loss by thermal conduction through
        conducting leads 346 and 348 to be minimized. To further
        decrease and minimize heat conduction loss through conducting
        leads 346 and 348, the power conversion output can be a high
        frequency AC power output that is transmitted through capacitors
        that replace conducting leads 346 and 348. </p>
      <p>The configuration shown in FIGS. 16A and 16B can be used in a
        variety of furnace and high temperature environments including
        spatially distributed heat sources and heat sources that vary in
        temperature and intensity. For example, in the power conversion
        application where cooling gas flow is not used and where the
        maximum power output is required for a high temperature
        turbulent environment with varying temperature bands, a
        two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter can be used to
        provide increased output by utilizing a power conversion-heat
        pump process or by utilizing a dual thermal band power
        conversion cycle. </p>
      <p>A two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter as shown in
        FIG. 13 can be used for high capacity output when mounted on
        substrates 338 in FIG. 16A. For high capacity use, diode array
        334, which corresponds to diode 220 in FIG. 13, is placed on top
        of diode 224 of FIG. 13. Diode 224 is mounted on substrate 338
        and in close thermal contact with diode 334. Diode 336, which
        corresponds to diode 222 of FIG. 13, is placed on top of diode
        226. Diode 226 is mounted on substrate 338 and in close thermal
        contact with diode array 336. </p>
      <p>The planar arrays Of the two-stage configuration as applied to
        FIG. 16A can utilize the diode array shown in FIG. 14. The
        terminals 276 and 278 in the array of FIG. 14 are used for
        applying an external electric field to add incremental increase
        in contact potential for successive pairs of electrodes. The
        terminals 116 and 118 of the planar array of FIG. 14 correspond
        to terminals 350 and 352 in FIG. 16A. In the two-stage
        reversible thermoelectric converter, conducting leads 350 and
        352 are replaced with multiple leads including conducting leads
        for each of the diodes and conducting leads for applying an
        external electric field to each of the array elements. </p>
      <p>In the two-stage reversible thermoelectric converter, the diode
        arrays corresponding to diodes 224 and 226 in FIG. 13 are
        operated in the heat pump cycle to remove the small incoming
        leakage heat so as to achieve maximum conversion efficiency from
        diode arrays 334 and 336. When the incoming heat is at a lower
        temperature, the diode array 224 of FIG. 13 is operated in a
        lower temperature power conversion cycle. The dual ranges for
        the temperature and power outputs are obtained by controlling
        the contact potential V.sub.c and the output voltage so as to
        maximize the power output. For both power conversion cycles, an
        AC output can be used to supplement the power output from inside
        the furnace environment so as to minimize thermal conduction
        losses. </p>
      <p>In summary, the physical basis for the reversible process of
        the reversible thermoelectric conversion invention is that the
        conversion time of the thermal energy of the incoming hot
        electrons is smaller than the thermalization time t.sub.ep for
        the hot electrons. This result is achieved by limiting the
        storage time for the electromagnetic energy in the energy levels
        of the quantum well electrodes so as to thereby limit the
        conversion time. </p>
      <p>This is achieved by reducing the level of the voltage input
        V.sub.ii, generated by the conversion of the thermal energy
        input of the hot electrons, by limiting the contact potential
        V.sub.ci for the quantum well electrodes. The limit for V.sub.ci
        is a function of the incoming power rate, the capacitance
        between the quantum well electrodes, the ratio of the
        temperature of the hot electrons to the temperature of the cold
        electrons, and the thermalization time of the hot electrons. </p>
      <p>The physical basis of the reversible process of the reversible
        thermoelectric conversion invention which enables the first
        diode to be separated from the second diode of the conversion
        circuit by the distance required for each application and
        environment is that each first diode and each second diode can
        be comprised of a series array of pairs of electrodes as shown
        in FIG. 9B. For this series array, the contact potential between
        each pair of electrodes can be added in series with the series
        sum the same for the resultant contact potential for the first
        diode and the second diode. The resultant contact potentials
        V.sub.c for the series array of pairs of electrodes in the
        reversible thermoelectric conversion circuit can be increased so
        as to give the voltage output V.sub.o which is required to
        transport the conversion energy from the first diode over the
        required separation distance to the second diode. </p>
      <p>Examples of the options for adding the increments of contact
        potential V.sub.ci to the series array of electrode pairs are
        given above for both fixed increments and variable increments of
        voltage. For each option, as shown in the energy level diagram
        of FIG. 9C, the Fermi levels become equal for the equilibrium
        state after contact is made between all pairs of electrodes for
        the reversible thermoelectric circuit. After the equilibrium
        state shown in FIG. 9C is established for the typical ultrafast
        conversion circuit, it can be seen from FIG. 9C that the pairs
        of electrodes represented by E1 to E4 and E6 to E9 are
        equivalent electrically to two diodes. These two equivalent
        diodes are able to function as one first diode and one second
        diode with each diode having an effective contact potential
        V.sub.c equal to the sum of the contact potentials V.sub.ci of
        these 4 pairs of electrodes. As a result, by increasing the
        number n of pairs of electrodes in series for the first diode
        and the second diode as required to achieve the required output
        voltage, the separation distance between the first diode and the
        second diode can be increased to meet the requirements of all
        the major applications. </p>
      <p>The performance output of the reversible thermoelectric
        conversion circuit is a function of the resultant contact
        potentials V.sub.c of the sum of the contact potentials of the
        series array whereas, the conversion time for each incoming hot
        electron input is a function of the contact potential V.sub.ci
        of only one pair of quantum well electrodes in the series array
        for the first diode. As a result, both the conversion time and
        the output voltage of the reversible thermoelectric conversion
        circuit can be achieved independently so as to meet the
        requirements for each of the major applications. </p>
      <p>The physical basis of the reversible process of the reversible
        thermoelectric conversion invention which enables an applied
        electric field to add a variable contact potential in series
        between each pair of electrodes in the series array of pairs of
        electrodes is comprised of two combined reversible processes. In
        one of the reversible processes, the energy of the resultant
        electrostatic field between the pairs of electrodes is minimized
        and, in the second of the reversible processes, the equilibrium
        for the chemical potential of the reversible thermoelectric
        conversion circuit is established. </p>
      <p>In the first of the reversible processes, the electric field is
        applied by auxiliary electrodes and the energy of the
        electrostatic field between the pairs of electrodes is
        minimized, in accordance with Thompson's Theoren, by the
        separate distribution of charges on the surface of each
        auxiliary electrode and each pair of quantum well electrodes.
        This charge distribution occurs within the minimum response time
        for the capacitance of each electrode pair and generates the
        contact potential V.sub.ci for each electrode pair that is
        inversely proportional to the capacitance of each electrode
        pair. Each contact potential V.sub.ci represents the added
        positive or negative voltage to each electrode that increases or
        decreases the voltage potential level of each succeeding
        electrode pair in the applied electric field. </p>
      <p>The second of the combined reversible processes establishes the
        equilibrium for the chemical potential of the Fermi Dirac
        distribution in the reversible thermoelectric conversion circuit
        and also in the ultrafast time for a typical application.
        Equilibrium for the chemical potential, which, for the Fermi
        Dirac distribution, is equal to the Fermi energy, gives the
        result that the Fermi level has a constant value for all Fermi
        conductors in the reversible thermoelectric conversion circuit
        so that the levels must be equal for all pairs of quantum well
        electrodes that are in contact. </p>
      <p>The energy level diagram for the final result of these two
        combined reversible processes is shown in FIG. 9C. As shown, the
        first reversible process establishes the contact potential
        V.sub.ci of these 8 pairs of electrodes for the reversible
        thermoelectric circuit represented by FIG. 9C. The result of the
        second reversible process as shown establishes the equal Fermi
        level of all the pairs of electrodes for the reversible
        thermoelectric circuit represented by FIG. 9C. As a result of
        these two processes that, typically, can both be ultrafast, a
        time varying contact potential can be achieved for the
        reversible thermoelectric conversion circuit. </p>
      <p>The physical basis of the reversible process which enables the
        electrical energy from the power conversion, heat pump, or
        refrigeration cycle, or combined cycles, to be transported
        between the first and second diodes over extreme distances, as
        in geothermal or space power conversion or over extreme
        temperature differences, as from incandescent to cryogenic
        temperatures, is that the use of reversible auxiliary components
        together with the use of the input voltage waveform required for
        the transportation of the electrical energy between the first
        and second diodes, enables the performance of the reversible
        thermoelectric conversion cycles of this invention to be
        achieved. </p>
      <p>To achieve the required input waveforms, an AC electric field
        is used to apply a variable AC contact potential to the series
        array of pairs of electrodes for the first and second diodes as
        described above. For each diode, as shown in FIG. 14, auxiliary
        electrodes 270 and 272 connected to terminals 276 and 278, can
        be used to apply the AC contact potential by capacitance
        coupling to the first and last electrodes, 102 and 106, of the
        series array for both the first and second diodes. The required
        Voltage level for the AC waveforms for the transportation of the
        conversion energy in each direction between the first and second
        diodes is obtained by the use of two voltage transformers. </p>
      <p>The primary terminals of each step up transformer are connected
        to the terminals 116 and 118 of each series array as shown in
        FIG. 14. One of the secondary terminals of each step up
        transformer is connected to the connecting lead between the
        first and second diodes, and the other secondary terminal of
        each step up transformer is connected to the output lead of the
        reversible thermoelectric converter. The voltage level of the AC
        waveform for the electrical energy output from the first and
        second diodes is increased by the step up transformer up to the
        voltage level required for minimizing all transmission losses
        between the first and second diodes. For applications such as
        for the geothermal energy conversion at maximum depth and
        temperature, the use of transparent heat reservoir to enclose
        the first diode and connected step up transformer, such as
        described above using spaced layers of quartz material, can
        enable the equilibrium temperature inside the heat reservoir,
        for the crystal lattice of the first diode and the conducting
        wire of the connected step up transformer, to be minimized so
        that the reversible conversion processes of the first diode and
        the connected step transformer can be achieved without the use
        of coolant flow or added heat pump processes. </p>
      <p>Similar increased separation distances for transporting thermal
        energy from the second diode to the first diode can be achieved
        by this reversible process for the heat pump or refrigeration
        cycles. To further increase this temperature range for the power
        conversion cycle, the thermal heat reservoirs for the second
        diode can be used to alternatively store and then remove the
        power conversion loss by using a heat pump cycle for the second
        diode during the AC cycle for which a DC component is added to
        the AC waveform for additional cooling of the second diode. </p>
      <p>A basic option to achieve the required reversible performance
        from the voltage transformers for the power conversion cycle
        from a hot environment is the combined reversible cycle option
        shown in FIG. 13 with diodes 224 and 226 operating in a heat
        pump cycle to lower the temperature of diode 220 where the first
        diode 220 and the second diode 222 can operate in a power
        conversion cycle with diodes 222 and 226 being located in cool
        temperature reservoirs outside the hot environment. This
        combined cycle can maintain the temperature of the quasi-static
        heat reservoir 252 enclosing first diode 220 at the lower
        temperature required for reversible power conversion without any
        loss in the overall efficiency. For this option, the step up
        transformer is placed within the quasi-static heat reservoir 252
        and with the temperature maintained as low as required to
        transform the voltage reversibly, using superconduction
        operation for the transformers if required. This example of an
        option for the control of the environment for auxiliary
        state-of-the-art components is an example of achieving a
        practical reversible process for many applications of the
        reversible thermoelectric converter. </p>
      <p>Additional reversible auxiliary components that can be placed
        in the connecting leads between the first and second diode are
        capacitors. One application for the series connection of
        coupling capacitors to the connecting leads is to reduce the
        energy loss by thermal conduction through the conducting leads
        in regions of high thermal gradients such as in the high
        temperature region close to the first diode. For the
        refrigeration cycle approaching that for cryogenic temperatures,
        these regions can be close to the second diodes. The protection
        afforded by the capacitors against thermal loss for extreme
        temperature gradients can be used alone or together with the
        transformers in the connecting leads for high to low temperature
        applications involving superconducting materials. </p>
      <p>One example of the combined use of capacitors to protect
        against thermal loss and transformers to protect against
        resistance loss is based on adding the use of the coupling
        capacitor to the above example of the combined reversible power
        conversion-heat pump cycle shown in FIG. 13. For this example,
        the coupling capacitor is placed in the thermal insulating wall
        of the heat reservoir, the outside capacitor terminal is
        connected through the conducting lead to the second diode and
        the inside capacitor terminal is connected to the high voltage
        output terminal of the step up voltage transformer. The combined
        two stage reversible thermoelectric converter uses the
        reversible step up transformer to minimize the electrical power
        loss in transmitting electrical power between the first and
        second diodes and uses the reversible coupling capacitor to
        minimize the thermal power loss in transmitting electrical power
        between the inside and the outside of the thermal insulating
        wall of the cold heat reservoir inside the furnace. This
        reversible performance can be obtained for the maximum power
        output that is generated inside the highest temperature furnace
        and that is transmitted for reversible power conversion to the
        cold second diode over the separation distance between the first
        and second diodes. This performance can be achieved using
        state-of-the-art auxiliary components by controlling the
        environment inside the heat reservoirs enclosing the auxiliary
        components. </p>
      <p>Therefore, since the transformer and capacitors are reversible
        components in this controlled environment, these components, as
        well as other reversible components or combinations of
        reversible components in a controlled environment, can be used
        in circuits connected to the reversible thermoelectric converter
        of this invention, while accomplishing the reversible processes
        inherent to the reversible thermoelectric processes of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>While there have been shown and described what are at present
        considered the preferred embodiments of the present invention,
        it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various
        changes and modifications may be made therein without departing
        from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended
        claims. </p>
