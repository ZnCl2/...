      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates generally to devices for directly
        converting thermal energy to useful electric energy, wherein the
        invention may also be utilized for directly pumping heat from a
        colder source to a higher temperature sink. More specifically,
        the invention relates to a device for utilizing with high
        efficiency the electric fluctuation energy of small circuits
        thermally insulated from other small circuits at a different
        temperature so as to produce useful electric energy. The same
        device also efficiently pumps heat from lower to higher
        temperature regions. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Devices for converting thermal energy directly into electric
        energy have been extensively investigated and the most commonly
        utilized devices have been the thermionic converters working
        from high temperature sources and silicon cells utilizing the
        input thermal energy of solar radiation. The present
        state-of-the-art has been limited to achieving efficiencies of
        15% for thermionic converters and 16% for silicon solar cells.
        In addition to these limitations on efficiencies, the
        temperature range over which these devices can work efficiently
        has been limited to high temperatures in the range of
        1400.degree. to 2200.degree. K for the emitter and 500.degree.
        to 1200.degree. K for the collector of the thermionic converters
        and to moderate operating temperatures in the range of less than
        400.degree. K for the temperature of the silicon solar cells. </p>
      <p>The present invention removes these limitations along with
        providing other improvements in the performance of the direct
        conversion of thermal energy to electric energy. The thermal
        converter of this invention eliminates the electron cooling,
        radiation losses and lead losses of thermionic diode converters
        and operates reversibly as a heat pump over a wide temperature
        range. The efficiency for each working temperature range is
        determined by the physical dimensions of the circuits. The small
        circuits of this invention yield increased efficiency and power
        output or heat pump output. The efficiency of the small circuit
        devices of this invention also improves the efficiency when the
        input thermal energy is in the form of thermal radiation from a
        heated source such as solar radiation from the sun which is to
        be converted to useful power. The Carnot cycle efficiency
        obtainable from a heat source at solar temperature working with
        a heat sink at the ambient temperature on earth is over 90%.
        This invention achieves this efficiency as it is not limited by
        the heat losses resulting from the diffusion and thermal
        conduction processes of solar cells. The invention also improves
        on the efficiency obtainable from the small circuits of the
        prior art. A typical prior art device is disclosed in U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,760,257 issued Sept. 18, 1973, which discloses a device
        used with a directional wide band antenna system to convert
        radiation energy to useful output power. The improvement of the
        invention herein over the prior art results generally from
        minimizing or eliminating the losses resulting from eddy current
        losses on the receiving antenna surfaces. Also, the efficiency
        of converting the wide bandwidth radiation such as solar
        radiation is increased in the instant invention by minimizing or
        eliminating the losses that occur from impinging stray radiation
        from other directions and the losses resulting from incompletely
        utilized voltages from antenna element spacings approaching one
        wavelength, or from antenna element spacings less than one half
        wavelength. </p>
      <p><b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>A primary object of the instant invention is to provide an
        improved apparatus for directly converting thermal energy to
        electric energy. </p>
      <p>Another object of the invention is to improve the efficiency of
        conversion of heat to electricity. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the invention is to increase the power
        output from the thermal energy converter to a high power level.
      </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the invention to increase the
        operating temperature range of the thermal energy converter so
        that efficient conversion over a wider range of temperatures is
        obtained. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of the invention to provide an alternate
        mode of operating the device as a heat pump or a refrigerator
        with an improved coefficient of performance over a wide
        temperature range. </p>
      <p>It is a yet further object of the invention to increase the
        types of heat sources with which the thermal converter operates
        to include solar, fossil, nuclear and geothermal heat sources. </p>
      <p>It is still a further object of the invention to lower the
        temperature at which efficient operation is achieved so as to
        use the waste heat from other power plants as input heat sources
        for this thermal energy converter. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of this invention is to decrease the weight
        and size of the thermal converter so as to increase the power
        output per unit volume and per unit weight of the thermal
        converter. </p>
      <p>These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
        become apparent from the following description taken in
        accordance with the accompanying drawings which form a part of
        this application. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, both the conversion of
        electric energy fluctuations to useful power output and the
        refrigeration cycle embodiments have increased efficiency over a
        wide range of working temperatures. The small microcircuits of
        the transducer modules convert electric energy fluctuations into
        a useful output with a high efficiency. This efficiency is over
        90% for some applications. The lead conduction losses, electron
        cooling and radiation losses are minimized. This increase in
        efficiency is accomplished in part by using a vacuum or
        equivalent thermal barrier between the circuits at different
        temperatures and by providing an electrical path for the
        electric fluctuation energy. This is achieved by coupling the
        electric fluctuating energy using capacitors having a vacuum or
        equivalent thermal barrier between the capacitor plates and by
        separating the adjacent areas of the circuits of the modules 7
        and 8 of FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2 by a vacuum or equivalent thermal
        barrier. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1a of the drawings, incoming heat 50 from
        some heat source shown on the left side of the drawings is
        converted into electrical power for an electrical load 6 shown
        on the right side of the drawing. Thermal conduction layer 37 is
        the heated thermal conducting film which may typically be a
        metal or carbon film that is in thermal contact with layer 1 of
        the invention. This thermal conduction layer 37 is also
        thermally exposed by conduction, radiation or convection to the
        heat 50 from some heat source (not shown) and conducts this
        thermal energy to the layer 1 of the device. In this embodiment
        and for this application, the layer 1 is comprised of an
        assembly of modules 7 (to be more fully described infra) for
        transducing the incoming heat at the temperature of the source
        to electric energy fluctuations across potential barriers or
        electrical resistors. A low loss dielectric substrate 34
        typically but not limited to sapphire supports the modules 7. </p>
      <p>This fluctuating electrical energy is transmitted across a
        thermal barrier 2 from each module 7 of layer 1 to a
        corresponding conversion module 8 of layer 3. (The conversion
        module 8 will be more fully described infra). The thermal
        barrier 2 may be, but is not limited to, a vacuum thermal
        barrier in which the separation distance between layers 1 and 3
        is maintained by spacing support 47. This separation distance is
        less than the dimensions of modules 7 and 8 in the plane of the
        layers 1 and 3. For the vacuum thermal barrier, the vacuum is
        maintained over a convenient area of the layers by making the
        spacing support 47 in the form of walls to enclose convenient
        areas between the layers 1 and 3. The separation walls 47 may
        typically be of a low thermal conductivity material such as
        glass but are not limited to this material. As will be described
        infra, the walls of the substrate 34 and 35 containing the
        vacuum may typically be plated with a metallic coating with a
        low net effective thermal emissivity such as gold. The layer 3
        is maintained at a lower temperature by thermal contact with
        thermal conducting layer 58 which may typically be a metal or
        carbon film which is thermally exposed to the cooler reservoir
        sink at the lower temperature by conduction, convection or
        radiation. The modules 8 are supported on the low loss
        dielectric substrate 35 of layer 3 which may be of similar
        material to substrate 34. The conversion modules 8 of layer 3
        for this power conversion mode rectify the fluctuating
        electrical energy to provide a direct current power output from
        each module 8. </p>
      <p>The output power from all the modules 8 of layer 3 is combined
        in a series parallel network, to be described infra, to supply
        the total available output power of all the modules at the
        required voltage to the electrical load 6. The series-parallel
        circuit is connected to electrical leads 4 and 5 and the total
        available output power is conducted by leads 4 and 5 to the
        electrical load 6. Layers 1, 2, 3, 37 and 58 may be flexible and
        may extend in shape and area to conform to the application. </p>
      <p>An alternate embodiment of the invention is schematically shown
        on FIG. 1b. This embodiment utilizes the invention as a heat
        pump or refrigerator. Input power from a power source 27 is
        supplied to leads 30 and 31 to the series parallel network and
        to the modules 8. This reverses the direct current in each
        module 8 so that heat 56 is pumped across thermal conducting
        film 58 from the low temperature reservoir to the low
        temperature of the modules 8 and across the thermal barrier 2 to
        the higher temperature of the modules 7 of the layer 1 and to
        the thermal conducting film 37. From the thermal conducting film
        37, the heat output 57 is transferred by conduction, convection
        or radiation to the higher temperature reservoir. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows another embodiment of the invention wherein the
        embodiments of FIGS. 1a and 1b are combined so that modules 7 in
        layer 1 and modules 8 in layer 3 operate as in FIG. 1a to
        provide output power through leads 4 and 5, whereas modules 8 of
        layer 28 and modules 7 of layer 29 are to work in the heat pump
        or refrigeration mode as shown in FIG. 1b with the input power
        being transmitted by conductive leads 30 and 31. Layer 28 is in
        thermal contact with layer 3 and is thermally insulated from
        layer 29 by a thermal barrier layer 32 that may be similar to
        the thermal barrier 2 between layers 1 and 3. The addition of
        layers 28, 29 and 32 operating in the refrigeration mode to
        layers 1, 2, and 3 lowers the temperature of layer 3 so that for
        some components and designs of the rectifying modules 8, the
        overall efficiency of the power conversion of the two stages is
        improved. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3a shows a schematic view of one embodiment of a circuit
        for the transducing module 7 and the conversion module 8. In
        this schematic view the circuit to the left of condenser plates
        22 and 23 is the circuit of module 7 and, as stated supra, layer
        1 of FIGS. 1a, 1b, and 2 is comprised of an assembly of modules
        7. In this schematic view, condenser plates 22, 23, 10 and 18
        are part of layer 2 of FIGS. 1a, 1b, and 2 as will be shown
        infra. Finally, in this schematic view the circuit to the right
        of condenser plates 10 and 18 is the circuit of module 8 and, as
        stated supra, layer 3 is comprised of an assembly of modules 8.
        In FIG. 3a the transducing modules 7 use a diode 9 as the source
        of the electric energy fluctuations which are transmitted by
        electrical leads 13 and 14 to the condenser plates 22 and 23.
        The other plates of the condensers 10 and 18 are on the other
        side of the vacuum or equivalent thermal barrier and are
        connected to the rectifying module 8. The condenser plate 10 is
        connected by lead 17 in module 8 to the high impedance
        inductance 11 and to the rectifying diode 12. The condenser
        plate 18 is connected by lead 19 to the other lead of the
        inductance 11, to the low impedance capacitor 20, and to the
        power output lead 15. The rectified output power from the diode
        12 is conducted by connecting lead 21 to power output lead 16
        and through the inductance 11 and lead 19 to power output lead
        15. The power output to the leads 15 and 16 along with the power
        output from the other rectifying modules of the layer 3 are
        conducted to the electrical load using the leads 4 and 5 (see
        FIG. 1a). </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3b a schematic view is given to show one embodiment of
        a circuit to combine the output power from all the modules using
        a series-parallel circuit to produce a convenient final output
        voltage to leads 4 and 5. In this schematic, the module output
        powers of the rectifying modules 8 carried by the leads 19 and
        21 in the vertical column are connected in parallel so that the
        total current of all modules in the vertical columns are added
        at a constant output voltage. Also, as shown in FIG. 3b the
        total output of each column is added in series so that the
        resultant output voltage to the load is the sum of the output
        voltages of each column. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3c the sectional view shows an embodiment of a
        construction of the vacuum thermal barrier and the condenser
        plates 22, 10, 23, and 18 by which the electric voltage
        fluctuations are transmitted from the higher temperature module
        7 to the lower temperature module 8. The condenser plates 22,
        10, 23, and 18 are constructed on the substrates 34 and 35 which
        form the opposite walls of the enclosed vacuum. These two
        adjacent walls of the substrates 34 and 35 are also plated as
        shown with a metallic coating 33 having a low net effective
        emissivity such as gold. The plated area of the walls covers all
        the area of both adjacent walls with the exception of the areas
        containing condenser plates 22, 23, 10 and 18 and a small
        separation area between the metallic coating 33 and the
        condenser plates. This separation area as shown in FIG. 3c
        electrically insulates the condenser plates 22, 23, 10 and 18
        from the metallic coating 33 on the walls. This metallic coating
        enables the vacuum thermal barrier to minimize the amount of the
        heat loss by radiation across the walls of the vacuum. An
        embodiment of the thermal barrier shown as layer 2 in FIGS. 1a,
        1b and 2 is comprised of an assembly of condenser plates 22, 23,
        10 and 18 and the metallic coating layer 33 shown in FIG. 3c and
        the spacing support walls shown in FIG. 1a. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 is a schematic view of module 7 wherein a resistor or
        resistance film 26 is used as the source of the electric energy
        fluctuations. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 is a schematic view of the rectifying module 8 in which
        a diode 24 is connected to lead 17 with opposite polarity to
        that of diode 12. The other terminal of diode 24 is connected to
        lead 19 to provide a path for the rectified current in the
        module. FIG. 6 shows module 8 wherein the low impedance
        capacitor 25 is added to isolate the rectified output voltage
        from module 7. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, there is shown a sectional view of
        layer 42 which is added adjacent to thermal conducting film 37
        for the efficient conversion of radiation energy to thermal
        energy. This is another embodiment of the invention for
        converting solar radiation or other radiation to useful electric
        power. The incoming solar radiation is normally incident on
        plane 44 of layer 42. Plane 44 is divided into contiguous square
        cells 44a, 44b, 44c, etc., in both dimensions of plane 44 by
        walls 46a, 46b, 46c, 46d, etc., in horizontal planes normal to
        the plane of the drawing and by walls 39a, 39b, 39c, etc., in
        vertical planes parallel to the plane of the drawing. On the
        back surface of each cell of the parabolic surface 38 is
        typically coated with an aluminum, silver, or other reflecting
        surface layer 52 so as to reflect all the incoming normally
        incident solar radiation into the round hole 40 in the surface
        of the reflecting paraboloid. This round hole is placed in the
        plane normal to the axis of the paraboloid at the focus of the
        paraboloid. The reflecting surface is supported by thermal
        insulating material 41. The sides of the cylindrical hole 40 as
        well as the flat back side of the insulating material 41 are
        coated with a reflecting layer 52 so as to direct all incoming
        solar radiation against the thermal conducting layer 37 to be
        absorbed and converted to thermal energy. On the left side the
        thermal conducting layer 37 is spaced from the collecting layer
        42 by the spacing supports 54 made of thermal insulating
        material such as glass. On the right side the thermal conducting
        layer 37 is in thermal contact with layer 1 of the invention.
        (See FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2). This radiation collection layer 42 may
        be made of some thin and flexible material such as quartz with
        the dimensions of each round hole 40 in each small cell
        typically being as small as 1 micron in diameter and the
        thickness of layer 42 being as small as 10 microns. </p>
      <p>The linewidth of the conductors for the module circuits using
        electron beam microfabrication may typically be of the order of
        10.sup.-.sup.4 to 10.sup.-.sup.6 cm. Micro circuit manufacturing
        techniques may be used in the fabrication of the modules which
        can range in size according to the power output requirements.
        The maximum power requirements can be achieved using module size
        larger than the physical limit on circuit miniaturization given
        in a paper by R. W. Keyes in the May 1975 issue of the
        Proceedings of the IEEE (pp. 740-767). In this paper, the
        applicable limit on circuit miniaturization is the
        electromigration damage to conductors and this limit allows
        conductors carrying the maximum current requirements of this
        device to be smaller than 10.sup.-.sup.6 cm in diameter. Using
        larger conductors and increasing the area of modules 7 and 8 in
        the plane of layers 1 and 3 of FIGS. 1a and 2 up to
        10.sup.-.sup.6 square centimeters gives a power output
        capability of the layers 1 and 3 of the order of 10 KW per
        square meter in the plane of layers 1 and 3 in FIGS. 1a and 2. </p>
      <p>A review of microcircuit manufacturing techniques is given in a
        paper by H. I. Smith in the October 1974 issue of the
        Proceedings of the IEEE (pp. 1361-1388), and also in a paper by
        A. N. Broers and R. H. Dennard in Semiconductor Silicon 1973
        (pp. 830-841). Other techniques in addition to electron beam
        microfabrication are feasible for the microfabrication of the
        circuits of this invention. Among these techniques, X-ray
        lithography using sensitive polymers as electron resist material
        may be utilized for simplicity and low cost. The manufacture of
        micro circuit components for the instant invention can be
        accomplished using the micro circuit technology described by H.
        Sobel in the August 1971 issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE
        (pp. 1200-1211) and by M. Coulton in the October 1971 issue of
        the Proceedings of the IEEE. Diodes 9, 12, and 24 may typically
        be classical Schottky barrier diodes or quantum or tunnel
        diodes. The Schottky diodes may be of the type described by
        Fetterman et al in Applied Physics Letters, Jan. 15, 1974, page
        70. The tunnel diodes may be of the type described by Twu et al
        in Applied Physics Letters, Nov. 15, 1974 or by Javan in the
        IEEE Spectrum, October, 1971, page 91. For the rectifying diodes
        12 and 24, increasing the nonlinearity increases the efficiency
        of the device. As shown in the paper by J. C. Yater in the
        October 1974 issue of the Physical Review A (pp. 1361-1369), the
        non-linearity obtainable from classical diodes enables the
        Carnot cycle efficiencies to be obtained. For quantum effect or
        tunnel diodes the degree of non-linearity of tunnel diodes can
        be different from that of classical diodes. It can be shown
        using a similar method of analysis to that given in the above
        listed paper in the Physical Review by J. C. Yater that the
        efficiency of rectification is increased using tunnel diodes as
        the heated diodes 9 when the non-linearity is less than that for
        classical diodes and as the cooled diodes 12 and 24 when the
        non-linearity is larger than that of the classical diodes. </p>
      <p>As hereinbefore noted, the efficiency of conversion is improved
        by eliminating or minimizing the power losses from electron
        cooling, radiation cooling and lead losses. These losses are
        minimized since there is no electron flow from the hotter layer
        1 to the cooler layer 3 of FIGS. 1a and 2, since the thermal
        barrier 2 can be a vacuum with negligible radiation losses, and
        since there are no electrical leads from the hot layer 1 to the
        cooler layer 3 of FIGS. 1a and 2. The inherent higher efficiency
        of the invention provides an increase of several hundred percent
        in the efficiency of power conversion over existing thermionic
        converters, solar cells, or thermoelectric power generators.
        Since the theoretical efficiency using the classical Schottky
        barrier diodes for the rectifying diodes 12 and 24 is given by
        the Carnot cycle efficiency, the thermal cycles are reversible
        cycles so that the device also operates in a heat pump or
        refrigeration mode by using an input power to reverse the direct
        current flow. The circuits of this invention can be made
        extremely small by current state-of-the-art technology. (See
        prior references). The mean free path of an electron in a
        resistive material is as low as 10.sup.-.sup.6 cm with the
        result that conductors can be placed less than every
        10.sup.-.sup.5 on a heated resistive film without resulting in
        any significant correlation between the fluctuations of
        individual circuits. Accordingly, as the elemental circuit size
        is reduced to the order of the electron mean free path the
        production of kilowatts of power output per square centimeter of
        surface area of layer is obtained. </p>
      <p>The effect of the statistics of fluctuation effects on the
        thermally caused electrical fluctuations across a single
        resistor is that the output power is independent of the physical
        size or the number of conducting electrons in the resistor. This
        power is shown by C. J. Bakker and G. Heller in the March 1939
        issue of Physica (pp. 262-274) to be approximately kT/t, with k
        being the Boltzmann constant, T being the absolute temperature,
        and t being the mean time between collisions for an electron.
        The effective mean time t to give the fluctuation power in a
        metal resistor is computed in this paper and the result shows an
        effective electron velocity of 10.sup.8 cm/sec and an effective
        mean free-path length of 10.sup.-.sup.6 cm so that the effective
        mean time t is of the order of 10.sup.-.sup.14 sec for electrons
        at room temperature. For this value for t and for T =
        700.degree. K the fluctuation power available is of the order of
        10.sup.-.sup.6 W. Conductors placed every 10.sup.-.sup.5 cm on
        an extended heated resistive film result in an available power
        output of 10.sup.8 W of available fluctuation energy per square
        meter of a resistive film at a temperature of 700.degree. K when
        these are used as the resistor 26 in FIG. 4. The thickness of
        layers 1 and 3 is comparable to the spacing of modules 7 and 8
        in the plane of layers 1 and 3. For cubical modules of this
        size, the potential power output per cubic centimeter of modules
        is 10.sup.9 W. </p>
      <p>The potential barrier of the diodes 9, 12 and 24 and the output
        voltage of the output power can be optimized for each
        temperature range so as to achieve the highest possible
        efficiency for each required operating temperature range. As
        shown in the above listed paper in the Physical Review by J. C.
        Yater, the non-linearity of the classical diodes are a function
        of both the temperature and the capacity of the diode potential
        barriers. This relationship enables a larger non-linearity to be
        obtained for the rectifying diodes 12 and 14 of module 7 as
        these diodes are operated at cooler temperatures. From this
        relationship the capacity of the diode potential barriers can be
        designed to achieve the highest possible efficiency for each
        operating temperature range. For diodes having a larger capacity
        than required to give the maximum efficiency for a given
        operating temperature range when operating in the embodiment
        shown in FIG. 1a, the embodiment shown in FIG. 2 can be used to
        enable the given diodes to operate at the highest possible
        efficiency as the temperature of the rectifying module 8 in
        layers 3 and 28 are lowered. </p>
      <p>The reversible cycle resulting from the elimination or
        minimization of losses thus enables the same thermal cycle to be
        used in a power conversion mode, a heat pump mode and a
        refrigeration mode. The same device can be used to generate
        power for the home, heating for the home and air conditioning
        for the home. As an example, the power in a square meter of
        sunlight is converted efficiently by the device to 1 KW of
        output power. This 1 KW output power can be used as the input
        power to the same device operating in the efficient heat pump
        mode between 32.degree. and 80.degree. Fahrenheit. The
        equivalent heat of 10 KW of power can then be delivered into the
        higher temperature reservoir. </p>
      <p>By using thin flexible layers 1, 3, 37 and 58 that can be
        shaped and sized so as to be used with maximum efficiency for
        each heat source including solar, fossil, nuclear and
        geothermal, the use of a radiation collection layer 42 can
        achieve a high efficiency when the incoming source of heat is in
        the form of radiation. For incoming solar radiation on layer 42,
        the efficiency of the power conversion is increased to a much
        higher value than can be obtained from existing solar cells. The
        highest efficiency obtainable from existing silicon solar cell
        is 16% and the highest theoretical value predicted for any
        material is 25% for Al Sb at ambient temperatures. The value
        obtainable from this device is over 90% using classical diodes
        12 and 24 in the rectifying modules 8. </p>
      <p>The efficient operation of the device can be extended to lower
        temperature range using the two stage temperature embodiment
        shown in FIG. 2 in which layers 28 and 29 are added to enable a
        larger temperature range to be used for each stage of the cycle.
        This extends the range of operating temperatures to the range
        where modules 8 in layer 3 and modules 8 in layer 28 are in the
        temperature range where the diodes of module 8 are in the
        super-conducting state. The extension of the operating
        temperature range for the thermal cycles can for some diodes
        increase the efficiency of the thermal cycle by a factor that is
        larger than the increase in efficiency for the Carnot cycle for
        this same extension in the operating temperature range. As
        hereinbefore noted, this increase in efficiency results from the
        dependence of the non-linearity of the rectifying diodes 9 and
        24 on the diode temperature. As the diode temperature is lowered
        the diode non-linearity and rectification efficiency are
        increased. By using the two stage thermal cycle the diode
        rectification efficiency is increased when larger diodes are
        used and when the operating temperature range is low. The low
        operating temperature range of the device for conversion of the
        thermal energy of the waste heat from other power plants is an
        example of an application for the two stage thermal cycle. </p>
      <p>By making the dimension of the circuit size of the order of
        10.sup.-.sup.3 cm in each dimension while maintaining a constant
        power output potential from each cell, megawatts of power output
        potential per kilogram of module weight is obtained. This is an
        important improvement in the capability of the device for the
        application of building satellite solar power stations for
        supplying energy for earth use. <br>
