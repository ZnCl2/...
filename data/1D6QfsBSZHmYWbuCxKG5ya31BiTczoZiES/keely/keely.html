      <br>
      John Ernst Worrell Keely (September 3, 1837 – November 18, 1898)
      was an American inventor from Philadelphia who claimed to have
      discovered a new motive power which was originally described as
      "vaporic" or "etheric" force, and later as an unnamed force based
      on "vibratory sympathy", by which he produced "interatomic ether"
      from water and air. Despite numerous requests from the
      stockholders of the Keely Motor Company, which had been
      established to produce a practicable motor based on his work, he
      consistently refused to reveal to them the principles on which his
      motor operated, and also repeatedly refused demands to produce a
      marketable product by claiming that he needed to perform more
      experiments.<br>
      <br>
      He secured substantial investments from many people, among whom
      was John Jacob Astor IV.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biography</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, John Keely was orphaned in early
      childhood and was raised by his grandparents. Before becoming an
      inventor, he worked as a member of a theatrical orchestra, a
      painter, a carpenter, a carnival barker, and as a mechanic.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1872, Keely invited scientists to attend a demonstration at his
      laboratory at 1422 North Twentieth Street Philadelphia, of a
      machine which he asserted was motivated by a new and hitherto
      unknown force. Keely announced that he had discovered a principle
      for power production based on the musical vibrations of tuning
      forks and that music could resonate with atoms or with the aether.
      Public interest was aroused and within a few months the Keely
      Motor Company was formed in New York, with a capital of
      $5,000,000.,[1] equivalent to $95 million in 2013.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Keely's theories</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Keely delivered descriptions of the supposed principles of his
      process on various occasions.<br>
      <br>
      In 1884, following the demonstration of his "Vaporic gun":<br>
      <br>
      Stripping the process of all technical terms, it is simply this: I
      take water and air, two mediums of different specific gravity, and
      produces from them by generation an effect under vibrations that
      liberates from the air and water an inter atomic ether. The energy
      of this ether is boundless and can hardly be comprehended. The
      specific gravity of the ether is about four times lighter than
      that of hydrogen gas, the lightest gas so far discovered. — New
      York Times, 22 September 1884[3]<br>
      <br>
      Following a demonstration in June 1885:<br>
      <br>
      It is an elaboration of interatomic ether by vibration. The atomic
      ether vibrates all around the molecules of matter. There is a
      magnetic force attached to it at the same time, and it assimilates
      with the molecular atomic aggregations - that is, assimilates with
      a certain attractive force that it is hard to tell what it is. I
      call it a vibratory negative. It don't act like a magnet drawing
      metals toward it. There is a certain magnetic effect about it that
      causes it to adhere by vibratory rotation to different forms of
      matter - that is the molecular, atomic, etheric, and
      ether-etheric. The impulse is given by metallic impulses, the
      rotary power that is formed by etheric vibration - that is the
      force that holds it in position. — New York Times, 7 June 1885[4]<br>
      <br>
      In the 19th century most physicists believed that all of space was
      filled with a medium called the "Luminiferous aether" (or
      "ether"), a hypothetical substance which was thought necessary for
      the transmission of electromagnetic waves and to the propagation
      of light, which was believed to be impossible in "empty" space. In
      1887, an experiment was performed by Albert A. Michelson and
      Edward W. Morley to attempt to confirm the existence of the ether.
      The experiment, named the Michelson-Morley experiment after the
      two scientists, shocked the scientific community by giving results
      which implied the ether's non-existence. This result was later
      used by Albert Einstein to refute the ether's existence, and to
      develop special relativity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Etheric generator</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On November 10, 1874, Keely gave a demonstration of an "etheric
      generator" to a small group of people in Philadelphia. Keely blew
      into a nozzle for half a minute, then poured five gallons of tap
      water into the same nozzle. After some adjustments a pressure
      gauge indicated pressures of 10,000 psi which Keely said was
      evidence that the water had been disintegrated and a mysterious
      vapor had been liberated in the generator, capable of powering
      machinery. In subsequent demonstrations he kept changing the
      terminology he used, to "vibratory-generator" to a
      "hydro-pneumatic-pulsating-vacu-engine" to "quadruple negative
      harmonics". It was later reported that the witnesses of the
      demonstration were so impressed that they formed a stock company,
      purchased patent rights for the six New England states, and paid
      $50,000 in cash for their share in the invention.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The New York Times reported in June 1875 that Keely's new motive
      power was generated from cold water and air and evolved into a
      vapor "more powerful than steam, and considerably more
      economical". It reported that Keely refused to disclose what the
      vapor was or how it was generated until he had taken out patents
      in "all the countries of the globe which issue patent rights"
      which was estimated would cost around $30,000.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Keely said that the discovery of this new energy source was
      accidental. He said that the apparatus by which it was generated
      was called a "generator" or "multiplicator", from where it was
      then passed into a "receiver" and from there to the cylinders of a
      steam engine. The "generator" was reported as being about 3 ft
      (0.91 m), made of Austrian gunmetal in one piece, and holding
      about 10 or 12 gallons of water. Its inside was made up of
      cylindrical chambers connected by pipes and fitted with stopcocks
      and valves. The "receiver" or "reservoir" was about 40 in (1,000
      mm) long by 6 in (150 mm) in diameter and connected to the
      "generator" by a 1 in (25 mm) diameter pipe. Keely claimed that
      his apparatus would generate his "vapor" from water solely by
      mechanical means without using any chemicals and claimed to be
      able to produce 2,000 psi in 5 seconds.[5]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1881, Keely met Clara Jessup Bloomfield Moore, the wealthy
      widow of a Philadelphia industrialist who had the year before
      established the Bloomfield Moore art collection. Mrs Moore became
      acquainted with Keely through her interest in scientific subjects,
      and remained his friend and patron up to the time of his death.
      She invested $100,000 plus a monthly salary of $250 (around $2.2
      million and $5400/month in today's values [1]) so that he could
      devote his entire time and energy to the perfection of his motor
      and widely advocated him and his work, producing many articles and
      books.[6]<br>
      <br>
      Her family did not approve of her assuming obligations which they
      believed the company should fulfill under its contract with Keely.
      She made an arrangement with Keely on 12 April 1890 to furnish him
      with an additional $2,000 a month for his household and shop
      expenses and for instruments of research, which was to expire when
      he had gained sufficient control of his unknown force to enable
      him to resume his work under the direction of the management of
      the company upon a provisional engine. This arrived in December
      1890, when Mrs Bloomfield Moore handed over to the Directors bills
      that had been presented since the expiration of Mr. Keely's
      contract with her.[7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Stockholder suit</b><br>
      <br>
      On 14 December 1881 the stockholders of the Keely Motor Company
      held a meeting at which a report was read that complained that
      while they had faith in the merits of Keely's invention, the
      inventor was unreasonably secretive of the principles and
      operating methods of his apparatus. He had assured them that the
      "generator" had been perfected a year before, and that the
      "multiplicator" was also now perfected, and they considered it
      only fair and reasonable that the secrets of the machinery be
      revealed to them. They recommended that some intelligent and
      trustworthy person be taken into Keely's confidence "so that in
      the case of accident they would not be totally without a clue to
      the invention". The report complained at some length about Keely's
      uncommunicativeness and said that it was the experience of
      everyone who had come into contact with him over the previous ten
      years that "any attempt at a serious investigation of his
      operations has been met on his part with deception and
      misrepresentation".[8]<br>
      <br>
      Keely was reluctant to reveal his secrets, and filed a demurrer on
      20 January 1882 to the bill in equity presented against him by the
      Keely Motor Company's stockholders. The demurrer was described as
      entirely technical, and gave a number of reasons why the court
      should not afford the plaintiffs the relief they sought.[9]
      Argument was heard on the demurrer in Philadelphia's Court of
      Common Pleas on 27 March, when it was argued that the inventor
      "could not be made to expose that which no one knew but himself
      and which was hidden in his own brain".[10] However, Keely was
      overruled by Judge Pierce on 1 April 1882, who ordered him to
      "make known his process in the way indicated in the bill filed by
      the Keely Motor Company".[11]<br>
      <br>
      On 24 May Keely filed his answer to the stockholders' equity suit.
      He admitted the truth of the complainants' bill regarding the
      contract, and added that although, due to "certain abstruse
      difficulties by reason of the nature and qualities of the said
      force", he had so far failed to bring his inventions into
      practical use, he believed he would ultimately succeed.[12]<br>
      <br>
      In June 1882 a committee appointed by the Company's board of
      directors agreed that one William Boekel of Philadelphia was to be
      "instructed by Mr. Keely in the construction and operation of his
      inventions".[13]<br>
      <br>
      The annual meeting of the Company's stockholders on 13 December
      1882 heard a report from Boekel in which he stated that what Keely
      claimed to have discovered was "the fact that water in its natural
      state is capable of being, by vibratory motion, disintegrated so
      that its molecular structure is broken up, and there is evolved
      therefrom a permanent expansive gas or ether, which result is
      produced by mechanical action". Boekel said that it would be
      improper to describe the mechanism used, and added that Keely had
      discovered all that he had claimed.[14] It was later discovered by
      a Times reporter in August that Boekle had not yet been entrusted
      with the secrets of the motor as promised by Keely, and that the
      inventor kept delaying matters by telling Boekle that he could
      explain it to him in less than two hours after it was completed,
      and that he had not done so already because the engine had not yet
      reached that state.[15]<br>
      <br>
      On 28 August 1883, at the monthly meeting of the Company's
      directors, it was announced that Keely's engine would be ready for
      operation around the first week in September, and that a final
      inspection of it by the Trustees would be conducted on 29 August,
      at which the stockholders were expected to be present. When the
      inspection was made the following day, however, Keely said that it
      would not be ready for another six weeks.[16]<br>
      <br>
      On 29 October 1883 it was reported that the Company's stockholders
      were to bring another suit against the inventor in the name of the
      company for "fulfilment of his many pledges".[17] At a meeting of
      the Board of Directors the following day, Keely made a statement
      explaining his progress, saying that he was constructing a street
      chamber to hold his vapor and that when this was complete a
      demonstration would be given, and his explanation was voted "very
      satisfactory" by the directors.[18]<br>
      <br>
      At the annual stockholders' meeting on 12 December 1883 a letter
      from Keely was read out, in which the inventor said that he could
      not see why he might not fulfil the shareholders' expectations in
      the next two months and suggested that the stockholders' meeting
      be postponed to 1 February 1884. This proposal met with some
      disagreement from some stockholders, and it was decided to give
      Keely no funds for the next 60 days.[19] When the promised
      stockholders' meeting was held on 1 February 1884, another
      postponement was announced at Keely's request.[20] A board meeting
      which took place on 25 March 1884 reported that the vibratory
      engine was finished, that "the work of adjusting and focalizing is
      progressing rapidly", and that Keely had set the date for the
      demonstration of the motor to take place on or before 10
      April.[21]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Vaporic gun</b><br>
      <br>
      On 20 September 1884 Keely demonstrated a "vaporic gun" at Sandy
      Hook to a party of Government officials. He said that he had
      brought with him five gallons of "vaporic force" in a "receiver"
      which, if the experiments were successful, would show that no
      bogus aids had been used. The gun was described as a small gun
      with a 1.25 in (32 mm) bore, resting on wheels, with an iron
      "receiver" 4.5 ft (1.4 m) long containing Keely's mysterious force
      connected to it by "an iron wire tube" 3/16" (5 mm) in diameter.
      Keely rammed a small lead ball about 5 oz (140 g) in weight into
      the gun's muzzle, then tapped the iron "receiver" with a hammer.
      He explained that this was to stimulate the "vibratory force". He
      then turned a handle and the ball was fired from the gun with a
      short, sharp report but no smoke and very little recoil. It was
      reported that the projectile had been fired a distance of 300 yd
      (270 m). More shots were fired and their velocity measured; one
      attained 482 ft/s (147 m/s), another 492 ft/s (150 m/s), and yet
      another 523 ft/s (159 m/s). The gun was also tested by firing
      against three 3 in (76 mm) thick spruce planks and penetrated the
      first and went halfway through the second. Keely said that he had
      used a pressure of 7,000 psi and could use 30,000 psi.[22]<br>
      <br>
      The following day Keely met with a reporter to whom he declared
      that his experimenting days were over and that complete success
      was close. He announced that his motor would be completed in less
      than two months and that he would then make a public exhibition of
      its powers.[3]<br>
      <br>
      The vaporic gun failed to impress Lieutenant E.L. Zalinski, who
      had witnessed the demonstration. He told the President of the
      Keely Motor Company, A.R. Edey, that with the same apparatus he
      could perform the same experiments with compressed air, and go
      even further than Keely had gone. Edey said he would "speak about
      it to Mr. Keely," but offer was not accepted. Zalinski said that
      none of the experiments at Sandy Hook showed that Keely had
      discovered a new force.[23]<br>
      <br>
      Zalinski later attended a demonstration at Keely's workshop in
      November, in place of Colonel John Hamilton. He later reported
      that he suggested to Keely that it would be a more complete test
      of his power if he would discharge a large reservoir which he
      showed his guests, and then recharge it using his generator. Keely
      declined to do this, on the grounds that it would take two hours -
      despite his many statements that he could generate force in a few
      seconds - and that the reservoir had been "carefully negatized".
      Keely also claimed to have achieved pressures of 50,000 psi, and
      that he had broken all his pressure gauges. When Zalinski produced
      a pressure gauge he had brought with him - capable of registering
      10,000 psi - and offered it to Keely, saying "I would like to have
      you put it on, and break it for me", Keely was momentarily lost
      for words before saying, "I do not believe in pressure gauges,
      anyhow."[24]<br>
      <br>
      <b>June 1885 demonstration</b><br>
      <br>
      On 6 June 1885 Keely gave what he called "an exhibition" of his
      motor at his workshop at North Twentieth Street, Philadelphia.
      Around 20 witnesses attended, including newspaper reporters, a
      mechanical engineer, and officers and stockholders of the Keely
      Motor Company. A reporter noticed a "large iron globular object"
      which he was told was a new engine which Keely was engaged in
      building.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Keely assembled an apparatus on top of which was screwed a globe
      with several apertures to which tubes were fixed, leading to
      cylinders. A reporter asked if he could see the globe's contents,
      but Keely declined, saying that it would take too long, and that
      he wished to show results rather than the mechanism. Keely then
      proceeded by taking a violin bow and rubbing it across one of two
      large tuning forks which formed part of his apparatus. After
      making a minor adjustment to the device, he opened a stopcock
      leading into one of the cylinders and the witnesses heard "a hiss
      as of escaping air". Keely told them that it was in fact "etheric
      vapor", adding "It ain't compressed air or any vapor having
      substance." The force was then used to lift some weights, and
      Keely claimed that he had about 22,000 psi of pressure at his
      disposal.[4]<br>
      <br>
      A further demonstration was given, of a rotating iron globe
      suspended on an axle, which was used to saw some wood. The globe
      was not opened, Keely saying that it was hollow and empty, and his
      assistants saying that it contained "some bits of mechanism". A
      sceptical reporter, who believed that it was in fact operating on
      compressed air, asked how long the engine could work. Keely
      replied that he had one run for 40 days, whereupon the reporter
      suggested he simply run it for half an hour, just making the globe
      rotate. Keely duly set the globe rotating, and it ran for less
      than 15 minutes, constantly decreasing in power, before he stopped
      it.[4]<br>
      <br>
      On 26 March 1886 Keely performed a demonstration before a
      committee of scientists and engineers from New York, where he
      obtained a pressure of 2,700 psi apparently by using a single pint
      of water, and then doubled the pressure by adding more water.
      Keely claimed that the "etheric force" by which these results were
      obtained would be utilized as fully as possible in the 25,000 hp
      engine on which he was then working.[25]<br>
      <br>
      The stockholders of the Keely Motor Company met on 14 December
      1887, and expressed their confidence in Keely's ultimate success.
      Keely did not attend the meeting, but supplied a report in which
      he reviewed his efforts and experiments since 1882 and announced
      that he had abandoned "etheric force" in favour of a new force
      which was unnamed but which he said was based on "vibratory
      sympathy".[26]<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Wilson suit</b><br>
      <br>
      On 3 January 1888 an injunction was granted against Keely on
      behalf of complainant Bennett C. Wilson, who said that in 1863 he
      had entered into an agreement with Keely, whom he had originally
      engaged to varnish furniture. The agreement was that Wilson was to
      find tools and materials and pay the expenses of inventions made
      by Keely, Keely agreeing that all inventions so made, and patents
      obtained, should be equally owned by him and Wilson. On 14 August
      1869 Keely assigned a half ownership in what was referred to as
      the "Keely motor" to Wilson, who claimed that Keely had then
      assigned all rights and title to the invention later that same
      month in return for funds.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Wilson alleged that he had only recently become aware that the
      machine called the "Keely motor" was the same as the one
      constructed in 1869 and assigned to him. He asked for an
      injunction restraining Keely from removing the machine or altering
      its construction or mode of operation, and requested that an order
      also be made compelling Keely to exhibit to the complainant all
      models, machines, and drawings of the invention referred to in the
      assignments to Wilson, and that an order be made compelling Keely
      to fully disclose the invention and the mode of constructing and
      operating it.[27]<br>
      <br>
      On 7 April a formal order was made directing Bennett Wilson, his
      attorney, and four experts, to make a full and detailed inspection
      of the Keely motor, its mode of construction, and principle of
      operation within 30 days. The four experts were named as Dr.
      Charles M. Cresson, Analytical Chemist of City and State Boards of
      Health; Thomas Shaw, mechanical engineer; William D. Marks, civil
      engineer and Professor of Dynamical Engineering at the University
      of Pennsylvania; and Jacob Naylor, iron founder and President of
      the Eighth National Bank. The result of the inspection was to make
      known only whether the present Keely motor was or was not the same
      apparatus that he was alleged to have assigned to Wilson in
      1869.[28]<br>
      <br>
      On 18 September it was revealed that Keely had not yet obeyed the
      court order, despite the time span having been increased to 60
      days, and a lawyer representing Bennett Wilson said he believed
      Keely never would comply with the order and that he had never
      intended to do so.[29] Finally, on 17 November 1888, Keely was
      jailed in Moyamensing Prison for contempt of court for refusing
      the court order to "operate and explain the mode of operation" of
      the Keely Motor.[30] However, he was soon released on bail on 20
      November by three judges of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.[31]<br>
      <br>
      Finally, on 28 January 1889, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
      handed down an opinion reversing the order committing Keely to
      prison for contempt, and ordered his discharge. The opinion
      declared that the order commanding Keely to "exhibit, explain, and
      operate his motor" was premature, and that the court had no right
      to enforce the order by committing Keely to jail for contempt.[32]<br>
      <br>
      On March 28, 1889 Keely's counsel announced that the inventor had
      the "missing link" which was needed to make the "vibratory
      resonator and ethereal generative evaporator" a success. It was
      described as a copper tube in the form of a loop, with the ends
      welded together so that no joint could be seen, and had been made
      in copper due to that metal's "resonant properties". A private
      demonstration of Keely's motor was promised as soon as the tube
      was "adjusted", and was stated as likely to occur "in a week or
      two".[33]<br>
      <br>
      At the Keely Motor Company's stockholders' meeting in December, a
      report was read from Keely in which he discussed the difficulties
      he had had with the Board of Directors during 1889 and said that
      while the work of "graduating" or adjusting his provisional engine
      had not progressed as rapidly as he had expected, no serious
      obstacles had presented themselves, and there were no difficulties
      affecting the principle or "essence" of his work. While he could
      not give a timescale for when the graduation of the engine would
      be completed, Keely said that it would not be a protracted period,
      and that when it was finished, one or more engines would at once
      be ordered.[34]<br>
      <br>
      In June 1895 the trade journal Electricity published a challenge
      to Keely, in which they said that they would undertake to repeat
      every phenomenon produced by Keely within 60 days. Keely ignored
      this challenge.[35]<br>
      <br>
      After an absence of several years in England, Mrs Moore returned
      to the US to deal with litigation concerning her late husband's
      estate. Her advocacy of Keely and his inventions formed part of
      the case and she decided to strengthen her position by getting
      eminent physicists to examine his inventions. Among those invited
      were Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, both of whom declined the
      opportunity for various reasons.[36]<br>
      <br>
      Keely again informed the directors of his company in early
      November 1895 that "before the end of the year" he would
      "positively be all through with his work to prove conclusively
      that" he has devised "a practical commercial working engine"
      operated by his new force.[35]<br>
      <br>
      On 14 November it was reported that another meeting had been
      arranged between Keely and Mrs Bloomfield Moore and New York
      capitalists headed by John Jacob Astor IV, who were interested in
      the Keely Motor Company.[37] It was reported the following week
      that Astor had purchased a large interest in the motor from "a
      person who for some years past has been an enthusiastic advocate
      of M. Keely".[35]<br>
      <br>
      Also in November 1895, Mrs Moore invited Addison B. Burk,
      president of the Spring Garden Institute to make an inspection.
      Burk asked if electrical engineer E. Alexander Scott of the
      Engineers Club could accompany him, and this was agreed to. In the
      event, Scott took charge of the investigation as he was familiar
      with Keely and had talked to him in 1874.[1][36]<br>
      <br>
      Scott made several visits to Keely's workshop, beginning on 9
      November 1895, and was shown many demonstrations. Among these was
      a levitation experiment where heavy weights in sealed flasks of
      water were made to rise and fall in response to differently
      pitched sounds from a zither, to activate a "globe liberator"
      which then transmitted "the aetheric force" through a wire to the
      water container. This had been shown to many investors and
      investigators. Scott was accompanied by Burk on his second and
      third visits and when the two analysed what they had seen they
      concluded that compressed air had been used in nearly all the
      experiments, in some cases alongside another more powerful but
      hidden force. The demonstration with the rising and falling
      weights was powered by compressed air via a thin tube which Keely
      had assured Burk and Scott was a solid wire and which was a common
      feature in nearly every piece of apparatus in Keely's
      laboratory.[38]<br>
      <br>
      Burk and Scott reported their findings to Mrs Moore, who was
      concerned by the negative report, and also by dismissive articles
      in the press. It was reported on 22 March 1896 that Mrs Bloomfield
      Moore had arranged with Professor Wentworth Lascelles Scott of
      London to investigate Keely's claims of etheric force and also to
      examine his other inventions. It was said that "an important
      series of tests will be made in the presence of the
      scientist".[39] Lascelles Scott was allowed to examine whatever he
      wanted and had complete instructions on its use from Keely. After
      spending a month investigating, Lascelles Scott stated to a
      meeting of the Franklin Institute that "Keely has demonstrated to
      me, in a way which is absolutely unquestionable, the existence of
      a force hitherto unknown."[38]<br>
      <br>
      Since Lascelles Scott and Alexander Scott disagreed, they were
      brought together to witness more demonstrations by Keely. Mrs
      Moore suggested that a definitive test would be to cut the wire
      that Scott alleged was in fact an air pipe, but Keely flatly
      refused to do so and Mrs Moore, her faith shaken, reduced Keely's
      monthly salary.<br>
      <br>
      On 24 December 1895 Mrs Bloomfield Moore said that due to the
      position taken by the managers of the old Keely Motor Company at
      the annual meeting, and the delay on the part of the stockholders
      in accepting his proposition for a reorganization, Keely had
      decided not to take out any patents on his inventions, and would
      instead adopt a royalty system in dealing with his inventions
      commercially. Mrs Moore said that at least 30 patents would be
      required, which would take much time and money which would be
      better used in developing Keely's system.[40]<br>
      <br>
      On 18 June 1897 Keely demonstrated his new etheric engine to the
      General Manager of the Manhattan Elevated Railway, the Chief
      Engineer of Western Union, and a representative of the
      Metropolitan Traction Company. All were reported as being
      surprised at the force produced by Keely's new motor, but declined
      to express any opinion as to its value. The engine was reported as
      weighing about 200 lb (91 kg) and being capable of developing 10
      hp.[41]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Death</b><br>
      <br>
      Keely died at his home in Philadelphia from pneumonia on 18
      November 1898.[42] His will was admitted to probate on 1 December,
      and bequeathed his entire estate of about $10,000 to his widow,
      Anna M. Keely, who was appointed his executor. The will made no
      reference to his motor.[43]<br>
      <br>
      Keely is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd,
      Pennsylvania.<br>
      <br>
      The first meeting of the Keely Motor Company's stockholders
      following his death was held on 20 December 1898. Charles S. Hill,
      his widow's attorney, stated that Keely's secret did not exist in
      manuscript form, but that Keely had suggested before his death
      that an inventor, Thomas Burton Kinraide of Boston, was the one
      man who could successfully carry on his work. Hill then announced
      that he had a secret which he would pass on to only one person.
      This secret, he said, was "of a nature to encourage the
      stockholders and to induce them to leave everything in Kinraide's
      hands for one year". John J. Smith, one of the Company's
      Directors, was appointed to confer with Hill, and later reported
      that the secret told to him by Hill "offered great encouragement
      to the stockholders" but did not divulge any further details.[44]<br>
      <br>
      In January 1899 Kinraide had 20 large packing cases transported to
      his laboratory in Jamaica Plain, Boston, said to contain the
      material part of Keely's motor. Kinraide said that he had often
      talked with Keely about the principles of his invention and said
      that he felt he knew more about it than any other person. He was
      to continue with Keely's experiments at the request of Mr. and Mrs
      Keely.[45] However, on 6 May 1899 it was reported that Kinraide
      had abandoned all work on the Keely motor and was to return all
      the machines and notes to the Keely Company. He stated that he
      wanted nothing more to do with the motor due to the notoriety
      caused him by the Philadelphia Press's report and when asked
      whether he thought the motor was a fraud simply replied that he
      had not arrived at any such conclusion and had decided to make no
      further investigations.[46]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Philadelphia Press investigation</b><br>
      <br>
      On 19 January 1899 The Philadelphia Press published an illustrated
      article detailing an investigation made by the newspaper of
      Keely's workshop, in which the Press contended that the
      investigation had clearly proven Keely's motor to have been "a
      delusion and deception" and that its alleged mysterious forces
      were the result of trickery.[47]<br>
      <br>
      The investigation, which took a week, was assisted by consulting
      engineer Professor Carl Hering, Assistant Professor of Physics at
      the University of Pennsylvania Professor Arthur W. Goodspeed,
      Professor of Experimental Psychology at the University of
      Pennsylvania Lightner Witmer, and Doctor M. G. Miller, who
      superintended digging operations. Electrical engineer Clarence B.
      Moore, the son of Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, was an observer. The
      scientists involved substantiated the report with signed
      statements.[47]<br>
      <br>
      The floors of Keely's workshop were taken up and a brick wall was
      removed. Inside the wall they found mechanical belts linked to a
      silent water motor two floors below the laboratory. In the
      basement there was a three-ton sphere of compressed air that ran
      the machines through hidden high pressure tubes and switches. The
      walls, ceilings and even solid beams were found to have concealed
      tubes. Journalists documented everything photographically to leave
      no room for doubt. Hering and Goodspeed were of the opinion that
      the tubing and the large steel sphere in the basement indicated
      the use of normal forces and possible deception, and Hering said
      in his signed statement that Keely had probably lied and deceived,
      and was satisfied that he had used highly compressed air to power
      his demonstrations.[47]<br>
      <br>
      At a meeting of the Keely Motor Company's board on 25 January
      1899, President B. L. Ackerman issued a statement denying the
      Philadelphia Press report. The statement claimed that the tubes
      mentioned in the report had been discarded by Keely years before,
      and that in all his experiments since 1887 only solid wires had
      been used. Up to that time, it was stated, Keely had been working
      on a theory of etheric or vaporic force, and used the tubes to
      convey this force, but after 1887 he was convinced that he had
      discovered what he called "vibratory sympathy". A concealed
      electric wire discovered in Keely's workshop was described by
      Ackerman as the remains of the wires of a burglar alarm, and in no
      way connected with the force used by Keely's motor. The statement
      denied all assertions that Keely was an imposter, and declared
      that there was no trickery in any of the results that Keely had
      claimed to have obtained.[48]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Present day</b><br>
      <br>
      Today, Philadelphia has forgotten all about its infamous resident.
      Even Keely's old house has completely disappeared and the site is
      now a private parking lot for the property next door.[49] A model
      of Keely's engine was in the collection of the Franklin Institute
      in Philadelphia, and an "Etheric Force Machine" of his dating from
      1878 is in the American Precision Museum in Windsor, Vermont.<br>
      <br>
      Keely still has supporters, who continue to claim that he was
      framed.<br>
      <br>
      "Unfortunately the history books took the Scientific American
      debunking as fact and John Keely has been portrayed historically
      as a fraud and a conman. This is because Clarence Moore found the
      floor of Keely's 'workshop' raised and saw a pressure machine that
      was hooked up to his machines to make them look like they actually
      worked. Those who have any inkling of physics who have studied
      what remains of his work, know these reports to be mostly
      erroneous." — Jerry Decker, KeelyNet.com<br>
      <br>
      Dale Pond's Was Keely a Fraud? argues against the idea that Keely
      was a fraud.<br>
      <br>
      Keely's theories form the basis of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics
      which is detailed within the SVPwiki where the bulk of his found
      writings are presented for study.<br>
      <br>
      Keely's theories were featured prominently in the 1998 book Gods
      of Eden by Andrew Collins, in relation to the theoretical use of
      SVP-based devices as systems of levitation.<br>
      <br>
      Note: In 2005 Jeff and Rita Behary found the original glass plate
      negatives of the Keely Motor taken by Thomas Burton Kinraide in
      his Jamaica Plain home Ravenscroft. They show the contents of the
      Keely Motor and are the last known photos [50]of the motor ever
      taken. Kinraide discovered evidence of plain fraud within the
      motor but did not wish this information to be published because
      Keely was a close friend and he did not wish to further tarnish
      his name in the press. The photos can be found here :<br>

      <br>
      Quoted from Dashed Against the Rock- Colville<br>
      <br>
      First.<br>
      Matter is capable of infinite subdivision.<br>
      <br>
      Second.<br>
      In the aggregation of matter, force or energy is stored up or
      conserved.<br>
      <br>
      Third.<br>
      In the dissociation of matter, force is liberated.<br>
      <br>
      Fourth.<br>
      All matter is in a state of perpetual activity, whether the
      substance under consideration be inanimate or animated, visible or
      invisible.<br>
      <br>
      Fifth.<br>
      There is no dividing of matter and force into two distinct terms,
      as they both are ONE.FORCE is liberated matter. Matter is force in
      bondage.<br>
      <br>
      Sixth.<br>
      All motion is synchronous; no sound or movement can be made but
      all that moves or sounds does so in harmony with something.<br>
      <br>
      Seventh.<br>
      All structures, whether crystalline or homogeneous, have for their
      unit structures minute bodies called molecules. It is the motion
      of these molecules with which we have particularly to deal; as in
      experimental research and demonstration, when we produce an action
      upon one Molecule we do so upon all the molecules constituting the
      mass operated upon.<br>
      <br>
      Eighth.<br>
      These molecules have an envelope, rotating with inconceivable
      rapidity, formed of a high tenuous ether, whose place in the order
      of subdivision ranks third, the three divisions being, - first,
      molecular; second, atomic; third, atomolic. (For convenience' sake
      we will use the term atomolic in place of etheric in our
      subsequent definitions.)<br>
      <br>
      Ninth.<br>
      This atomolic substance has a density approximately 986,000 times
      that of steel, enabling it to permeate steel as light penetrates
      glass; this rotating envelope of atomolic substance is in a liquid
      condition. There are four conditions of matter; viz. solid,
      liquid,gaseous, and ultra-gaseous. These conditions result from
      greater or lesser range of oscillation of the composing units
      individually: this is equally true, whether the units are
      molecules, atoms, atomoles, planets, or suns. But one LAW governs
      all matter.<br>
      <br>
      Tenth.<br>
      This molecular envelope, rotating with such great velocity, holds
      in its embrace the next subdivision of matter, the atomic. There
      cannot ever be more or less than three atoms in any Molecule.<br>
      These are placed so as to form a triangle in the interior; they
      rest in a condition of substance, or matter, we will term
      inter-molecular. In this inter-molecular substance we find an
      enormous energy or force in bondage, held thus by the rotating
      envelope enclosing it.Were we to rotate a spun brass shell, say
      nine inches in diameter, at a very much less rate of speed than
      that at which the molecular envelope rotates, say nine hundred
      revolutions per second, - its equator would first bulge out, then
      form into an oval disc. A solid block of wood subject to such
      revolution would swiftly fly to pieces. The rotating envelope of
      aMolecule,unlike these, the greater its velocity of rotation, the
      greater is its compression toward the centre (syntropy) of the
      molecule. The rotation of this envelope is of such a nature as to
      produce an internal pressure upon every portion from every point
      of the Molecule as a sphere. Were we to consider a rotating
      envelope as ordinarily understood, it would be one in which the
      envelope rotated around an equator having poles of no rotation; i.
      e. the poles would not possess the compressing force of the
      equator: the result would therefore be a compressed equator, and
      the intermolecular substance would pass out without resistance at
      the poles.<br>
      <br>
      Eleventh.<br>
      If it be possible let us conceive an envelope with an equator, but
      destitute of poles,a number of these rotating over the sphere,
      this atomolic envelope possessing an almost infinite attractive
      force toward the centre of theMolecule, pressing in the
      inter-molecular substance, where it is held until this revolving
      envelope becomes negatized by a certain order of vibration, when
      the enclosed matter rushes out to its natural condition of
      concordant tenuity, as in the case of gunpowder, dynamite, and
      nitro-glycerine. This force, we must see,has been held in the
      embrace of the rotating envelopes of the unit-structures, or where
      does it come from? This force at the time of an explosion was
      liberated by shock or fire, both being orders of imparted motion
      or vibration. How much greater the result would be were we to
      associate a scientific instrument now completed, and shortly to be
      given to the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; an agent as nitro-glycerine; one
      pound of nitro-glycerine would have its destructive force
      augmented beyond all possible control. These instruments are
      carefully concealed by wise masters from all persons save the few
      who are already prepared to study their potency with the exclusive
      end in view of aiding the real scientific progress of humanity;
      and, furthermore,&nbsp;&nbsp; be truly stated that a ferocious
      sensualist, however powerful his intellect, would be utterly
      unable to either comprehend or operate one of these marvelous
      constructions.<br>
      <br>
      Twelfth.<br>
      Next in order of consideration is the second subdivision of matter
      - the atomic. The atom has the same rotating envelope as
      theMolecule, governed by the same laws of rotation and
      compression. The rotating envelope holds in its embrace the
      interatomic substance and three atomoles resting in it, the
      atomoles within the atom being constructed after the same pattern
      as the atom and theMolecule, obedient to the same laws; the atomic
      being simply the third subdivision of matter. The threefold order
      is absolutely universal.<br>
      <br>
      Thirteenth.<br>
      The atomolic substance is what is termed the ether which fills all
      space and is the transmitting medium for all celestial and
      terrestrial forces. This is the liquid ether of occult science.<br>
      <br>
      Fourteenth.<br>
      The atomoles are made up of atomolini (singular atomolinus ); the
      subdivision of&nbsp; matter from this point is beyond man's power,
      as at this point it escapes all control of apparatus, passing
      through glass and hardened steel as a luminous flame without heat,
      which is hardly seen before it vanishes, - a perpetual flame
      coldly luminous.<br>
      <br>
      Fifteenth.<br>
      This again, from previous analysis, is made up according to the
      triple order, and may again be subject to subdivision, even to
      infinity.<br>

            of Sympathetic Vibratory Physics</b></big><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The following forty laws governing natural harmony, sound and
      vibration are explored by Dale Pond in detail in his book:
      Universal Laws Never Before Revealed: Keelys Secrets. Some of
      these laws are again explored in Its a Musical Universe!<br>
      <br>
      <b>(1) Law of Matter and Force</b><br>
      "Coextensive and coeternal with space and duration, there exists
      an infinite and unchangeable quantity of atomoles, the base of all
      matter; these are in a state of constant vibratory motion,
      infinite in extent, unchangeable in quantity, the initial of all
      forms of energy."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(2) Law of Corporeal Vibrations</b><br>
      "All coherent aggregates when isolated from like bodies, or when
      immersed or confined in media composed of matter in a different
      state, vibrate at a given ascertainable pitch." <br>
      <br>
      <b>(3) Law of Corporeal Oscillations</b><br>
      "All coherent aggregates not isolated from like bodies, oscillate
      at a period-frequency varying with the tensions that augment and
      diminish the state of equilibrium."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(4) Law of Harmonic Vibrations</b><br>
      "All coherent aggregates are perpetually vibrating at a
      period-frequency corresponding to some harmonic ratio of the
      fundamental pitch of the vibrating body; this pitch is a multiple
      of the pitch of the atomole."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(5) Law of Transmissive Vibraic Energy</b><br>
      "All oscillating and vibrating coherent aggregates create, in the
      media in which they are immersed, outwardly propagated concentric
      waves of alternate condensation and rarefaction, having a
      period-frequency identical with the pitch of the aggregate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scholium:</b> All forms of transmissive energy can be focussed,
      reflected, refracted, diffracted, transformed, and diminished in
      intensity inversely as the square of the distance from the
      originating source."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Universal Laws</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>(6) Law of Sympathetic Oscillation</b><br>
      "Coherent aggregates immersed in a medium pulsating at their
      natural pitch simultaneously oscillate with the same frequency,
      whether the pitch of the medium be a unison, or any harmonic of
      the fundamental pitch of the creative aggregate." <br>
      <br>
      (<b>7) Law of Attraction</b><br>
      "Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in unison, or harmonic
      ration, are mutually attracted."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(8) Law of Repulsion</b><br>
      "Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in discord are mutually
      repelled."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(9) Law of Cycles</b><br>
      "Coherent aggregates harmonically united constitute centers of
      vibration bearing relation to the fundamental pitch not multiples
      of the harmonic pitch, and the production of secondary unions
      between themselves generate pitches that are discords, either in
      their unisons, or overtones with the original pitch; from harmony
      is generated discord, the inevitable cause of perpetual
      transformation."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(10) Law of Harmonic Pitch</b><br>
      "Any aggregate in a state of vibration develops in addition to its
      fundamental pitch a series of vibration in symmetrical
      sub-multiple portions of itself, bearing ratios of one, two,
      three, or more times its fundamental pitch."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(11) Law of Force</b><br>
      "Energy manifests itself in three forms: Creative, the vibrating
      aggregate; Transmissive, being the propagation of isochronous
      waves through the media in which it is immersed; Attractive, being
      its action upon other aggregates capable of vibrating in unisons
      or harmony."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(12) Law of Oscillating Atomic Substances</b><br>
      "Coherent atomic substances are capable of oscillating at a pitch
      varying directly as the density, and inversely as the linear
      dimensions from one period of frequency per unit of time to the
      21st octave above, producing the creative force of Sonity, whose
      transmissive force (Sound) is propagated through the media of
      solids, liquids, and gases, and whose static effect (Sonism)
      produces attractions and repulsions between sympathetically
      vibrating bodies according to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and
      Repulsion."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(13) Law of Sono-thermity</b><br>
      "Internal vibrations of atomic substances and atomic molecules are
      capable of vibrating at a period-frequency directly as their
      density, inversely as their linear dimensions, directly as the
      coefficient of their tension from the 21st to the 42nd octaves,
      producing the creative force (Sono-thermity), whose transmissive
      force (Sono-therm) is propagated in solid, liquid, gaseous, and
      ultra-gaseous media, statically producing adhesions and molecular
      unions, or disintegration, according to the Law of Harmonic
      Attraction and Repulsion."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(14) Law of Oscillating Atoms</b><br>
      "All atoms when in a state of tension are capable of oscillating
      at a pitch inversely as the cube of their atomic weights, and
      directly as their tension from 42 to 63 octaves per second,
      producing the creative force (Thermism), whose transmissive force
      (Rad-energy) propagated in solid, liquid, and gaseous ether,
      produces the static effects (Cohesion and Chemism) on other atoms
      of association, or dissociation, according to the Law of Harmonic
      Attraction and Repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scholium: </b>Dark radiant heat begins at absolute zero
      temperature, and extends through light, chemical rays, actinic
      rays, and infra-violet rays, up to the dissociation of all
      molecules to the 63rd octave."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(15) Law of Vibrating Atomolic Substances</b><br>
      "Atoms are capable of vibrating within themselves at a pitch
      inversely as the Dyne (the local coefficient of Gravity), and as
      the atomic volume, directly as the atomic weight, producing the
      creative force (Electricity), whose transmissive force is
      propagated through atomolic solids, liquids, and gases, producing
      induction and the static effect of magnetism upon other atoms of
      attraction or repulsion, according to the Law of Harmonic
      Attraction and Repulsion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scholium: </b>The phenomenon of Dynamic Electricity through a
      metallic conductor and of induction are identical. In a metallic
      conductor, the transmission is from atom to atom, through
      homologous interstices, filled with ether, presenting small areas
      in close proximity. In crystalline structures, heat, which expands
      the atoms, by twisting them produces striae, increases the
      resistance, etc. Between parallel wires and through air the
      induction takes place from large areas through a rarefied medium
      composed of a mixture of substances, whose atoms are separated by
      waves of repulsion of various pitches, discordant to electric
      vibrations; the said atoms sympathetically absorb the vibrations
      and dissipate from themselves, as centers, concentric waves of
      electric energy which produces heat and gravism."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(16) Law of Oscillating Atomoles</b><br>
      "Atomoles oscillating at a uniform pitch (determined by their
      uniform size and weight) produce the creative force Atomolity,
      whose transmissive form, Gravism, is propagated through more
      rarefied media, producing the static effect upon all other
      atomoles, denominated Gravity."<br>
      <br>
      <b>(17) Law of Transformation of Forces</b><br>
      "All forces are different forms of Universal Energy unlike in
      their period- frequency, merging into each other by imperceptible
      increments; each form representing the compass of 21 octaves. Each
      form or pitch may be transformed into an equivalent quantity of
      another pitch above or below it in the scale of 105 octaves. The
      transformation can occur only through its static effect,
      developing vibrations of harmonic pitches above or below their
      fundamental vibration, or developing with juxtaposed aggregates,
      resultant and difference, or third order, as the case may be.<br>

      "The higher harmonics and overtones of projected rad-energy are of
      a pitch sufficiently high to cause the atom to expand; by causing

      John Worrell Keely (1837-1898) of Philadelphia was a carpenter and
      mechanic who announced in 1872 that he had discovered a new
      principle for power production. The vibrations of a simple tuning
      fork had given him the idea, and the means to tap etheric energy.
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="keelycr.jpg" width="200"
          height="249"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Keely persuaded a dozen engineers and capitalists to invest in the
      idea, forming the Keely Motor Company in New York in 1872. Soon he
      had capital of one million dollars, primarily from wealthy New
      York and Philadelphia businessmen. He used the money to buy
      materials necessary for building a motor based on his theories.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <div align="center"><i><b>Keely Motor Company Board of Directors</b></i><i><b><br>
          </b></i></div>

      <br>
      Soon he had constructed an etheric generator, which he
      demonstrated to amazed audiences in 1874 in Philadelphia. Keely
      blew into a nozzle for half a minute, then poured five gallons of
      tap water into the same nozzle. After some fine adjustments the
      pressure gage indicated pressures of 10,000 pounds per square
      inch. This, said Keely, was evidence that the water had been
      disintegrated and a mysterious vapor had been liberated in the
      generator, capable of powering machinery. <br>
      <br>
      One spectator at a Keely demonstration described the power of the
      machine. "Great ropes were torn apart, iron bars broken in two or
      twisted out of shape, bullets discharged through twelve inch
      planks, by a force which could not be determined."<br>
      <br>
      Keely predicted his discovery would make other forms of power
      obsolete. A quart of water would be enough to send a train from
      Philadelphia to San Francisco and back. A gallon would propel a
      steamship from N. Y. to Liverpool and back. "A bucket of water has
      enough of this vapor to produce a power sufficient to move the
      world out of its course." <br>
      <br>
      Keely lived comfortably, as befitted the president of a company,
      but not extravagently. To his credit, he plowed most of the
      invested money into research equipment and tools. He did most of
      the experimentation himself, designing and constructing his own
      apparatus. He was not willing to entrust his secret to those who
      could not or would not understand—especially physicists and
      engineers. Skeptics noted that the equipment could never be made
      to work as it was supposed to unless Keely was present. <br>
      <br>
      The work went slowly. To keep up the spirits of stockholders Keely
      staged occasional public demonstrations. These were masterpieces
      of showmanship. He demonstrated a marvelous machine, a "vibratory
      engine" or "hydro-pneumatic pulsating vacuo-engine." It was a work
      of the machinist's art, made of gleaming brass and copper. The
      engine was attached to another machine called a "liberator," a
      complicated array of brass wires, tubes and tuning forks.<br>
      <br>
      Keely explained that he was tapping a "latent force" of nature—the
      vibratory energy of the ether. [We can blame that idea on the
      physicists.] Keely often used a harmonica, violin, flute, zither
      or pitch pipe to activate his machines. Some said that it was
      worth the price of being duped to hear the eloquent language Keely
      used wo explain his theory. [Keely was said to have considerable
      musical knowledge and talent.] Skeptics suggested that these
      musical tones were a signal to a hidden confederate to activate
      the secret trickery and mechanisms that made the miracles happen.
      <br>
      <br>
      A central idea of Keely's theory of nature was the notion that
      musical tones could resonate with atoms, or with the ether itself.
      He even drew this musical chart to help people understand the
      finer points of this theory. [There are those today who use this
      as evidence that Keely was far ahead of his time, anticipating the
      theory of quantum mechanics.] <br>
      <br>
      Biographers have described Keely as a "mechanical experimenter",
      "inventor and imposter", "professor of perfidy", "swindler", and
      "scandalous scamp". Keely's lack of formal scientific education
      didn't bother his supporters, and didn't deter Keely himself from
      grandly proclaiming his theories as "scientific".<br>
      <br>
      Keely expounded his ideas using an elaborate theory of the
      "etheric force", spiced with eloquently profound terms such as:
      "sympathetic equilibrium, quadrupole negative harmonics, etheric
      disintegration". His backers were duly impressed. He looked with
      condescending pity on those who appeared not to understand. <br>
      <br>
      Some disillusioned stockholders withdrew their support as Keely's
      experiments suffered repeated delays. Keely declared he'd already
      proven his theory could be implemented for useful purposes, and he
      made vast claims for the economic benefits of etheric energy over
      coal and other energy sources. But he resisted investor's demands
      that he produce some marketable product. Stockholders were not
      happy with Keely's insistence that more experimentation was needed
      to "perfect" the machines. Fortunately, when nearing bankruptcy,
      Keely acquired a wealthy backer, Mrs. Clara S. J.
      Bloomfield-Moore, the widow of a Philadelphia paper manufacturer.
      <br>
      <br>
      She advanced him over $100,000 for expenses and promised him a
      salary of $2,500 per month. She became active in promoting Keely
      in journals and books and in seeking scientists who might validate
      his claims. She suggested that Keely share his secret with Edison
      or Tesla to hasten its development, but he refused. He did agree
      that scientists at least be allowed to observe the demonstrations.<br>
      <br>
      E. Alexander Scott, an electrical engineer, witnessed such a
      demonstration. When Keely showed him the etheric power causing a
      weight to rise and fall in a closed flask of water, Scott was
      unimpressed. Keely used the sound from a zither to activate the
      globe liberator which then supposedly transmitted the etheric
      force through a wire to the water container. Scott suspected the
      weight was really hollow, so that the slightest change of water
      pressure could cause it to rise or fall, just as a Cartesian
      diver. The wire, he guessed, was a hollow tube transmitting air
      pressure to the water chamber. To counter this suggestion, Keely
      cut a ways into the wire with a file to prove it solid. But Moore
      surreptitiously picked up a scrap piece of similar wire in the
      workshop and later found that it did have a very fine, hollow
      center.<br>
      <br>
      Other demonstrations showed the etheric force to be great enough
      to lift large weights :<br>

      <br>
      It could also fire Keely's "vaporic gun", demonstrated at Sandy
      Hook, Long Island :<br>

      The Scientific American magazine followed Keely's career with some
      amazement and amusement. They were not impressed, reporting that
      all the demonstrations they had witnessed could easily have been
      produced with hidden sources of compressed air.<br>
      <br>
      Keely continued this research for fourteen years, occasionally
      staging demonstrations to placate impatient stockholders. Mrs.
      Moore was concerned by Alexander Scott's negative report, and by
      dismissive and unkind articles in newspapers and magazines. So she
      sought a second opinion from physicist Prof. W. Lascelles-Scott,
      from England. He spent a month in Philadelphia carrying out his
      investigation, finally reporting to the Franklin Institute that
      "Keely has demonstrated to me, in a way which is absolutely
      unquestionable, the existence of a force hitherto unknown." <br>
      <br>
      Since physicist Lascelles-Scott and engineer Alexander Scott
      obviously disagreed, they were brought together to witness more
      Keely demonstrations. Mrs. Moore suggested that the definitive
      test would be to cut that wire that Scott alleged was really an
      air line. This time Keely flatly refused to comply.
      Lascelles-Scott retreated to England, and Mrs. Moore, her faith
      shaken, reduced Keely's salary to $250 per month. <br>

      <br>
      After Keely died on Nov. 18, 1898, suspicious skeptics and
      newspaper reporters did a careful examination of his laboratory.
      Some of Keely's machinery had already been removed by "believers"
      who hoped they could make it work. A Boston electrician, T. Burton
      Kinraide, removed the engine to his home at Jamaica Plains. Some
      of the apparatus ended up in England. No one could make it
      function as it had in Keely's laboratory. The secret was not in
      the machines; the secret was in the laboratory building itself.
      Engineer Alexander Scott and Mrs. Moore's son, Clarence, examined
      the building, accompanied by press and photographers. False
      ceilings and floors were ripped up to reveal hidden mechanical
      belts and linkages to a silent water motor in the basement (two
      floors below the laboratory). A system of pneumatic switches under
      the floor boards could be used to turn machinery on and off. A
      three-ton sphere was found in the basement, thought to be a
      reservoir for compressed air, but which could have been a
      discarded piece of one of Keely's many abandoned projects. The
      walls, ceilings and even apparently solid beams were found to have
      hidden pipework. The evidence of fraud on a grand scale was
      obvious and difficult to dismiss. <br>
      <br>
      What's really remarkable is that Mrs. Moore had persuaded a number
      of apparently respectable scientists to observe Keely's
      demonstrations, and some of them affirmed that they were
      impressed, and even convinced that Keely had made revolutionary
      scientific discoveries. Why were some so easily duped by Keely's
      obvious (though very elaborate) deceptions, which were correctly
      guessed by more perceptive and skeptical observers? Of course, it
      must be stated that Keely never allowed anyone to examine his
      machines, independently test them, or even look inside of them.
      Even today, scam artists promoting energy machines can find at
      least a few degree-holding engineers or physicists willing to
      declare publicly that they found no fraud or deception in the
      machines and who are convinced that new scientific principles are
      at work. So much for "expert witnesses". <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Keely had kept his company going for 26 years without ever
      putting a product on the market, paying a dividend or revealing
      his secrets. That's his one undisputed accomplishment. He never
      divulged his secrets with anyone, so far as we know. One close
      friend reported that he had once asked Keely "John, what do you
      want for an epitaph?" His answer: "Keely, the greatest humbug of
      the nineteenth century."<br>
      <br>
      The term "humbug" is associated with the American showman Phineas
      Taylor Barnum (1810-91), who wrote a book "Humbugs of the World"
      and was renowned for hoodwinking the public with fake and hyped
      "wonders". Barnum and Keely never met, but they might have been
      kindred spirits. <br>
      <br>
      Keely's theories have been cavalierly updated by such folks to
      harmonize with their new-age philosophy, and with their shaky
      understanding of popularized science. They have translated "ether"
      to "zero point energy" or "free energy" that they claim fills all
      of space and may be tapped by anyone clever enough to rediscover
      Keely's secrets.<br>
      <br>
      Some years ago I had the opportunity to see and examine a model of
      Keely's hydro-vacuo engine, part of the collection of the Franklin
      Institute in Philadelphia. At that time it was on loan to a
      private individual (in exchange for a generous gift to the
      museum). Unfortunately backgrounds at this person's home weren't
      ideal for photography, and this photo was the best I obtained
      (though the original photo was in 3d.) <br>
      <br>
      Though the press classed Keely's claims with "perpetual motion",
      Keely himself never claimed that any of his inventions violated
      physical laws. He very cleverly couched his claims to be consonant
      with speculative science of his day. He exercised eloquent
      embellishment of these ideas, and coined marvelous
      scientific-sounding words, but without ever carefully defining
      them. He was so good at this that his followers today can point to
      obscure things Keely said and ingeniously interpret them as
      anticipating modern atomic theory.<br>
      <br>
      Present-day "seekers" likewise avoid the term "perpetual motion".
      To account for the energy they hope to produce, they invent
      mysterious forms of energy "all around us" that have never been
      discovered, have no effect on most matter, and have no solid
      foundation in well-established and well-tested science. <br>
      <br>
      They hold "science as we know it" in contempt, and see today's
      science as a straitjacket restraining those who seek to discover
      "new scientific principles." These folks devote far more effort to
      rationalizing their methods, justifying their unproven claims, and
      inventing new paradigms than they spend producing testable
      results.<br>
      <br>
      It is not pathological to admit that science is never complete,
      and that new discoveries will be made and will at least modify
      some of our present understanding. However, it is just a bit
      perverse to justify one's scientific thinking by basing it on the
      vague and incomprehensible invented pseudoscientific theories and
      experimental deceptions of a 19th century charlatan such as Keely.
      Keely may have been a clever con artist, or he may have been a
      diligent but misguided seeker of scientific truth who only
      fabricated deceptions to gain support. He may have been both.
      Whatever may be the case, I confidently predict that if new
      sources of energy are ever discovered, they will have not the
      slightest connection with anything Keely ever did or imagined.
      Present-day followers and admirers of Keely are wasting their
      time, and will simply get nowhere as they try to implement his
      ideas to produce an energy generator.<br>

      A. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, is the bed of the engine B. figures 1, 4,
      is a cylindrical semi-globular vessel which is bolted to it and
      near its end. C is a vacuum chamber [?] chamber B. it communicates
      with it by means of a circle of openings, a, arranged in its base.<br>
      <br>
      Within the chamber B and of very near by the same conformation as
      the chamber D. its waist or cylindrical part, E, fits snugly and
      tightly the waist or cylindrical part of the vessel B. there is a
      space b. between the semi-globular parts of the two vessels.<br>
      <br>
      F is an inverted conical pulsating chamber placed centrally in the
      vacuum chamber C. its bottom opens into the vessel D. its top is
      closed by a pulsating diaphragm G. the stem H of which passes
      through a guide or box C. of the air chamber, I, which is formed
      from the vacuum chamber C. by the said pulsating diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      J is a water and air vessel which is suspended in an opening in
      the bed A of the engine, it is divided into two parts by the
      pulsating diaphragm K the upper part G is for water, and the lower
      part, d, for air, a pipe I communicates with the chamber F.<br>
      <br>
      M is the valve chest and N, the cylinder of the engine, on the
      chamber J the valve O is of the three way plug order and is
      operated by means of gear wheel and toothed sector e-f figure 1.
      which are actuated by the eccentric rod and eccentric P, G.<br>
      <br>
      R. is a crank shaft which turns in suitable bearings in the
      housings R. it connects with the piston and piston rod g. by means
      of the connecting rod h and the cross head i sliding on the guide
      rods j. on the inner end of the shaft R. is the eccentric Q. which
      actuates the gear and sector e-f. by means of the ball and socket
      eccentric rod P.<br>
      SS are shafts which are parallel and turn coincidentally and at
      the same speed with the shaft R. by means of the spur and pinion
      gearing T', T', T2, T3 they turn in bearings of the housings R2,
      R3 the former carries the ball or fly wheel v while the latter has
      the crank wheel V on its other end.<br>
      <br>
      W is a balance or compensating lever which turns on the fulcrum K.
      depending from the bed plate A of the engine, the ball and socket
      rod W1 connects one end of it to the crank wheel v while W3
      connects its other end to the lever W2 which turns on a fulcrum b
      of the air chamber I.<br>
      <br>
      To start the engine reference being had to figures 1, 4, the
      piston g. being on its up stroke, the cock m. of the supply pipe X
      is opened and sufficient water is admitted to fill the waist B of
      the vessel D the pipe X1 and the chamber J. above the pulsating
      diaphragm K. to the dotted line 4-4. the air displaced by the
      water is forced into the pulsating cone F and compressed in the
      upper part of the chamber J above the said line 4-4. an air pump
      is now applied to the nozzle Y of the vacuum chamber C. and the
      air exhausted therefrom, the chamber C. communicating with the
      semi-globular part of the vessel B through the circle of openings,
      a, in its base, and with the horizontal pipe X2 which leads from
      the valve chest M to the vessel B, the air is exhausted from all
      at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      If the inlet cock, M. of the supply pipe X be opened to its extent
      and a full water pressure be admitted to the waist E of the vessel
      D it will rise in the semi-globular part of the same and also run
      through the pipe X1 into the upper part of the chamber J until the
      compression of the air in the conical pulsating chamber F and in
      the part, d, of the chamber J equals the pressure of the water,
      the cock m. of the pipe T being open to permit a free circulation
      of air between the chambers, the pulsating diaphragms G and K.
      will be extended, the stem H partaking of the outwardly motion of
      its diaphragm will be raised vertically and thereby lift the lever
      W3 it will be readily seen that there is an uninterrupted water or
      other fluid flow between the vessel D and the upper part of the
      chamber J. and an uninterrupted air flow between the lower part of
      the same and the conical pulsating chamber F which opens into the
      upper part of the said vessel D.<br>
      <br>
      A weight sufficient for obtaining the requisite pressure being
      hung so the lever W3 its force on the stem H causes the pulsating
      diaphragm G to compress the air in both chambers F, J. downwardly
      upon the water of the vessel D. and upwardly by the diaphragm K.
      against the water on the pat[?] c1 of the chamber J.<br>
      <br>
      The descending vibration of the lever W3 through its end or
      connecting rod W2 depressed the end, O, of the compensating lever
      W. and of consequence raises its opposite end p, the connecting
      rod W1 of that end turns the crank wheel V. since the shafts SSR
      turn coincidently and at the same speed through the medium of the
      spur gear and pinion T3, T2, T, T. the eccentric Q. and rod P
      working the spur gear and sector e-f. slowly turn the plug valve
      O. until its port q and the valve chest port v leading from the
      chamber J form a continuous port to the cylinder N.<br>
      <br>
      The water in the pipe X1 in the vessel D and in the upper part of
      the chamber J and also the compressed air above the line 4-4
      acting under the influence of the compressed air in the conical
      chamber F and in the lower part of the chamber J. rushes through
      the port, v, and pressing against the under side of the piston g,
      causes it to ascend; when it arrives at the end of its stroke, the
      eccentric Q and the rod P. together with the gear and sector e-f
      will have turned the plug valve V, so as to shut off all
      communications of this cylinder N with chamber J. and opened its
      port into the pipe X2 through the port X?.<br>
      <br>
      The vessel B, the chamber C and the pipe X2 from one continuous
      vacuum, the instant the ports between the cylinder N and the pipe
      X2 are opened, the air and water contained in the cylinder is
      sucked into the vacuum, the pressure of the atmosphere acting on
      the piston through the openings, S, in the cylinder head makes the
      return or down stroke, the back pressure of the air and water
      being renewed by the vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      The set of the crank wheel v should be such that as the piston
      ascends the end p of the compensating lever W should descend and
      the end, o ascends, whereby the lever W is raised gradually and
      the pulsating diaphragm G is permitted to expand or left unloaded
      by the expansion of the air in the chambers F, J and the pressure
      of the water flowing through the supply pipe X.<br>
      <br>
      A few revolutions of the engine will effectually exhaust all the
      air from the upper part of the chamber J, the valve and valve
      chest ports, and from the cylinder beneath the piston.<br>
      <br>
      To draw off the water as exhausted from the cylinder after
      performing its work as a mechanical agent, an exhaust pipe X3 taps
      the semi-globular part of the vessel B near its top as shown at
      figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, its other end dips into water to prevent
      the entrance of air, it is freed of its air at the same time with
      the vacuum chamber C. and the vessel B.<br>
      <br>
      The pipe X3 prevents the water from raising in the chamber or
      vessel C higher than the bottom of the vacuum chamber C. it should
      maintain the same level in the vessel D. if it should rise into
      the pulsating chamber E. as shown at figure 4. it would reduce the
      volume of air and thereby materially interfere with the capacity

          This paper is quite astounding in that it correlates&nbsp;
          with Keelys' claim that water can be progressively dissociated
          at 620, 630 and 12,000 cycles per second.&nbsp; These&nbsp;
          are on the molecular, atomic and etheric levels respectively.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting&nbsp; that the etheric level of 12,000&nbsp;
          /&nbsp; 20&nbsp; =&nbsp; 600 (Puharich's frequency) found by
          original experimentation. This 600 cps frequency&nbsp; is
          therefore&nbsp; a&nbsp; harmonic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
          12,000&nbsp; cps frequency which Puharich discovered.<br>
          <br>
          Keely also claims&nbsp; that the disruption of water occurs at
          42,800 cycles per second.<br>
          <br>
          The direct quote from the book "Keely and His Discoveries" by
          Bloomfield Moore, published in 1893 ;<br>
          <br>
          "The orders of intensification for accelerating dissociation
          would not be understood by any explanations that could be
          made, if unaccompanied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the demonstrations
          witnessed by the late Professor Leidy, Dr. Brinton, and
          others.<br>
          <br>
          "When the&nbsp; ether&nbsp; flows from a tube, its negative
          centre represents molecular sub-division carrying
          interstitially (or between its&nbsp; molecules) the lowest
          order of liberated ozone.<br>
          <br>
          "This is the first order of ozone and its wonderfully
          refreshing and vitalizing to those who breathe it.<br>
          <br>
          "The second&nbsp; order, or atomic separation, releases
          a&nbsp; much higher grade of ozone; in fact, too pure for
          inhalation, is the one that has been (though&nbsp; attended
          withe much danger to the operator) utilized by Keely in his
          carbon register to produce the circuit of high vibration that
          breaks up the&nbsp; molecular magnetism which is recognized as
          cohesion.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;"The acceleration of these orders is governed by the
          introductory impulse on a certain combination of vibrator
          chords, arranged for this purpose in the instrument, with
          which Keely dissociates the elements of water, and which he
          calls a Liberator.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          "In molecular dissociation one fork of 620 is used, setting
          the chords on the first octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In atomic separation two forks, one of 620 and one of 630 per
          second; setting the chords on the second octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In the etheric three forks one of 620, one of 630, and one of
          12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.<br>
          <br>
          As a matter of further clarification, Keely states that you
          cannot DIRECTLY dissociate a single level of aggregation due
          to the shell structure of matter.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, if you wish to dissociate the Atomic level,
          you must first dissociate the molecular to be able to get to
          theatomic. That follows also if you wish to dissociate the
          etheric, you must disrupt the molecular AND the atomic, THEN
          the etheric.<br>
          <br>
          Keely refers to this technique as progressive dissociation.<br>

          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>THE MYSTIC AT HOME. </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          IN a charming suburban residence about ten miles from
          Liverpool Street station, on a lovely June day, when the
          fashionable London season of '93 was rapidly <br>
          nearing its close, Madame Discalcelis found herself in the
          presence of a modest gentleman about thirty years of age,
          plainly attired in the customa^ house-dress of men who attach
          more value to comfort than to display. Speaking with clear,
          measured accents on the subject which possessed his brain and
          evidently lay nearest to his heart, his fine lustrous eyes
          glowing with suppressed fervor, he uttered the following
          noteworthy statements concerning the ultimate constitution of
          matter and the action of the force regulating its phenomena,
          statements which surely challenge the closest attention of the
          whole scientific world. <br>
          <br>
          " First. Matter is capable of infinite subdivision. <br>
          <br>
          "Second. In the aggregation of matter, force or energy is
          stored up or conserved. <br>
          <br>
          " Third. In the dissociation of matter, force is liberated. <br>
          <br>
          "Fourth. All matter is in a state of perpetual activity,
          whether the substance under consideration be inanimate or
          animated, visible or invisible. <br>
          <br>
          "Fifth. There is no dividing of matter and force into two
          distinct terms, as they both are ONE. FORCE is liberated
          matter. Matter is force in bondage. <br>
          <br>
          "Sixth. All motion is synchronous; no sound or movement can be
          made but all that moves or sounds does so in harmony with
          something. <br>
          <br>
          "Seventh. All structures, whether crystalline or homogeneous,
          have for their unit structures minute bodies called molecules.
          It is the motion of these mole <br>
          cules with which we have particularly to deal; as in
          experimental research and demonstration, when we produce an
          action upon one molecule we do so upon all the molecules
          constituting the mass operated upon. <br>
          <br>
          " Eighth. These molecules have an envelope, rotating with
          inconceivable rapidity, formed of a high tenuous ether, whose
          place in the order of subdivision <br>
          ranks third, the three divisions being, first, molecular;
          second, atomic; third, atomolicr (For convenience' sake we
          will use the term atomolic in place of ethericin our
          subsequent definitions.) <br>
          <br>
          "Ninth. This atomolic substance has a density approximately
          986,000 times that of steel, enabling it to permeate steel as
          light penetrates glass ; this rotating <br>
          envelope of atomolic substance is in a liquid condition. There
          are four conditions of matter; viz. solid, liquid, gaseous,
          and ultra-gaseous. These conditions result from greater or
          lesser range of oscillation of the com posing units
          individually: this is equal!}- true, whether the units are
          molecules, atoms, atomoles, planets, or suns. But one LAW
          governs all matter. <br>
          <br>
          "Tenth. This molecular envelope, rotating with such great
          velocity, holds in its embrace the next subdivision of matter,
          the atomic. There cannot ever <br>
          be more or less than three atoms in any molecule. These are
          placed so as to form a triangle in the interior; they rest in
          a condition of substance, or matter, we will term
          inter-molecular. In this inter-molecular substance we find an
          enormous energy or force in bondage, held thus by the rotating
          envelope enclosing it. Were we to rotate a spun brass shell,
          sa}' nine inches in diameter, at a very much less rate of
          speed than that at which the molecular envelope rotates, say
          nine hundred revolutions per second, its equator would first
          bulge out, then form into an oval disc. A solid block of wood
          subject to such revolution would swiftly fly to pieces. The
          rotating envelope of a molecule, unlike these, the greater its
          velocity of rotation, the greater is its compression toward
          the centre of the molecule. The rotation of this envelope is
          of such a nature as to produce an internal pressure upon every
          portion from every point of the molecule as a sphere. Were we
          to consider a rotating envelope as ordinarily understood, it
          would be one in which the envelope rotated around an equator
          having poles of no rotation; i.e. the poles would not possess
          the compressing force of the equator: the result would
          therefore be a compressed equator, and the intermolecular
          substance would pass out without resistance at the poles. <br>
          <br>
          " Eleventh. If it be possible let us conceive of an envelope
          with an equator, but destitute of poles, a number of these
          rotating over the sphere, this atomolic envelope possessing an
          almost infinite attractive force toward the centre of the
          molecule, pressing in the inter-molecular substance, where it
          is held until this <br>
          revolving envelope becomes negatized by a certain order of
          vibration, when the enclosed matter rushes out to its natural
          condition of concordant tenuity, as in the case of gunpowder,
          dynamite, and nitro-glycerine. This force, we must see, has
          been held in the embrace of the rotating envelopes of the
          unit-structures, or where does it come from? This force at the
          time of an explosion was liberated by shock or fire, both
          being orders of imparted motion or vibration. How much greater
          the result would be were we to associate a scientific
          instrument now completed, and shortly to be given to the
          world, with such an agent as nitro-glycerine ; one pound of
          nitro-glycerine would have its destructive force augmented
          beyond all possible control. These instruments are carefully
          concealed by wise masters from all persons save the few who
          are already prepared to study their potency with the exclusive
          end in view of aiding the real scientific progress of
          humanit}" ; and, furthermore, it may be truly stated that a
          ferocious sensualist, how ever powerful his intellect, would
          be utterly unable to either comprehend or operate one of these
          marvellous constructions. <br>
          <br>
          "Twelfth. Next in order of consideration is the second
          subdivision of matter the atomic. The atom has the same
          rotating envelope as the molecule, governed by the same laws
          of rotation and compression. <br>
          <br>
          The rotating envelope holds in its embrace the inter-atomic
          substance and three atomoles resting in it, the atomoles
          within the atom being constructed after the same pattern as
          the atom and the molecule, obedient to the same laws; the
          atomolic being simply the third subdivision of matter. The
          threefold order is absolutely universal. <br>
          <br>
          "Thirteenth. The atomolic substance is what is termed the
          ether which fills all space and is the transmitting medium for
          all celestial and terrestrial forces. This is the liquid ether
          of occult science. <br>
          <br>
          " Fourteenth. The atomoles are made up of atomolini (singular
          atomolinus); the subdivision of matter from this point is
          beyond man's power, as at this point it escapes all control of
          apparatus, passing through glass and hardened steel as a
          luminous flame without heat, which is hardly seen before it
          vanishes, a perpetual flame coldly luminous. <br>
          <br>
          "Sixteenth. This again, from previous analysis, is made up
          according to the triple order, and may again be subject to
          subdivision, even to infinity." <br>
          <br>
          "In my next interview with you," said Aldebaran to his
          visitor, "I shall endeavor to show you the law governing the
          triple aggregation of force and matter, <br>
          which is, in brief, as follows: first, CREATIVE SOURCE;
          second, TRANSMISSIVE WAVE; third, EFFECT." <br>
          <br>
          The mystical scientist then took a courteous leave of his
          visitor, and after seeing her to her carriage, hurried to the
          suburban station connecting with the under ground railway to
          Aldsgate, where he had important business with a distinguished
          mechanical engineer. <br>
          <br>
          <b>CHAPTER V. </b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>FURTHER REVELATIONS. </b><br>
          <br>
          ON the occasion of the next meeting between the lady and the
          scientist the latter gave utterance to the following
          remarkable truth. <br>
          <br>
          Each molecule has three envelopes. The most external one the
          professor illustrated by an india-rubber ball on which he had
          traced a number of meridian lines. <br>
          On another ball were represented the three envelopes. The
          outer hemisphere of one of the envelopes is removed to show
          the under envelope, the outer hemisphere of which is removed
          in still another part of the diagram to show the inmost
          envelope. A third diagram was then produced to show the
          position of the atoms which the rotating envelopes enclose. A
          fourth diagram showed the lines of interference of the
          rotating envelopes. <br>
          <br>
          There being three perfect envelopes, these of necessity must
          have six poles, to which add the neutral centre of the sphere
          itself, comprising the origin of the septenary of mysticism
          which is universal in nature. The fifth diagram exhibited
          showed the subdivision of matter into atomic, atoinolic, and
          atomolinic. A black disc representing a sphere shows the
          negative atom; two white discs also representing spheres
          illustrate the two positive atoms in the triad, completing the
          tertiary aggregation forming the molecule. Each atom is in
          turn composed of three atomoles ; in the negative atom are
          three positive atomoles, positive in the sense of activity; in
          the positive atom are also three atomoles, two of which are
          negative, i.e. passive, and one positive. The negative is
          always that which seeks the neutral centre ; the positive
          represents the active radiating energy: for instance, the sun
          is a medium for transmitting radiant energy of positive order,
          which all the planets receive negatively, i.e. it focalizes
          upon their neutral centres. This order extends to infinity.
          The final diagram presented was simply intended to further
          elucidate the action of the rotating envelopes, illustrating
          the compressing force of the rotating spheral and the
          protection of the neutral poles. In the rotating envelopes
          force acts in the opposite direction to its action in the
          revolution of the earth, where the centrifugal action is
          greatest at the equator; and the greater the speed of
          rotation, the greater the centre-fleeing force. <br>
          <br>
          In the case of the etheric envelope, however, the greater the
          speed of rotation, the more powerful is the centripetal
          (centre -seeking) force which compresses <br>
          the atoms within ; the pressure, therefore, is greatest at the
          equator and gradually lessens toward the poles. If there were
          only one envelope, the tendency would be for the atoms to be
          oblate, to fly out at the poles, where the pressure is least.
          A beautiful provision of nature obviates this, by providing
          three envelopes, rotating one within <br>
          the other, like three shells ; the line of greatest internal
          pressure in each one of which being protected by the
          equatorial lines, the line of greatest pressure covering the
          line of least pressure on the others. Each of the three atoms
          is placed directly under one pole of each of the three
          envelopes. <br>
          <br>
          If the rotating envelope of the molecule were in any way
          checked in its motion, the enclosed matter would immediately
          burst forth, producing the phenomenon of integration,
          releasing from its previously pent-up condition a volume of
          matter many times as great as that before disintegration took
          place. Sound-force moving at certain rates of vibration
          negatizes the action of the rotating envelopes, producing
          conditions which result in their breaking up, followed by the
          separation of the atoms contained in those envelopes, and also
          of inter-molecular substance occupying space not taken up by
          the atoms. By successive orders of vibration the atoms,
          atomoles, and atomolini are disintegrated, and so on to the
          luminous order, where all control ceases... <br>

          covering the entire domain of organic chemistry can be worked
          according to simple rules and methods deducible from these
          newly discovered laws and by the aid of these, to us, new

          </b><b>1. Law of Matter and Force : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Coextensive and coeternal with space and duration, there <br>
          exists an infinite and unchangeable quantity of atomoles, the

          <b>2. Law of Corporeal Vibrations : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All coherent aggregates when isolated from like bodies, or <br>
          when immersed or confined in media composed of matter in <br>
          a different state, vibrate at a given ascertain able pitch. <br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Law of Corporeal Oscillation : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All coherent aggregates not isolated from like bodies,
          oscillate at a period-frequency varying with the tensions that
          augment and diminish the state of equilibrium. <br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Law of Harmonic Vibrations : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All coherent aggregates are perpetually vibrating at a
          period-frequency corresponding to some harmonic ratio of the
          fundamental pitch of the vibrating body ; this pitch is a
          multiple of the pitch of the atomole. <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Law of Transmissive Vibraic Energy : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All oscillating and vibrating coherent aggregates create, in
          the media in which they are immersed, outwardly propagated
          concentric waves of alternate condensation and rarefaction,
          having a period-frequency identical with the pitch of the

          Scholium: All forms of transmissive energy can be focussed,
          reflected, refracted, diffracted, transformed, and diminished
          in intensity inversely as the square of the distance from the
          originating source. <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Law of Sympathetic Oscillation : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Coherent aggregates immersed in a medium pulsating at their
          natural pitch simultaneously oscillate with the same
          frequency, whether the pitch of the medium be a unison, or any
          harmonic of the fundamental pitch of the creative aggregate. .

          <br>
          <b>7. Law of Attraction : </b><b><br>

          Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in discord are
          mutually repelled. <br>
          <br>
          <b>9. Law of Cycles : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Coherent aggregates harmonically united constitute centres of
          vibration bearing relation to the fundamental pitch not
          multiples of the harmonic pitch, and the production of
          secondary unions between themselves generate pitches that are
          discords, either in their unisons, or overtones with the
          original pitch ; from harmony is generated discord, the
          inevitable cause of perpetual transformation. <br>
          <br>
          <b>10. Law of Harmonic Pitch : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Any aggregate in a state of vibration develops in addition to
          its fundamental pitch a series of vibration in symmetrical
          sub-multiple portions of itself, bearing ratios of one, two,
          three, or more times its fundamental pitch. <br>
          <br>
          <b>11. Law of Force : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Energy manifests itself in three forms : Creative, the
          vibrating aggregate ; Transmissive, being the propagation of
          isochronous waves through the media in which it is immersed;
          Attractive, being its action upon other aggregates capable of
          vibrating in unisons or harmony. <br>
          <br>
          <b>12. Law of Oscillating Atomic Substances : </b><br>
          <br>
          Coherent atomic substances are capable of oscillating at a
          pitch varying directly as the density, and inversely as the
          linear dimensions from one period of frequency per unit of
          time to the 21st octave above, producing the creative force of
          Sonity, whose transmissive force (Sound) is propagated through
          the media of solids, liquids, and gases, and whose static
          effect (Sonism) produces attractions and repulsions between
          sympathetically vibrating bodies according to the Law of
          Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          <b>13. Law of Sono-thermity : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Internal vibrations of atomic substances and atomic molecules
          are capable of vibrating at a period-frequency directly as
          their density, inversely as their linear dimensions, directly
          as the coefficient of their tension from the 21st to the 42d
          octaves, producing the creative force (Sono-thermity), whose
          transmissive force (Sono-therm) is propagated in solid,
          liquid, gaseous, and ultra-gaseous media, statically producing
          adhesions and molecular unions, or disintegration, according
          to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          <b>14. Law of Oscillating Atoms : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All atoms when in a state of tension are capable of
          oscillating at a pitch inversely as the cube of their atomic
          weights, and directly as their tension from 42 to 63 octaves
          per second, producing the creative force (Thermism), whose
          transmissive force (Rad-energy) propagated in solid, liquid,
          and gaseous ether, produces the static effects (Cohesion and
          Chemism) on other atoms of association, or dissociation,
          according to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>

          temperature, and extends through light, chemical rays, actinic
          rays, and infra-violet rays, up to the dissociation of all
          molecules to the 63d octave. <br>
          <br>
          <b>15. Law of Vibrating Atornolic Substances : </b><br>
          <br>
          Atoms are capable of vibrating within themselves at a pitch
          inversely as the Dyne (the local coefficient of Gravity), and
          as the atomic volume, directly as the atomic weight, producing
          the creative force (Electricity), whose transmissive force is
          propagated through atomolic solids, liquids, and gases,
          producing induction and the static effect of magnetism upon
          other atoms of attraction or repulsion, according to the Law
          of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : The phenomena of Dynamic Electricity through a
          metallic conductor and of induction are identical. In a
          metallic conductor, the transmission is from atom to atom,
          through homologous interstices, filled with ether, presenting
          small areas in close proximity. In crystalline structures,
          heat, which expands the atoms, by twisting them produces
          striae, increases the resistance, etc. Between parallel wires
          and through air the induction takes place from large areas
          through a rarefied medium composed of a mixture of substances,
          whose atoms are separated by waves of repulsion of various
          pitches, discordant to electric vibrations ; the said atoms
          sympathetically absorb the vibrations and dissipate from
          themselves, as centres, concentric waves of electric energy
          which produces heat and gravism. <br>
          <br>
          <b>16. Law of Oscillating Atomoles : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Atomoles oscillating at a uniform pitch (determined by their
          uniform size and weight) produce the creative force Atomolin/,
          whose transmissive form, Gravism, is propagated through more
          rarefied media, producing the static effect upon all other
          atomoles, denominated Gravity. <br>
          <br>
          <b>17. Law of Transformation of Forces : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          All forces are different forms of Universal Energy unlike in
          their period-frequency, merging into each other by
          imperceptible increments ; each form representing the compass
          of 21 octaves. Each form or pitch may be transformed into an
          equivalent quantity of another pitch above or below it in the
          scale of 105 octaves. The transformation can occur only ,
          through its static effect, developing vibrations of harmonic
          pitches above and below their fundamental vibration, or
          developing with juxtaposed aggregates, resultant and
          difference, or third order, as the case may be. <br>

          normal harmonic scale will indicate the ratios in which the
          transformation of forces will occur. <br>
          <br>
          <b>18. Law of Atomic Pitch : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Atoms have each a different and definite pitch, at which they
          naturally vibrate. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : Atomic pitch is determined directly from its simple
          spectrum. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : Atomic pitch is determined by computations from its
          associate spectrum with all other atoms, as in known spectra.
          <br>
          <br>
          Scholium: Atomic pitches are more important working data than
          atomic weights ; tables of atomic pitches must be precise. <br>
          <br>
          <b>19. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Rad-energy : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The higher harmonics and overtones of projected rad-energy are
          of a pitch sufficiently high to cause the atom to expand; by
          causing the atomoles to vibrate systematically the same
          influence will cause the atom to contract, and thus by
          changing the volume, atomic pitch is varied. <br>
          <br>
          <b>20. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Electricity and
            Magnetism : </b><br>
          <br>
          Electricity and Magnetism produce internal vibrations in the
          atom, which are followed by proportional changes in volume
          and, therefore, pitch. <br>
          <br>
          <b>21. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Temperature : </b><br>
          <br>
          Atoms in chemical combination oscillate with increasing
          amplitude directly as the temperature, and simultaneously
          absorb overtones of higher harmonics, producing expansion of
          volume and diminution of pitch. <br>
          <br>
          Rule : The gradual approach of the temperature of harmonic
          combination can be observed by mutually comparing superimposed
          spectra; chemical combination commences when the fundamental
          lines of each spectrum bear harmonic ratios by linear
          measurement. <br>
          <br>
          <b>22. Law of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation : </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Atoms not isolated and in a state of tension between forces
          that oppose and increase the equilibrium oscillate bodily at a
          pitch that is a resultant of the atomic weight, atomic volume,
          and tension. <br>
          <br>
          <b>23. Law of Variation of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation by
            Pressure : </b><br>
          <br>
          The frequency of atomic oscillation increases and diminishes
          inversely as the square of the pressure. <br>
          <br>
          <b>24. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Temperature :
          </b><br>
          <br>

          <b>Mathematical Demonstration of the Size of an Atom. </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Its Weight and Volume. </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A rectangular, or preferably, a circular, disc is suspended
          from the ceiling of a room in such a manner that vibrations
          cannot be communicated to it from the vibrating walls of the
          room. It is then experimentally determined to what fundamental
          note the metal plate sympathetically vibrates. Then, according
          to the law of linear dimensions, which is equally applicable
          to solids, liquids, or gases, it is mathematically determined
          what size of plate will produce successive octaves above that
          pitch, until a size of plate is obtained capable of producing
          a period-frequency corresponding to that of dark radiant heat,
          which we know is produced by the oscillations of atoms, and is
          termed therma. The vibrating atomic substance of the plate is
          capable of producing the trarismissive force called sound and
          sonothermism, which is propagated through atomic media by wave
          -motion, but which cannot be propagated through space devoid
          of atomic substance. But when the plate has been reduced
          theoretically to a size sufficiently in finitesimal to
          correspond to the maximum or minimum size of an atom, as
          determined by the atomic researches of Professors Tait &amp;
          Clerk Maxwell, we reach vibration frequency so high that it
          can be propagated through a vacuum devoid of atomic substance,
          as a transmissive force called rad-energy, beginning with dark
          radiant heat. And be it carefully observed that
          period-frequency corresponds with that of dark rad-energy. The
          law of linear dimensions may be thus stated: The
          vibration-periods of two similarly circumstanced homologous
          bodies are to each other as their cubical contents, and
          therefore the vibration-frequencies of homologous metal plates
          are to each other as the inverse ratio of their linear
          dimensions. The octave of a given plate will be a homologous
          plate having ^ of its volume. A circular disc twenty inches in
          diameter and one inch thick vibrates, e.g,, 1024 times per
          second. The ten octaves from unity successively reducing the
          size of the disc by |, we get at each reduction the octave of
          the previous pitch, and at any given octave we have the
          volume, weight, and vibration-frequency of the vibrating
          atomic substance. <br>
          <br>
          Ten octave, 1024 vibrations per second; metal disc, twenty
          inches in diameter, one inch thick. To get the cubical
          contents of this vibrating aggregate it is necessary to square
          the diameter; we multiply by 0.7854, which is equal to 314.16
          inches in volume. Starting from this point, we progress
          through successive octaves upward, increasing in pitch and
          diminishing in size. <br>
          <br>
          <b>THE SCALE OF FORCES.</b> <br>
          <br>
          First octave (unity per second) is approximately the lowest
          frequency capable of producing waves of rarefaction and
          condensation in the air. The atomic aggregate <br>
          oscillating at this pitch can be experimentally determined,
          and the aggregate vibrating at a pitch one octave higher will
          have a mass lying between ^ and the cube root of the mass of
          the first-mentioned aggregate ; the exact relation under
          varying conditions of gravity, magnetic saturation, and
          pressure, can be determined only by accurate measurements. But
          assuming a body of a size represented by x, with a pitch
          represented by 1024 per second, then a pitch of 2048 per
          second will be produced by a body having a volume of some mean
          between of x and the cube root of x. By accurately determining
          the pitch of a volume of any metallic sphere capable of
          oscillating at the pitch of, e.g., the eleventh octave of
          sonity (1024 per second), under normal conditions of gravity,
          pressure, magnetism, and then successively diminishing its
          size by ^ of itself, we get the successive octaves of pitches
          higher and higher in period-frequency until we pass the domain
          of sonity and enter the domain of sono-thermity . The point
          where the one form of energy merges into the other lies
          approximately at the twenty-first octave, and this pitch also
          marks the point where the air is no longer capable of
          vibrating at that pitch in waves of transverse form. This
          first gamut of 21| octaves consists of three forms ; viz.
          sonity, sound, and sonism. The following is a tabulation of
          the pitches of sonity in octaves from one vibration per second
          to where the next form of energy commences. <br>
          <br>
          <b>FRAUNHOFER LINES. </b><br>
          <br>
          The Fraunhofer lines represent the silences, or the places of
          invisible pitches between the luminous pitches of rad-energy.
          They cannot therefore be conveniently used as data from which
          to measure the fundamental pitches of the atoms undergoing
          examination. When a series of sound-pencils are projected upon
          a screen, they undergoa combination of overtones and under
          tones at the point of contact producing tones of a pitch
          either too low to be recognized by the human ear or too high
          to be called sound. The Fraunhofer lines are not therefore
          simply silences, but may be the higher invisible ultra-actinic
          rays. The fact is that some of the Fraunhofer lines are
          capable of producing a variety of chemical actions, when
          reflected and focalized. Observation thus far shows that these
          lines do not bear any definite ascertainable relation to the
          pitches producing them, but that they do bear some uniform
          relation from which the fundamental pitch could be determined
          cannot be doubted. The relation of the Fraunhofer lines to the
          luminous spectra are undoubtedly such as would enable one to
          compute the creative pitches producing them ; but as yet no
          such determinations have been made. The accurate method of
          determining them is from the mutual relation of the harmonic
          pitches of the luminous spectra. <br>
          <br>
          A table representing the harmonic overtones and undertones of
          simple vibrations, and the resultant harmonics of associate
          vibrations, will be of great convenience in making these
          determinations. <br>
          <br>
          The natural unity of sonity lies above 1 per second, and below
          2 per second, and for this reason the number ing of the
          octaves is accomplished by calling the end of the first octave
          No. 1 instead of No. 2. At the end of the twenty-first octave
          sono-thermity commences, and the bodies oscillating at this
          pitch are either correspondingly smaller by ^ than the
          preceding sonitic aggregates; or larger aggregates undergo
          vibration in submultiple portions of themselves. In either
          case the originating oscillation of a sono-thermic pitch is
          that of an isolated or localized aggregation. This first class
          of forces, or first double gamut, is included within the range
          of about forty-three octaves. The bodies of the first gamut
          oscillate with a rhythmically recurring translatory pendulous
          motion and produce waves of a transverse form, while the
          bodies of the second gamut undergo internal nodal vibration
          and produce waves of a longitudinal form. Beyond the upper
          limit of the forty-third octave we reach bodies of a size
          (determined bythe same method as in sonity) which we know to
          be about the size of an atom as approximately determinedby
          various physicists to lie between eleven and twelve
          micromillimeters (hydrogen molecules), which gives the highest
          pitch of the known atoms, and from which can be roughly
          jestimated the pitch of the heavier atoms. Starting with the
          approximate pitch of hydrogen as determined from its associate
          spectrum with oxygen, and working back to the size of the
          largest atoms, we again reach a pitch corresponding to the
          highest sono-thermic vibrations. Starting with the known
          temperature and pitch of a heated body, emitting definite rays
          of light, and working back to absolute zero, We again reach
          the pitch of the sono-thermic limit. <br>

          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>AMPLITUDE OF FORCE. </b><br>
          <br>
          The amplitude of vibrations is directly increased or&nbsp;
          diminished by increasing or diminishing the size or number of
          creative aggregates... <br>
          <br>
          Thus the human race is immersed in forces whose intensity is
          vast in proportion to the number of EGOS adding each its quota
          to the already intense vibration, tending either to love or
          hate, kindness or cruelty, timidity or bravery. Those who
          intensify the force of cruelty in the place where they reside,
          maybe strengthening a murderer's hand to strike the deadly
          blow in a distant land. This result is brought about through
          the agency of etheric waves, which transmit forces with
          undiminished intensity even to uncalculated distances. This
          phenomenon may be termed transympathetic. <br>
          <br>
          They who feel that force called love, which on higher planes
          is known as sympathy, thrill with waves of force which are
          already strong, augmenting them or increasing their intensity.
          They who indulge such sentiments and encourage such forces may
          stop the falling hand on evil sped... <br>
          <br>
          Every man contains, developed or embryonic, all conditions of
          the Infinite ; therefore no height is too great to reach.
          Impossibility is a meaningless word to the man who apprehends
          the fathomless contents of his own nature. Thou comest here, O
          man, with the instrument thou hast graduated in thy many past
          existences ; how few of thy chord-settings, if thou art
          numbered with the many, respond to the higher harmonies !
          Universal unity or fraternity has been absorbed to almost
          embryonic conditions by the prevalence of material
          self-regard. Charity has been rendered almost latent, that
          beautiful chord-setting found even in the lowest forms of
          creation LOVE, the dominant chord of the cycles. Love has an
          amplitude of action in the brute which may well make the
          selfish man ashamed, but until the crust of selfishness is
          broken through, the beauty of love is obscured, and though it
          exists all about him, the poor blind egotist has no eye to
          discern it. The centres of love, brotherhood, charity, voice
          their music loud and clear, yet the masses will not listen. I
          do not mean the immortal EGO when I say man will not listen ;
          I refer to the personality which is the resultant of all the
          ages of action in this, now rapidly closing, cycle... <br>

          </b><b>THE PROFESSOR IN HIS STUDY. </b><br>
          <br>
          ... [H]e was so very busy, working upon an air-ship of which
          he had procured a perfect working model from Aldebaran, that
          he had become almost as complete a recluse of science as that
          exceedingly retiring worker, who scarcely ever allowed himself
          an evening, much less a day, in which to pay tribute to the
          social amenities, without which life would be such a complete
          blank to the devotees of fashion, and not to them only, but to
          many kindly natures whose gregarious instincts are strong, and
          who have little interest in life outside their fellowship with
          others...<br>
          <br>
          Two or three clergymen who were present, and notably Mrs.
          Northafriker, an earnest missionary to foreign lands,
          expressed an intense desire to witness the progress <br>
          already made by Professor Monteith; but as the work was not
          sufficiently completed to admit of close inspection, without
          disturbing the professor too greatly in the midst of his
          laborious, but beloved, undertaking, he declared himself
          obliged to content himself, and trusted they would be
          contented, with seeing the model which as the pattern he was
          faithfully determining to copy on a much larger scale. Though
          his own work was as yet immature, he assured them that others
          had made great progress, though he was only in the infancy of
          his herculean task. <br>
          <br>
          The model is accurately described, as far as it can be at
          present, in a previous chapter of this book. See page 280. <br>
          <br>
          "The propeller of this wonderful aerial navigator," said the
          professor, "is now actually in existence in Philadelphia ; for
          I have seen it there and I have, therefore, the authority of
          an eye-witness for this statement, as well as the word of many
          distinguished scientific investigators, whose judgment and
          veracity are entirely beyond dispute. It is a stupendous fact,
          of colossal magnitude, that the above navigator has associated
          with it all the conditions requisite for interstellar
          communication, it being positively proven that this wonderful
          vessel can navigate the air under all varying atmospheric
          conditions, from the calmest to the most perturbed, and is
          capable of travelling with amazing velocity, as well as at the
          lowest possible rate of motion, and that with perfect safety
          to the vessel and its inmates, making due allowance for
          atmospheric friction." ...<br>
          <br>
          <b>CHAPTER XXV. </b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>WHAT OF AERIAL NAVIGATION? </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          AMONG the problems which most intensely interested Professor
          Monteith, after his return to London, that of aerial
          navigation occupied first rank. It was at the retreat of
          Aldebaran, one cold January afternoon, that he received the
          following remarkable instruction from the lips of the mystic
          scientist, who was then in the act of constructing an aerial
          navigator which he declared would, in the course of from three
          to five years, be quite ready for presentation to the world.
          The method of constructing this wonderful machine was
          explained in the following demonstration, which took place
          under the eyes of the professor. <br>
          <br>
          A small instrument, having three gyroscopes as a principal
          part of its construction, was the object exhibited to the
          professor as the instrument for demonstrating the facts of
          aerial navigation. These gyroscopes were attached to a heavy,
          inert mass of metal, weighing about one ton. The other part of
          the apparatus consisted of tubes, enclosed in as small a space
          as possible, being clustered in a circle. These tubes, the
          mystic went on to explain, represented certain chords, which
          were coincident to the streams of force acting upon the
          planet, focalizing and defocalizing upon its neutral centre.
          The action upon the molecular structure of the mass lifted was
          based upon the fact that each molecule in the mass possessed a
          north and south pole, more strictly speaking, a positive and
          negative pole, situated through the centre, formed by the
          three atoms which compose it. No matter which way the mass of
          metal is turned, the poles of the molecule point undeviatingly
          to the polar centre of the earth, acting almost exactly as the
          dip-needle when uninfluenced by extraneous conditions,
          electrical and otherwise. The rotation of the discs of the
          gyroscopes produces an action upon the molecules of the mass
          to be lifted, reversing their poles, causing repulsion from
          the earth in the same way as like poles of a magnet repel each
          other. <br>
          <br>
          This repulsion can be diminished and increased according as
          the mechanical conditions are operated. By operating the three
          discs, starting them at full speed, then touching two of them,
          so as to bring them, according to the tone they represented by
          their rotation, to a certain vibratory ratio, the weight then
          slowly swaying from side to side left the floor, rose several
          feet in the air, remaining in that position, and as the discs
          gradually decreased their speed of rotation the weight sank to
          the floor, settling down as lightly as a thistle-down. Where
          one molecule can be lifted, there need be no limit as to the
          number in a structure that may be operated upon as easily as
          one. The vessel in contemplation, the aerial navigator, will
          be over two hundred feet long, over sixty feet in diameter,
          tapering at both ends to a point, made of polished steel, and
          will be capable of being driven under the power of depolar
          repulsion, at the rate of three hundred miles an hour. It can
          be far more easily controlled than any instrument now in use
          for any phase of transit. Another very remarkable feature
          connected with this strange revelation of aerial navigation,
          is that the vessel is not buoyed up or floated in the air
          through the medium of the air, so that if there were no
          atmosphere it would float just as readily; hence, under
          mechanical conditions most certainly capable of production,
          involving massive strength of resistance to interstellar
          vacuity this can be made capable of navigating even the remote
          depth of space, positions between planets where polarity
          changes being controlled by other adjuncts of concentration
          for that purpose. <br>
          <br>
          Safely enclosed within this structure, a man possessing the
          chemical knowledge these new laws give, with sufficient supply
          of material from which to make oxy <br>
          gen, by the enormously increased rate of speed attained by
          such navigator where atmospheric friction is avoided, the time
          occupied in travelling from one planet to an other would be
          amazingly brief, and one can travel to other planets in this
          system of worlds as easily as the same ship could navigate the
          depths of the ocean. <br>
          <br>
          The great obstacle hitherto preventing the solution of this
          problem has been the strength of structure needed under
          conditions above presented. With this knowledge of matter, the
          size of structure is unimportant ; the heaviest can be as
          easily controlled as the lightest. <br>
          <br>
          The results following the advent of such wonders as are here
          represented must closely approximate the long-foretold
          millennium, or more properly golden age : the disarming of
          nations, the ennoblement of man, the universality of the
          realization of brotherhood, and the true elevation of
          womankind; since man, possessing all that may be obtained,
          need no longer fear the development of woman to perfect
          equality with himself. In that time it shall be the search for
          the divine ideal which must engage the faculties of all to
          their utmost extent.<br>

          This paper is quite astounding in that it correlates with
          Keelys' claim that water can be progressively dissociated at
          620, 630 and 12,000 cycles per second.&nbsp; These&nbsp; are
          on the molecular, atomic and etheric levels respectively.<br>
          <br>
          It is interesting&nbsp; that the etheric level of 12,000&nbsp;
          /&nbsp; 20&nbsp; =&nbsp; 600 (Puharich's frequency) found by
          original experimentation. This 600 cps frequency&nbsp; is
          therefore&nbsp; a&nbsp; harmonic&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp;
          12,000&nbsp; cps frequency which Puharich discovered.<br>
          <br>
          Keely also claims&nbsp; that the disruption of water occurs at
          42,800 cycles per second.<br>
          <br>
          The direct quote from the book "Keely and His Discoveries" by
          Bloomfield Moore, published in 1893 ;<br>
          <br>
          "The orders of intensification for accelerating dissociation
          would not be understood by any explanations that could be
          made, if unaccompanied&nbsp; by&nbsp; the demonstrations
          witnessed by the late Professor Leidy, Dr. Brinton, and
          others.<br>
          <br>
          "When the&nbsp; ether&nbsp; flows from a tube, its negative
          centre represents molecular sub-division carrying
          interstitially (or between its&nbsp; molecules) the lowest
          order of liberated ozone.<br>
          <br>
          "This is the first order of ozone and its wonderfully
          refreshing and vitalizing to those who breathe it.<br>
          <br>
          "The second&nbsp; order, or atomic separation, releases
          a&nbsp; much higher grade of ozone; in fact, too pure for
          inhalation, is the one that has been (though&nbsp; attended
          withe much danger to the operator) utilized by Keely in his
          carbon register to produce the circuit of high vibration that
          breaks up the&nbsp; molecular magnetism which is recognized as
          cohesion.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;"The acceleration of these orders is governed by the
          introductory impulse on a certain combination of vibrator
          chords, arranged for this purpose in the instrument, with
          which Keely dissociates the elements of water, and which he
          calls a Liberator.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          "In molecular dissociation one fork of 620 is used, setting
          the chords on the first octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In atomic separation two forks, one of 620 and one of 630 per
          second; setting the chords on the second octave.<br>
          <br>
          "In the etheric three forks one of 620, one of 630, and one of
          12,000, setting the chords on the third octave.<br>
          <br>
          As a matter of further clarification, Keely states that you
          cannot DIRECTLY dissociate a single level of aggregation due
          to the shell structure of matter.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, if you wish to dissociate the Atomic level,
          you must first dissociate the molecular to be able to get to
          theatomic. That follows also if you wish to dissociate the
          etheric, you must disrupt the molecular AND the atomic, THEN
          the etheric.<br>
          <br>
          Keely refers to this technique as progressive dissociation.<br>

            </b><b>THE MYSTIC AT HOME. </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          IN a charming suburban residence about ten miles from
          Liverpool Street station, on a lovely June day, when the
          fashionable London season of '93 was rapidly nearing its
          close, Madame Discalcelis found herself in the presence of a
          modest gentleman about thirty years of age, plainly attired in
          the customary house-dress of men who attach more value to
          comfort than to display. Speaking with clear, measured accents
          on the subject which possessed his brain and evidently lay
          nearest to his heart, his fine lustrous eyes glowing with
          suppressed fervor, he uttered the following noteworthy
          statements concerning the ultimate constitution of matter and
          the action of the force regulating its phenomena, statements
          which surely challenge the closest attention of the whole
          scientific world. <br>
          <br>
          " First. Matter is capable of infinite subdivision. <br>
          <br>
          "Second. In the aggregation of matter, force or energy is
          stored up or conserved. <br>
          <br>
          " Third. In the dissociation of matter, force is liberated. <br>
          <br>
          "Fourth. All matter is in a state of perpetual activity,
          whether the substance under consideration be inanimate or
          animated, visible or invisible. <br>
          <br>
          "Fifth. There is no dividing of matter and force into two
          distinct terms, as they both are ONE. FORCE is liberated
          matter. Matter is force in bondage. <br>
          <br>
          "Sixth. All motion is synchronous; no sound or movement can be
          made but all that moves or sounds does so in harmony with
          something. <br>
          <br>
          "Seventh. All structures, whether crystalline or homogeneous,
          have for their unit structures minute bodies called molecules.
          It is the motion of these molecules with which we have
          particularly to deal; as in experimental research and
          demonstration, when we produce an action upon one molecule we
          do so upon all the molecules constituting the mass operated
          upon. <br>
          <br>
          " Eighth. These molecules have an envelope, rotating with
          inconceivable rapidity, formed of a high tenuous ether, whose
          place in the order of subdivision ranks third, the three
          divisions being, first, molecular; second, atomic; third,
          atomolic (For convenience' sake we will use the term atomolic
          in place of etheric in our subsequent definitions.) <br>
          <br>
          "Ninth. This atomolic substance has a density approximately
          986,000 times that of steel, enabling it to permeate steel as
          light penetrates glass ; this rotating envelope of atomolic
          substance is in a liquid condition. There are four conditions
          of matter; viz. solid, liquid, gaseous, and ultra-gaseous.
          These conditions result from greater or lesser range of
          oscillation of the com posing units individually: this is
          equally true, whether the units are molecules, atoms,
          atomoles, planets, or suns. But one LAW governs all matter. <br>
          <br>
          "Tenth. This molecular envelope, rotating with such great
          velocity, holds in its embrace the next subdivision of matter,
          the atomic. There cannot ever be more or less than three atoms
          in any molecule. These are placed so as to form a triangle in
          the interior; they rest in a condition of substance, or
          matter, we will term inter-molecular. In this inter-molecular
          substance we find an enormous energy or force in bondage, held
          thus by the rotating envelope enclosing it. Were we to rotate
          a spun brass shell, sa}' nine inches in diameter, at a very
          much less rate of speed than that at which the molecular
          envelope rotates, say nine hundred revolutions per second, its
          equator would first bulge out, then form into an oval disc. A
          solid block of wood subject to such revolution would swiftly
          fly to pieces. The rotating envelope of a molecule, unlike
          these, the greater its velocity of rotation, the greater is
          its compression toward the centre of the molecule. The
          rotation of this envelope is of such a nature as to produce an
          internal pressure upon every portion from every point of the
          molecule as a sphere. Were we to consider a rotating envelope
          as ordinarily understood, it would be one in which the
          envelope rotated around an equator having poles of no
          rotation; i.e. the poles would not possess the compressing
          force of the equator: the result would therefore be a
          compressed equator, and the intermolecular substance would
          pass out without resistance at the poles. <br>
          <br>
          " Eleventh. If it be possible let us conceive of an envelope
          with an equator, but destitute of poles, a number of these
          rotating over the sphere, this atomolic envelope possessing an
          almost infinite attractive force toward the centre of the
          molecule, pressing in the inter-molecular substance, where it
          is held until this revolving envelope becomes negatized by a
          certain order of vibration, when the enclosed matter rushes
          out to its natural condition of concordant tenuity, as in the
          case of gunpowder, dynamite, and nitro-glycerine. This force,
          we must see, has been held in the embrace of the rotating
          envelopes of the unit-structures, or where does it come from?
          This force at the time of an explosion was liberated by shock
          or fire, both being orders of imparted motion or vibration.
          How much greater the result would be were we to associate a
          scientific instrument now completed, and shortly to be given
          to the world, with such an agent as nitro-glycerine ; one
          pound of nitro-glycerine would have its destructive force
          augmented beyond all possible control. These instruments are
          carefully concealed by wise masters from all persons save the
          few who are already prepared to study their potency with the
          exclusive end in view of aiding the real scientific progress
          of humanity ; and, furthermore, it may be truly stated that a
          ferocious sensualist, how ever powerful his intellect, would
          be utterly unable to either comprehend or operate one of these
          marvellous constructions. <br>
          <br>
          "Twelfth. Next in order of consideration is the second
          subdivision of matter the atomic. The atom has the same
          rotating envelope as the molecule, governed by the same laws
          of rotation and compression. <br>
          <br>
          The rotating envelope holds in its embrace the inter-atomic
          substance and three atomoles resting in it, the atomoles
          within the atom being constructed after the same pattern as
          the atom and the molecule, obedient to the same laws; the
          atomolic being simply the third subdivision of matter. The
          threefold order is absolutely universal. <br>
          <br>
          "Thirteenth. The atomolic substance is what is termed the
          ether which fills all space and is the transmitting medium for
          all celestial and terrestrial forces. This is the liquid ether
          of occult science. <br>
          <br>
          " Fourteenth. The atomoles are made up of atomolini (singular
          atomolinus); the subdivision of matter from this point is
          beyond man's power, as at this point it escapes all control of
          apparatus, passing through glass and hardened steel as a
          luminous flame without heat, which is hardly seen before it
          vanishes, a perpetual flame coldly luminous. <br>
          <br>
          "Sixteenth. This again, from previous analysis, is made up
          according to the triple order, and may again be subject to
          subdivision, even to infinity." <br>
          <br>
          "In my next interview with you," said Aldebaran to his
          visitor, "I shall endeavor to show you the law governing the
          triple aggregation of force and matter, which is, in brief, as
          follows: first, CREATIVE SOURCE; second, TRANSMISSIVE WAVE;
          third, EFFECT." <br>
          <br>
          The mystical scientist then took a courteous leave of his
          visitor, and after seeing her to her carriage, hurried to the
          suburban station connecting with the under ground railway to
          Aldsgate, where he had important business with a distinguished
          mechanical engineer. <br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><b>CHAPTER V. </b><b><br>
            </b><b>FURTHER REVELATIONS. </b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          ON the occasion of the next meeting between the lady and the
          scientist the latter gave utterance to the following
          remarkable truth. <br>
          <br>
          Each molecule has three envelopes. The most external one the
          professor illustrated by an india-rubber ball on which he had
          traced a number of meridian lines. On another ball were
          represented the three envelopes. The outer hemisphere of one
          of the envelopes is removed to show the under envelope, the
          outer hemisphere of which is removed in still another part of
          the diagram to show the inmost envelope. A third diagram was
          then produced to show the position of the atoms which the
          rotating envelopes enclose. A fourth diagram showed the lines
          of interference of the rotating envelopes. <br>
          <br>
          There being three perfect envelopes, these of necessity must
          have six poles, to which add the neutral centre of the sphere
          itself, comprising the origin of the septenary of mysticism
          which is universal in nature. The fifth diagram exhibited
          showed the subdivision of matter into atomic, atoinolic, and
          atomolinic. A black disc representing a sphere shows the
          negative atom; two white discs also representing spheres
          illustrate the two positive atoms in the triad, completing the
          tertiary aggregation forming the molecule. Each atom is in
          turn composed of three atomoles ; in the negative atom are
          three positive atomoles, positive in the sense of activity; in
          the positive atom are also three atomoles, two of which are
          negative, i.e. passive, and one positive. The negative is
          always that which seeks the neutral centre ; the positive
          represents the active radiat ing energy: for instance, the sun
          is a medium for transmitting radiant energy of positive order,
          which all the planets receive negatively, i.e. it focalizes
          upon their neutral centres. This order extends to infinity.
          The final diagram presented was simply intended to further
          elucidate the action of the rotating envelopes, illustrating
          the compressing force of the rotating spheral and the
          protection of the neutral poles. In the rotating envelopes
          force acts in the opposite direction to its action in the
          revolution of the earth, where the centrifugal action is
          greatest at the equator; and the greater the speed of
          rotation, the greater the centre-fleeing force. <br>
          <br>
          In the case of the etheric envelope, however, the greater the
          speed of rotation, the more powerful is the centripetal
          (centre -seeking) force which compresses the atoms within ;
          the pressure, therefore, is greatest at the equator and
          gradually lessens toward the poles. If there were only one
          envelope, the tendency would be for the atoms to be oblate, to
          fly out at the poles, where the pressure is least. A beautiful
          provision of nature obviates this, by providing three
          envelopes, rotating one within the other, like three shells ;
          the line of greatest internal pressure in each one of which
          being protected by the equatorial lines, the line of greatest
          pressure covering the line of least pressure on the others.
          Each of the three atoms is placed directly under one pole of
          each of the three envelopes. <br>
          <br>
          If the rotating envelope of the molecule were in any way
          checked in its motion, the enclosed matter would immediately
          burst forth, producing the phenomenon of integration,
          releasing from its previously pent-up condition a volume of
          matter many times as great as that before disintegration took
          place. Sound-force moving at certain rates of vibration
          negatizes the action of the rotating envelopes, producing
          conditions which result in their breaking up, followed by the
          separation of the atoms contained in those envelopes, and also
          of inter-molecular substance occupying space not taken up by
          the atoms. By successive orders of vibration the atoms,
          atomoles, and atomolini are disintegrated, and so on to the
          luminous order, where all control ceases...<br>

          words of Aldebaran as he conversed with Madame Discalcelis on
          the marvellous work in which she found him ever tirelessly

          "The newly discovered forces, and laws governing all forces,

          investigations no longer consist in a blind groping after
          facts; an untried chemical combination can now be planned and
          its results predicted. Synthetical operations covering the
          entire domain of organic chemistry can be worked according to
          simple rules and methods deducible from these newly discovered

          pitches are harmonics of the lowest pitch, or are a unison
          with the resultant notes or overtones, or undertones, of any
          two or more of them. <br>

          ELECTRICITY is the oscillation of the atomoles of an atom. <br>
          <br>

          in ether. <br>
          <br>
          MAGNETISM is the mutual attraction of juxtaposed bodies
          vibrating at unison or harmonic electric pitches. <br>
          <br>
          GRAVITY is the mutual attraction of atomoles. <br>
          <br>
          GRAVISM is the transmissive form through a medium of atomoles
          in the fourth state, or a medium composed of atomolini. <br>
          <br>
          ATOMOLINI are ultimate units of atomoles, and when in a liquid
          state are the media for the transmission of gravism. The
          illimitable divisibility and aggregation of matter is a
          logical sequence. <br>
          <br>
          1. Law of Matter and Force : <br>
          <br>
          Coextensive and coeternal with space and duration, there
          exists an infinite and unchangeable quantity of atomoles, the
          base of all matter ; these are in a state of constant
          vibratory motion, infinite in extent, unchangeable in
          quantity, the initial of all forms of energy. <br>
          <br>
          2. Law of Corporeal Vibrations : <br>
          <br>
          All coherent aggregates when isolated from like bodies, or
          when immersed or confined in media composed of matter in a
          different state, vibrate at a given ascertain able pitch. <br>
          <br>
          3. Law of Corporeal Oscillation : <br>
          <br>
          All coherent aggregates not isolated from like bodies,
          oscillate at a period-frequency varying with the tensions that
          augment and diminish the state of equilibrium. <br>
          <br>
          4. Law of Harmonic Vibrations : <br>
          <br>
          All coherent aggregates are perpetually vibrating at a
          period-frequency corresponding to some harmonic ratio of the
          fundamental pitch of the vibrating body ; this pitch is a
          multiple of the pitch of the atomole. <br>
          <br>
          5. Law of Transmissive Vibraic Energy : <br>
          <br>
          All oscillating and vibrating coherent aggregates create, in
          the media in which they are immersed, outwardly propagated
          concentric waves of alternate condensation and rarefaction,
          having a period-frequency identical with the pitch of the
          aggregate. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium: All forms of transmissive energy can be focused,
          reflected, refracted, diffracted, transformed, and diminished
          in intensity inversely as the square of the distance from the
          originating source. <br>
          <br>
          6. Law of Sympathetic Oscillation : <br>
          <br>
          Coherent aggregates immersed in a medium pulsating at their
          natural pitch simultaneously oscillate with the same
          frequency, whether the pitch of the medium be a unison, or any
          harmonic of the fundamental pitch of the creative aggregate.<br>
          <br>
          7. Law of Attraction : <br>
          <br>
          Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in unison, or
          harmonic ratio, are mutually attracted. <br>
          <br>
          8. Law of Repulsion : <br>
          <br>
          Juxtaposed coherent aggregates vibrating in discord are
          mutually repelled. <br>
          <br>
          9. Law of Cycles : <br>
          <br>
          Coherent aggregates harmonically united constitute centres of
          vibration bearing relation to the fundamental pitch not
          multiples of the harmonic pitch, and the production of
          secondary unions between themselves generate pitches that are
          discords, either in their unisons, or overtones with the
          original pitch ; from harmony is generated discord, the
          inevitable cause of perpetual transformation. <br>
          <br>
          10. Law of Harmonic Pitch : <br>
          <br>
          Any aggregate in a state of vibration develops in addition to
          its fundamental pitch a series of vibration in symmetrical
          sub-multiple portions of itself, bearing ratios of one, two,
          three, or more times its fundamental pitch. <br>
          <br>
          11. Law of Force : <br>
          <br>
          Energy manifests itself in three forms : Creative, the
          vibrating aggregate ; Transmissive, being the propagation of
          isochronous waves through the media in which it is immersed;
          Attractive, being its action upon other aggregates capable of
          vibrating in unisons or harmony. <br>
          <br>
          12. Law of Oscillating Atomic Substances : <br>
          <br>
          Coherent atomic substances are capable of oscillating at a
          pitch varying directly as the density, and inversely as the
          linear dimensions from one period of frequency per unit of
          time to the 21st octave above, producing the creative force of
          Sonity, whose transmissive force (Sound) is propagated through
          the media of solids, liquids, and gases, and whose static
          effect (Sonism) produces attractions and repulsions between
          sympathetically vibrating bodies according to the Law of
          Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          13. Law of Sono-thermity : <br>
          <br>
          Internal vibrations of atomic substances and atomic molecules
          are capable of vibrating at a period-frequency directly as
          their density, inversely as their linear dimensions, directly
          as the coefficient of their tension from the 21st to the 42d
          octaves, producing the creative force (Sono-thermity), whose
          transmissive force (Sono-therm) is propagated in solid,
          liquid, gaseous, and ultra-gaseous media, statically producing
          adhesions and molecular unions, or disintegration, according
          to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          14. Law of Oscillating Atoms : <br>
          <br>
          All atoms when in a state of tension are capable of
          oscillating at a pitch inversely as the cube of their atomic
          weights, and directly as their tension from 42 to 63 octaves
          per second, producing the creative force (Thermism), whose
          transmissive force (Rad-energy) propagated in solid, liquid,
          and gaseous ether, produces the static effects (Cohesion and
          Chemism) on other atoms of association, or dissociation,
          according to the Law of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : Dark radiant heat begins at absolute zero
          temperature, and extends through light, chemical rays, actinic
          rays, and infra-violet rays, up to the dissociation of all
          molecules to the 63d octave. <br>
          <br>
          15. Law of Vibrating Atornolic Substances : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms are capable of vibrating within themselves at a pitch
          inversely as the Dyne (the local coefficient of Gravity), and
          as the atomic volume, directly as the atomic weight, producing
          the creative force (Electricity), whose transmissive force is
          propagated through atomolic solids, liquids, and gases,
          producing induction and the static effect of magnetism upon
          other atoms of attraction or repulsion, according to the Law
          of Harmonic Attraction and Repulsion. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : The phenomena of Dynamic Electricity through a
          metallic conductor and of induction are identical. In a
          metallic conductor, the transmission is from atom to atom,
          through homologous interstices, filled with ether, presenting
          small areas in close proximity. In crystalline structures,
          heat, which expands the atoms, by twisting them produces
          striae, increases the resistance, etc. Between parallel wires
          and through air the induction takes place from large areas
          through a rarefied medium composed of a mixture of substances,
          whose atoms are separated by waves of repulsion of various
          pitches, discordant to electric vibrations ; the said atoms
          sympathetically absorb the vibrations and dissipate from
          themselves, as centres, concentric waves of electric energy
          which produces heat and gravism. <br>
          <br>
          16. Law of Oscillating Atomoles : <br>
          <br>
          Atomoles oscillating at a uniform pitch (determined by their
          uniform size and weight) produce the creative force Atomolin,
          whose transmissive form, Gravism, is propagated through more
          rarefied media, producing the static effect upon all other
          atomoles, denominated Gravity. <br>
          <br>
          17. Law of Transformation of Forces : <br>
          <br>
          All forces are different forms of Universal Energy unlike in
          their period-frequency, merging into each other by
          imperceptible increments ; each form representing the compass
          of 21 octaves. Each form or pitch may be transformed into an
          equivalent quantity of another pitch above or below it in the
          scale of 105 octaves. The transformation can occur only ,
          through its static effect, developing vibrations of harmonic
          pitches above and below their fundamental vibration, or
          developing with juxtaposed aggregates, resultant and
          difference, or third order, as the case may be. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : A table of the intervals and harmonics of the
          normal harmonic scale will indicate the ratios in which the
          transformation of forces will occur. <br>
          <br>
          18. Law of Atomic Pitch : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms have each a different and definite pitch, at which they
          naturally vibrate. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : Atomic pitch is determined directly from its simple
          spectrum. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : Atomic pitch is determined by computations from its
          associate spectrum with all other atoms, as in known spectra.
          <br>
          <br>
          Scholium: Atomic pitches are more important working data than
          atomic weights ; tables of atomic pitches must be precise. <br>
          <br>
          19. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Rad-energy : <br>
          <br>
          The higher harmonics and overtones of projected rad-energy are
          of a pitch sufficiently high to cause the atom to expand; by
          causing the atomoles to vibrate systematically the same
          influence will cause the atom to contract, and thus by
          changing the volume, atomic pitch is varied. <br>
          <br>
          20. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Electricity and
          Magnetism : <br>
          <br>
          Electricity and Magnetism produce internal vibrations in the
          atom, which are followed by proportional changes in volume
          and, therefore, pitch. <br>
          <br>
          21. Law of Variation of Atomic Pitch by Temperature : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms in chemical combination oscillate with increasing
          amplitude directly as the temperature, and simultaneously
          absorb overtones of higher harmonics, producing expansion of
          volume and diminution of pitch. <br>
          <br>
          Rule : The gradual approach of the temperature of harmonic
          combination can be observed by mutually comparing superimposed
          spectra; chemical combination commences when the fundamental
          lines of each spectrum bear harmonic ratios by linear
          measurement. <br>
          <br>
          22. Law of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms not isolated and in a state of tension between forces
          that oppose and increase the equilibrium oscillate bodily at a
          pitch that is a resultant of the atomic weight, atomic volume,
          and tension. <br>
          <br>
          23. Law of Variation of Pitch of Atomic Oscillation by
          Pressure : <br>
          <br>
          The frequency of atomic oscillation increases and diminishes
          inversely as the square of the pressure. <br>
          <br>
          24. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Temperature : <br>
          <br>
          The force of cohesion diminishes inversely as the square of
          the distance the atoms are apart, and the force of the
          chemical affinity diminishes in the same ratio. Heat increases
          the amplitude of the oscillations in a direct ratio to the
          temperature of the natural scale. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : New thermometers and accurate thermometric tables,
          on the natural bases, wherein doubling the temperature doubles
          the pitch of the transmissive energy, are required. Such a
          table of temperature will bear natural relations to atomic
          weights, pitches, specific heats, chemical affinities,
          fusions, solubilities, etc., and will disclose new laws. One
          table for each must be constructed. <br>
          <br>
          25. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Electricity : <br>
          <br>
          The electric current destroys cohesion and chemical tension
          directly as square of current in amperes, inversely as the
          resistance in ohms, inversely as the chemical equivalent, and
          conversely as the coefficient of the difference between the
          freezing and volatilizing temperature of mass acted upon. <br>
          <br>
          26. Law of Variation of Atomic Oscillation by Sono-thermism :
          <br>
          <br>
          Diminishes the tensions directly as the quantity of heat
          developed, and in antithetical proportion to the harmonics
          absolved. <br>
          <br>
          27. Law of Chemical Affinity : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms whose atomic pitches are in either unison, harmonic or
          concordant ratios, unite to form molecules. <br>
          <br>
          Corollary: When two atoms are indifferent, they may be made to
          unite by varying the pitch of either, or both. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : This necessitates the construction of tables
          representing variation of atomic pitches by temperature,
          pressure, etc. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium: Tables of all harmonics and concords, and harmonics
          founded upon a normal harmonic scale, are equally essential. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium: Optical instruments may be made to measure pitches
          of energy. <br>
          <br>
          28. Law of Chemical Dissociation : <br>
          <br>
          If the pitch of either atom, in a molecule, be raised or
          lowered ; or, if they both be unequally raised or lowered in
          pitch until the mutual ratio be that of a discord ; or, if the
          oscillation amplitude be augmented by heat until the atoms are
          with the concentric waves of attraction, the atoms will
          separate. <br>
          <br>
          29. Law of Chemical Transposition : <br>
          <br>
          New molecules must be harmonics of the fundamental pitch. <br>
          <br>
          30. Law of Chemical Substitution (too complex for brief
          statement) . <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          The presence of harmonics and discords. <br>
          <br>
          32. Law of Molecular Synthesis and Combination (Organic) : <br>
          <br>
          The molecular pitch must be a derived harmony of the radicals.

          33. Law of Chemical Morphology : <br>
          <br>
          The angle of crystallization is determined by the relation
          between the molecular pitch of the crystallizing substance to
          the vibration-density of the liquid depositing it. <br>
          <br>
          34. Law of Atomic Dissociation: <br>
          <br>
          Overtones of high rad-energy pitches produce separation of the
          atomoles and recombinations among the atomolic molecules of
          the atoms. <br>
          <br>
          35. Law of Atomolic Synthesis of Chemical Elements : <br>
          <br>
          Harmonic pitches of atomolity produce association of
          etheric-atomolic particles to form atoms : the kind of atom is
          determinable by the pitches employed. <br>
          <br>
          36. Law of Heat : <br>
          <br>
          Atoms under the tension of chemical combination oscillate with
          an amplitude directly as the temperature, inversely as the
          pressure, and as the square of the specific heat. Diminishing
          the pitch of oscillation inversely as the square of the
          distance of the atoms apart, and simultaneously increasing the
          vibrating pitch of the atom by absorption of overtones and
          higher harmonics. <br>
          <br>
          37. Law of Electro-chemical Equivalents : <br>
          <br>
          An atom vibrates sympathetically under the influence of
          electric energy, such undertones of which are absorbed as are
          a harmonic or harmony of the electric pitch ; the amount of
          energy absorbed being directly as the arithmetical ratio of
          the undertone of the fundamental electric pitch. <br>
          <br>
          Scholium : A table of electro-chemical equivalents on the
          normal basis will indicate the electrical conditions and
          amount of chemical change. <br>
          <br>
          38. Law of Cohesion : <br>
          <br>
          The cohesion between atoms diminishes directly as the square
          root of the pressure and temperature, and as the square of
          electric intensity. <br>
          <br>
          39. Law of Refractive Indices : <br>
          <br>
          A table of the refractive indices of substances indicates
          their molecular pitch ; and in connection with crystalline
          form the phase of molecular oscillation. <br>
          <br>
          40. Law of Electric Conductivity : <br>
          <br>
          Electric energy is transmitted through homogeneous bodies with
          a completeness in direct proportion as the atoms are more or
          less perfect harmonics of the electric pitch, but not at all
          through substances whose atoms are discordant to the electric
          pitch ; also through molecular substances, when their
          resultant notes are harmonics of the electric pitch, the
          transmissions being inversely as the temperature, directly as
          the density diminished in proportion to the amount of
          crystallization, and inversely as the cube of the dyne, also
          directly as the reciprocal of the local magnetic intensity. <br>

          from the ceiling of a room in such a manner that vibrations
          cannot be communicated to it from the vibrating walls of the
          room. It is then experimentally determined to what fundamental
          note the metal plate sympathetically vibrates. Then, according
          to the law of linear dimensions, which is equally applicable
          to solids, liquids, or gases, it is mathematically determined
          what size of plate will produce successive octaves above that
          pitch, until a size of plate is obtained capable of producing
          a period-frequency corresponding to that of dark radiant heat,
          which we know is produced by the oscillations of atoms, and is
          termed therma. The vibrating atomic substance of the plate is
          capable of producing the trarismissive force called sound and
          sono-thermism, which is propagated through atomic media by
          wave -motion, but which cannot be propagated through space
          devoid of atomic substance. But when the plate has been
          reduced theoretically to a size sufficiently in finitesimal to
          correspond to the maximum or minimum <br>
          size of an atom, as determined by the atomic researches of
          Professors Tait &amp; Clerk Maxwell, we reach vibration
          frequency so high that it can be propagated through a acuum
          devoid of atomic substance, as a transmissive force called
          rad-energy, beginning with dark radiant heat. And be it
          carefully observed that period-frequency corresponds with that
          of dark rad-energy. The law of linear dimensions may be thus
          stated: The vibration-periods of two similarly circumstanced
          homologous bodies are to each other as their cubical contents,
          and therefore the vibration-frequencies of homologous metal
          plates are to each other as the inverse ratio of their linear
          dimensions. The octave of a given plate will be a homologous
          plate having ^ of its volume. A circular disc twenty inches in
          diameter and one inch thick vibrates, e.g,, 1024 times per
          second. The ten octaves from unity successively reducing the
          size of the disc by |, we get at each reduction the octave of
          the previous pitch, and at any given octave we have the
          volume, weight, and vibration-frequency of the vibrating
          atomic substance. <br>
          <br>
          Ten octave, 1024 vibrations per second; metal disc, twenty
          inches in diameter, one inch thick. To get the cubical
          contents of this vibrating aggregate it is necessary to square
          the diameter; we multiply by 0.7854, which is equal to 314.16
          inches in volume. Starting from this point, we progress
          through successive octaves upward, increasing in pitch and
          diminishing in size. <br>
          <br>
          <b>THE SCALE OF FORCES. </b><br>
          <br>
          First octave (unity per second) is approximately the lowest
          frequency capable of producing waves of rarefaction and
          condensation in the air. The atomic aggregate oscillating at
          this pitch can be experimentally deter mined, and the
          aggregate vibrating at a pitch one octave higher will have a
          mass lying between ^ and the cube root of the mass of the
          first-mentioned aggregate ; the exact relation under varying
          conditions of gravity, magnetic saturation, and pressure, can
          be determined only by accurate measurements. But assuming a
          body of a size represented by x, with a pitch represented by
          1024 per second, then a pitch of 2048 per second will be
          produced by a body having a volume of some mean between of x
          and the cube root of x. By accurately determining the pitch of
          a volume of any metallic sphere capable of oscillating at the
          pitch of, e.g., the eleventh octave of sonity (1024 per
          second), under normal conditions of gravity, pressure,
          magnetism, and then successively diminishing its size by ^ of
          itself, we get the successive octaves of pitches higher and
          higher in period-frequency until we pass the domain of sonity
          and enter the domain of sono-thermity . The point where the
          one form of energy merges into the other lies approximately at
          the twenty-first octave, and this pitch also marks the point
          where the air is no longer capable of vibrating at that pitch
          in waves of transverse form. This first gamut of 21| octaves
          consists of three forms ; viz. sonity, sound, and sonism. The
          following is a tabulation of the pitches of sonity in octaves
          from one vibration per second to where the next form of energy
          commences. <br>
          <br>
          <b>FRAUNHOFER LINES. </b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The Fraunhofer lines represent the silences, or the places of
          invisible pitches between the luminous pitches of rad-energy.
          They cannot therefore be conveniently used as data from which
          to measure the fundamental pitches of the atoms undergoing
          examination. When a series of sound-pencils are projected upon
          a screen, they undergo a combination of overtones and under
          tones at the point of contact producing tones of a pitch
          either too low to be recognized by the human ear or too high
          to be called sound. The Fraunhofer lines are not therefore
          simply silences, but may be the higher invisible ultra-actinic
          rays. The fact is that some of the Fraunhofer lines are
          capable of producing a variety of chemical actions, when
          reflected and focalized. Observation thus far shows that these
          lines do not bear any definite ascertainable relation to the
          pitches producing them, but that they do bear some uniform
          relation from which the fundamental pitch could be determined
          cannot be doubted. The relation of the Fraunhofer lines to the
          luminous spectra are undoubtedly such as would enable one to
          compute the creative pitches producing them ; but as yet no
          such determinations have been made. The accurate method of
          determining them is from the mutual relation of the harmonic
          pitches of the luminous spectra. <br>
          <br>
          A table representing the harmonic overtones and undertones of
          simple vibrations, and the resultant harmonics of associate
          vibrations, will be of great convenience in making these
          determinations. <br>
          <br>
          The natural unity of sonity lies above 1 per second, and below
          2 per second, and for this reason the numbering of the octaves
          is accomplished by calling the end of the first octave No. 1
          instead of No. 2. At the end of the twenty-first octave
          sono-thermity commences, and the bodies oscillating at this
          pitch are either correspondingly smaller by ^ than the
          preceding sonitic aggregates; or larger aggregates undergo
          vibration in submultiple portions of themselves. In either
          case the originating oscillation of a sono-thermic pitch is
          that of an isolated or localized aggregation. This first class
          of forces, or first double gamut, is included within the range
          of about forty-three octaves. The bodies of the first gamut
          oscillate with a rhythmically recurring translatory pendulous
          motion and produce waves of a transverse form, while the
          bodies of the second gamut undergo internal nodal vibration
          and produce waves of a longitudinal form. Beyond the upper
          limit of the forty-third octave we reach bodies of a size
          (determined by the same method as in sonity) which we know to
          be about the size of an atom as approximately determined by
          various physicists to lie between eleven and twelve
          micromillimeters (hydrogen molecules), which gives the highest
          pitch of the known atoms, and from which can be roughly
          jestimated the pitch of the heavier atoms. Starting with the
          approximate pitch of hydrogen as determined from its associate
          spectrum with oxygen, and working back to the size of the
          largest atoms, we again reach a pitch corresponding to the
          highest sono-thermic vibrations. Starting with the known
          temperature and pitch of a heated body, emitting definite rays
          of light, and working back to absolute zero, We again reach
          the pitch of the sono-thermic limit. <br>

          The amplitude of vibrations is directly increased or
          diminished by increasing or diminishing the size or number of
          creative aggregates... <br>
          <br>
          Thus the human race is immersed in forces whose intensity is
          vast in proportion to the number of EGOS adding each its quota
          to the already intense vibration, <br>
          tending either to love or hate, kindness or cruelty, timidity
          or bravery. Those who intensify the force of cruelty in the
          place where they reside, maybe strengthening a murderer's hand
          to strike the deadly blow in a distant land. This result is
          brought about through the agency of etheric waves, which
          transmit forces with undiminished intensity even to
          uncalculated distances. This phenomenon may be termed
          transympathetic. <br>
          <br>
          They who feel that force called love, which on higher planes
          is known as sympathy, thrill with waves of force which are
          already strong, augmenting them or increasing their intensity.
          They who indulge such sentiments and encourage such forces may
          stop the falling hand on evil sped... <br>
          <br>
          Every man contains, developed or embryonic, all conditions of
          the Infinite ; therefore no height is too great to reach.
          Impossibility is a meaningless word to the man who apprehends
          the fathomless contents of his own nature. Thou comest here, O
          man, with the instrument thou hast graduated in thy many past
          exist ences ; how few of thy chord-settings, if thou art
          numbered with the many, respond to the higher harmonies !
          Universal unity or fraternity has been absorbed to almost
          embryonic conditions by the prevalence of material
          self-regard. Charity has been rendered almost latent, that
          beautiful chord-setting found even in the lowest forms of
          creation LOVE, the dominant chord of the cycles. Love has an
          amplitude of action in the brute which may well make the
          selfish man ashamed, but until the crust of selfishness is
          broken through, the beauty of love is obscured, and though it
          exists all about him, the poor blind egotist has no eye to
          discern it. The centres of love, brotherhood, charity, voice
          their music loud and clear, yet the masses will not listen. I

          ... [H]e was so very busy, working upon an air-ship of which
          he had procured a perfect working model from Aldebaran, that
          he had become almost as complete a recluse of science as that
          exceedingly retiring worker, who scarcely ever allowed himself
          an evening, much less a day, in which to pay tribute to the
          social amenities, without which life would be such a complete
          blank to the devotees of fashion, and not to them only, but to
          many kindly natures whose gregarious instincts are strong, and
          who have little interest in life outside their fellowship with
          others...<br>
          <br>
          Two or three clergymen who were present, and not ably Mrs.
          Northafriker, an earnest missionary to foreign lands,
          expressed an intense desire to witness the progress already
          made by Professor Monteith; but as the work was not
          sufficiently completed to admit of close inspection, without
          disturbing the professor too greatly in the midst of his
          laborious, but beloved, undertaking, he declared himself
          obliged to content himself, and trusted they would be
          contented, with seeing the model which as the pattern he was
          faithfully determining to copy on a much larger scale. Though
          his own work was as yet immature, he assured them that others
          had made great progress, though he was only in the infancy of
          his herculean task. 1 <br>
          <br>
          1 The model is accurately described, as far as it can be at
          present, in a previous chapter of this book. See page 280. <br>

          "The propeller of this wonderful aerial navigator," said the
          professor, "is now actually in existence in Philadelphia ; for
          I have seen it there and I have, therefore, the authority of
          an eye-witness for this statement, as well as the word of many
          distinguished scientific investigators, whose judgment and
          veracity are entirely beyond dispute. It is a stupendous fact,
          of colossal magnitude, that the above navigator has associated
          with it all the conditions requisite for interstellar
          communication, it being positively proven that this wonderful
          vessel can navigate the air under all varying atmospheric
          conditions, from the calmest to the most perturbed, and is
          capable of travelling with amazing velocity, as well as at the
          lowest possible rate of motion, and that with perfect safety
          to the vessel and its inmates, making due allowance for
          atmospheric friction." ...<br>

          <div align="center"><b>CHAPTER XXV. </b><b><br>
            </b><b>WHAT OF AERIAL NAVIGATION? </b><b><br>
            </b></div>
          <br>
          AMONG the problems which most intensely interested Professor
          Monteith, after his return to London, that of aerial
          navigation occupied first rank. It was at the retreat of
          Aldebaran, one cold January afternoon, that he received the
          following remarkable instruction from the lips of the mystic
          scientist, who was then in the act of constructing an aerial
          navigator which he declared would, in the course of from three
          to five years, be quite ready for presentation to the world.
          The method of constructing this wonderful machine was
          explained in the following demonstration, which took place
          under the eyes of the professor. <br>
          <br>
          A small instrument, having three gyroscopes as a principal
          part of its construction, was the object exhibited to the
          professor as the instrument for demonstrating the facts of
          aerial navigation. These gyroscopes were attached to a heavy,
          inert mass of metal, weighing about one ton. The other part of
          the apparatus consisted of tubes, enclosed in as small a space
          as possible, being clustered in a circle. These tubes, the
          mystic went on to explain, represented certain chords, which
          were coincident to the streams of force acting upon the
          planet, focalizing and defocalizing upon its neutral centre.
          The action upon the molecular structure of the mass lifted was
          based upon the fact that each molecule in the mass possessed a
          north and south pole, more strictly speaking, a positive and
          negative pole, situated through the centre, formed by the
          three atoms which compose it. No matter which way the mass of
          metal is turned, the poles of the molecule point undeviatingly
          to the polar centre of the earth, acting almost exactly as the
          dip-needle when uninfluenced by extraneous conditions,
          electrical and otherwise. The rotation of the discs of the
          gyroscopes produces an action upon the molecules of the mass
          to be lifted, reversing their poles, causing repulsion from
          the earth in the same way as like poles of a magnet repel each
          other. This repulsion can be diminished and increased
          according as the mechanical conditions are operated. By
          operating the three discs, starting them at full speed, then
          touching two of them, so as to bring them, according to the
          tone they represented by their rotation, to a certain
          vibratory ratio, the weight then slowly swaying from side to
          side left the floor, rose several feet in the air, remaining
          in that position, and as the discs gradually decreased their
          speed of rotation the weight sank&nbsp; to the floor, settling
          down as lightly as a thistle-down. Where one molecule can be
          lifted, there need be no limit as to the number in a structure
          that may be operated upon as easily as one. The vessel in
          contemplation, the aerial navigator, will be over two hundred
          feet long, over sixty feet in diameter, tapering at both ends
          to a point, made of polished steel, and will be capable of
          being driven under the power of depolar repulsion, at the rate
          of three hundred miles an hour. It can be far more easily
          controlled than any instrument now in use for any phase of
          transit. Another very remarkable feature connected with this
          strange revelation of aerial navigation, is that the vessel is
          not buoyed up or floated in the air through the medium of the
          air, so that if there were no atmosphere it would float just
          as readily; hence, under mechanical conditions most certainly
          capable of production, involving massive strength of
          resistance to interstellar vacuity this can be made capable of
          navigating even the remote depth of space, positions between
          planets where polarity changes being controlled by other
          adjuncts of concentration for that purpose. <br>
          <br>
          Safely enclosed within this structure, a man possess ing the
          chemical knowledge these new laws give, with sufficient supply
          of material from which to make oxygen, by the enormously
          increased rate of speed attained by such navigator where
          atmospheric friction is avoided, the time occupied in
          travelling from one planet to an other would be amazingly
          brief, and one can travel to other planets in this system of
          worlds as easily as the same ship could navigate the depths of
          the ocean. <br>
          <br>
          The great obstacle hitherto preventing the solution of this
          problem has been the strength of structure needed under
          conditions above presented. With this knowledge of matter, the
          size of structure is unimportant ; the heaviest can be as
          easily controlled as the lightest. <br>
          <br>
          The results following the advent of such wonders as are here
          represented must closely approximate the long-foretold
          millennium, or more properly golden age : the disarming of
          nations, the ennoblement of man, the universality of the
          realization of brotherhood, and the true elevation of
          womankind; since man, possessing all that may be obtained,
          need no longer fear the development of woman to perfect
          equality with himself. In that time it shall be the search for
          the divine ideal which must engage the faculties of all to
          their utmost extent.<br>
