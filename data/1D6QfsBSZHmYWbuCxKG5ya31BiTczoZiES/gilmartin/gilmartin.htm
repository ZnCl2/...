      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a mechanical problem that has troubled
        scientists since the ancient Greeks. Now a Scottish electrician
        has invented a small water wheel that could save thousands of
        pounds in energy bills. <br>
        Ian Gilmartin, 60, who has no mains electricity, is generating
        power from the stream in his garden. He and friend Bob Cattley,
        58, have invented a mini water wheel capable of supplying enough
        electricity to power a house, with no running costs and zero
        carbon emissions. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contraption is the first off-the-shelf
        water wheel system which can generate a good supply of
        electricity from a waterfall as little as 20cm in height. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is designed to be used in small rivers or
        streams, making it ideal for potentially thousands of homes
        across Britain. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gilmartin, an electrician and inventor
        born and raised in the village of Springfield, near Cupar, Fife,
        was not prompted to think up his device by high energy bills -
        he does not own a TV and has never lived in a house with
        electricity. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he has a stream at the back of his house
        near Staveley, in Cumbria, and with the help of PhD engineering
        student Mr Cattley, now hopes to see the invention in the shops
        by the end of next year. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gilmartin, who lived in Linwood before
        moving to Cumbria in the late-1960s, began experimenting three
        years ago with yoghurt pots, toilet rolls and wheelie bins in
        the stream, before test-running a prototype. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the results to the Lake District
        National Park, and secured a £15,000 grant from the
        organisation's sustainability fund. The prototype has been
        working successfully at St Catherine's, a National Trust site
        near Windermere, opening up previously untapped energy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water wheel produces one to two
        kilowatts of power and generates at least 24 kilowatt hours of
        sustainable green energy in a day, just less than the average
        household's daily consumption of around 28 kilowatt hours. It
        should cost around £2000 to install, and will pay for itself
        inside two years. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Beck Mickle low head micro hydro
        generator could potentially provide electricity to more than
        50,000 British homes and could be used industrially. The
        inventors predict a series of them linked on the same river
        course could create enough electricity to power a small town or
        large hospital. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gilmartin said he came up with the idea
        after giving up work to look after his son, who had epilepsy.
        "There was nothing available on the market to recover any
        sensible amount of energy from low (pressure) heads, so in
        wanting something to think about at the time, I thought of the
        idea of having revolving buckets to recover energy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "While we cannot say this provides free
        electricity, because of the initial cost of buying the machine,
        it is expected to pay for itself within two years and then
        greatly reduce the owner's electricity bills after then. Because
        what we are doing is cheap to make, the pay-back is very quick."

              Energy Production</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A revolutionary new invention that uses yoghurt pot plastic to
        generate electricity could be a significant new step towards
        increasing the UK's reliance on renewables. </p>
      <p>The Beck Mickle Hydro project uses the plastic device to
        generate electricity from shallow waters such as rivers and
        streams to a depth of just 20 cm. </p>
      <p>"We could be looking at significant changes to power
        production," explained the inventor of the device, Ian
        Gilmartin. </p>
      <p>"We want to generate energy from water between 20 cm and two
        metres deep. No one else has attempted anything like this in
        such shallow water." </p>
      <p>Mr Gilmartin hopes that the invention, currently being
        developed at Lancaster University, will translate into a device
        that could generate enough electricity to power a house. </p>
      <p>Homeowners could then buy the machine for around £1,000 to
        achieve their own renewable microgeneration. </p>
      <p>The device could also reportedly be used to provide drinking
        water and in air conditioning. </p>
      <p>The project has received funding from the Lake District
        National Park Authority's sustainable development fund. It is
        believed the device, once developed, could be used in up to
        100,000 sites across the UK. </p>

      <p>Local inventor and electrician lan Gilmartin has redesigned the
        water wheel for the 21st century to provide renewable
        inexpensive electricity from even tiny streams without harming
        fish or contributing to global warming. This unique patented
        technology makes use of recycled plastic and can even provide
        power from becks that are no more than a trickle. It is
        envisaged units that are scalable will be sold as white goods
        that can easily be approved and installed before simply being
        plugged in. </p>
      <p>Following a referral from Business Link Cumbria, lan has been
        working with the Enterprise and Business Partnerships (EBP) Team
        of Lancaster University's Environment Centre to assess the
        environmental impact of this technology, identify its market
        potential and strengthen its patent protection. </p>
      <p>The environmental impact assessment focused on the use of
        food-grade recycled plastics within the water wheel, to support
        a possible demonstration at the National Trust's St Catherine's
        site in Winder-mere. This was contracted out to CookPrior
        Associates Ltd, a local consultancy experienced in such
        assessments, which identified a low risk of any organic
        chemicals leaching from the plastics to be used, but recommended
        a series of leaching trials to ensure that no unforeseen
        problems arose. </p>
      <p>Through a variety of literature searches, internet searches and
        personal contacts with organisations such as the: NERC,
        Environment Agency and Land Registry, the EBP team have
        identified several reports providing information on potential
        sites for low-head hydro generation and the proportion of the UK
        meeting minimum gradient and flow requirements. </p>
      <p>However, further work remains to be done, in particular the
        development of a comprehensive business plan to successfully
        attract investors. Therefore, a team of four MBA students
        undertaking a business planning module in the University's
        Management School, have been recruited. The team have
        enthusiastically accepted the challenge of pulling together the
        market information so far obtained and producing a first draft
        business plan for delivery in mid December. During the business
        planning project, EBP have continued to investigate a means of
        actively identifying potential customers, rather than relying
        solely on passive internet-based advertising. This has now led
        to discussions with the University's Geography </p>
      <p>Department regarding the possible development of an automated
        system for analysing 1 in 10,000 scale maps and providing the
        postcodes of potential customers for use in targeted mail shots,
        possibly along with their electricity bills. EBP are also
        working closely with lan using the group's patent and
        intellectual property experience, to strengthen Beck Mickle
        Hydro's patent position and ensure appropriate confidentiality
        agreements are in place across their numerous contacts. </p>
      <p><br>
        Beck Mickle Hydro have also been working closely with the
        Lancaster University Renewable Energy Group (LUREG) to evaluate
        their technology against siphon technology LUREG are developing
        as an alternative means of low-head hydroelectric generation.
        LUREG, which has significant expertise in low head hydroelectric
        generation in both tidal and non-tidal environments have adopted
        lan's technology and are working closely with him to establish a
        number of demonstration sites for both technologies. </p>
      <p>The EBP team with the financial support of the NorthWest
        Development Agency and Higher Education Innovation Fund helps
        companies across the NorthWest to access the environmental and
        science expertise of Lancaster University. This is accomplished
        via company visits to identify areas where assistance would be
        beneficial, small pieces of free consultancy, technical and
        business based student projects and facilitating the formation
        of affinity groups between companies to resolve common issues
        through collaborative research partnerships. The EBP team also
        serve as the prime contact for the Lancaster Environment Centre,
        which is the largest of its kind in Europe and brings people
        together from across the university together with the NERC's
        Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. </p>
