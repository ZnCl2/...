      For several years , an independent researcher Ardèche , Jean
      -Christophe Dumas, explores the " Casimir effect " in relation to
      the resonance of water.<br>
      <br>
      He discovers a spontaneous steam generator with singular
      characteristics method .<br>
      <br>
      "The Dumas effect" is appraised in Nice by an independent
      laboratory, September 14, 2013 .<br>
      <br>
      The findings are instructive : like the Casimir effect , the Dumas
      effect generates a yield of 116 % energy.<br>
      <br>
      For the first time a simple, easy to design and very inexpensive
      method allows all access to free energy.<br>
      <br>
      " In space, there is a free form of energy, infinite that will
      allow humanity to harmonize its energy technologies with major
      workings of nature. This discovery is only a matter of time. " --
      Nicolas Tesla (1856-1943)<br>
      <br>
      In 1948, thanks to quantum field theory and in total violation of
      the laws of thermodynamics , the physicist Hendrik Casimir
      predicted the existence of an infinite reservoir of energy in the
      vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      In 1958 the first experimental proof of the validity of this
      theory is made.<br>
      <br>
      In 1997 Sparnay Lamoreaux then realize that scientifically valid
      testing the Casimir effect <br>
      <br>
      Here is the complete instructions for making (for a few euros!) Of
      the process generating the Dumas effect.<br>
      <br>
      A simple, effective technology that is available to all, free
      license and for the greater common good of all the inhabitants of
      the earth.<br>

      April 23-&nbsp; François Alfonsi MEP Regions and Peoples
      Solidarity met Jean-Christophe Dumas Dumas Effect discoverer of
      the process - free energy. He was accompanied by his parliamentary
      assistant and Gérard Pierre Costa Leynaud candidate in the
      European elections on 25 May. Regions and Peoples Solidarity

      Jean- Christophe Dumas is an independent, passionate researcher of
      physics, chemistry and electronics. He has invented the resonance
      reactor, a small craft scrap , which could disrupt our lives and
      change our behavior in terms of energy . You said revolutionary ?<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>The Ardèche researcher Jean-Christophe Dumas in front of
        his invention.</i><br>
      <br>
      Jean- Christophe Dumas is convinced that his discovery could upset
      the energy story of this century. In any case, it is true that
      experience, we have assisted gawk . Because at first we did not
      believe it too. The Scientist welcomes us to his home in Vals
      -les- Bains. On the terrace of his house, he prepares his shot. A
      container filled with water, an extension cord and that's it. It
      dips into the water a small steel ball, based on a switch. The
      reactor resonance makes a slight noise. And indeed, the steam
      escapes from the container. The water turns into steam instantly
      well. The researcher has not lied to us. Then the most amazing,
      perhaps this revolution, the process produces more energy than it
      consumes. This would allow, for example, to have a heating system
      at a lower cost .<br>
      <br>
      <i>The resonance reactor</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Practical use can : express desalinating seawater And if this was
      the solution for millions of people short of water? The Ardèche
      researcher is a philanthropist, he has not filed any patent, it
      offers the public his invention via internet / free invention of
      law.<br>

      few euros scrap steel, the price of the machine is to make
      yourself. Scientific Ardèche claims not to be a weirdo. It must
      give a series of lectures to promote his invention would encounter
      strong resistance from powerful industrial lobbies.<br>

          Subject: George Wiseman on the Dumas Effect<br>
          Date: Mar 10, 2015<br>
          <br>
          Hola Folks!<br>
          <br>
          George Wiseman is an expert on HHO and has done many
          fascinating&nbsp; experiments, many documented at his
          www.eagle-research.com website. I sent him the DUMAS info and
          he shares this;<br>
          <br>
          Jerry,<br>
          <br>
          I independently discovered what you are calling the Dumas
          Effect (I'm calling it the Wise Heater) in the early 1990's
          when I was trying to find a method to split water without
          using electrolyte (using pure water).<br>
          <br>
          I danced for joy when I started making copious volumes of gas
          with little electricity... But I noticed that the little jar I
          was experimenting with was getting really hot; so I thought
          some of the gas might be steam...<br>
          <br>
          So I dutifully put a condenser on the gas output, which would
          condense any steam and allow it to drip back into the jar.<br>
          <br>
          I was really sad (happy dance stopped) when I concluded that
          the gas was 99.99% steam. Not one bit of Brown's Gas was
          generated by this method.<br>
          <br>
          But I found the effect interesting, because the jar did heat
          up twice as fast as I would expect for the energy
          consumption.&nbsp; And MOST of my money making innovations
          come from side effects of my main research...<br>
          <br>
          So I dutifully made measurements and compared the Wise Heater
          to a heating element that used a similar amount of wattage (my
          soldering iron).&nbsp; I used a wattmeter to measure the
          energy input (calculated to joules) and a thermometer on the
          jars.<br>
          <br>
          I report this experiment in my Brown's Gas, Book 1, written in
          the early 1990's see excerpt below:<br>
          <br>
          Experiment One<br>
          I placed two copper plates .0625 inch (1/16’) from each other
          in about 276 ml (just over a cup) of de-ionized water.<br>
          <br>
          Note: the water used in this experiment must be as pure as
          possible. ANY impurity will cause electrical consumption to
          rise.<br>
          <br>
          The plates were about .5 inch high by 1.5 inches long. They
          were held together by plastic bolts and apart by plastic
          washers. I soldered #14 solid copper leads to the plates.<br>
          <br>
          I plugged this directly into 120 VAC, as I had been assured
          (by MAXA) that Brown’s Gas could be produced by AC current.<br>
          <br>
          My electrolyzer as described in Experiment 1, drew only .5 Amp
          of current but went from 20°C (68°F) to 50°C (122°F) in ten
          minutes and to 94°C (201.2°F) in 25 minutes from the start of
          the experiment.<br>
          <br>
          I got all excited because there was a lot of gas. But I
          thought some of it must be steam, because of the high
          temperature. So I sealed my electrolyzer, assembled a
          condenser to separate the steam from the Brown’s Gas and
          directed all the vapors through the condenser, and then to a
          ‘displacement’ container.<br>
          <br>
          I figured the steam would condense (turn back to liquid) and
          drain back to the electrolyzer. I figured the Brown’s Gas
          (being oxygen and hydrogen) would remain in a vapor state when
          cooled and would displace water in my displacement container.<br>
          <br>
          By condensing the steam, I found that the vapors being
          produced by the electrolyzer were nearly all steam (99.99%).<br>
          <br>
          So much for copious Brown’s Gas.<br>
          <br>
          So much for a simple AC application with no electrolyte and no
          transformer.<br>
          <br>
          I did discover that the plates allowed the most current flow
          when they were in a horizontal position (plate surfaces
          vertical but depth shallow), so that the bubbles could remove
          themselves from between the plates quickly, allowing more
          liquid to come in from underneath.<br>
          <br>
          Bubbles between the plates impedes the electrical flow that
          produces more gas.<br>
          <br>
          I also discovered that the electrical forces involved were
          powerfulenough to rip the molecules right out of the copper
          plates.<br>
          <br>
          When operating this experiment for a period of time the water
          becomes cloudy with copper.&nbsp; When examined, the plates
          show obvious loss of copper.<br>
          <br>
          A side effect of this experiment seems to be ‘over-unity’
          heat. Over-unity means that more energy is produced by a
          device than is supplied to it. To take 276 ml from 20°C to
          50°C in ten minutes<br>
          indicates 34,643.52 joules. The electrical power used was
          about 36,000 joules.<br>
          <br>
          This may not seem to be over unity on the face but you must
          remember that this was an open container at 3000 ft elevation
          with no insulation to prevent radiation, conduction and
          convection losses.<br>
          <br>
          I ran a side experiment with electric resistance heaters
          drawing the same amperage at the same voltage in the same
          container with the same volume of water and it took twenty
          minutes to go from 20°C to 50°C and almost an hour to reach
          85°C (185°F). The electric element was never able to bring the
          water to a full boil.<br>
          <br>
          Note, electric elements are supposed to be 98% efficient, so
          the above experiment 'indicates' that the Wise Heater is more
          than twice as efficient at heating water as an electric
          element.<br>
          <br>
          I also discovered that DC current flow (with set-up as per
          Experiment1, but with a bridge rectifier installed) at this
          high voltage still produced the ‘over-unity’ heat.<br>
          <br>
          I duplicated this experiment several times and have had
          friends duplicate it.<br>
          <br>
          However, getting back to the original experiment, high voltage
          (AC or DC) and no electrolyte did not produce significant
          amounts of H2 and O2, and what was produced was certainly not
          Brown’s Gas.<br>
          <br>
          The high voltage seemed to cause the H and O to reduce
          directly back to water as soon as it formed in the
          electrolyzer; with the net result of simply converting
          electricity into heat...<br>
          <br>
          So I suggest to you, as I did to Sterling during the Brown's
          Gas on Catalyst experiments, That the Wise Heater experiment
          be repeated, but use stainless steel plates (to increase
          electrodeposition voltage; so the plates won't degrade).<br>
          <br>
          The idea is to use plates like they are capacitor plates and
          'vibrate' the water to heat it up.<br>
          <br>
          There is a magnetic field between capacitor plates (I've
          proven that by putting a flat coil between pates and putting
          AC onto the plates; the coil output electricity like a
          transformer.)<br>
          <br>
          Water is polarized by magnetic fields, so when you put AC to
          the plates, it causes the water to be polarized one direction
          and then the other as the AC reverses voltage.&nbsp; Pulsing
          DC acts similarly.&nbsp; The 'flipping' of the water molecules
          back and forth heats up the water.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, 50 or 60 Hz may not be the optimum, and both the
          plate spacing and plate height need to be experimented with,
          but the technology is valid and works as is.&nbsp; No need to
          be complicated, it's very simple.&nbsp; BTW, a glass jar
          prevents electrical shock, yet allows the heat to be gathered.<br>
          <br>
          You want to use pure water because any ions that cross the
          'capacitor' gap 'bleed' electricity.&nbsp; You want any
          electrical charge that's built up on a plate to return to the
          Grid on the opposite cycle, thus 'conserving'
          electricity.&nbsp; The Wise Heater technology could be
          considered a spinoff of my 'Energy Conserver Theory" and my
          "Capacitive Power Supply" projects.<br>
          <br>
          Thus I can confirm that the Dumas Effect is likely REAL
          because of my own independent experiments.<br>
          <br>
          May the blessings be<br>

          Peter Daysh Davey believed it to be a sonic effect more than
          just electricity, that you had to 'tune' the gap to make it
          produce large volumes of steam quickly and cheaply.<br>

          "Well as it uses from 100% to around 20% of a normal forced
          current heater like a commercial waterboiler. The consumption
          depends on factors I have not investigated yet.<br>
          <br>
          By the way - there are no splitting water into H/O2 or forming
          of gasses whatsoever. So no electrolysis here!<br>
          <br>
          But something even more interesting is the viscosity of the
          water once resonated. It gets much thicker than tap water. And
          it seems to get rid of all the impurities in the water -
          laying at the bottom in a brownish colour.<br>
          <br>
          When resonating salt water the same thing happens. Only now
          there is a much thicker layer at the bottom - now including
          the salt.<br>
          <br>
          This could be a starters point for understanding Keely
          resonance technology, as water is a miracle learning tool. In
          my view mainly because of it's willingness to form any crystal
          bundles whatsoever - the incredible water memory capacity.<br>
          <br>
          Keely also noted water is as made for frequency manipulation.
          The Oxygen atom weighing exactly 16 times that of the hydrogen
          atom also makes it perfect for frequency disassociation.?"<br>

          But he decided to test whether the same phenomenon is to
          appear, if a metal hemisphere which simulates his pilot cabin
          is submerged in water and is excited into a resonance
          frequency.<br>
          <br>
          So he found two tops from old bicycle bells, joined them
          together, tuned one of them to 50 Hz frequency, attached
          electricity wire to each one of them, and thrown them into
          water.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, water started to boil extremely fast. So he made
          his first heater patent based on this observation. This patent
          was already registered in 1944.<br>

          After a hero return from the war, he had a device, which
          repetitively proved to everyone who measured it, that it has
          the efficiency decisively exceeding 100%.<br>

          Mr Davey was a musician who volunteered to defend freedom and
          his country as a fighter pilot during the World War Two. He
          took part in the Battle for Britain. Fighter aeroplanes of
          that time had propellers and engines, which during acrobatics
          of aerial battles were making the pilots cabin to vibrate at
          various frequencies.<br>
          <br>
          As a sensitive musician Mr Davey noticed, that there was such
          a frequency of the motor and propeller buzzing, when the
          aeroplane cabin and his body were getting into a resonance.<br>
          <br>
          At this unique resonance frequency he always was experiencing
          an influx of heat in his aeroplane cabin.<br>
          <br>
          He did not know yet, that in future this phenomenon will be
          utilised in ultrasonic weapon systems for effective and
          undetected killing of people. But he decided to test whether
          the same phenomenon is to appear, if a metal hemisphere which
          simulates his pilot cabin is submerged in water and is excited
          into a resonance frequency of an AC current.<br>
          <br>
          So he found two tops from old bicycle bells, joined them
          together, tuned one of them to 50 Hz frequency, attached
          electricity wire to each one of them, and thrown them into
          water.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly, water started to boil extremely fast. So he made
          his first heater patent based on this observation. This patent
          was already registered in 1944.<br>
          <br>
          In times when I kept in touch with Mr Davey he explained to me
          that the fine tuning of the bowl (1) to the frequency of the
          current he carried out with the saxophone.<br>
          <br>
          Namely, holding the heater in his fingers he played on the
          saxophone the tune "low B" - which (the tune) is harmonic to
          the frequency of 50 Hz. (Other easily accessible sources of
          sounds having frequency 50 Hz include: piano - "low D", tuning
          fork - "50 Hz", buzzing electrical transformer, modern
          oscilloscope with a speaker.)<br>
          <br>
          If the bowl (1) of the heater would NOT fall into a resonance
          (i.e. would NOT vibrate noticeably) during this playing, then
          he slightly grinded (on a fast grinder) the front face of this
          bowl and then tried again. These repetitions he carried out as
          long as required for the bowl (1) always fall in the resonance
          (vibrations) when he played this tune.<br>
          <br>
          In turn the fine tuning of the distance "L" the inventor
          carried out by measuring the electricity consumption by the
          heater (means measuring the value of Amperes that flow through
          the heater). Namely he measured this power consumption for
          several different distances "L" and then set on a given heater
          the distance "L" for which this power consumption was the
          lowest.<br>
          <br>
          (1) The "sonic boiler" boils water immediately after it is
          submerged in this water.<br>
          <br>
          (2) The "sonic boiler" boils water simultaneously in the
          entire volume of this water.<br>
          <br>
          (3) Practically all phenomena which we get to know during the
          use of classical electrical heaters of water, for the "sonic
          boiler" have a completely different course.<br>
          <br>
          (4) The "sonic boiler" is exceptionally safe in use.<br>
          <br>
          (5) The "sonic boiler" boils any amount of any liquid that is
          based on water.<br>
          <br>
          (6) The "sonic boiler" changes physical attributes of water
          that it boils.&nbsp; the sound of water boiled with this
          boiler is completely different than in boiling with normal
          methods.<br>
          <br>
          (7) The "sonic boiler" in the technical version shown here has
          a similar consumption of energy as every other heater of water
          (in spite that in the version shown in "Fig. #B1" it
          apparently consumed almost zero electricity).<br>

          That idea of tuning to water is pure Keely who claimed 42.8khz
          would dissociate water in an explosion instantaneously
          generating upwards of&nbsp; 29,000psi...imagine that force to
          drive engines!<br>
