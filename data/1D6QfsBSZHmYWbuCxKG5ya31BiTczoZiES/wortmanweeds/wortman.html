      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Abrasive-weeding is a novel weed management tactic with potential
      to reduce tillage and hand-weeding in organic agriculture.
      However, abrasive-weeding has not been tested in vegetable
      cropping systems and growers are interested in the potential for
      using organic fertilizers as abrasive grits to control weeds and
      supplement crop nutrition in one field pass. A two-year field
      study was conducted at the University of Illinois Sustainable
      Student Farm to determine the effect of air-propelled abrasive
      grit type, including organic fertilizers, and application
      frequency on weed density and biomass and crop yield and
      marketability in organic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and
      pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cropping systems. Abrasive-grits,
      including granulated walnuts shells and maize cobs, greensand
      fertilizer, and soybean meal, were applied via compressed air
      between one and four times within planting holes of plastic mulch.
      Weed density was quantified 25 or 37 days after the first
      application and weed biomass was harvested at the end of the
      growing season. Tomatoes and peppers were harvested ripe and
      graded for marketability. Two applications of abrasive grits,
      regardless of grit type, reduced weed density by 63% and 80% in
      tomato and pepper, respectively. Broadleaf weeds were more
      susceptible to abrasive-weeding than grass weeds. Abrasive-weeding
      reduced final weed biomass by 69–97% compared with the weedy
      control, regardless of grit type or application frequency. Total
      tomato yield was up to 44% greater in treated plots compared with
      the weedy control, whereas total yield gains in pepper (up to 33%)
      were only approaching significance (p = 0.09). Yield and the
      marketability of fruit was not negatively affected by grit
      application, despite minor stem and leaf tissue damage after
      applications. Organic fertilizers used as abrasive grits in this
      study could contribute between 35 and 105 kg N ha−1, which may
      improve the functionality and economic feasibility of
      abrasive-weeding.<br>

      <b><b><br>
        </b> </b><b>Why do organic farmers need specialized
        technologies to control weeds?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While many conventional farmers can rely on just a handful of
      herbicides to control most weeds, there are no comparable “silver
      bullets” available to organic farmers. Instead, organic farmers
      must develop an ecological approach to weed management that
      includes a diverse mix of cultural, mechanical, and physical
      tactics to control weeds. Cultural practices like crop rotation,
      cover cropping, and delayed planting dates are helpful for
      disrupting weed growth, but mechanical tillage is the primary form
      of weed control on most organic farms. Fossil fuel use and soil
      disturbance associated with intensive tillage have raised
      questions about the environmental sustainability of organic
      farming. Thus, research is needed to develop novel mechanical and
      physical organic weed control tactics that reduce dependence on
      tillage without sacrificing crop productivity or farm
      profitability.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>What methods have organic farmers been utilizing to control
        weeds in lieu of synthetic herbicides? </b><br>
      <br>
      Many organic farmers have tried cover crop mulches (e.g.,
      roller-crimped rye), natural herbicides (e.g., citrus oil), and
      flame-weeding to reduce tillage. Each of these strategies can be
      effective in certain cropping situations, but they also have
      limitations. For example, cover crop mulches can harbor insect
      pests and interfere with crop emergence and nutrient availability.
      Natural herbicides are expensive and not effective against many
      weed species. Flame-weeding is effective against a broad range of
      weed species, but is fossil fuel-intensive and can cause
      significant crop damage and yield loss.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>What is abrasive weeding, how does it work and what are the
        benefits?</b><br>
      <br>
      Abrasive-weeding, or “weed blasting”, is a physical form of weed
      control that uses air-propelled abrasive grits to kill small weed
      seedlings within the crop row. Any small, gritty material can be
      used in abrasive-weeding (e.g., granulated walnut shells and corn
      cobs), but we are interested in using organic fertilizers as
      abrasive grits so that farmers can control in-row weeds and
      supplement crop nutrition in one field pass.<br>
      <br>
      Abrasive grits are applied in a 4-6 inch band within the crop row
      via compressed air (100 PSI) either by hand (Fig. 1) or by a
      prototype grit applicator (Figs. 2 &amp; 3). Abrasive grits
      defoliate and kill small weed seedlings (i.e., those with two
      leaves or less) if the growing point is above the soil surface.
      Thus, abrasive-weeding is most effective on broadleaf weeds and
      less effective on grasses because the growing point is often
      protected beneath the soil surface.<br>
      <br>
      Like many organic weed control tactics, abrasive-weeding is most
      effective when there is a size differential between the crop
      (large) and weeds (small); thus, planting or transplanting into a
      weed-free seedbed is important for success. Abrasive-weeding can
      partially defoliate and slow the growth of larger weeds, but weed
      mortality decreases greatly when the weeds have three or more
      leaves at the time of grit application.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Are there limitations on the crops that it can be used on?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Thus far, we have demonstrated successful weed control with
      abrasive-weeding in corn, soybean, tomato, and pepper. Further
      research is being done in broccoli and kale. Abrasive-weeding will
      likely be effective in most crops with a vertical growth habit or
      those that are vertically trellised. However, the number of
      applications and the amount of grit required in a specific
      cropping system will determine the economic feasibility of
      abrasive-weeding. As a result, this technology may have the
      greatest potential in organic vegetable crops because economic
      returns per unit area are high, and grit applications can be
      paired with a straw or (bio) plastic mulch, which should reduce
      the quantity of grits required to achieve season-long weed
      suppression.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Is this technology available to organic farmers now? Where can
        they learn about it?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hand-held application of abrasive-grits is currently available to
      organic farmers as it only requires a portable air-compressor and
      a hand-held siphon- or gravity-fed grit applicator (Fig. 1), both
      of which can be found at your local hardware store. Larger-scale
      mechanized abrasive-weeding is still in the research and
      development phase, but our research team hopes to publish
      blueprints for a four-row (grain crops) and two-row (vegetable
      crops) prototype grit applicator within the next two years (Figs.
      2 &amp; 3).<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Weed blasting offers new control method for
          organic farmers</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Weeds are a major scourge for organic growers, who often must
      invest in multiple control methods to protect crop yields. A
      relatively new weed control method known as abrasive weeding, or
      "weed blasting," could give organic growers another tool. The
      method, recently field-tested at the University of Illinois, is
      surprisingly effective.<br>
      <br>
      In conjunction with plastic mulch, abrasive weeding reduced final
      weed biomass by 69 to 97 percent compared to non-weeded control
      plots, said U of I agroecologist Samuel Wortman.<br>
      <br>
      Abrasive weeding involves blasting weed seedlings with tiny
      fragments of organic grit, using an air compressor. For the
      current study, grit was applied through a hand-held siphon-fed
      sand-blasting unit connected to a gas-powered air compressor,
      which was hauled down crop rows with a walk-behind tractor. The
      study looked at a number of grit sources: walnut shells,
      granulated maize cob, greensand, and soybean meal. If applied at
      the right plant growth stage, the force of the abrasive grit
      severely damages stems and leaves of weed seedlings.<br>
      <br>
      Wortman found no significant differences between the grit types in
      terms of efficacy. "When it leaves the nozzle, it's at least Mach
      1 [767 mph]," Wortman noted. "The stuff comes out so fast, it
      doesn't really matter what the shape of the particle is." Because
      ricocheting particles can pose a risk to the applicator, Wortman
      advises using protective eyewear.<br>
      <br>
      Blasted grit does not discriminate between weed and crop
      seedlings, which makes it important to use this method in
      transplanted crops that are substantially larger than weed
      seedlings at the time of grit application. Although some visible
      damage occurred on stems and leaves of both tomato and pepper
      crops, the damage did not affect marketable fruit yield. Studies
      are ongoing to determine whether abrasions on crop tissues could
      result in increased susceptibility to disease, but early results
      show little effect.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, plots with plastic mulch and one or more blasting
      treatment achieved the same fruit yields seen in hand-weeded
      plots, and 33 to 44 percent greater yields than in non-weeded
      control plots.<br>
      <br>
      An additional benefit of weed blasting is the potential for
      growers to use organic fertilizers, such as soybean meal, as
      blasting material. "We expect that abrasive weeding could
      contribute between 35 and 105 kg nitrogen per hectare [31 - 94 lbs
      per acre] to soil fertility." The idea that a grower could both
      fertilize and kill weeds in a single pass is appealing, but it is
      still unknown whether the fertilizer would be available for plant
      uptake within critical windows.<br>
      <br>
      According to Wortman's research, weed blasting does affect some
      weeds more than others. Essentially, the smaller the seedling, the
      better. Also, seedlings whose growing points are aboveground
      (annual broadleaf species) are more susceptible to blasting than
      seedlings whose growing tips are located belowground (grasses and
      broadleaf perennials). Finally, Wortman noted that the presence of
      plastic mulch seemed to factor strongly into the equation. Weed
      blasting alone "is not a silver bullet, but it is an improvement,"
      he said.<br>
      <br>
      The method is now being tested in different horticultural crops,
      including broccoli and kale, with and without additional weed
      control methods. Early results suggest that the presence of
      polyethylene mulch or biodegradable plastic mulch strongly
      enhances the success of weed blasting, as compared with straw
      mulch and bare soil. Wortman and his collaborators have also
      developed a mechanized grit applicator, which they are currently
      testing.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Abrasive weed control is a novel weed management tactic that has
      great potential to increase the profitability and sustainability
      of organic vegetable cropping systems. The objective of this study
      was to determine the effect of air-propelled organic abrasive
      grits (e.g., organic fertilizers) on weed seedling emergence and
      growth and vegetable crop growth. A series of thirteen greenhouse
      trials were conducted to determine the susceptibility of weeds to
      abrasive weed control with one of six organic materials including:
      corn cob grits, corn gluten meal, greensand fertilizer, walnut
      shell grits, soybean meal, and bone meal fertilizer. In addition,
      crop injury was quantified to determine the potential utility of
      each organic material as abrasive grits in tomato and pepper
      cropping systems. Of the six organic materials, corn gluten meal,
      greensand fertilizer, walnut shell grits, and soybean meal
      provided the broadest range of POST weed control. For example, one
      blast of corn gluten meal and greensand fertilizer reduced Palmer
      amaranth (one-leaf stage) seedling biomass by 95 and 100% and
      green foxtail (one-leaf stage) biomass by 94 and 87%,
      respectively. None of the organic materials suppressed weed
      seedling emergence when applied to the soil surface, suggesting
      that residual weed control with abrasive grits is unlikely. Tomato
      and pepper stems were relatively tolerant of abrasive grit
      applications, though blasting with select materials did increase
      stem curvature in tomato and reduced biomass (corn cob grit) and
      relative growth rate (corn gluten meal and greensand) in pepper.
      Results suggest that organic fertilizers can be effectively used
      as abrasive grits in vegetable crops, simultaneously providing
      weed suppression and supplemental crop nutrition. Field studies
      are needed to identify cultural practices that will increase the
      profitability of multifunctional abrasive weed control in organic
      specialty crops.<br>

      Frank Forcella was surrounded with apricot pits – a seemingly
      useless collection of fruit stones saved in an endless line of
      5-gallon buckets. Apricot trees don’t fare well in the cold of
      Minnesota, but Forcella scratched out a hobby harvest each year,
      and hit a bumper crop in 2007. More apricots; many varieties; and
      a massive jump in his pit bucket mother lode. What to do with a
      never-ending pit collection?<br>
      <br>
      Commercial fruit processors often grind a portion of shell pits
      for use in commercial sand blasting as a soft grit. As an ARS
      research agronomist, Forcella believed organic grit might be an
      effective weed killer. His determination to break from convention
      has resulted in a four-row grit blaster capable of obliterating
      weeds.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, Forcella bought a cheap, handheld sandblaster and
      hooked it to an air compressor at the North Central Soil
      Conservation Research Lab in Morris, Minn. He tested grit on
      greenhouse seedlings and found a split-second blast destroyed the
      weeds. Next, he purchased a bigger blaster, mounted it on an ATV,
      and switched to corn cob grit. Driving down rows and manually
      gunning down weeds, Forcella knew the system had potential. He
      wrote a funding proposal for a larger machine and was approved for
      a Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) grant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>High-Velocity Fertilizer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dan Humburg, an ag engineer at South Dakota State University, and
      grad student Corey Lanoue built the tractor-hauled grit
      applicator. “Typically, when you’re sandblasting, operations are
      very power hungry. Trying to find the optimum balance between the
      application rate and still satisfy the farmer was difficult. We
      tried to maximize efficiency and ultimately that’s turning
      compressed air into abrasive velocity,” says Lanoue, currently a
      design engineer with Vermeer.<br>
      <br>
      With four rows and eight nozzles firing grit at 100 lbs. per
      square inch, Forcella runs the system through corn field plots
      twice every season, each nozzle blasting a 4” band. (First, when
      corn is 4-6” high at the 1- to 3-leaf stage. Second, when corn is
      1’ tall at the 5-leaf stage.) His field trials have shown 80% to
      90% season-long weed control. In addition, Forcella has
      successfully tested a weed-and-feed method for organic growers,
      using cottonseed and canola seed meal. Essentially, he’s killing
      weeds by spraying high-velocity fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      What about crop damage? “One of the things we were worried about
      was disease. Make a hole in a crop plant, and open a door to crop
      disease. However, there are no problems because the crops aren’t
      hurt at all. The grit is aimed at the base of the corn plants and
      nails the small weeds. Weeds must be below a couple of inches or
      the system won’t work,” Forcella notes.<br>
      <br>
      When a broadleaf weed – such as Palmer amaranth – is hit with
      grit, the stem is severed and the root cannot regrow. The root
      system withers due to a lack of photosynthesis. However, when
      grasses germinate, the growing point is still below the surface.
      Blasting grit will eliminate the leaves, but the grass continues
      growing. Specific grasses must be hit at least twice to kill them,
      according to Forcella. “We’re going over twice anyway to
      compensate for early-germinating and late-germinating broadleaf
      weeds.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pigweed Slayer</b><b><br>

      Forcella’s grit applicator has gained attention from Sam Wortman,
      a weed scientist with the University of Illinois Department of
      Crop Sciences. Wortman is working with South Dakota State
      University to build a device specifically for vegetable crops on a
      commercial scale. Manuel Perez, with the Department of
      Agroforestry Engineering at the University of Seville in Spain, is
      designing a grit-blasting system with robotics for application in
      olive orchards and vineyards.<br>
      <br>
      Costs to run the grit applicator system range from $50-$100 per
      acre due to diesel and grit expenses. “A conventional grower
      doesn’t want to spend over $50 per acre for weed control, but
      that’s pretty good for an organic grower,” Forcella says. However,
      he notes changes in agriculture may open the conventional door to
      the weed blaster, particularly the spread of herbicide-resistant
      Palmer amaranth. “Palmer continues to creep upwards. When I see
      pictures from the South of workers chopping Palmer and throwing it
      in carts, it looks like images from 100 years back. In situations
      where there are no reliable alternatives, a grit applicator could
      work for a conventional farmer.”<br>
      <br>
      From apricot pit to grit applicator, Forcella has found success.
      “As a weed scientist, I wondered if you could kill weeds with
      grit. On its face, it’s certainly a crazy idea, but I couldn’t
      shake the thought. This is still small-scale, but it works.”<br>

          control weeds</b><br>

      The unlikely hobby of growing apricots in Minnesota may have led a
      research agronomist to a new way to control in-row weeds on
      organic farms: blasting them away.<br>
      <br>
      Frank Forcella works for the USDA North Central Soil Conservation
      Research Laboratory in Morris, Minn. He and his wife, Jessica,
      have been growing apricots since 1991. In 2007 they had a very
      productive year, and Forcella wanted to find a way to use the pits
      left over from making jams and dried fruit instead of letting them
      go to waste.<br>
      <br>
      A little online research taught him that ground shells of apricot
      pits are used in “sandblasting.” In fact, many modern sandblasting
      techniques use plant-based products. He was discussing this with
      Dean Peterson when both men had the same idea of sandblasting
      weeds.<br>
      <br>
      He and Peterson spent about $50 on a handheld sandblaster,
      connected it to an air compressor and started testing it in the
      greenhouse. “We’d have corn and weeds growing in a pot and we
      learned right away that we could knock down the weeds and the corn
      would be okay. We repeated the experiment many times and had
      reasonably good success,” he said. When aimed at the bases of crop
      plants growing in rows, the propelled grit kills weed seedlings
      through abrasion.<br>
      <br>
      To test the method on corn growing in the field, they bought a
      bigger sandblasting unit, and hauled the air compressor around on
      an ATV. “We learned if we made two or three passes at the right
      times we could get full-season weed control,” Forcella recalled.<br>
      <br>
      Researcher Frank Forcella applies abrasive grit to corn rows using
      an air compresser hauled by a graduate student on an ATV. Forcella
      found that just two to three passes at strategic times provided
      full-season weed control. <br>
      <br>
      Forcella admits he is not “mechanically astute.” So when it came
      time to build a prototype of a larger unit he needed help. He
      applied for and received a grant from the North Central
      Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (NC-SARE) for an
      “Air-Propelled Abrasive Grit Management” (PAGMan) system.<br>
      <br>
      Forcella said it took a little while to find someone who was an
      expert ag engineer who worked with steel, but they were fortunate
      to find Dan Humberg, a professor of ag engineering at South Dakota
      State University (SDSU).<br>
      <br>
      SDSU graduate student Cory Lanoue took an interest in the project
      and started working on it with CAD (computer aided design)
      software. Then, using the design he developed over nearly a year,
      he and fellow grad students, under the supervision of Humberg, put
      together their abrasive grit applicator machine in about two
      months.<br>
      <br>
      “It was an impressive feat in my eyes,” said Forcella. “Cory did a
      fantastic job.”<br>
      <br>
      They developed PAGMan “for selective, post-emergence, in-row weed
      control in corn, soybean, and other crops that are grown in widely
      spaced rows.”<br>
      <br>
      The 2013 and 2014 growing seasons were their first using the
      four-row, eight-nozzle unit. Forcella admitted that the unit may
      seem small to many of today’s large-scale farmers, but the size is
      realistic for a family organic farm.<br>
      <br>
      The field tests were performed on organically certified land at
      the West Central Research and Outreach Center of the University of
      Minnesota. These experiments are being led by SDSU graduate
      student Mauricio Erazo-Barradas under the direction of Sharon
      Clay, a weed scientist.<br>
      <br>
      The idea is that farmers will clear weeds from between crop rows
      like they traditionally have for years with inter-row cultivation,
      flaming or mowing, but they will use the sandblasting method to
      kill the weeds next to the corn plants. The field tests include
      all of these treatments.<br>
      <br>
      Ground corn cobs make an effective grit for “sandblasting” weeds.
      Any gritty material that is about 0.5mm works with the PAGMan
      system.<br>
      <br>
      “I think of using abrasive grit for weeds as one more tool in the
      toolbox for controlling weeds,” Forcella said. “It’s not the only
      tool—you need lot of them—but this definitely can be one more tool
      for organic producers to use.”<br>
      <br>
      Through their trials, they learned that the system works best when
      the nozzles are about two feet from the plants using air pressure
      of 70 to 100 psi. If the nozzles are too far away or the pressure
      too light it doesn’t kill the weeds. If the nozzles are too close
      or there’s too much pressure, it can damage the corn.<br>
      <br>
      Forcella said they have been focusing on the control of the most
      common annual weeds, such as lambsquarters, pigweed, and foxtail
      (Chenopodium album, Amaranthus retroflexus, and Setaria viridis),
      which are common throughout the nation and especially abundant in
      the Corn Belt.<br>
      <br>
      “Timing is crucial,” Forcella said, and the weeds must be
      seedlings no more than two or three inches tall. The two necessary
      times to blast the weeds are once at the 1-leaf stage of the corn
      (4-6 inches) and again at the 3-leaf to 5-leaf stage (about 8-12
      inches) in order to provide season-long weed control. This also
      maintains corn yields comparable to those in weed-free crops.<br>
      <br>
      Using sandblasting along with cultivation offers 80 to 90 percent
      weed control, which Forcella described as “quite reasonable,
      especially for organic production.” Weed control at 80 to 90
      percent is enough to prevent yield loss in field corn. A weedy
      corn field can easily lose 20 to 50 percent yield.<br>
      <br>
      Although blasting works well with annual broadleaf weeds, it is
      not as effective with seedlings of grassy weeds because their
      growing points are below ground. When foxtail is the most common
      weed, three applications may be needed for good control; at the
      1-leaf, 3-leaf, and 5-leaf stages of corn. The system likely will
      not be effective on perennials, as these weeds are simply too
      tough-stemmed, and they tend to have large root reserves, which
      allows them to sprout continuously.<br>
      <br>
      Forcella and his colleagues have tried many different types of
      abrasive grit: walnut shells, ground up corn cobs and even plain
      sand. “As long as it’s the right size (about 0.5 mm) and gritty,
      it will work,” he said. Most of their experiments have been done
      with corn cob grit because it is inexpensive and readily
      available.<br>
      <br>
      When they presented the idea to organic producers, they quickly
      realized it was more likely to be adopted if the applicator could
      be doing “double duty” when moving across the field. Luckily,
      Forcella said, many nitrogen-rich organic fertilizers have a
      gritty texture as well. They started experimenting with corn
      gluten meal, alfalfa meal, cotton seed meal, canola seed meal and
      even lime to neutralize acidic soil. “All the grits work equally
      well to control small weed seedlings,” he said. Their planned
      trials include looking at how and when the plants uptake nitrogen
      after gritty organic fertilizers are applied to control weeds.<br>
      <br>
      Other upcoming trials will include determining what type of nozzle
      and spray pattern work best and looking at how the idea can be
      applied to organic vegetable production.<br>
      <br>
      The project has taken on an international angle as well. For
      several years Forcella has collaborated with a weed scientist,
      Professor Jose Urbano, from the University of Seville (UdS) in
      Spain. One of Urbano’s colleagues at UdS, Manuel Perez Ruiz, is an
      ag engineer. He was interested in the concept as well and secured
      funding from his government to determine how to apply the idea to
      olive orchards and vineyards. His group is investigating how to
      integrate GPS and robotic technology with the PAGMan system. This
      new work is in collaboration with Professor David Slaughter at the
      University of California-Davis and the USDA-Agricultural Research
      Service.<br>

      post-emergence, in-row weed control for corn, soybean, and other
      crops grown in widely spaced rows. Photo by USDA-ARS<br>
      <br>
      One of the drawbacks of the system thus far is that the unit needs
      to move at a rather slow speed, about one to one-and-a-half miles
      per hour, so it is time-consuming. Forcella explained that
      maintaining the diligence needed to drive at a very slow speed and
      staying aligned as to not damage the corn plants is difficult. GPS
      and robotic technology could help eliminate this drawback for the
      farmer.<br>
      <br>
      Still others are working to help make this project come together.
      Sam Wortman at the University of Illinois recently was awarded a
      grant from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s
      Organic Research and Extension Initiative. This new project will
      extend the technology to organic vegetable production. The
      aforementioned researchers at SDSU and USDA-ARS will collaborate
      on this venture.<br>
      <br>
      Forcella said as a public employee working on a project like this
      he has no interest in trying to patent the idea. Since the idea
      has already been shared with so many others, the overall concept
      may not even be patentable at this point, but smaller things such
      as the nozzle design could be.<br>
      <br>
      Even though the idea may not be patented in the future, the unit
      is not something that could easily be built by someone on their
      own, he added. Forcella and his colleagues hope that a larger
      equipment company, a few of which have expressed interest, will
      decide to build and market the unit. He hopes the unit will be
      commercially available within the next five years.<br>
