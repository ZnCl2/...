              more importance.<br>
              <br>

              <br>
              <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The invention has for its object to provide a spring
              pendulum to determine the physical conditions (energy
              flow, energy distribution) in the art of dowsing, which
              has a long life with maximum sensitivity and
              reproducibility, against disturbing local magnetic fields
              is insensitive and a high degree of maneuverability both
              in transport ensured at rest as in the handling during
              operation.<br>
              <br>
              The unit should be kept as small as possible in the
              dimensions to require little space during transport and to
              carry out measurements in the confined space area with
              sufficient accuracy in operating condition.<br>
              <br>
              This object is achieved in that the above-mentioned test,
              the spring element is longitudinally arranged tightly
              fitting slidable in the sleeve and that it is held in a
              radial position in the extended state in a substantially
              acting as a soft elastic fixed stock of rubber or
              plastics, and that the mass member of a ball of a
              non-magnetic material is.<br>
              <br>
              The invention is described by the following, explained in
              more detail by Figures embodiments.<br>
              <br>
              In the drawings:<br>
              <br>
              1 shows a longitudinal section through a first embodiment
              of the pendulum with an elastic clamping of the spring
              element at one end,<br>
              <br>
              2 shows a longitudinal section through a second embodiment
              of the pendulum with an elastic clamping of the spring
              member in a slidable piston.<br>
              <br>
              1 shows a longitudinal section through a first embodiment
              of the pendulum with an elastic clamping of the spring
              element at one end. 1, serving as a handle sleeve and the
              protective tube made of a nonmagnetic stainless steel
              material, in this case from a corrosion-resistant
              austenitic Cr / Ni-steel. 2 illustrates a stopper formed
              as a rotational body made of a plastic<br>
              <br>
              In this case, nylon is selected.<br>
              <br>
              The plug 2 is the use of 3, preferably made of brass. 4 is
              a pull spring element in the form of a non-magnetic, bent
              at its inner end metal wire: spring hard, cold-worked
              austenitic Cr / Ni steel.<br>
              <br>
              The fixed end of the spring element 4, non-magnetic mass
              element 5 has the form of a metal ball, in this case also
              consists of Cr / Ni-steel. 6 is the other end of the
              sleeve 1 final gland (polyamide) comprising the bearing 7
              (elastic clamping) for the spring member 4 in the form of
              a rotation body concentric.<br>
              <br>
              This camp consists of 7 natural rubber a certain hardness
              and thus sets the arm span of the spring element 4 in the
              working position against fixed (rigid) clamping down
              considerably.<br>
              <br>
              The elasticity of the pendulum will be increased
              considerably.<br>
              <br>
              The bearing 7 is provided on its inner face with a stop
              (catch) 8th<br>
              <br>
              This is in this case made of brass.<br>
              <br>
              The stop plate is to ensure that the bent end of the
              spring element 4 does not dig into the working position in
              the comparatively soft bearing 7.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 2 refers to a longitudinal section through a second
              embodiment of the pendulum with an elastic clamping of the
              spring member in a slidable piston.<br>

              consisting of a cold-drawn blank tube of 18 mm outer
              diameter, 17 mm inner diameter, 0.5 mm wall thickness and
              180 mm length.<br>
              <br>
              The material was a non-magnetic corrosion-resistant steel
              with the material number nac 14 301 DIN (German standard).<br>
              <br>
              Both the plug 2, as 6 is a stuffing box for the plastic

              steel of the same composition as in Example I. The plug 2
              of plastic was virtually identical with that of Example 1<br>
              <br>
              The same was true for the stuffing box 6 with the
              difference that this was not provided for the inclusion of
              an additional component, but only a central hole of 5 mm
              in diameter for the passage of the spring element 4 had.<br>

              slightly larger central hole of 5 mm diameter for
              receiving the cylindrical mounting member 9.<br>

              Various clocks that occur are all characterized by the

              on our environment.<br>
              <br>
              Only events beyond control and to any extent, and as
              rotations or oscillations are visible, but not measurable
              or comparable to the operator or witnesses of a search.<br>
              This gives rise, despite some successes, to endless and
              fruitless controversy because these clocks are inert.<br>

              The object of the present invention overcomes these

            <br>
            <div align="left"> I, JEAN BORGNI, a French citizen of 4 Rue
              Xavier de Maistre, 06100 Nice, France, a French citizen,
              do hereby declare the invention, for which I pray that a
              patent may be granted to me, and the method by which it is
              to be performed, to be particularly described in and by
              the following statement:<br>
              <br>
              The invention relates to pendulums used in the various
              areas of radiesthesia: water divining, finding creatures
              (living or dead) and articles, and medical and
              parapsychological investigations. Various improvements
              have been made to inert pendulums of all kinds. In
              particular, some have been equipped with means for
              amplifying the waves received, so eliminating regrettable
              errors. However, the amplification is not selective, and
              this causes difficulties for the operator.<br>
              <br>
              To overcome these disadvantages the invention proposes
              that every device, with or without amplifying means,
              should be preceded by a sensor tuned to a frequency band
              encompassing the frequency of the subject of the
              investigations. This sensor, or antenna or scanner is
              followed by a conventional detecting device which can
              generally be followed by two electronic amplification
              stages comprising field effect transistors, as found
              commercially. The sensor will be set to select between 500
              and 600 MHz. In this way the user of the pendulum receives
              not a confused mass of signals, but only those relevant to
              his investigation.<br>
              <br>
              Thus according to the present invention there is provided
              a pendulum capable of detecting very small electric
              currents and adapted for use in radiesthesia or
              waterdivining, which comprises a pendulum bob and a thread
              or wire by means of which the pendulum bob is adapted to
              be suspended, characterised in that the pendulum bob
              contains an electronic circuit capable of selectively
              detecting radiation in which the bob is suspended thus to
              increase the discrimination of the pendulum, said circuit
              comprising a turned detector circuit adapted to detect
              radiation in the 500 to 600 MHz, followed by an amplifier
              stage.<br>
              <br>
              A device embodying the invention will now be described, by
              way of example, with reference to the accompanying
              drawings.<br>

              A cavity or shell A in the bottom of the pendulum houses
              the battery B, for reasons of gravitational balance. The
              upper body part C of the pendulum contains an entry at the
              top for a suspending thread or wire D, which effects
              operation of a switch E (not shown in Fig 2) so that the
              battery does not supply current unless the pendulum is
              suspended, which connects F, G. The tuned detector-sensor
              assembly is shown installed at H but the miniaturised
              circuit (Fig 2) cannot be shown in the sectional drawing
              (Fig 1).<br>
              <br>
              The detector-sensor assembly H comprises a circuit
              arrangement of a sensor coil S, capacitors C1, C2, C3, C4,
              resistors R1, R2, R3, R4, field effect transistor T and
              diodes D1, D2, connected as shown in Fig 2 and tuned to
              the desired selection frequency in the range 500 to 600
              MHz.<br>
              <br>
              The sensor coil S may be subject to the effect of the
              earth's magnetic field only, but alternatively a
              controllable influence may be exerted by means of a
              diamagnetic mass or body I. The drawing does not show the
              amplifying means, if any, since this may be conventional;
              in one such embodiment a system employing two field effect
              transistor stages is employed for amplification purposes.<br>

              The invention can be applied wherever conventional
              pendulums are used, and it replaces these in a remarkable
              fashion, eliminating errors in the interpretation of
              signals.<br>

            <div align="left"> I, DOUGLAS WALTER ATKINSON, a British
              Subject, of " Hildaslea," Angmering, Sussex, do hereby
              declare the nature of this invention to be as follows:<br>
              In the study and practice of Radiesthesia, which is based
              on observation of effects produced by radiant energy
              emitted by the human body, various forms of apparatus have
              been used to locate physiological defects, diseased
              tissue, to determine the general state or health, and so
              on of patients under observation.<br>
              <br>
              One particular appliance which is used in this field is
              known as the Turenne Rule and comprises a linear scale
              which is marked at intervals representing critical
              wave-lengths of radiant energy corresponding to different
              physiological components or groups of organs of the human
              body. A similar appliance has been evolved by Lesourd for
              the same purpose.<br>
              <br>
              An object of this invention is to provide a new or
              improved apparatus for visually reproducing the effects of
              the radiant energy of the various parts of the body, my
              invention being based on the discovery that the
              wave-length of this energy has some relationship to the
              effect produced on a beam of light by a sample of blood or
              other matter taken from the patient's body.<br>
              <br>
              The apparatus according to this invention comprises a
              projection surface or plate of frosted glass or other
              rigid material etched or otherwise marked with divisions
              or other markings corresponding to the Turenne or Lesourd
              Rule, a light source mounted for producing a beam whose
              axis is transverse to the plane of said plate, a crystal
              prism arranged in front of said light source and adapted
              to break up the beam therefrom and project its spectrum on
              to said plate, an aperture-provided screen between said
              light source and prism, and a holder for the introduction
              of one or more slides into the path of the beam from said
              light source to the prism.<br>
              <br>
              The light source may be an electric lamp bulb or other
              suitable element and is preferably arranged within a
              closed housing, the light being able to pass out from this
              housing through a quartz rod which serves to direct a
              pencil of light, provided with an ultra violet component,
              in the required direction towards the prism.<br>
              <br>
              To enable the light beam, which is refracted by passage
              through the prism, to register with the desired range of
              the projection surface, the housing and/or the quartz rod
              thereof may be mounted so as to be angularly movable to
              vary the angle which the light pencil emergent therefrom
              initially makes with the projection surface.
              Alternatively, or in addition, the prism itself may be
              mounted in the apparatus so as to be rotatable for
              adjusting the position of the refracted beam in relation
              to the projection surface. Again, the prism and/or the
              light source may be mounted for movement towards or away
              from one another.<br>
              <br>
              With these aids, the parts can be adjusted until the
              correct "focus') on the projection surface is obtained,
              with the visible spectrum extending between the Turenne
              markings 5 to 80. Suitable clamping devices are provided
              for securing the parts in their appropriately-adjusted
              positions.<br>
              <br>
              The screen between the light source and prism is
              preferably provided with a narrow slot for the passage of
              light rays, and this screen can also be adjustable to
              compensate for adjustment of the light source or prism<br>
              <br>
              The holder previously referred to prefer ably is in the
              form of a frame, e.g., of rectangular shape, furnished
              with perimetrical grooves for receiving and retaining one
              or more slides.<br>
              <br>
              The whole apparatus is preferably so arranged that the
              projection plate is horizontally-disposed, the operator
              then observing this plate from above, i.e., from the
              opposite side from the light-source and prism. With such
              an arrangement, the use of material such as frosted glass
              is preferred for the plate, the markings being made on the
              upper side of the plate. It will be apparent, however,
              that other arrangements- are possible within the scope of
              this invention, and that the light source and prism could
              be located above the plate, or the plate could be disposed
              with its projection surface in a vertical plane.<br>
              <br>
              In using the apparatus described, a sample of the
              patient's blood or other matter, e.g., urine is placed
              between the two slides and these are then inserted in the
              holder so as to be at right angles to the light beam from
              the sourer. This produces a characteristic change in the
              spectrum indicated on the projection surface or plate and
              provides useful medical evidence.<br>
              <br>
              The apparatus which I have devised can be used on its own
              for observation or testing purposes, or can be combined
              with other apparatus at present in use in Radiesthesia;
              for instance it may be incorporated with electronic
              apparatus, used in Radiesthesia, for example, the
              so-called Drown or Delawarr apparatus.<br>
              <br>
              <b>SPECIFICATION</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              In the study and practice of Radiesthesia, which is based
              on observation of effects produced by radiant energy
              emitted by the human body and other forms of matter,
              various forms of apparatus have been used to indicate
              physiological conditions, diseased tissue, to determine
              the general state of health, and so on of patients under
              observation.<br>
              <br>
              One particular appliance which is used in this field is
              known as the Turenne Rule and comprises a linear scale
              which is marked at intervals representing critical
              wave-lengths of such radiant energy, see for example page
              113 of "Les mineraux, Les andes des formes geometriques,
              etc.," by Turenne, 1935 Edition. Similar appliances have
              been evolved by Lesourd (see e.g., page 44 of "Vie
              Maladies Radiations," by G. Lesourd, 1937 Edition) and by
              others for the same purpose. These rules are generally
              used in conjunction with a swinging pendulum for carrying
              out the requisite tests.<br>
              <br>
              An object of this invention is to provide a new or
              improved apparatus for indicating the radiant energy of
              the various parts of the body, my invention being based on
              the discovery that the wave-length of this energy has some
              relationship to the effect produced on a beam of light by
              a sample of blood or other matter taken from the patient's
              body.<br>
              <br>
              The apparatus according to this invention comprises a
              projection surface, e.g., a plate, of frosted glass or
              other rigid material which is etched or otherwise
              furnished with divisions or other markings corresponding
              to the Turenne, Lesourd, or other Rules used in
              Radiesthesia, a light source, means for directing a light
              beam, from said source, in a direction inclined to the
              plane of said surface, an optical system arranged in the
              path of said light beam and adapted to break the latter up
              and project its spectrum on said surface, an
              aperture-provided screen associated with said optiCal
              system, and a holder for the introduction of one or more
              slides into the path of the ~ light beam, whereby the
              latter, after passage through said slide or slides and
              said optical system, will be projected on to said surface.<br>
              <br>
              The light source may be an electric lamp bulb or other
              suitable element and is preferably arranged within a
              closed housing which prohibits the issuance of light
              except through a quartz rod which serves to direct a
              pencil of light, provided with an ultra violet component,
              in the required direction towards the optical system.<br>
              <br>
              The optical system will be appropriately constructed so
              that the light beam, after dispersion by the system, will
              register with the desired range of the projection surface.
              To this end the system will comprise a plurality of
              crystal prisms. The housing and/or the quartz rod thereof
              may be mounted for adjustment to vary the distance between
              the housing and the optical system.<br>
              <br>
              The aperture in the screen between the light source and
              prism is preferably in the form of a slot of adjustable
              width for the passage of the light rays.<br>
              <br>
              The holder can also be adjustable to compensate for
              adjustment of the light source and permit correct focusing
              of the light beam on the projection surface.<br>
              <br>
              Parts of one form of apparatus according to the present
              invention are diagammatically illustrated in side view in
              the single figure of the accompanying drawing.<br>
              <br>
              In this drawing, 1 denotes a plate of frosted glass
              representing the projection surface. This plate 1 is
              horizontally disposed in a casing which, for convenience,
              has not been illustrated, and the plate is provided on its
              upper surface with graduated, etched markings
              corresponding to those on the Turenne Rule. These markings
              are actually furnished on the horizontal upper surface of
              the plate 1.<br>
              <br>
              The light source consists of an electric lamb bulb 2
              mounted in a socket 3 which is connected to a source of
              current in conventional fashion. The lamp 2 is arranged in
              a housing 4 of rectangular prismatic form the walls of
              which are closed and coated with darkening material so as
              to prohibit the emergence of light, except through a
              quartz rod 5 which passes through the front wall of tile
              housing. The rod 5 is so directed that the light pencil
              which issues from this rod has its axis directed obliquely
              to the plane of the plate 1. Mounted next to the housing 4
              is a holder 8 having a peripheral channel 9 for receiving
              and locating a pair of quartz glass plates or slides 10
              between which the sample to be tested is smeared.<br>
              <br>
              After passage through the plates 10, the light pencil
              reaches an optical system 11 which serves to disperse the
              beam and cast it on to the under surface of the plate 1.<br>
              <br>
              The system 11 is provided with a support 12 which also
              carries a pair of shutters or slides 7 which are mounted
              on the support 12 for movement towards or away from each
              other to vary the width of a slot 6 between them. This
              permits adjustment of the width of the light beam reaching
              the optical system 11.<br>
              <br>
              The optical system 11 is diagrammatically shown as
              comprising three quartz prisms 13, 14 and 15, these being
              so selected and arranged that the light beam, after
              refraction and dispersion by the passage therethrough,
              will be projected on to the plate 1 over the appropriate
              range. In the visible spectrum, this will extend from the
              marking 13, representing red, to the markings 78 to 80.
              representing the violet component.<br>
              <br>
              To assist in the initial " focusing," provision is made
              for adjustment of the respective distances apart of the
              optical system 11, the holder 8, and the housing 4 and its
              quartz rod 5. To these several ends, set screws 16 passing
              through slots 17 in flanges 18 and 19, on the holder 8 and
              the housing 4 respectively, permit adjustment of these
              components of the apparatus in the direction of the light
              beam.<br>
              <br>
              With these aids, the components can be adjusted until the
              correct " focus " on the projection surface is obtained,
              with the visible spectrum extending between the Turenne
              markings 5 to 80.<br>
              <br>
              As indicated by the drawing, the whole apparatus is
              preferably so arranged that the projection plate 1 is
              horizontally-disposed, the operator then observing this
              plate from above, i.e. from the opposite side from the
              light-source and prism. It will be apparent, however, that
              other arrangements are possible within the scope of this
              invention, and that the light source and prism could be
              located abore the plate, or the plate could be disposed
              with its projection surface in a vertical plane.<br>
              <br>
              In using the apparatus described, a sample of the
              patient's blood or other matter, e.g. urine, is placed
              between the two slides 10 and these are then inserted in
              tile holder S so as to be at right angles to the light
              beam from the source. This produces a characteristic
              change in the spectrum indicated on the projection plate 1
              and provides useful medical evidence.<br>
              <br>
              The apparatus which I have devised can be used on its own
              for observation or testing purposes, or can be combined
              will other apparatus at present in use in Radiesthesia :
              for instance it may be incorporated with electronic
              apparatus used in Radiesthesia, for example the so-called
              Drown apparatus (see British Patent No. 515,S66). Again
              the apparatus can be used in conjunction with the pendulum
              testing method.<br>

              <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              [0001] The present invention relates to a device for
              shielding from radiation, especially of interference with
              the features stated in the preamble of the protective
              claim 1.<br>
              <br>
              [0002] Under the technical term "interference" refers
              mainly physically not properly measurable, possibly
              biological effects causing radiation, such as the
              emanations of geodetic areas of irritation, power lines,
              water lines, metal deposits, oil deposits, electronic or
              electrical devices, equipment and machinery as well as all
              other detectable radiation of diviners.<br>
              <br>
              [0003] These detectable by diviners and dowsers radiation
              can possibly exert adverse effects on human or animal
              organisms or organisms.<br>
              <br>
              [0004] From the Austrian Patent <b>AT 397 346 B</b> is an
              arrangement for protection against terrestrial radiation
              and to shield earth radiation emerges.<br>
              <br>
              [0005] This known arrangement for screening earth
              radiation comprises a coil having one end connected to an
              outlet of the ground line is connected, while the other
              end is connected through an intermediate metal foil, for
              example, on the wall or the floor to the ground potential.<br>
              <br>
              [0006] This known device for screening of terrestrial
              radiation is therefore particularly disadvantageous
              because they contact the ground wire to an electrical
              outlet requires a life-threatening manipulating a socket
              and their use is therefore dangerous, inconvenient and
              associated with a considerable design effort and
              craftsmanship.<br>
              <br>
              [0007] The Austrian Patent <b>AT 409 930 B</b> discloses
              a system for manipulation of the metal films, the
              influence of this arrangement with metal foils are used to
              shield from EMI.<br>
              <br>
              [0008] This from the Austrian Patent AT 409 930 B known
              arrangement also includes a coil, one end of which is
              connected to the ground wire in a socket connection and is
              spaced only slightly from the neutral conductor and phase
              of this outlet.<br>
              <br>
              [0009] The other end of the coil is connected there to a
              metal foil which is the other side to a container of
              "right-handed" water connection.<br>
              <br>
              [0010] [By "right-handed water" is there understood the
              technical term used by rod-goers and sensitive people.
              "Right Turn water" occurs in nature and can be identified
              by diviners and dowsers.<br>
              <br>
              [0011] The coil and the dextrorotatory water appear there
              at least three hours to the intermediate metal foil and
              metal foil are like this, the suppressive or the
              interference-suppressing properties lend.<br>
              <br>
              [0012] This from the Austrian Patent AT 409 930 B known
              device is also already so extremely disadvantageous
              because it making contact with the ground wire an
              electrical outlet requires a life-threatening manipulating
              an AC outlet and their use is therefore dangerous,
              complicated and with a considerable design and
              craftsmanship effort.<br>
              <br>
              [0013] The object of the present invention is therefore to
              provide a device for shielding from radiation, especially
              by diviners and dowsers detectable interference, which
              does not require a lethal tampering with an electrical
              outlet whose use is fast, simple and completely harmless
              and also people without knowledge in the field of
              Electrical and without distinctive craftsmanship is open
              and which is not associated with a distinct design effort
              and also has radiesthetically detectable, excellent
              anti-jamming or interference-suppressing properties, thus
              reducing the effects of interference on humans and / or
              animals be minimized or turned off, and where such
              protection is particularly intense and very long lasting.<br>
              <br>
              [0014] According to the invention this object is achieved
              by a generic device by the features specified in the
              characterizing part of the protective claim 1.<br>
              <br>
              [0015] Particularly preferred embodiments are the subject
              matter of the dependent claims.<br>
              <br>
              [0016] As a rule, the inventive device for shielding
              radiation from a two-or multi-layer sheet, foil, film or
              plate-like structure.<br>
              <br>
              [0017] Each individual layer can be, for example,
              synthetic rubber or natural rubber or latex or rubber, or
              mixtures thereof.<br>
              <br>
              [0018] Preferably, for each individual layer is a layer
              stretching.<br>
              <br>
              [0019] The stretch film may for example be stretched
              before its connection with its vertically adjacent single
              layer in one or more directions in the range of 5 to 40%
              of its length uniaxially, biaxially or multi-axially,
              preferably in the range of 7% to 30% of their length, in
              particular in the range of 8% to 25% of its length.<br>
              <br>
              [0020] In general, the apparatus of the invention for
              shielding is formed such that the individual layers for a
              period ranging from 0.1 hours to 2.5 hours, preferably in
              the range of 0.2 hours to 2.0 hours, in particular in
              range of from 0.3 hours to 1.5 hours have undergone
              stretching.<br>
              <br>
              [0021] The adjacent individual layers may have a right
              angle or an acute angle or an obtuse angle aligned
              stretching directions. Preferably, the stretching
              directions of vertically adjacent individual layers are
              aligned with each other at right angles.<br>
              <br>
              [0022] Alternatively, it may be comprising the inventive
              device for shielding radiation by a stretching apparatus
              in which two or more individual layers which after the
              combination of their individual layers together in one or
              more directions of stretching in the range from 5 to 40%
              of its length monoaxially, biaxially or multiaxially
              undergoes stretching, preferably in the range of 7% to 30%
              of their length, in particular in the range from 8% to 25%
              of its length.<br>
              <br>
              [0023] As a rule, the individual plies of a plurality of,
              multi-layer device according to the invention for
              screening then the stretching, for example for a period in
              the range of 0.1 hours to 2.5 hours, preferably in the
              range of 0.2 hours to 2.0 hours, in particular in the
              range of 0.3 hours to 1.5 hours exposure.<br>
              <br>
              [0024] Also in this case, the stretching directions may be
              perpendicular or at an acute angle or an obtuse angle to
              each other. Preferably, the two or more directions of
              stretching are then aligned substantially perpendicular to
              each other.<br>
              <br>
              [0025] A particular advantage of the inventive device for
              shielding radiation lies in its thinness and the related
              outstanding handling.<br>
              <br>
              [0026] For example, each individual layer has a thickness
              ranging from 0.1 mm to 2.0 mm, preferably in the range of
              0.2 mm to 1.5 mm, in particular from 0.25 mm to 1.0 mm
              having.<br>
              <br>
              [0027] The total thickness of the inventive multi-layer
              device for shielding of radiation, for example in the
              range from 0.3 mm to 5 mm, preferably in the range of 0.4
              mm to 4 mm, in particular from 0.5 mm to 3 mm lie.<br>
              <br>
              [0028] The length and the width of the inventive
              multi-layer device for shielding of radiation, for example
              in the range from 0.5 cm to 3.5 m, preferably in the range
              of 1.0 cm to 3.0 m, in particular from 1.5 cm to 2.5 m
              lie.<br>
              <br>
              [0029] The length and the width of the multilayer device
              according to the invention may be the same or different.<br>
              <br>
              [0030] In particularly preferred embodiments of the
              inventive device for shielding radiation, the nature of
              each individual layer, for example, rubber, an unsaturated
              polymer (polyisoprene) with<br>
              <br>
              [0031] as the repeating units be that (rubber) or is
              present in the cis-1 ,4-configuration, in the trans-1
              ,4-configuration (gutta percha).<br>
              <br>
              [0032] The synthetic rubber which may be included in the
              inventive device for shielding radiation can for example
              be selected from the group of acrylate rubber,
              polyester-urethane rubber, brominated butyl rubber,
              polybutadiene, chlorinated butyl rubber, chlorinated

              [0033] A particular advantage of the inventive multi-layer
              device for shielding radiation is the fact that their
              molecules or molecules of each individual stretch film may
              be longitudinally oriented by drawing in the direction of
              stretching, so that each single layer of the inventive
              multi-layer device or the multi-layer with respect to the
              apparatus itself optionally may come to be reduced or the
              function of a filtering and / or absorbing device for
              eliminating polarization interference.<br>

              dyes, lithopone, titanium dioxide, iron oxides, chromium
              compounds or its compounds or mixtures thereof.<br>
              <br>
              [0035] The two or more individual layers of the inventive
              multilayer device for shielding radiation can be
              irreversibly connected to one another through a
              vulcanization process.<br>
              <br>
              [0036] Alternatively, the two or more individual layers
              can be reversibly releasably connected with each other.<br>
              <br>
              [0037] For this purpose, two or more individual layers can
              be brought reversibly example by Velcro fasteners,
              magnets, buttons, or a zip fastener with each other.<br>

              to filter or even completely shielded against radiation,
              it is preferably detectable by diviners and / or dowsers

              [0044] The inventive multi-layer device for shielding in
              particular interference, for example in the form of a bed
              pad, a covering for a housing of an electronic or

              <b> </b><br>
              The invention relates to methods and apparatus for the
              transformation of fluids, especially water. Fluids so
              transformed may be used as part of a treatment or
              prophylaxis regime for a range of disorders.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Background</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The treatment of disease and other malaise in humans, and
              in animals, is complex, and therc are many thcrapeutic
              regimens that prove effective although their mode of
              action is unknown. In some cases, such as homeopathy, the
              results obtained appear to be at odds with established
              scientific principles. It is undoubted that many patients
              value the effect that homeopathic treatments have on their
              conditions, and it is demonstrable that homeopathy is
              practiced by many scientifically-qualified medical
              practitioners as an adjunct to their more conventional (in
              the context of developed Western Medicine) treatments. The
              prevailing view amongst the established scientific
              community is that any benefits of such treatment must be
              the result of a placebo effect. Other commentators posit
              alternative explanations, e.g. based upon hitherto unknown
              properties of water.<br>
              <br>
              Whatever the truth about these treatments may turn out to
              be, such interventions are widely practiced, not only by
              independent practitioners, but also by national heath
              services in many countries, including the National Health
              Service in the United Kingdom.<br>
              <br>
              A body of expertise has been developed over the years, and
              methodologies for the practice of the therapy and the
              production of the therapeutic materials used are well
              developed, documented and repeatable.<br>
              <br>
              Within the context of conventional Western medicine also,
              there are drugs in common usage whose mechanism of action
              is unknown, and many whose efficacy is still a matter of
              debate, but which nonetheless find widespread usage.<br>
              <br>
              There are also many methodologies (both in the healthcare
              context and elsewhett) undertaken by practitioners who
              seem to posscss a desirable capability, but which othcr
              people find hard, if not impossible, to master. Such
              people may be described as gifted, talented, or merely
              skilled; but whatever the words chosen they, and others
              like them, Is appear to be able to perform tasks that
              others cannot.<br>

              The inventor has a desire to both protect and share the
              present invention with the world.<br>

              a way which will enable reproduction by others skilled in
              the relevant art. Apparatus used in the method will also
              be described that can be readily reproduced. Water
              transfbmied by the methods and apparatus described herein

              <br>
              <b>Description of Prcfcrred Embodimcnts</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The invention has its origin in a discovery by the
              inventor that there are regions in the world where an
              unexpected dowsing response maybe obtained, having the
              form of an elliptical shape on the ground. Dowsing is a
              skill that has been practiced over many years, and has
              found application in many fields including, and perhaps
              most common in the public perception, the discovery of
              water sources. However, dowsing (a form of divination)
              may, by concentration of the dowser, be used to answer
              other questions as well as thosc relating to the prescncc
              or absence of water.<br>
              <br>
              Practitioners of the art will have their own techniques
              and apparatus, often in the form of a pcndulum whosc
              swinging motion providcs the rcsponsc to the concentration
              poscd by the dowsing practitioner. For example, a
              clockwise rotation of a pendulim might (for a particular
              practitioner) indicate a positive response (e.g. "yes" to
              concentrated thought), an anticlockwisc motion indicating
              a negative response, and no rotation might indicate that
              there is no response, or the practitioner is not entitled
              to know the thought. Whatever the particular form of
              response, people skilled in the art of dowsing will know
              the response that is appropriate in their own practice,
              and will be able to find these dowsing response fields,
              Indeed, confidential trials carried out by the inventor
              with two other skillod dowsers confirmed that thcy were
              also ablc to detect the dowsing responsc field dcscribcd
              hcrcin.<br>
              <br>
              The inventor believes that the response field is the
              result of a tachyon beam normally striking the Earth.
              Tachyons are believed to be subatomic particles that
              travel faster than light, a property that, of course,
              seems to challenge cunently established views of the
              physical world. However, recent experimental evidence from
              CERN (Organisaiion Européenne pour ía Recherche Nucléaire)
              appears to be consistent with neutrinos travelling faster
              than light, and this is receiving serious scientific
              scrutiny around the world. Whatever the outcome of those
              studies, and whatever the nature of the phenomenon causing
              the dowsing response field, it remains that it may be
              detected by a person ski lied in the art of dowsing. For
              the purpose of this application, we shall refer to the
              phenomenon as being caused by a contribution from a
              tachyon beam interacting with an earth force or forces.
              Should this turn out not to be the causal agent, the
              invention may still be worked as described.<br>
              <br>
              The tachyon beam strikes the surface of the Earth at an
              angle of approximately 51[deg.] to the horizontal. The
              beam itself typically has a circumference of between 8.5
              and 9 inches (ca. 21.6 to 22.9 cm), and results in an
              elliptical dowsing response field approximately S feet
              (ca. 2.4m) across at ground level. In the parlance of
              dowsing, as would be understood by a person skilled in the
              art, the tachyon beam has a positive dowsing response. The
              beam and the ovoid dowsing response field may be detected
              by divination with e.g. a pendulum or rods. A dowser may
              find the response field (and the orientation of the
              tachyon beam) by asking questions about the location of
              the beam perimeter and orientation, and seeking a response
              using their preferred dowsing apparatus.<br>
              <br>
              There is an additional elliptical dowsing response field
              is also associated with a generally vertical beam
              emanating from the Earth. These Earthly beams have a
              negative character.<br>
              <br>
              In some cases, the response field comprises four such
              Earthly beams, one from each of the cardinal points. In
              this case, it is common that the North (and West beams)
              have a positive character, the South (and East beams)
              being negative.<br>
              <br>
              In further instances, the dowsing response field appears
              to be associated with two cosmic rays, one having a
              positive character, the other negative. The inventor has
              determined that the energy of the rays has an equivalence
              of approximately 153 Gd\'. This figure is within the range
              postulated for the mass equivalence of the Higgs Boson
              (having a mass equivalence range of between 115 and 185
              GeV/c2), whose existence and characteristics are yet to be
              confirmed by conventional physics. This correlation might
              be coincidental, but it is nonetheless interesting, and
              might shed some light on the mechanism of action of the
              methods described herein.<br>
              <br>
              The inventor has found that water, placed within a
              receptacle located within the tachyon beam, and orientated
              in a particular way, is transformed over time, typically
              over a period of one to three days. The transformation of
              the water may be detected by a change in the dowsing
              response to the water. The inventor has found that the
              optimum position for the receptacle is approximately 25
              inches (ca. 63.5 cm) from the ground surface. The optimum
              orientation of the receptacle containing the water is to
              orient the major axis of the container at an angle of
              19[deg.] to the tachyon beam, away from the horizontal,
              thereby assuming an orientation of approximately 700 from
              the horizontal. It might be coincidental, but 19[deg.] is
              approximately the value of Kelvin's Wedge, a well known
              phenomenon in fluid dynamics. Whether there is a
              mechanistic effect underlying this association is not
              relevant to the ability to position the container in the
              correct way.<br>
              <br>
              Containers particularly suitable for the transformation
              process arc described herein.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 1 illustrates, in schematic cross-section,
              apparatus particularly suitable for containing fluid (such
              as water) for treatment in a tachyon beam. The apparatus,
              generally indicated by 1, comprises an ovoid receptacle of
              approximately 2.25 litres capacity, and formed
              predominantly of copper, although other volume capacities
              are envisaged. For convenience in manufacturing, the
              container comprises an upper shell 2 and a lower shell 3,
              each having a flange portion 4 miming around the perimeter
              of the open end of the shells 2, 3. The shells may be
              formed by a copper spinning process and clamped together
              using the flanges 4 to form a watertight seal. The walls
              of each shell are approximately 2 mm thick.<br>
              <br>
              In particularly preferred embodiments of the container,
              the inner surface 5 of the shells is coated with a layer
              of silver (not illustrated), for example by
              electroplating.<br>
              <br>
              The container also comprises an inlet valve 6 to allow
              water to be introduced to the interior of the container,
              and an outlet valve 7 to allow treated water to be
              conveniently removed. The inlet valve 6 is located to one
              side, and near the top of the upper shell 2.<br>
              <br>
              The outlet valve 7 is located centrally at the bottom of
              the lower shell 3.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 2 illustrates, again in schematic cross-sectional
              form, the ovoid container of Figure 1 orientated at an
              angle 0 to the vertical. Like components are numbered
              accordingly. The angle 0 is measured between the major
              axis of the ellipse and a vertical datum.<br>
              <br>
              Figure 3 illustrates, again in schematic cross-sectional
              form, apparatus of the present invention located within a
              tachyon beam. Like elements of the apparatus arc
              correspondingly numbered. In the diagram, the tachyon beam
              8 is illustrated schematically by the two dashed lines 9A
              and 9B. The tachyon beam is shown to be orientated at an
              angle of DT to the horizontal ground level 10. The major
              axis 11 of the container is oriented at an angle e to the
              tachyon beam. The inventor has found that the tachyon
              beams generally subtend an angle of 510 to the horizontal
              (i.e. j = 510) optimum value for t, is approximately
              19[deg.], making the angle between the major axis 11 of
              the container and the horizontal 7Ø0 The centre of gravity
              ofthe container is positioned at a height h above ground
              level 10.<br>
              <br>
              An optimum height is approximately 25 inches (cci. 63.5
              cm).<br>
              <br>
              In order to treat water using the method of the invention,
              an elliptical dowsing response field is first detected by
              divination. To avoid erroneous effects, the location
              should be free of electrical interference such as
              oversailing power lines, metal fences, vibrating machinery
              and the like. The correct location is preferably
              determined using sense searching", aided by spinning
              hand-held pendulums, and the concentration of thc dowsing
              practitioner. As an aid to the dowsing practitioner, the
              pertinent locations are where one (or more) cosmic rays
              and Earth Rays coincide to produce a vortex to which they
              all contribute. The term "vortex" is not necessarily to be
              construed in the technical sense of spirally spinning
              fluid, but is more a wave property of the Cosmic and
              Earthly wave combination.<br>
              <br>
              Once the tachyon beam is detected from the elliptical
              dowsing response field, the container is charged with
              water, and suspended within the tachyon beam at the
              required angle. Normal tap water may be used, and this is
              nominally positively charged, as determined by its dowsing
              response. When positioning the container, ferrous metals
              such as iron should be avoided as e.g. support materials.
              For example, no iron nails or fittings should be used.<br>
              <br>
              The "concentration point" of the intersecting beams is
              "captured" within the copper egg-shaped vessel. The shape
              of the container (egg-shaped) confines the parameters of
              the trees and ensures that they are captured to mature.
              The maturing process (i.e. the transformation process)
              takes approximately two and a half days. When matured, the
              water is nominally negatively charged.<br>
              <br>
              Use of the Transformed (Mature' Water Initially, the
              inventor was asked to supply water treated by the method
              and apparatus disclosed herein, referred to hereafter as
              "mature water", to see whether ft might have any Is effect
              on children suffering front diarrhoea, and!br whom no
              other treatment was available. Believing that, at wont,
              the mature water would do no harm to the children, the
              inventor agreed. One teaspoon (cxi. 5m1) of the mature
              water was given to each of 160 children on a daily basis
              in an orphanage in Zambia for whom diarrhoea was endemic.<br>
              <br>
              The dosage had good results with a reduction of around 80%
              in the number of children afflicted, and over the
              subsequent two years there was little occurrence of
              diarrhoea in the orphanage school. Following repositioning
              of the vessel to a more effective location, the remaining
              20% of children suffering from diarrhoea indicated it was
              no longer a problem and that thcir health had improvcd. It
              is believed that the potency of the water from the second
              location is that of 2.1 times.<br>
              <br>
              At a later date time, the headmaster of the school
              contacted the inventor, explaining that he believed he had
              malaria. He was aware of the effect on the incidence of
              diarrhoea, and asked whether he could also take some of
              the water to see whether it had any effect. The inventor
              agreed, and requested to monitor the headmaster's blood
              stream, remotely, using so a dowsing technique. He
              obtained a numerical result from the dowsing activity and
              recorded it. The headmaster took one tablespoon (ca. 15
              ml) of the mature water twice daily. Successive remote
              monitoring the headmaster's blood showed changes in the
              dowsing response and after two days the change in the
              response was particularly apparent.<br>
              <br>
              The inventor contacted the headmaster who told him that he
              had had the best night's sleep for a long time, and that
              he felt much better. The headmaster was very grateful and
              believed that the mature water was the cause ofhis
              recovery.<br>
              <br>
              The headmaster then asked whether he could give some of
              the mature water to a friend, a 66 year old lady, who was
              bedridden, and suffering from FIIV infection. She gave the
              inventor the consent to remotely monitor her by dowsing.
              In order to treat her, water obtained according to a
              further aspect of the invention was used. In this aspect
              it is envisaged that the water in the vessel is
              distributed in like manner to the inside of an egg.<br>
              <br>
              Namely that there is a central volume of more effective
              water, typically around 4.2 times as potent as "normal"
              water, said central volume being surrounded by a layer of
              less potent, typically around 2.1 times as potent as
              "normal" water. Water of desired potency can be extracted
              using a syringe. After three days, the lady was able to
              stand, and after 97 days of treatment her disease appeared
              to be in remission. She consulted her local doctor who
              tested her immune system, and was very surprised by how
              strong it appeared to be.<br>
              <br>
              The remote monitoring results, which monitored "excess
              positive ions", during this initial study showed the
              readings to be descending in a form closely resembling a
              logarithmic curve.<br>
              <br>
              This is clearly not a controlled study, but prompted the
              inventor to allow further subjects with HIV infection to
              take the water. Again, the inventor had no reason to
              believe that the mature water could do any harm to the
              subjects, and no other medication available to them was
              withheld in the tests.<br>
              <br>
              A number of other subjects took daily doses of the mature
              water, and the state of the blood was again monitored
              remotely by dowsing, on approximately a twice-daily basis.<br>
              <br>
              Results from three of the subjects are presented in
              Figures 4-6. It can be seen that, in all cases, the
              remotely-dowsed state of the blood (presented graphically
              as a percentage excess of positive ions) changed
              dramatically, with the "excess ions" falling progressively
              over a period of approximately 10 days.<br>
              <br>
              The data were collected remotely by dowsing, with no
              contact from the inventor to the subjects, or to the
              person overseeing the study. When collating and analysing
              the data, the inventor was surprised to see, in each case,
              that around six days into the treatment the excess
              positive ions fbr each subject appeared to increase for a
              short while, before returning to a continual decline
              towards a "normal" ionic balance. When this finding was
              related to the person overseeing the study, he revealed
              that that corresponded to a period when they had run out
              of the mature water, and so the treatment had been briefly
              suspended. This fact was unknown to the inventor (who
              carried out the remote monitoring) until the study was
              complete.<br>
              <br>
              The subjects in the study reported improvements in their
              symptoms during the period of administration of the mature
              water.<br>

            <div align="left"> The present invention refers to an
              apparatus and method for the detection of natural
              resources and assets, said device being formed by two
              hollow rods structured by a stopper (1) having an inner
              thread (2) which is threaded. The rod has an external
              thread (3) located at the inner portion (4) thereof, the
              rod being simultaneously formed by an upper end portion
              (5), which has an external thread (6) at the end portion
              thereof that is threaded to the inner thread (7) of the
              stopper (8). For instance: For dollars, a dollar note is
              located at the upper inner portion of each dowsing-rod
              (5), a stopper (8) being also located therein. For finding
              oil, crude oil is located at the upper portion of the
              dowsing-rods (5), a stopper (1) and (8) being previously
              located therein upon filling the rods for finding any
              material. For finding gold, approximately 10 g of gold are
              located at the upper portion of the rods (5) and
              subsequently threaded (6)(7) by locating the stopper (8)
              of each rod. The rods a re characterised in that they may
              be made of any material. For finding the natural resources
              and assets under the surface, the sections (3) of each rod
              are gripped with both hands, in such a manner that one rod
              is gripped by each hand, maintaining the sections (5) of
              each rod parallel to the ground, the rods spinning freely
              and indicating the displacing direction; if the sections
              (5) of each rod are slightly crossed while displacing,
              they indicate that the target is being reached, but when
              the sections (5) are completely crossed, they indicate the
              right place or area where the material is located, and
              according to the distance, the section (5) of the rods
              being raised indicating that the target is at a longer
              distance, obstacles not being an inconvenient for the
              accuracy of the place, either in land, sea or at distance.
              Hot water, cold water and oil are located approximately at
              450 m, at an approximate distance of 400 m; the distance
              for founding gold, silver and metals depends on the amount
              thereof in the subsoil, which may be of from about 2 Km to
              about 3 Km and the depth being more than 450 m; in the
              ocean, the distance and depth depend on the amount, for
              example, in an area of 500 m2 the distance may be of about
              4000 m and the depth of up to 1000 m.<br>

              <b> </b><br>
              [0001] In the dowsing dowsing rods and pendulums are now
              mainly used as a tool for water lines to locate so-called
              interference fields of earth radiation or to get a mental
              commuting answers to various questions, such as
              personality traits, interpersonal relations, etc..<br>
              <br>
              Subject of the invention is a pendulum which, although is
              also suitable for the above purposes, but mainly for the
              detection of electrical, electromagnetic and geomagnetic
              waves or Charges.<br>
              <br>
              It is assumed here that all matter and all living things,
              including man, earth's magnetic charge has a specific
              quantity.<br>
              <br>
              [0002] For example, If you hold a regular pendulum above a
              ferromagnet, it beats at a north pole magnet first time in
              120 turns to the left and then 120 times in right turns ..<br>
              <br>
              In a magnetic south pole, it turns first to the right and
              then 120 times 120 times to the left.<br>
              <br>
              This indicates that negative magnetic charge with links,
              plus magnetic charge will be displayed with right turns
              through the swing.<br>
              <br>
              But the pendulum rotates about iron first 120 times 120
              times to the left and then to the right.<br>
              <br>
              The specific magnetic charge of iron is therefore
              indicated with 120/120 Links-/Rechtsdrehungen.<br>
              <br>
              If you hold the pendulum over each one juxtaposed minus or
              Plus magnet as it swings back and forth between the two,
              and it therefore shows opposite polarity magnetic fields.<br>
              <br>
              [0003] On the outside, the subject of the invention is
              different - in the following&gt; Magnetic Spherical &lt;or
              &gt; MF pendulum&gt; called - from the normal pendulum
              mainly by a special fixture and metal rings.<br>
              <br>
              The pendulum itself can consist of metals commonly used
              for aligning, for example copper or brass.<br>
              <br>
              As a holding device is a cord switch, as used in power
              cables.<br>
              <br>
              The fixed through a screw plug with a hole in the pendant
              copper wire is so fixed on three metal rings, same or
              different sizes, such as key rings, which are connected
              together with a wrapped loop that it can move freely on
              the fixed ring.<br>
              <br>
              The cord switch two copper wire members are used so that
              one is connected to the three rings by a coiled loop
              forming the other top end with copper wire windings and a
              metal ring at the top end of the cord switch.<br>
              <br>
              Both pieces of wire are in the same fixed line switches
              such as power cables.<br>
              <br>
              By the switch button allows the copper contact between the
              two parts of copper wire in the cord switch to interrupt
              what the &lt;MF-Pendel&lt; für die Unterbrechung der
              Verbindung zum erdmagnetischen Feld, die durch den oberen
              Drahtteil mit Windungen zustande kommt, wesentlich ist.<br>
              <br>
              [0004] In the following schematic drawing of the features
              of the subject invention are shown, and show namely:<br>

              <br>
              [0006] In the following embodiments are described the
              different functions of the magnetic pendulum:<br>
              <br>
              1 The specific magnetic field.<br>
              <br>
              [0007] To determine how much geomagnetic charge a certain
              material, such as iron contains, the lower ring (3)
              between the thumb and index finger is held.<br>
              The pendulum starts to kick in left turns.<br>
              <br>
              After 120 turns to the left, it suggests to 120 right
              turns.<br>
              <br>
              When Rose quartz is 70/70 at Onyx 100/100 Left / right
              turns.<br>
              <br>
              2 Electrostatic waves<br>
              <br>
              [0008] In a conductor can with the &lt;MF-Pendel&lt;
              können sowohl die elektrostatischen als auch die
              statischen elektromagnetischen Wellen gemutet werden.<br>
              <br>
              The electrostatic waves with the central metal ring (4),
              held between the thumb and index finger measured.<br>
              <br>
              The pendulum rotates here 220 times 220 times to the left
              and then to the right.<br>
              <br>
              The measurement can also be made in a room, whether the
              electric light or electrical devices are turned on or not.<br>
              <br>
              3 Static electromagnetic waves<br>
              <br>
              [0009] Holding the &lt;MF-Pendel&lt; am oberen Metallring
              (5) mit ausgeschaltetem Schalterknopf (4), so können damit
              beispielsweise vor einem eingeschaltetem TV-Gerät die von
              der Stromquelle unabhängigen, statischen
              elektromagnetischen Wellen gemessen werden.<br>
              <br>
              There may always be the same amount of left / right turns
              shown, but the number of turns may vary.<br>
              <br>
              Normally, there are 240/240 Left / right expansions.<br>
              <br>
              When the power is supplied through an overhead line,
              depending on the humidity part of the electromagnetic
              charge to the atmosphere can be derived, which is shown
              with the MF pendulum by a reduced number of turns.<br>
              <br>
              4 The geomagnetic field<br>
              <br>
              [0010] Holding the cord switch (6.7) with off switch
              button (4) in hand, the Nord-/Südpolachse is constantly
              displayed, namely by the pendulum swings in this direction
              back and forth.<br>
              <br>
              Considering a compass under the swinging pendulum, the
              accuracy of the swing direction can be checked and
              verified.<br>
              <br>
              When the switch button, the pendulum of the
              Nord-/Südpolrichtung to Ost-/Westrichtung, which can be
              verified with the compass changes.<br>
              <br>
              Can therefore be used as a compass, as a special feature
              the special spherical. However, the air is charged
              electromagnetically, so the MF pendulum deviates to the
              west of the Nord-/Südpolachse from, corresponding to the
              strength of the electromagnetic emmission.<br>
              <br>
              For example, the electromagnetic immission of air displays
              with 120 swing left or right-turns, the pendulum deviates
              from 160 degrees from the Nord-/Südpolachse in the compass
              function.<br>
              <br>
              With the metal ring at the outlet of the cord switch (7),
              the earth's magnetic field is measured.<br>
              <br>
              If you hold this ring when the switch is off button (4)
              rotates the pendulum 240 times to the left, making the
              magnetic North Pole, with the switch button (4) it rotates
              240 times to the right, making the magnetic south pole is
              displayed.<br>
              <br>
              [0011] In summary, one can say that specific magnetic
              charges in fabrics as well as the electrostatic or the
              independent, static electromagnetic waves in conductors
              and in the air are muted by aligning spins with the
              magnetic field oscillating in a new way, and that it with
              the function mentioned sites can be employed as a novel
              compass, both Nord-/Südpolachse and the east / west
              direction and the global magnetic field by oscillations in
              the corresponding directions or Turns display.<br>

              of language) of the Japanese language into numeric values
              and using the numeric values, because there is no
              divination for being performed by focusing attention on
              undulations of a language and converting them into the
              numeric values, though a locution naturally varies with
              different kinds of consciousness and difference attitudes
              of a heart and verbalization makes desires of individuals
              and the like delicately different from one another in
              spite of their homogeneousness. ; SOLUTION: The numeric
              values of respective Japanese syllabary characters are
              determined by dowsing; the numeric values corresponding to
              the respective characters of contents to be divined, which
              are constructed as sentences, are added together. When
              numeric values, which are obtained by addition, are 12 or
              less, the numeric values themselves are applied to twelve
              kinds of energy. In the case of 13 or more, until
              respective digit numbers are added together so that
              numeric values, which are obtained by addition, can reach
              12 or less, they are repeatedly added together, and the
              numeric values, determined by the repeated addition, are
              applied to the above energy.<br>

              Movement of fluctuations fundamental things all have,
              energy and wave [0005] -, and that the consciousness of
              the human characters and graphics, color, sound, or even
              viewed as wave in the fundamental I could.<br>
              <br>
              You can rebound or tuned to each other, each wave is
              emitted or affect, or away or attract each other each
              other.<br>
              <br>
              To exist - wave energy also words emanating from the
              consciousness of our own course.<br>
              <br>
              It is what is called (once in a while and a call) Kotodama
              since ancient times.<br>
              <br>
              We or the mouth actually or words in my head it when doubt
              and desire, trouble, etc. came into being in mind.<br>
              <br>
              At that time, the words emanating from the consciousness
              of our own wave energy of the word - is have a.<br>
              <br>
              By try substituting the words doubt and desire, the
              trouble is, can be the hazy feeling, but to reveal the
              conviction.<br>
              <br>
              So of mind and consciousness have different, wording also
              come naturally different, or that it into words, desire of
              the individual person may differ in subtle yet
              homogeneous.<br>
              <br>
              However, there was no divination is performed to quantify
              this by focusing the wave with the words.<br>
              <br>
              Therefore, the wave energy of words Japanese have in the
              present invention - it is intended to quantify (Kotodama),
              there is provided a method of divination is performed
              using the number.<br>

              To obtain a numeric value of each hiragana by down Zing
              [Means for Solving the Problems], it adds a number
              corresponding to each letter of the desired content
              divination was documented in 13 or more, that number as it
              is if the number of 12 or less It is fitted into the -
              energy 12 different numerical values ??obtained by
              repeating this until 12 or less by adding st, if there is
              any.<br>
              <br>
              First embodiment of the invention], I ask a number
              Japanese (Hiragana) for each.<br>
              <br>
              For example, we down Managing on the letter "A", mosquito
              numbers of many expressed it - takes down Managing further
              on the ground, wave energy with the letter "A" - to
              quantify the .<br>
              <br>
              Those tabulated numbers Hiragana usually used are shown in
              Figure 2 and Figure 1.<br>
              <br>
              Go by adding the number corresponding to the character of
              each of the things you want fortune to see this chart.<br>
              <br>
              For example, to calculate the "2 +3 +4 +2 +2 +4" if ",
              Hiroshi Suzuki."<br>
              <br>
              To fit in - "the energy of the 12" mentioned below as it
              is number that come up if the numbers from 1 to 12.<br>
              <br>
              To add the number of Dear if number more than 13. "<br>
              <br>
              For Hiroshi Suzuki ", I will be the" 8 "and" 1 +7 "total

              <br>
              It is going to add a number repeatedly until Dear "12" or
              less when it exceeds "12" yet.<br>
              <br>
              It will become one of the tips in understanding the
              current status and future about what the contents of the

              phrases commonly used in fortune-telling It is useful to
              quantify.<br>
              <br>
              For example, "C of A and B. What"<br>
              "A +1 + B +8 + C +2 +1 +6 +5 +8 +6 +5", that is, the sum

              Dowsing has been known since ancient times and is today an
              important part of Geobiology, especially science that
              studies the relationship between the health of living
              organisms and their environments.<br>
              <br>
              Dowsing for the recording and interpretation of
              electromagnetic fields with extremely low energy are
              insufficient to be identified, captured and measured by
              the most sensitive on the market electronics and
              electrical engineering.<br>
              However, these electromagnetic fields play, despite their
              low intensities, a significant role in the lives of human
              beings, animals and plants.<br>
              Simple tools like the pendulum dowsing, deputizing the
              temporary absence of ultra-sensitive devices.<br>
              <br>
              Conventionally the waves useful in this area are divided
              into the following twelve colors:<br>
              <br>
              BLACK - INFRA RED - RED - ORANGE - YELLOW - GREEN - BLUE -
              INDIGO - VIOLET - ULTRA-VIOLET - WHITE - GREEN NEGATIVE.<br>
              <br>
              These colors are the specialists after Geobiology,
              directly related to geological phenomena perceived by the
              dowsers, via a pendulum.<br>
              <br>
              They are particularly important for the interpretation of
              these phenomena and can include establishing
              correspondences between them, the emitted waves and motion
              of pendulums.<br>
              <br>
              According to a recent theory, there is a fundamental
              relationship between the period of oscillation physics own
              T of a pendulum and geobiological color waves able to set
              in motion, a relationship which is reflected in the
              undifferentiated electromagnetic spectrum colors
              geobiological - a spiral-shaped curve - divided into
              twelve equal sectors circle.<br>
              <br>
              The object of the present invention is a set of twelve
              pendulum dowsing harmonizing with this theory in that it
              is characterized by the fact that the periods of
              oscillation own twelve clocks represented in a circular
              coordinate system after substantially shaped curve
              staircase.<br>
              <br>
              The attached drawing shows the fig. 2 and 3 two
              embodiments schematic, and given as non-limiting example,
              the object of the invention.<br>
              <br>
              The game clocks shown in Fig. 2 is composed of twelve
              clocks A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L each consist of
              a rod 11 and a washer 12 engaged and permanently fixed,
              for example by welding on the rod 11.<br>
              <br>
              Each rod 11 is provided at is upper end, with a loop 13
              for attaching the wire 14, of given length, in which the
              pendulum is intended to be suspended.<br>
              Its lower end has a conical shape.<br>
              <br>
              These clocks are distinguished from each other by the
              distance between the washer 12 and the loop 13.<br>
              <br>
              The game clocks shown in Fig. 3 consists of twelve
              straight A .......<br>
              L each constituted by a cylinder 15 terminating at its
              lower end by a cylinder 15 and having a circular groove
              16.<br>
              <br>
              These clocks are distinguished them by levels which are
              the grooves 16.<br>
              In both embodiments, the periods own different clocks
              represented in a coordinate system circular oscillation
              substantially follow a curve-shaped staircase.<br>

              This invention concerns transmitting devices for
              transmitting radiation of a type which either itself or
              other radiation induced by it can be detected by the human
              nervous system so as to appear as a series of contractions
              of muscles under the control of the nervous system as
              experienced by a person undertaking dowsing or water
              devining as it is sometimes called.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Background to the invention</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The applicant who is an experienced dowsing subject has
              found it possible to create a particular kind of spacial
              disturbance in the form of radiation which can, be adapted
              to provide for remote sensing or communication from one
              place to another.<br>
              <br>
              The spacial disturbance or radiation as it will
              hereinafter be referred to, exhibits the property of a
              wave and is best described by it's properties. It can be
              produced by a variety of devices some of which will be
              described. It is also produced naturally but usually of
              sufficiently low intensity as not to be useful unless
              modified by means to be described.<br>
              <br>
              Some of the properties of the radiation which have been
              observed are as follows:-<br>
              <br>
              1. It exhibits properties similar to a wave in a plasma.<br>
              <br>
              2. The radiation can be produced in the form of a directed
              beam of radiated energy of almost any degree of
              directivity.<br>
              <br>
              3. It has the properties of a wave in or flow of positive
              charges or particles.<br>
              <br>
              4. A beam of the radiation can be deflected by a magnetic
              and/or an electrostatic field. The direction of deflection
              is that which would be expected of a beam of positive
              charged particles.<br>
              <br>
              5. The radiation appears to have considerable penetrating
              power and has been found to pass through all substances
              that have so far been tested although it is believed that
              in some cases the radiation has been modified after
              passing through some materials. The materials tested
              todate include inter alia air, ground, metals and
              insulators and buildings. No insulation material has been
              found which will effectively screen it.<br>
              <br>
              6. It's velocity in air varies slightly but is apparently
              at or near the velocity of sound.<br>
              <br>
              7. It's velocity in other substances appears to vary
              considerably particularly in water and metals and although
              it will apparently penetrate these it does so only after a
              considerable delay.<br>
              <br>
              8. The radiation appears to have the properties of a
              longitudinal wave but it can apparently be polarised in a
              somewhat similar way to a light wave. It, therefore, has
              some of the properties of a light wave and some of a sound
              wave which, of course, cannot be polarised.<br>
              <br>
              9. The radiation can apparently be produced in a very wide
              range of frequencies as can an ordinary electromagnetic
              wave of which this its probably a member.<br>
              <br>
              10. The radiation apparently follows the normal laws of
              reflection from substances in that the angle of reflection
              is equal to the angle of incidence from any reflecting
              surface.<br>
              <br>
              11. Polarisation is achieved by means of devices which
              will effectively polarise electromagnetic radiation.<br>
              <br>
              12. On reflection from or more particularly when passing
              through a surface of any substances, the reflected ray
              appears to produce two conical fields of radiation
              originating at the point of impact with the surface, one
              in the forward and another in the reverse direction of the
              ray.<br>
              <br>
              The included angle of the hollow cone of radiation is
              apparently 900 and since the cone is centred about the
              axis normal to the surface, the sides of the hollow cone
              of radiation are at 450 to the surface.<br>
              <br>
              In addition to the two cones of radiation appearing at a
              reflective surface, there is apparently a further planar
              field of radiation centred at the point of impact, the
              plane being tangential to the plane of the surface on
              which the radiation is impinging. When the radiation is
              polarised, all reflected rays are polarised normal to the
              incident ray. If the incident ray is randomly polarised
              then so are the reflective rays.<br>
              <br>
              A beam of the radiation which the applicant has discovered
              will be referred to as a scionic wave.<br>
              <br>
              It is an object of the present invention to provide a
              device for generating a scionic wave<br>
              <br>
              It is another object of the present invention to propose
              methods of using such waves for performing certain
              investigations and measurements.<br>
              <br>
              So far the applicant has used his own dowsing sensation
              reaction to detect the presence of a scionic wave whether
              eminating from a transmitting aid or reflected from or
              refracted through different materials. It is to be
              understood that the invention particularly the methods to
              be proposed herein is not limited to this form of
              detection and any suitable detector may be used which is
              found to respond to scionic wave radiation.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Summary of the invention</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              According to the present invention a scionic wave
              transmitter comprises two basic component parts:<br>
              <br>
              (a) Means for producing a regularly occurring disturbance
              as by oscillating, vibrating or rotating, and<br>
              <br>
              (b) A device for coupling the disturbance into a local
              energy field to produce a scionic wave.<br>
              <br>
              The first disturbance may be a varying electric field, a
              varying magnetic field, or a disturbance caused by
              mechanical action on a fluid medium such as a sound wave
              on air or a mechanically vibrated member or may comprise
              an electromagnetic wave.<br>
              <br>
              Coupling devices which have been found to function are as
              follows:-<br>
              <br>
              (a) In the case of the primary disturbance comprising an
              electromagnetic wave, any substance which presents a
              change in dielectric constant or permittivity through
              which the originating disturbance is travelling, and<br>
              <br>
              (b) Where a physical vibration oscillation or rotation
              comprises the primary disturbance, any device capable of
              causing a change in the velocity of the originating
              disturbance.<br>
              <br>
              Devices which have found to be particularly effective
              under heading (a) are:<br>
              <br>
              1. A wire helix.<br>
              <br>
              2. A succession of metal and plastics washers (i.e. discs
              having central apertures).<br>
              <br>
              3. Laminated materials particularly plastics laminates.<br>
              <br>
              4. Plastics, sponge foamed material.<br>
              <br>
              5. Plastics shredded wool.<br>
              <br>
              6. Water vapour.<br>
              <br>
              Although other mechanisms may be at work, the most likely
              explanation is that the primary disturbance causes
              positively charged ions in the air (created by other means
              or by the originating disturbance) to be coupled to the
              disturbance and for them then to proceed as a wave of
              positively charged ions, which have their own
              characteristics, but follow a path governed by the
              radiating energy of the original disturbance. It would
              appear that the scionic wave of positively charged ions
              can be deviated from the path of the radiating primary
              disturbance by electric or magnetic fields.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Preferred forms of the invention</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              In a first embodiment an electric lamp is placed behind a
              helical coil of wire. A scionic wave is produced which
              emits from both ends of the coil along the axis of the
              helix. In the device constructed by the applicant, 16
              turns of copper wire were wound on a mandrel one cm in
              diameter and spaced to produce a coil 8 cms long.<br>
              <br>
              In a second embodiment, a cube of plastics foam sponge
              material was placed in front of an electric lamp or
              candle. The distance between the source of light and the
              face of the cube was approximately 2 cms. A scionic wave
              was found to be produced in the line of the source and the
              plastics cube.<br>
              <br>
              In the third embodiment, a metal pin was placed in front
              of an electric lamp or candle. A scionic wave was found to
              be produced in the line of the source and the obstruction
              and the wave in this case was found to be polarised.<br>
              <br>
              In a fourth embodiment the metal pin was replaced by an
              optical polarising filter.<br>
              <br>
              In a fifth embodiment the metal pin of the third
              embodiment was replaced by a metal or plastics sheet
              having a straight edge occupying the position of the metal
              pin.<br>
              <br>
              As a variation of each of the five previously mentioned
              embodiments, the source of light may be replaced by a
              source of heat such as a soldering iron tip. In each case
              a scionic wave is found to be produced in the line of the
              source and the coupler.<br>
              <br>
              In a sixth embodiment, an oscillating electrical circuit
              producing a supersonic wave for example at 40K Hz was
              placed in front of a suitable coupling device such as the
              helical coil of wire described in embodiment one.<br>
              <br>
              In a seventh embodiment an electrical oscillator was
              connected to two plates arranged in a plane so that two
              edges of the plates are almost but not quite touching. The
              plates are connected to the oscillator through at least
              one very high resistance and a varying voltage appears
              between the two plates. A coupling device was located in
              front of the plate in the form of a helical coil of wire
              and it was found that a scionic wave if produced in the
              line of the plates and the coupling device. In this case
              the wave was found to be polarised. It has been found that
              if one of the plates is circular and is mounted close to
              but not touching a second larger plate then a scionic wave
              is produced which is randomly polarised in a line through
              the plates and the coupling device.It was also found that
              if the two plates occupied two planes which are at an
              angle having a dihedral relative one to the other of
              approximately 100 then a scionic wave will be produced in
              the line of the acute angle between the two plates but no
              scionic wave is found to eminate in the opposite
              direction. If the two plates are co-planar or
              substantially co-planar then a scionic wave is apparently
              produced in both the forward and rearward directions.<br>
              <br>
              In a eighth embodiment a wire was looped down the inside
              of a helix of another wire and was returned back through
              the same helix close to the opposite diameter of the
              helix. When the wire was carrying a varying current, a
              scionic wave was found to emerge from both ends of the
              helix. The wave was found to be randomly polarised. By
              placing a metal reflector in the form of a disc or bar
              close to one end of the helix, the scionic wave was found
              to be produced only at the opposite end of the helix.<br>
              <br>
              In a ninth embodiment, the loop of wire previously
              described as passing through the helix was replaced by two
              single strands of wire between which an electrostatic
              field was formed.<br>
              <br>
              In a tenth embodiment a magnet was attached to a
              cantilever spring so that the magnet was capable of
              vibrating in line with the vibrations of the spring, and
              any one of the coupling devices previously mentioned was
              placed near to the magnet. A scionic wave was found to
              emerge in a line through the magnet and the coupler.<br>
              <br>
              In a eleventh embodiment, a cantilever spring mounted on a
              plate but insulated therefrom was supplied with an
              electric voltage so that a potential difference existed
              between the plate and the spring. A scionic wave was found
              to be produced in a line between the vibrating charged
              plate and a coupling device of any one of the types
              previously mentioned located close to it. In both this and
              the preceding embodiment, the best results were obtained
              when the amplitude of vibration was very small and in fact
              vibration due to ambient transients were found to be best
              and no particular driving force was used. On the other
              hand if the spring member is prevented from vibrating by
              being clamped then no scionic wave was found to be
              produced.<br>
              <br>
              In a twelfth embodiment, a sound resonating device in the
              form of a cylindrical aperture for example 2 mm in
              diameter and say 16 mm deep is located close to a coupling
              device with open end of the aperture or cavity close to
              the coupler.<br>
              <br>
              A scionic wave was found to eminate along the line of the
              cavity and the coupler.<br>
              <br>
              In a thirteenth embodiment, a small electrical loudspeaker
              was connected to a white noise generator close in front of
              which there was located a coupling device. A scionic wave
              was found to eminate in the line of the source and the
              coupler.<br>
              <br>
              In a last embodiment, a tuning fork was mounted close to a
              coupling device of any one of the types already mentioned
              so as to produce a scionic wave in the line of the fork
              and the coupler. It was found that the fork could be
              located either with the coupling device at the ends of the
              tines or normal to them.<br>
              <br>
              As a result of investigations made by the applicant, it
              was found that the emerging ray from a transmitter
              constructed in accordance with any of the preceding
              embodiments tended to spread and be rather wide. It was
              found that by passing the ray through an axial magnetic
              field the ray can be made very narrow and it was found
              that such a ray could be detected over a distance of many
              meters.<br>
              <br>
              It was found that the preferred form of axial magnetic
              field was that produced by an air cord coil located beyond
              the coupling device with the axis of the coil coaxial with
              the axis of the radiation eminating from the coupling
              device. By controlling the current flowing through the
              coils so a greater or lesser magnetic field density was
              obtained with the consequent control over the width of the
              eminating scionic wave.<br>
              <br>
              It was also found by experiment that using an
              electrostatic lens a similar control over the width of the
              beam could be obtained.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Applications of the invention</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The primary application for the invention todate has been
              the detection of underwater assistance and a determination
              of the depth of such systems below the surface.<br>
              <br>
              Whilst it has always been possible to detect the presence
              of underground water using the dowsing reaction of a
              suitable subject, the detection of such underground water
              has always proved to be rather imprecise and as far as can
              be ascertained, determinations of depth have tended to be
              more a matter of guess work and hypothesis together with a
              general knowledge of the geology of the area. Probably the
              biggest single factor affecting the results of
              conventional dowsing has been the variableness of the
              source of the scionic waves which the applicant has
              discovered interact with the human body to produce the
              dowsing reaction.Whilst it is clear that such waves exist
              in nature, and are reflected by a body of water to a much
              greater extent than by ordinary rock strata and earth, the
              dowsing subject has usually had difficulty in
              discriminating between the various informations received
              by him and to this end the invention provides a much more
              predictable source of scionic waves which if certain rules
              are observed will always follow a predictable pattern when
              reflected by an underground body of water or the like and
              which therefore will a dowsing subject to double check his
              findings and by using simple geometry to determine the
              precise depth of the body of water or other medium which
              he has detected.<br>
              <br>
              In a method of determining the presence of an underground
              body of water, a dowsing subject must first direct a
              scionic of narrow width in a completely vertical direction
              into the ground. The subject then walks away from the
              transmitter along any radial path measuring the distance
              as he walks and watching for a dowsing reaction.<br>
              <br>
              In the area where there is minimal dowsing activity from
              scionic waves emanating from the ground, it may be
              sufficient for the dowsing subject simply to note when the
              first dowsing reaction occurs and the distance from the
              transmitter, and then to retrace his steps and to try one
              or two other radial directions to double check that the
              distance to the first dowsing reaction is the same along
              each radial path. If so, then he can reasonably assume
              that he is picking up reflective scionic waves from a body
              of water underground.<br>
              <br>
              If the dowsing subject wishes to double check his results
              very carefully then the points along the radial paths
              followed by him can be plotted on a graph in which the
              zero crossing point of the graph is located in the centre
              of the page and in which the plots should occupy generally
              circular outline centred on the zero crossing point of the
              two axes of the graph. In the event that the plot of
              points is slightly elliptical then either a correction can
              be made to the angle of projection of the scionic wave
              from the transmitter so that the plot of points is
              rendered more circular alternatively the dimensions of the
              ellipse can be used in subsequent computation to determine
              the depth of the body of water underground.<br>
              <br>
              In an area which is "generally active" as far as a dowsing
              subject is concerned, it may be necessary to plot far more
              points along the first two or three radial directions
              before it is clear which of the points being detected
              along each radial path is an emanation of a scionic ray
              from a single body of water or like device underground.<br>
              <br>
              In this connection it will be appreciated that if there is
              more than one level underground water, then multiple
              reflections may be received from the different levels of
              water and in this connection a series of generally
              concentric plots of points would be obtained as a result
              of carefully plotting each dowsing reaction position along
              each of a plurality of radial arms emanating from the
              transmitting axis.<br>
              <br>
              In the event that some of the points detected along some
              of the radial arms correspond to points along lines of
              other scionic waves emanating from faults or other water
              or subterranean bodies then such lines will soon become
              apparent as such from the plots of the various points and
              can be disregarded or taken note of and followed in order
              to determine an overall picture of the subterranean
              strata.<br>
              <br>
              The positioning of the transmitter is critical since it is
              important for a generally circular pattern of plotted
              points to be obtained that the initiating scionic wave be
              vertical, to this end the transmitter is preferably
              provided with means for adjusting the inclination of the
              transmitter so as to produce a perfectly vertical ray or
              wave from the transmitter in a generally downward
              direction.<br>
              <br>
              To this end a spirit level or other levelling aid may be
              incorporated into the transmitter and preferably the
              latter is mounted at the other end of the tripod or the
              like with means for adjusting the attitude of the
              transmitter relative to the tripod.<br>
              <br>
              In a preferred embodiment of the invention an electrical
              oscillator generating electrical signals in the frequency
              range 1 Hz to 25 KHz is connected to the two adjoining and
              slightly dihedral plates of an initiator for creating the
              primary disturbance for generating a scionic wave and the
              latter is directed through a helical coil having coaxially
              aligned therewith an air coiled coil having a controlled
              electric current passing therethrough for establishing an
              axial magnetic field through which the scionic wave
              passes. The whole is mounted within a housing fitted
              adjustably at the upper end of a tripod and means is
              provided for indicating when a base plate of the housing
              is horizontal. The components are mounted within the
              housing such that when the base plate is horizontal the
              scionic wave emanating through the celloid is
              perpendicular to the base plate i.e. vertical.<br>
              <br>
              The applicant has discovered that if frequencies higher
              than the range 25 KHz are used then another phenomenon is
              produced. Thus when light is used as the source instead of
              the two dihedral plates or radio frequencies are used, the
              reflective ray can be detected long after the source has
              been removed. The cause of this is not well understood but
              appears to be due to charges left in the reflected surface
              which later reflects scionic waves created from other
              sources or disturbances such as light impinging on the
              earth.<br>
              <br>
              The soil appears to be non-dispersive at least over the
              range 1 Hz to 25 Hz and it is for this reason that the
              above range is specified as the preferred range for the
              embodiment previously described.<br>
              <br>
              The invention will now be described by way of example with

              <b> </b><br>
              In Fig. 1 the point of impact of a scionic ray 10 is
              denoted by reference numeral 12.<br>
              <br>
              The point of impact lies in a plane surface (not shown) of
              a reflecting material such as water and it is found that a
              plane wave 14 shown as a disc in the drawing emanates from
              the point of contact in the plane of the surface.<br>
              <br>
              In a generally rearward direction a first conical wave 16
              emanates from the point of contact 12 and beyond the
              surface of reflection a second hollow cone of transmitted
              rays is found to exist generally designated 1 8.<br>
              <br>
              The applicant has discovered that the sides of the cones
              are at 450 to the surface of impact whilst incident
              reflected and transmitted rays are in a plane normal to
              the surface of reflection.<br>
              <br>
              Referring now to Fig. 2 of the drawings, a transmitter
              unit comprises a housing 20 within which is located an
              electrical oscillator circuit 22 and power supply therefor
              24 having a control 26 for adjusting the frequency of the
              oscillator and an on/off switch 28. A spirit level 30
              provides indication as to when the housing is generally
              horizontal and to facilitate the adjustment and mounting
              of the housing, the latter is carried at the upper end of
              a tripod only the upper end of which is shown in the
              drawing having three legs, 32, 34, and 36 and having a
              fully adjustable head at the upper end of the legs 32 to
              36 generally designated 38 which includes a iocking clamp
              40 operated by a handle 42 which can be both raised and
              lowered and moved sideways and which has a twistable head
              44 to allow the latter to be locked in any desired
              position.<br>
              <br>
              Within the housing 20 is located a pair of plates 46 and
              48 which subtend an angle of just less than 1 800 and are
              connected to the output of the oscillator circuit 22. The
              amplitude of the latter is adjusted by a pre-set control
              50 so as to just produce the appropriate electric field
              between the two plates 46 and 48 so as to initiate the
              disturbance required to couple through the helical coil 52
              so as to produce the scionic wave discovered by the
              applicant.<br>
              <br>
              A coil 54 having an air core and an axis which is coaxial
              with the axis of the coil 52 is located in advance of the
              outlet exit 56 through which the ray is to pass and a
              control 58 allows the current flowing through the coil 54
              to be adjusted, the current conveniently being obtained
              from the power supply 24. By increasing the current so the
              strength of the magnetic field through the coil is
              increased and the dispersion of the wave is found to be
              decreased.<br>
              <br>
              In use the unit is set up so as to be completely
              horizontal and turned on and the beam adjusted so as to
              produce a narrow pencil like ray impinging normally on the
              surface of the earth below the tripod. The dowsing subject
              then walks away from the unit a distance of some few
              hundred feet and notes any positions along the radial path
              he has followed at which a dowsing reaction is
              experienced.<br>
              <br>
              Walking along another one or two circularly spaced radial
              paths and noting again when dowsing reactions are
              experienced will soon allow the dowser to determine which
              of the sets of points are a concentric circle and whether
              any other concentric circles exist thereby indicating
              lower levels of water, the radius of each circular pattern
              of dowsing reaction plottings corresponding to the depth
              of the water below the projector unit.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Detection of scionic waves</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              It has been found that there is a physiological reaction
              to these waves. It appears that the human body and
              probably those of other creatures react to scionic waves
              via their nervous system. The effect on the human body is
              to cause a slight change in the muscle tone. This effect
              is most noticeable in causing a small movement of the arms
              via the pectoral and deltoid muscles.<br>
              <br>
              This small movement can be amplified by holding rods or
              other means to magnify the movement in the arms.<br>
              <br>
              When a narrow beam of scionic waves is directed at the
              body there is a sensitive spot at the level of the thorax
              at a point halfway up the sternum and situated some depth
              in the chest, as shown by directing the beam from the
              side. It seems likely that body cavities are involved, in
              particular the trachea, which may cause amplification due
              to normal loads of vibration of the air column, and a
              reasonable Q before the oscillating positive charges
              affect the adjacent nerves.<br>
              <br>
              It is known that nerve axons are sensitive all over their
              surfaces but apart from the areas of Ranvier they are
              normally not influenced from their sides. It may possibly
              be that this external stimulus initiates a
              sodium/potassium exchange in the axon, which as far as its
              effect is concerned is treated like any normal nerve
              stimulus.<br>
              <br>
              Normally the body will react only to scionic waves that
              arrive along a plane transverse to the body in a vertical
              plane, i.e. no reaction to waves arriving from in front or
              behind. By positioning a coupler (such as a sheet of
              plastics foam material in a metal box) in front of the
              sternum at a point exactly midway up it, then scionic
              waves may be detected also in a vertical half disc facing
              the front. This not only enhances the effect but is more
              convenient when determining the direction of the wave
              origin.<br>
              <br>
              It appears that scionic waves are produced in the
              atmosphere generally by rays from the sun but also from
              stellar and other sources such as artificial light and
              heat sources.<br>
              <br>
              A ray of light or heat or other form of disturbance
              couples to a scionic wave which probably exists as
              positive ions in random motion.<br>
              <br>
              The coupling in this case effected by the atmosphere, its
              particles, and water vapour.<br>
              <br>
              The scionic wave will probably spiral around the earths
              magnetic field and is finally directed into a vertical
              path by the electrostatic gradient existing near the
              surface. The waves have considerable penetrating power and
              are probably the cause of the phenomenon of dowsing or
              water divining where the dowser experiences a sudden
              change in the intensity of the rays when reflected off
              water or metal under the ground.<br>
              <br>
              Considerable research has been carried out on this dowsing
              phenomenon but the general natural intensity is low and
              capricious. It fluctuates with varying cloud cover and at
              night time and in 10/10 cloud is very low and
              unpredictable. By generating local and more intense direct
              beams as described herein and before, better results are
              obtained in detecting underground water and objects.<br>
              <br>
              An interesting experiment consists of placing a small
              metal plate at an angle of 450 to the vertical and at the
              level of the chest. At various times a dowsing reaction
              from above can be detected, reflected off the plate into a
              horizontal ray. This ray can be turned through a large
              angle by an electrostatic or magnetic field placed in
              front of the plate.<br>
              <br>
              The requirements to produce a scionic beam are firstly to
              provide at least two sources of some form of radiant
              energy, whether varying electrical, varying magnetic,
              electro magnetic or mechanical, such as sound.<br>
              <br>
              Each radiant energy needs to be collimated, and in the
              form of a narrow beam.<br>
              <br>
              At least two beams need to intersect. The angle of
              intersection needs to be 105 . The complimentary angle of
              75 can be used, but it is not so effective.<br>
              <br>
              Each beam needs to be of dissimilar frequencies, although
              if a single source is used to provide multiple sources by
              splitting or reflection for instance, the requirement is
              met due to the normal broadband of the radiant source. It
              does not work for instance if the primary source is a sine
              wave of sound, but two different sound sources of
              different frequencies, if anharmonic, work well.<br>
              <br>
              The radiant energy sources may be mixed such as one of
              sound, and one of light, one of heat and one of light or
              any combination. The scionic beam is produced along a line
              which bisects the angle of intersection of the beams of
              energy and extends in both directions away from the point
              of intersection, in the plane of the two primary beams,
              irrespective of their relative strengths.<br>
              <br>
              If only two beams of energy are used, then the scionic
              beam they generate will be polarised such that the plane
              of polarisation of the scionic beam is normal to it, and
              in the plane of the two sources of energy.<br>
              <br>
              If three beams of radiant energy are used, they will form
              the edges of an equiangular tetrahedron and cross at a
              point. The angle between the beams again being 1050 (or
              750). The scionic beam will lie along a line, through the
              apex of the tetrahedron and make an equal angle with each
              beam of energy. It will be triply polarised with the three
              planes of polarisation at 1200 to each other and normal to
              the scionic beam. If a reflecting surface, especially one
              of metal is placed normal to the scionic beam, and within
              a short distance of the point of generation, no scionic
              radiation is detected beyond it.If another reflecting
              surface is placed normal to the scionic beam, but on the
              other side of the point of generation to the first
              reflector if the distance of the two reflectors to the
              point of generation is the same, then no scionic beam is
              detected, outside the two reflectors. If one of the
              reflectors is moved so that its distance from the point of
              generation is exactly twice that of the other, then this
              reflector does not interrupt the scionic beam. In general,
              if the point of generation of the scionic beasn is placed
              exactly one third of the way between two reflectors, the
              nearer one will reflect, and the further one appears
              transparent. A scionic beam cannot be detected nearer than
              three metres to its point of generation.<br>
              <br>
              Many methods exist, which can generate a scionic beam, but
              they all eventually boil down to producing intersecting
              wave fronts of radiant<br>
              energy at one of the above angles.<br>
              <br>
              A scionic beam may be used in conjunction with a static
              arrangement of geometric forms. The following are given as
              examples: <br>
              <br>
              (1) A series of pillars of any material are arranged so
              that the height of the pillars to the distance between
              their centres is in the ratio of 1 :3/2 and they are in a
              straight iine, and the number of pillars is notless than
              three in number.<br>
              <br>
              If they are placed in line with a beam of scionic
              radiation, they will greatly enhance the strength of the
              beam in the same line. If the scionic beam is such that
              the plane of the sources of primary radiation is normal to
              the height of the pillars, the emerging scionic beam is
              still polarised in the plane of the primary sources, and
              of course normal to the height of the pillars.<br>
              <br>
              If the pillars are replaced by discs spaced as above with
              the plane of the discs normal to the scionic beam, then
              the scionic beam is unpolarised.<br>
              <br>
              (2) A helix of wire, coaxial with the scionic beam where
              the spacing of the turns to the diameter accords with the
              above relationship, then a circularly polarised scionic
              beam is - produced.<br>
              <br>
              The above relationship was arrived at by experiment, and
              is empirical but leads to the supposition that there is an
              effective wavelength generated by the geoPnetric forms
              such that one wavelength is equal to 3/ times the height
              of the pillars.<br>
              <br>
              In the above illustration, the pillar spacing was at half
              wavelength intervals. If the spacing of the pillars is
              arranged so that they are at intervals of one third of a
              wavelength, the scionic radiation is changed in direction
              to be normal to the line of pillars.<br>
              <br>
              If, in the case of the pillars arranged as at first at
              half wavelength intervals, and if at one end of the line
              an extra pillar is spaced at one third of multiples of one
              third of a wavelength, then the scionic beam is suppressed
              in that direction and enhanced in the other.<br>
              <br>
              If the pillars are capped so forming a series of arches,
              then the effective wavelength is such that the ratio of
              the inside height of the pillars to their spacing centre
              to centre is 3/24The arches are equivalent to a series of
              slots in any material, and all the above conditions apply,
              but based on this effective wavelength.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Properties of a scionic wave</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              1. The speed of propagation in air is of the order of half
              that of sound;<br>
              <br>
              2. No substance has been found which it will not penetrate<br>
              <br>
              3. Soms reflection takes place off all surfaces, but only
              off metals and water to any extent, of those tested;<br>
              <br>
              4. It can be polarised;<br>
              <br>
              5. It can be deflected by magnetic and/or electric fields
              the direction of deflection being that of a positive
              charge;<br>
              <br>
              6. While no wavelength has been found, a wavelength can be
              generated based on the geometry of obstructions in its
              path;<br>
              <br>
              7. One beam will not deflect another whey they intersect;<br>
              <br>
              8. Refraction if it exists must be small, and so far has
              not been detected;<br>
              <br>
              9. Deflection by a magnetic field is usually complete for
              a narrow beam. it is independent of the field strength
              within limits and jumps to a deviation of 52.50 from its
              path, and no other angle.It is independent of the distance
              of the deviating field from the source of the scionic
              beam, and operates within the three metre limit for normal
              detection;<br>
              <br>
              10. Reflection is usual, i.e. the angle of incidence is
              equal to the angle of reflection;<br>
              <br>
              11. It is unusual, in that, irrespective of the angle of
              incidence of a beam to a surface, and in addition to the
              above usual reflection, there is a reflected beam, which
              is normal to the reflecting surface. Also a hollow cone of
              reflection with an internal included angle of 1050 set
              with its centre along the beam normal to the surface;<br>
              <br>
              12. When the beam passes through a surface such as a sheet
              of metal, brick wall etc., the emerging beam appears
              without noted refraction, and also with a mirror image of
              the cone and normal beam of the other side;<br>
              <br>
              13. In addition to the above reflected beams, a plane of
              radiation exists in the plane of the metal sheet or brick
              wall. in the latter case one on each surface, together
              with two mirror images of the forward cone;<br>
              <br>
              14. The cones of reflection and the reflection normal to
              the surface only occur with scionic beams, generated by
              two sources of primary radiation that intersect at 1050
              and not in the case of a scionic beam generated by two
              primary sources that intersect at 750;<br>
              <br>
              15. A scionic beam can be focussed down to a narrower
              beam, by passing it through a coaxial magnetic field.<br>
              <br>
              The experiments which led to this invention indicate that
              an unusual form of radiation is involved. It is unlike
              electromagnetic radiation in that it travels slowly. It
              is, however, affected by electric and magnetic fields. The
              angle of 1050 is the angle between the two hydrogen atoms
              and the oxygen atom in water, and it is therefore
              suggested that the primary radiation causes some vibration
              or rotation of water vapour molecules in the air. If the
              radiation causes the water molecules to be aligned or
              dimerised, then they may mutually repel and act more like
              particles and propagate by a kind of falling domino
              effect. It is noted that a scionic beam is highly
              collimated and diverged only slightly over a distance of a
              mile or so. If, on this theory during reorientation,
              moving charges are involved, they would generate a small
              potential in the nervous system and account for the
              muscular reflex.<br>

              <b> </b><br>
              I, WALTER GISHFORD EDWARDS, a British Subject of
              "Tadhill", Laverton Lane, Norton St. Philip, Near Bath, do
              hereby declare this invention, for which I pray that a
              patent may be granted to me, and the method by which it is
              to be performed, to be particularly described in and by
              the fcllowing statement :<br>
              <br>
              The present invention relates to a device for screening or
              neutralising dowsing rays or fields which are known to
              have harmful qualities which have detrimental affects on
              people suffering from functional disorders such as
              rheumatism, bronchial troubles and other ailments.<br>
              <br>
              These rays or fields exist generally in all kinds of
              localities and in both towns and in the country and their
              source appears to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere
              or outer space. The rays appear to have an affinity for
              underground veins of water, heavy clay, radioactive
              deposits and so on and is therefore more concentrated
              immediately over these deposits. The weather factor has
              some effect on these rays which vary in intensity and
              polarisation.<br>
              <br>
              Most people are inherently sensitive physically to these
              fields and it is the main object of the present invention
              to provide a device which will act to screen people from
              these fields or rays and also to neutralise such fields or
              rays so that they are rendered ineffective or
              comparatively so.<br>
              <br>
              According to the present invention there is provided a
              device for the purpose referred to which comprises a
              foundation of paper or other suitable material to which is
              secured a multiplicity of loops or rings of metal wire or
              foil arranged generally in a close formation in a common
              plane in such a manner that the rings do not touch one
              another.<br>
              <br>
              Copper has been found to be one suitable material for the
              rings or loops but other suitable materials may of course
              be used.<br>
              <br>
              The invention will be more fully described with reference
              to the accompanying drawing which illustrates a preferred
              form of the device.<br>
              <br>
              Referring to the drawings, the rings or loops are arranged
              in a desired formation or pattern on a foundation sheet as
              closely together as possible without touching so as to
              form a screen 3.<br>
              <br>
              Complete rings of copper foil or wire are effective to
              some extent but the screen ing and neutralising of the
              rays or fields is more efficient if the continuity of each
              ring is broken so as to leave a small gap 2 which may be
              about a quarter of an inch.<br>
              <br>
              When manufacturing the screen 3 it has been found to be
              convenient to mount the metal rings or loops 1 on a
              foundation material 4 such as paper or other suitable
              material so that the gaps 2 of all the rings 1 face in the
              same direction. The facing of the gaps in a common
              direction however is not essential.<br>
              <br>
              It is however particularly desirable that the metal rings
              or loops 1 should all be contained generally in the same
              common plane as it has been found that a discrepancy of a
              quarter of an inch in the plane of one ring or loop
              relative to the others will considerably reduce the
              screening and neutralising properties.<br>
              <br>
              When the rings or loops 1 are formed of copper foil it is
              convenient to apply these rings or loops to a foundation
              material 4 by means of adhesive.<br>
              <br>
              From experiments it has been found that very satisfactory
              results are obtained by making the rings or loops 1 so
              that they are<b> five inches in diameter</b> but this is
              not critical as in fact these rings may be any suitable
              size say anything from four and a half inches in diameter
              to three feet.<br>
              <br>
              In use the screens are mounted over the patient's bed
              either by sticking them to the ceiling or laying them on
              the floor of the room above, which is the more convenient.<br>
              <br>
              Within reasonable limits the vertical height of the screen
              above the patient does not make any difference.<br>
              <br>
              It will be appreciated of course that a screen may be
              constructed from one or more strips of paper or other
              foundation material bearing said copper rings or loops,
              said strips being secured together edge to edge in any
              suitable manner so as to extend over the required area.<br>
              <br>
              Referring to the small gap 2 in the ring, it has also been
              found that screening and neutralising may be obtained by
              having the ends of the rings overlapping but not touching,
              i.e. one free end of the ring passes and lies. underneath
              the other free end.<br>
              <br>
              <b>PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION.</b><br>
              <b> </b><br>
              The present invention relates to a device for screening or
              neutralising radionic fields.<br>
              <br>
              Radionic fields, including radiations commonly referred to
              as dowsing rays, are known to have harmful qualities which
              have detrimental effects on people suffering from
              functional disorders such as rheumatism, bronchial
              troubles and other ailments.<br>
              <br>
              These harmful radionic rays and fields exist generally in
              all kinds of localities and in both towns and in the
              country. The source of this radiation appears to be in the
              upper layers of the atmosphere or outer space, and may or
              may not have some connection with cosmic radiation. The
              radiation appears to have an affinity for underground
              veins of water, heavy clay, radioactive deposits and so
              on, therefore it is more concentrated immediately over
              these features. The weather factor has some effect on
              these rays which vary in intensity and polarisation.<br>
              <br>
              Most people are inherently sensitive to these fields in a
              radiesthetic sense and suffer organic reflexes and it is
              the main object of the present invention to provide a
              device which will act to screen people from these rays and
              also to neutralise such rays that they are rendered
              ineffective or comparatively so.<br>

              According to the present invention there is provided a
              device for the purpose referred to which comprises a
              foundation of paper or other suitable material which
              serves to support loops or rings of metal wire or foil
              arranged in a required formation or pattern so as to
              extend over and cover a desired area.<br>
              <br>
              Copper has been found to be one suitable material for the
              rings or loops but other suitable materials may of course
              be used.<br>
              <br>
              From experiments it has been found that very satisfactory
              results are obtained by making the rings or loops so that
              they are five inches in diameter but this is not critical
              as in fact these rings may be anything from four and a
              half inches in diameter to three feet.<br>
              <br>
              Each loop or ring is preferably circular and the rings are
              arranged as closely together as possible but without
              touching or over-lapping.<br>
              <br>
              Complete rings of copper are effective to some extent but
              the screening and neutralising of the radionic fields is
              more efficient if the continuity of each ring is broken so
              as to leave a small gap which may be about a quarter of an
              inch.<br>
              <br>
              When manufacturing the screen it has been found to be
              convenient to mount the metal rings or loops on a
              foundation material such as paper or other suitable
              material so that the gaps of all the rings face in the
              same direction. This however is not essential.<br>
              <br>
              It is however particularly desirable that the metal rings
              or loops should all be contained in the same common plane
              as it has been found that a discrepancy of a quarter of an

              Abstract --</b> The invention described above relates to a
            method for reliably detecting and eliminating positive or
            negative bioenergetic rays in the human environment and,
            furthermore, for reliable detection and elimination of
            positive or negative, in particular also of positive or
            negative bioenergetic states of high degree of an individual
            person on the basis of radionic measurement methods by using
            the "Copen Radionic Analytical Computer Mk5", as specified
            in detail in the description of the method. The method
            according to the invention is based partly on the findings
            which have led to the German Patent Application P 4204709.9,
            and partly on new findings as set forth in the present
            patent description. The aim of these measures is to avoid
            specific states of illness which would otherwise possibly or
            even necessarily occur when the method is not used.<br>

          <p align="left"><b>Abstract --</b> The method involves
            measuring quantitative deviations of organic energy states
            from their normal healthy values, expressed in
            'bio-energetic units', in the direction of either
            hyperactivity or hypoactivity in an error-free manner, by a
            'Copen Radionic Analytical Computer MK 5' (RTM) or
            comparable appts., supported if necessary by measurement of
            reaction to circularly polarised microwaves of geophysical
            origin. In a second phase, the measured deviations are
            corrected by application of precisely defined, metered and
            time-limited doses of bio-energetic radiation directed at
            specific parts of the body. The treatment is repeated as
            often as necessary until zero deviation is measurable for at
            least 25 minutes afterwards. </p>
