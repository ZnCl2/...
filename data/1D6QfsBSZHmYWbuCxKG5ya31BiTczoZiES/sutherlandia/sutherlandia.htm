      </div>
      <br>
      Credo: "I wish to appeal to the world. First, I am not a quack or
      a charlatan or a sensationalist. I am an old man who has seen
      much. I wish the world to know that there is a faint ray of hope
      that emanates from South Africa.<br>
      <br>
      It is a plant which is almost on the point of extinction, a plant
      called 'Suderlandia Fructosate'. This plant works miracles on
      people who have the terrible disease called Aids. And it is so
      miraculous that the miracles are seen within a week or a
      fortnight. A person, who was lying down on the point of death,
      when given this plant, rises and has much energy and is free of
      depression and has a good appetite. And I feel that as a nation,
      as a matter of world emergency, because the big scientists have
      not produced a viable safe treatment for aids. I say that this
      plant should be planted by all caring governments, by all caring
      organizations and that it should be given to human beings free of
      charge.<br>
      <br>
      You don't have do anything with the plant. You are going to laugh
      about this. You plant the plant okay, but then you take the little
      leaves and the red flowers from it and you put them in a tea cup
      and you pour much boiling water on it. And then you let the cup
      stand there, like tea you know, and you just drink, the patient
      just drinks.<br>
      <br>
      You can take them straight from the garden. You don't need to dry
      them first? because if you dry them too much they somehow loose
      some of their good spirit. Now this is all you do.<br>
      <br>
      You know, what I say is this. I can't cure the people of Africa
      without curing the people of the Caribbean, because Aids is
      running around the world. If I cure the people here and they get
      better, more Aids will come in and eat the same people whom I
      tried to cure. So the whole world must be cured.<br>
      <br>
      You need to take a fine sandpaper and sandpaper each little seed.
      The seeds are very tiny, tinier than grape seeds. And you
      sandpaper each seed and you plant it in a small flower pot. And
      you allow it to grow until it is about maybe four inches, three
      inches high. Then you take it and you plant it in the big veld
      (grassland). You can make a big garden, maybe twenty acres or so
      and you plant there. They just grow. There are farmers who have
      already planted them but they are too few. This is a world
      emergency and we must not be selfish.<br>
      <br>
      In the last few years or so there has been many claims made by
      people about plants and herbs, which they say are beneficial in
      the fight against aids. Some of these claims have proven to be
      false and at best have proven to be exaggerations. But in South
      Africa there is plan, which is on the brink of extinction.<br>
      <br>
      This plant is called by white people in English 'Suderlandia
      Fructosate'. This plant is also called by the Afrikaans people
      'kankerbos', which means cancer bush or 'kalkoenbos', which means
      turkey bush. Now this plant was known in South Africa and other
      parts of Sub-Saharan Africa for thousands of years. It was an
      anti-depressant, it was appetite booster, it was also and still is
      a dramatic booster of the human immune system.<br>
      <br>
      For many years African people and Xhoi-xhoi people and Xhoi-san
      people as well as Bantu people used this plant in the fight
      against cancer, and it was very effective there, and it still is.
      And they used it also in the fight against diseases like
      tuberculosis before there was streptomycin and other drugs to
      fight tuberculosis.<br>
      <br>
      In the old days when ordinary venereal disease like gonorrhea,
      syphilis and others were as incurable as Aids is today, our people
      used this plant to fight those diseases. If they had not had this
      plant, the black people of Southern Africa would have been
      destroyed just as the Australian Aborigines were destroyed, and
      other races of aboriginal people in other parts of the world were
      brought to extinction by diseases brought in from Europe.<br>
      <br>
      Now, we have found... me and a group of doctors, that it is having
      a dramatic impact in creating a better quality of life. People
      with full-blown aids, people who had been sent home to die find a
      better quality of life within the space of a month or a fortnight.
      I do not claim that this plant, dramatic as the results are is the
      cure for Aids.<br>
      <br>
      I say it is a stopgap, which must be used by all human kind in
      order to halt the disease of Aids. Until such a time as the
      pharmaceutical scientists can come up with a real cure, a cure
      which is not at all toxic. I say that this plant 'Suderlandia' is
      not at all toxic. One 'Suderlandia plant' is capable of treating
      10 people, and we need plantations of this plant.<br>
      <br>
      There is hope, a little ray of hope, a green ray of hope,
      emanating from South Africa, and I call on all human fellow human
      beings to make it larger, to spread hope throughout the world. I
      challenge you to create a safer, healthier world."<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>Sutherlandia frutescens (L.) R.Br.</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Family: Fabaceae ( pea &amp; bean family/Leguminosae)<br>
      Common names: sutherlandia, cancer bush, balloon pea (Eng.);
      umnwele(Xhosa &amp; Zulu); kankerbos, blaasbossie, blaas-ertjie,
      eendjies, gansiekeurtjie, klappers, hoenderbelletjie (Afr.)<br>
      <br>
      Sutherlandia frutescens, is a much-respected and long-used
      medicinal plant that is also an attractive garden plant, and has
      been cultivated in gardens for many years, for its fine form,
      striking colour and luminous flowers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Foliage </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sutherlandia is an attractive small, soft wooded shrublet, 0.5 to
      1 m in height. The leaves are pinnately compound . The leaflets
      are 4-10 mm long, grey-green in colour, giving the bush a silvery
      appearance. They have a very bitter taste.<br>
      <br>
      The flowers are orange-red, up to 35 mm long, and are carried in
      short racemes in the leaf axils at the tips of the branches in
      spring to mid-summer (September - December).Flower close up The
      flowers are not typical 'pea' flowers, the wing petals are very
      small and are concealed in the calyx, and the standard petal is
      much shorter than the keel.<br>
      <br>
      The fruit is a large, bladder-like, papery inflated pod and is
      almost transparent. It can be used in dry flower arrangements as
      it dries well, maintaining its colour and form.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ecology </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sunbirds pollinate the attractive, butterfly-like red flowers. The
      lightweight, papery, inflated pods enable the seed to be dispersed
      easily by wind. Stock browse the foliage.<br>
      <br>
      Ecologically legumes are well known for fixing nitrogen in the
      soil through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. The bacteria
      infect the roots, forming small growths or nodules. Inside the
      nodules, atmospheric nitrogen, which the plants cannot use, is
      converted to ammonia, which plants can use. The plant supplies
      sugars for the bacteria, while the bacteria provide the
      biologically useful nitrogen that the plant absorbs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Distribution </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sutherlandia frutescens occurs naturally throughout the dry parts
      of southern Africa, in Western Cape and up the west coast as far
      north as Namibia and into Botswana, and in the western Karoo to
      Eastern Cape. It shows remarkable variation within its
      distribution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Derivation of name and historical aspects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The genus Sutherlandia is so closely related to Lessertia and some
      botanists consider that it should be sunk in to Lessertia. This
      species is sometimes called Lessertia frutescens. The genus
      Sutherlandia was named after James Sutherland, ?1639-1719, first
      Superintendent of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden. The genus
      Lessertia is named after Jules Paul Benjamin de Lessert,
      1773-1847, a French industrialist, banker, amateur botanist and
      owner of an important private herbarium used by De Candolle. The
      species name frutescens means bushy in Latin.<br>
      <br>
      Pods Sutherlandia frutescens has many common names. It has become
      widely known as sutherlandia, The name cancer bush, kankerbos,
      comes from its reputation as a cure for cancer. The names
      balloon-pea, blaasbossie or blaas-ertjie (meaning bladder-bush or
      bladder-pea) all refer to the inflated, bladder-like fruits. The
      name klapper (meaning rattle) is a name applied to many species
      whose seeds rattle about in the mature, dry pods. The name
      hoenderbelletjie is in reference to the bright red flowers that
      are suggestive of the wattles (belletjies) of a fowl (hoender).
      The names eendjies and gansiekeurtjie are in reference to the
      inflated fruits which float on water and which are used by
      children as toy ducks (eendjies) and toy geese (gansies). Keurtjie
      is an old name applied mainly to species of Podalyria and
      occasionally to Sutherlandia and used as far back as 1680, derived
      from the Dutch keur meaning 'the pick of' or 'choice' in reference
      to their showy flowers. The Zulu name unwele means 'hair' -
      alluding to the fact that the plant stops people 'pulling out
      their hair' with distress.<br>
      <br>
      The Fabaceae (pea &amp; bean or pod-bearing family) is the second
      largest flowering plant family. It contains more than 600 genera
      and 12 000 species and is found throughout the world. In southern
      Africa this family is represented by 134 genera and more than 1
      300 species.<br>
      <br>
      The genus Sutherlandia, which has since been sunk in Lessertia,
      used to contain only 5 species, widespread throughout southern
      Africa. The genus Lessertia, which now includes Sutherlandia, is
      widely distributed in Africa, consists of ± 60 species, with ± 50
      in southern Africa.<br>
      <br>
      There are other closely related species that are often confused
      with Sutherlandia frutescens, these are Sutherlandia montana the
      mountain cancer bush, Sutherlandia microphylla commonly known as
      bitterblaar or grootgansiesbos, and Sutherlandia tomentosa, also
      known as eendjies or rooikeurtjie.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bush with dry pods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Uses and cultural aspects:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This plant is one of the most talked about in the ethnobotanical
      world because it has a strong reputation as a cure for cancer and
      now increasingly as an immune booster in the treatment of
      HIV/AIDS. Research on its properties is ongoing.<br>
      <br>
      It has long been known, used and respected as a medicinal plant in
      southern Africa. The original inhabitants of the Cape, the Khoi
      San and Nama people, used it mainly as a decoction for the washing
      of wounds and took it internally to bring down fevers. The early
      colonists regarded it as giving successful results in the
      treatment of chicken pox, stomach problems, and in the treatment
      of internal cancers. It is also known to have been used in the
      treatment of eye troubles, the eyes being bathed with a decoction
      of the plant. It continues to be used to this day as a remedy for
      the above-mentioned ailments. It is still used as a wash for
      wounds, to bring down fevers, to treat chicken pox, for internal
      cancers, and farm workers in the Cape still use it to treat eye
      troubles. It is also used to treat colds, 'flu, asthma, TB,
      bronchitis, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis and osteo-arthritis,
      liver problems, haemorrhoids, piles, bladder, uterus &amp;
      'women's' complaints, diarrhoea &amp; dysentery, stomach ailments,
      heartburn, peptic ulcers, backache, diabetes, varicose veins and
      inflammation. It is also used in the treatment of mental and
      emotional stress, including irritability, anxiety and depression
      and is used as a gentle tranquillizer. It is said to be a useful
      bitter tonic and that a little taken before meals will aid
      digestion and improve the appetite. It is considered to be a good
      general medicine.<br>
      <br>
      There is as yet no scientific support for the numerous claims and
      anecdotes that this plant can cure cancer, but there is
      preliminary clinical evidence that it has a direct anti-cancer
      effect in some cancers and that it acts as an immune stimulant.<br>
      <br>
      Sutherlandia should not be regarded as a miracle cure for cancer,
      its real benefits are as a tonic that will assist the body to
      mobilize its own resources to cope with the illness. It is known
      to decrease anxiety and irritability and to elevate the mood.
      Cancer patients, as well as TB and AIDS patients, lose weight and
      tend to waste away. Sutherlandia dramatically improves the
      appetite and wasted patients start to gain weight. It is also
      known to improve energy levels and gives an enhanced sense of
      well-being. It is hoped that treatment with sutherlandia will
      delay the progression of HIV into AIDS, and even remission of the
      disease is hoped for.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Growing Sutherlandia frutescens</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Seeds in dry podSutherlandia is fast growing and easy to grow, but
      short-lived as a garden subject. It is a tough, hardy plant that
      does well in full sun and tolerates all soil types. It occurs both
      in summer and winter rainfall regions, and is quite drought
      tolerant so does not require much watering. When growing it in
      containers, make sure that it is well drained and don't
      over-water. The plant is also quite pest resistant. Plants seed
      themselves readily, so that as the older plants start to look past
      their best they can be removed.<br>
      <br>
      It makes interesting temporary filler in the mixed border, rockery
      or shrubbery, especially if it is planted in groups or en masse.
      It is also a good contrast foliage plant against a green backdrop
      and can be used effectively to punctuate a soft landscape
      planting. It is also a must for the herb garden. It grows well in
      containers, and can be used as a temporary decoration for the
      patio or courtyard. Because they are fast and tough, they also
      work quite well as pioneers in a new garden, where they give cover
      and colour while the slower growing perennials get going.<br>
      <br>
      The cancer bush seeds itself readily, and grows easily from seed.
      Sow in autumn or spring in well-drained soil. Germination is
      improved if seeds are left to soak for about 4 hours or overnight
      in water hot enough for you to put your hand in. We have found
      that many members of the pea &amp; bean family are susceptible to
      pre-emergence damping off. Using sterile soil and treating the
      seed with the Apron (a.i. metalaxyl) effectively combats fungal
      infection. Keep the seed trays warm (not hot) and damp but not
      wet. Germination should occur in 2 to 3 weeks and seedlings can be
      transplanted as soon as they are large enough to handle. Planting
      the plants close together in groups of 3 or 5 will give you a
      fuller, more attractive bush.<br>

      A screening process was applied to extracts made from Sutherlandia
      frutescens (L.) R. Br (Fabaceae) and Lobostemon trigonus
      (Boraginaceae) as identified by the Botany Department, University
      of Port Elizabeth to detect if any of the extracts inhibited the
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For purposes of dereplication,
      sulphated polysaccharides were removed and bovine serum albumin
      (BSA) was included in the assays to adsorb non-specific tannins
      potentially present. In the reverse transcriptase (RT) assay, an
      aqueous extract of the Lobostemon leaves inhibited HIV-1 RT with
      an IC50 value of 49 microg/ml, while in the protease assay no
      inhibition was seen. In the alpha- and beta-glucosidase assays, no
      significant inhibition was seen with the inclusion of BSA,
      indicating tannin-based inhibitory effects on these two enzymes.
      The beta-glucuronidase inhibitory activity, however, was retained
      in the presence of BSA. The study shows that Sutherlandia extracts
      contain inhibitory compounds active against HIV target enzymes,
      while aqueous Lobostemon leaf extracts contain a potent HIV-1 RT
      inhibitor, thus showing a potential mechanistic action of these
      plants in aiding HIV-positive patients.<br>

      One of the best-known multi-purpose medicinal plants in Southern
      Africa, Sutherlandia frutescens subsp. microphylla (family:
      Fabaceae/Leguminosa), is used for a wide range of conditions,
      including cancer, viral diseases and inflammatory conditions.
      Little scientific data has been documented on the mechanism by
      which Sutherlandia frutescens acts on the immune system. Phagocyte
      derived reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide and
      superoxide radicals, are responsible for the pathogenesis of
      various inflammatory conditions. Anti-inflammatory properties of
      various medicinal-plant extracts have been explained, at least in
      part, by their antioxidant activities. We investigated the effects
      of a hot water extract of Sutherlandia frutescens on both luminol
      and lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence of neutrophils stimulated
      with L-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP) as well
      as its superoxide and hydrogen peroxide scavenging properties in a
      cell free system. The results indicate that Sutherlandia
      frutescens extract possesses superoxide as well as hydrogen
      peroxide scavenging activities at concentrations as low as 10
      microg/ml, which could account for some of the anti-inflammatory
      properties that have been described.<br>

      Previous studies on the pharmacology of South African medicinal
      plants in our laboratories and elsewhere have shown that some
      plants possess therapeutic attributes. One such ethnomedically
      useful plant is Sutherlandia frutescens R. BR. (family: Fabaceae).
      S. frutescens is widely used in South African traditional medicine
      for the management and/or control of a plethora of human ailments.
      In order to scientifically appraise some of the ethnomedical uses
      of S. frutescens, the present study was undertaken to investigate
      the analgesic, antiinflammatory and antidiabetic properties of the
      plant's shoot aqueous extract in experimental animal models. The
      analgesic effect of the herb's shoot extract was evaluated using
      the hot-plate and acetic acid test models of pain in mice, while
      the antiinflammatory and hypoglycemic effects of the plant's shoot
      aqueous extract were investigated in rats, using fresh egg
      albumin-induced pedal (paw) edema, and streptozotocin
      (STZ)-induced diabetes mellitus. Diclofenac (100 mg/kg) and
      chlorpropamide (250 mg/kg) were used, respectively, as reference
      drugs for comparison. S. frutescens shoot aqueous extract (50-800
      mg/kg i.p.) produced significant (p &lt; 0.05-0.001) analgesic
      effects against thermally- and chemically-induced nociceptive pain
      stimuli in mice. The plant extract (50-800 mg/kg p.o. or i.p.)
      also significantly (p &lt; 0.05-0.001) inhibited fresh egg
      albumin-induced acute inflammation and caused significant (p &lt;
      0.05-0.001) hypoglycemia in rats. The various chemical
      constituents and secondary metabolites of the herb are speculated
      to account for the observed analgesic, antiinflammatory and
      hypoglycemic effects of the plant. The results of this
      experimental animal study suggest that S. frutescens shoot aqueous
      extract possesses analgesic, antiinflammatory, and hypoglycemic
      properties, and thus lend pharmacological credence to the
      suggested folkloric uses of the herb in the management and/or
      control of painful, arthritic and other inflammatory conditions,
      as well as for adult-onset, type-2 diabetes mellitus in some
      communities of South Africa.<br>

      Sutherlandia frutescens popularly known as cancer bush is endemic
      to Southern Africa. Whole plant parts have been used and
      traditional healers claim that it can treat cancer. In this study
      it is shown that a crude aqueous Sutherlandia frutescens whole
      plant extract induced cytotoxicity in neoplastic cells (cervical
      carcinoma) and CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary cells) cell lines.
      Morphological observation and monitoring with other biological
      assays involving chromatin condensation as well as phosphotidyl
      serine externalisation point to apoptotic responses. Further
      biochemical assays showed similar DNA fragmentation patterns
      induced by Sutherlandia frutescens extracts compared to other
      inducers of apoptosis such as staurosporine and ceramide.
      Furthermore, Sutherlandia frutescens extracts induced apoptosis
      was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis. These findings warrant
      further research with a view to develop Sutherlandia frutescens
      extracts for use in anti-cancer therapy.<br>

      We examined the effects of two African herbal medicines
      recommended for HIV/AIDS patients on antiretroviral metabolism.
      Extracts from Hypoxis and Sutherlandia showed significant effects
      on cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism and activated the pregnane X
      receptor approximately twofold. P-glycoprotein expression was
      inhibited, with Hypoxis showing 42-51% and Sutherlandia showing
      19-31% of activity compared with verapamil. Initiating policies to
      provide herbal medicines with antiretroviral agents may put
      patients at risk of treatment failure, viral resistance or drug
      toxicity.<br>

      Sutherlandia frutescens is a South African herb used traditionally
      by the natives to treat cancer, and more recently to improve the
      overall health in HIV/AIDS patients. Gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometer profiling and liquid chromatographic/mass spectral
      investigation confirmed and quantified the presence of canavanine,
      GABA and arginine in the herbal preparation used in this study. In
      vitro study demonstrated a concentration dependent effect of
      Sutherlandia on several tumor cell lines, with 50% inhibition
      (IC50) of proliferation of MCF7, MDA-MB-468, Jurkat and HL60 cells
      at 1/250, 1/200, 1/150 and 1/200 dilutions, respectively.
      Sutherlandia treatment did not induce HL60 differentiation along
      the macrophage/monocyte or granulocyte lineage. It demonstrated
      antioxidant activity in reducing free radical cations with an
      estimated activity of 0.5 microl of Sutherlandia extract
      equivalent to that of 10 microM of Trolox. However, it did not
      significantly suppress lipopolysaccharide stimulated nitric oxide
      production by murine macrophage/monocyte RAW 264.7 cells, nor did
      it significantly inhibit IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in
      RAW 264.7 cells. In conclusion, Sutherlandia ethanolic extract
      showed a concentration dependent antiproliferative effect on
      several human tumor cell lines but did not show significant
      antioxidant effects. Further studies are needed to explore the
      activities of this multipurpose South African herbal preparation.<br>
