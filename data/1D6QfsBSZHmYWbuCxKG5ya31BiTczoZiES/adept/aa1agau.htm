                  manufactured from other elements by several methods.
                  The transmutation of silver to gold is the least
                  difficult to accomplish. The methods developed by
                  Francois Jollivet-Castelot offer a good chance of
                  success, albeit with great danger due to the use of
                  arsenic. The penultimate means of transmutation is the
                  Philosophers' Stone of any degree, but that is another
                  matter altogether.</font> </font></p>

              <p><font color="#000000">Fulcanelli and others Adepts,
                  however, affirm that experiments such as these are not
                  Alchemy, but rather "hyper-chemistry" or "archymy".
                  The following procedures are included in this
                  collection in order to afford a wider perspective to
                  all inquirers, and to console those who fail to
                  complete the Ars Magna.</font> </p>
              <p><font color="#000000">Most of the 19th and 20th century
                  experimenters in this genre used a variety of "wet"
                  techniques (refluxing with nitric acid, etc.), or
                  "dry" transmutations with alloys in the furnace. Dr.
                  Stephen Emmens used high-pressure hammering (500
                  tons/sq. in.) of silver at low temperature, followed
                  by fluxing, granulation, more hammering, treatment
                  with "modified nitric acid", and refining.</font></p>

                      Gold --- Its Artificial Production</font></i><font
                    size="+1"> ~&nbsp; It is not only by the common
                    operations of mining and digging in the profundities
                    of the earth that it is possible to obtain Gold. It
                    is quite within the powers of Art to imitate Nature
                    in this matter, for Art perfects Nature in this as
                    in many other things. We propose to provide in this
                    place an account of a formal experiment, the worth
                    of which has been tested over and over again, and
                    has in fact become little less than familiar among
                    operators in the pursuit of the Grand Work. In order
                    to perform it a large crucible must be provided, and
                    it must be of such a quality as will be able to
                    resist the action of intense heat. This crucible
                    must be set over a burning furnace, and at the
                    bottom of the vessel there must be strewn Powder of
                    Colophony (a kind of resin) to about the thickness
                    of the little finger. Above this undermost layer
                    there must be another layer of Fine Powder of Iron
                    --- that is, the Finest Iron Filings --- which shall
                    be of the same thickness. Subsequently, the filings
                    must be covered with a little Red Sulphur. Then the
                    fire in the furnace must be increased till the iron
                    filings have passed into a liquid condition. The
                    next operation is to throw in Borax --- that kind
                    which is made use of by goldsmiths for melting gold.
                    To this must be added a like quantity of Red
                    Arsenic, and as much Pure Silver as will be
                    equivalent to the weight of the Iron Filings. Let
                    the entire composition undergo coction by driving
                    the furnace, taking care at the same time not to
                    inhale the steam, on account of the arsenic in the
                    vessel. Take then another crucible into which, by
                    inclining the first vessel, you must pour the cocted
                    matter, having previously stirred it effectually
                    with an iron spatula. Proceed in such a manner that
                    the composition will flow into the second crucible
                    in a purified state, and devoid of recremental
                    matter. By means of the Water of Separation, the
                    Gold will be precipitated to the bottom. When it has
                    been collected, let it be melted in a crucible, and
                    the result will be good Gold, which will repay all
                    pains and expense which have been devoted to its
                    production. This chemical secret is contained in the
                    ‘Hermetic Cabinet’, and the facility with which the
                    experiment can be performed has led many persons to
                    undertake it. The authority cited in support of it
                    is no less than that of the most learned Basil
                    Valentine, who also affirms that the operation of
                    the Grand Work of the Philosophers can be performed
                    in less than three or four days, that the cost
                    should not exceed three or four florins, and a few
                    earthen vessels are sufficient for the whole
                    experiment. </font></p>

                    transmutations of silver to gold. He published a

                    possesses peculiar qualities that lend to its
                    augmentation as gold (Dr. Emmens also used Mexican
                    silver in his work). While he claimed success in
                    principle, he made no capital gains. Tiffereau
                    demonstrated his process at the French Mint in Paris

                    confirmed in the 1980s by the discovery that placer

                    started from the fact that gold is found in nature
                    associated with antimony and arsenic sulfides as
                    well as with tellurium, which is considered as a
                    mineralizer of gold. I therefore considered that it
                    was logical to introduce tellurium into the

                    antimony sulfides that I make...</font> </p>

                    work, which converts silver into gold, had its
                    origin in the course of certain investigations which
                    I undertook for the purpose of preparing chemically
                    pure nickel... in 1892. In attempting to prepare
                    these pure metals [nickel and iron], a certain
                    product was obtained which seemed to differ from
                    anything recorded in the textbooks. The same product
                    was subsequently found when the investigation was
                    extended to the case of metallic cobalt... The
                    phenomena observed afforded indications of the
                    existence of some substance common to the whole of
                    the elements in what is known as Series 4 of Group 8
                    of the classification of Chemical Elements... It
                    appeared to us almost self-evident that if we were
                    right in supposing a common substance to be present
                    in any single series of elements, the same would

                    starting point, so far as silver and gold were
                    concerned, was afforded by the remarkable
                    discoveries of Mr. Carey Lea with regard to
                    [colloidal silver]... It was found that... this
                    subdivision of metallic silver was attended by very
                    considerable changes in the physical properties of
                    the substance...By certain physical methods and by
                    the aid of a certain apparatus, we succeeded in
                    bringing about a further subdivision of the silver.
                    We were not surprised to find that the substance
                    obtained differed so far from ordinary silver that
                    it could no longer be regarded as the same
                    elementary substance. It seemed to require a new
                    name and a new chemical symbol. Inasmuch, therefore,
                    as our theory was that this substance was common to
                    both gold and silver, and in reality was the raw
                    material out of which both gold and silver were
                    constructed by the hand of nature, we named the
                    substance Argentaurum...</font> </p>

                    next step was to ascertain whether this substance
                    could be so treated as to be grouped into molecules
                    of greater density than those of silver... We found
                    that... Argentaurum can be aggregated into molecules
                    having a density considerably superior to that of
                    ordinary gold molecules. Whether we are right as to
                    this or not, the condensed Argentaurum presents the
                    appearance and is endowed with the properties of

                    absolute application of dimensional science. In this
                    reaction, gold is produced in its ultra-pure state
                    on a continuous basis. This procedure may be
                    utilized for most elements. The basis of this
                    dimensional occurs in the collection of atomic size
                    particles that form near the resonant metal (in this
                    case aluminum). Due to the size of the particles
                    they appear in what normal chemistry would consider
                    a gas phase. The targeted element (isotope) forms in
                    its singular state and due to the lack of energies
                    present. There are insufficient energies to bind the
                    atoms into a colloidal state. </font></p>

                    gold from aluminum, the ideal temperature is 302.9°
                    C. These temperatures are optimum for the Al (the Al
                    must be allowed to come into equilibrium with the
                    furnace). Once resonance is established, production
                    is continuous. The Au is captured in water as it is
                    removed from a negative pressure applied to the
                    furnace established by the vacuum pump. However,
                    please be aware that Al will also convert to Ag<sup>107</sup>
