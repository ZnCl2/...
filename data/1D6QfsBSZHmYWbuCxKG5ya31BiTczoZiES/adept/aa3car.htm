    <blockquote> &nbsp;&nbsp; Nuclear physicists bombard targets with
      high-energy particles in order (or chaos) to prove the schematic
      of their mindset with appropriate experimental results. In recent
      years, however, the discovery of cold fusion has quite upset the
      world view of conventional physicists, who generally deny the
      possibility that Nature allows for other means of transmutation.
      Yet, there is considerable historical evidence that many types of
      transmutations have been accomplished without particle
      accelerators, long before Pons and Fleischman announced their
      discovery of cold fusion. There is so much credible documentation
      of low-energy transmutation that, in the words of Rupert Gould,
      "did it relate to any more probable event, we should be compelled
      either to accept it or cease putting any faith in recorded
      testimony."
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many examples that can be cited,
        "biological transmutation" is the best developed and well known.
        About forty years ago, Dr. Louis Kervran presented the idea that
        sodium, potassium, and dozens of other elements change into each
        other under certain natural conditions in the mineral,
        vegetable, and animal kingdoms. Biological transmutations have
        been demonstrated, crucial experiments replicated, and the
        theoretical principles verified by many scientists who are
        finding new industrial, medical and agricultural applications of
        the discoveries. </p>

      <p><a name="AAII31Kushi"></a><b>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George
          Ohsawa &amp; Michio Kushi</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspired by the pioneering work of Dr.
        Kervran, Dr. George Ohsawa sought to transmute sodium into
        potassium <i>in vitro</i>. The method revealed itself to him in
        a symbolic dream. Thus inspired, Dr. Ohsawa and Michio Kushi, <i>et












          al</i>., constructed an experimental electric discharge tube
        with copper (Yin) and iron (Yang) electrodes and a valve through
        which to draw a vacuum or admit oxygen (Fig. 3.1). The first
        transmutation with this equipment was achieved on June 21, 1964.
        After applying 60 watts of electricity for 30 minutes to heat
        sodium to a plasma, a molar equivalent of oxygen was introduced.
        Viewed with a spectroscope, the orange band of sodium gave way
        to the blue of potassium, according to the formula: </p>
      <p>Na<sup>23 </sup>+ O<sup>16 </sup>= K<sup>39</sup> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Analysis of the reaction product confirmed
        the result and revealed an unexpected extra: a trace of gold was
        produced by the combination of Na, O, and K with the Cu and Fe
        electrodes. Several different metals were tested as electrode
        materials. Neon and argon atmospheres were found to enhance the
        yield of potassium and other elements. External heating of the
        reaction tube also served to ionize the sodium. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Louis Kervran noted these experiments in
        his book <i>Transmutations A Faible Energie</i>: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Professor [Masashiro] Torii, on a circuit
        designed by Prof. Sakurazawa, and under the control of Prof.
        Odagiri, observed in the spectroscope the passage of sodium to
        potassium upon the adjunction of a small quantity of oxygen to
        sodium vapor... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prof. Torii [of Musashino Institute of
        Technology, Tokyo] has informed me of having observed on 21 June
        1963, in the spectroscope, the passage of sodium to potassium,
        the disappearance of the yellow line of sodium being replaced by
        the red-violet ray of 7699 A<sup>o</sup> potassium; the
        experiment was repeated June 22 before five scientists... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the production of steel in electric
        furnaces, the incomprehensible appearance of boron [has been
        observed]. We see now that we cannot exclude, under the effect
        of a powerful electric field and of the high temperature of
        these furnaces, the 'reduction' of carbon from the loss of
        hydrogen and in keeping with: C - H = B... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The experience is simple to realize, as it
        suffices to take a plate of steel --- or of iron -- an anode of
        magnesium, place them in a jar containing distilled water
        rendered conductive by a salt of magnesium --- in order not to
        introduce any metallic ion other than magnesium, and these two
        electrodes are reunited by a metal wire, to the exterior of the
        jar; thus they realize (in part) a battery with magnesium at the
        negative, iron as positive; through the production of hydrogen
        at the electrode, magnesium is at a potential of 1.9 volts more
        negative than iron. Leave it for two or three months; from time
        to time add a little distilled water in order to compensate for
        evaporation. On analysis, calcium is obtained... in an operation
        in which calcium was not introduced!" </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The calcium (as oxide) accumulates in scales
        on the cathode. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kushi and Ohsawa, <i>et al</i>., proceeded
        to develop their process for industrial-scale production. They
        estimated that potassium could be manufactured for 1% of the
        current price. In a correspondence to Ken Jones (12 October
        1980), Michio Kushi stated: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After George Ohsawa and myself succeeded in
        producing K out of Na and O... we presented the experiment to
        several chemical corporations. At that time, Pfizer
        International became most actively interested. We had
        conferences on several occasions; however, soon after we decided
        not to become involved with these corporations, as a result of
        the considerations of the vast effects this would have on the
        industry." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers also had no patent with
        which to protect their interests. Ohsawa and Kushi then turned
        their attention to the manufacture of steel by transmutation of
        carbon and oxygen according to the formula: </p>
      <p>2 (C<sup>12 </sup>+ O<sup>16</sup>) = 2 Si<sup>28 </sup>= Ni<sup>56</sup>
        = Fe<sup>56</sup> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experimental arrangements worked as
        predicted, and produced several other elements from combinations
        of C and O with atmospheric nitrogen, etc: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Fe produced by this transmutation is
        stainless; it does not rust easily. Also it reacts much less to
        heat than does ordinary Fe... All results of the transmutation
        for Fe have been carefully examined and analyzed by several
        methods, as: (1) magnetic inspection, (2) spectroscopic
        analysis, (3) chemical analysis, (4) examination by reagents,
        etc, and confirmed by authoritative testing agencies. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new form of iron was called GOS (George
        Ohsawa Steel). The experimental method is as follows: </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Method 1</i>: Transmutation in Air [Fig.
        3.2] --- Two graphite crucibles (approx 2.5" x 5") cover each
        other top and bottom. The upper crucible has a 10 mm Hole,
        surrounded by a ceramic ring, which acts as an insulator. Into
        this hole a carbon rod (0.25" diam) is inserted until it reaches
        the 2 or 3 grams of carbon powder placed at the bottom of the
        lower crucible, which has one or two small holes at the lower
        part of its side wall for circulation of air. An iron base
        placed under the lower crucible acts as another electric pole.
        As the carbon rod approaches the powder, the electric arc
        arises. Continuing the operation for 20 to 30 minutes, the
        carbon powder changes to iron. In this experiment, the applied
        electricity is about 35 to 50 volts/8 to 18 amps, either AC or
        DC. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Method 2</i>: Transmutation in Water ---
        Using two carbon rods (0.25" diam.), create an electric arc
        between them, striking them on one another in water. This
        operation is performed for 1 to 5 seconds. Then, brown-black
        metallic powder (which contains iron) falls down to the bottom
        of the water. </p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Method</i> 3: Transmutation in Air ---
        Carbon powder is placed on a copper plate, approximately 12"
        long, 6" wide, and 0.5" thick. This plate works as an electrical
        ground. A carbon rod (0.25" diam.) used as the other electrical
        pole, is struck repeatedly to the carbon powder on the plate,
        producing an electric arc. The carbon powder changes into iron.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "During the process of this transmutation,
        nickel is temporarily produced as a short-lived radioactive
        isotope. The degree of transmutation from C and O is
        approximately 5% to 20% immediately, with a larger percent of
        transmutation occurring gradually in the air, which has the
        effect of cooling the metallic powder to below room
        temperature." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In another experimental configuration (Fig.
        3.3), the reaction was cooled by dry ice. When sparked with
        carbon rods, the CO<sub>2</sub> vapors also yielded iron, etc. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1994, R. Sundaresan and J.Bockris (Texas
        A&amp;M) reported that they had observed "Anomalous Reactions
        During Arcing Between Carbon Rods In Water: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spectroscopically pure carbon rods were
        subjected to a carbon arc in highly purified water. The arc
        current varied from 20 to 25 A and was passed intermittently for
        several hours. The original carbon contained ~ 2 ppm Fe. The C
        rods remained cool to the touch at &gt;2 cm from their tips.
        Adsorption of iron from water or the surrounding atmosphere was
        established as not being the cause of the increase of iron.
        There is a weak correlation between the iron formed and the time
        of passage of current. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When dissolved O<sub>2</sub> was replaced
        by N<sub>2 </sub>in the solution, no iron was formed. Hence,
        the mechanism </p>
      <p>2 <sub>6</sub>C<sup>12</sup> + 2 <sub>8</sub>O<sup>18</sup>Þ<sub>26</sub>Fe<sup>56</sup>
        + <sub>2</sub>He<sup>4</sup> </p>
      <p>was suggested as the origin of the iron. The increase in
        temperature of the solution was consistent with expectation
        based on this reaction." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in 1994, another group of researchers
        (M. Singh, <i>et al.</i>) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
        (Bombay) reported their "Verification of the G. Ohsawa
        Experiment for Anomalous Production of Iron from Carbon Arc in
        Water: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A direct current arc was run between
        ultrapure graphite electrodes dipped in ultrapure water for 1-20
        hours. The graphite residue collected at the bottom of the water
        trough was analyzed for Fe content by a conventional
        spectrographic method... The Fe content was fairly high,
        depending on the duration of the arcing... The results showed
        large variations in Fe content (50 to 2000 ppm) in the C
        residue. In the second series of experiments... with the water
        trough fully covered, the amount of Fe in the carbon residue
        decreased significantly (20-100 ppm). Here also there were large
        variations in the iron concentration in the residue, although
        the experiments were performed under identical conditions.
        Whether Fe is really being synthesized through transmutation
        from C and O as suggested by George Ohsawa or is getting
        concentrated to different degrees through some other phenomenon
        is not currently clear. The Fe in the C residue was also
        analyzed by mass spectroscopy for the abundance of various
        isotopes... Besides Fe, the presence of other elements like Si,
        Ni, Al, and Cr was also determined in the C residue, and it was
        found that the variation of their concentrations followed the
        same pattern as that of Fe." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1996, Kenjin Sasaki reported his
        successful experimental replication of the carbon arc production
        of iron. He used a 99.9999% pure graphite crucible and rod with
        a 100V/10A electric welder. The crucible was cooled. The arc
        (8-10A) struck high-purity carbon powder 4 times for 1 minute
        each time. The yield of iron was recovered with a magnet.
        Further experiments conducted by C. Akbar (Kushi Research
        Institute) "indicate that voltage potential and current density
        are important in the formation of iron in chemically pure
        carbon." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toby Grotz also conducted this experiment
        and reported the results in detail in 1996. He tested activated
        charcoal, activated carbon, and coal. No iron was produced from
        charcoal, but activated carbon did yield magnetic material.
        Tests were performed with copper and aluminum plates and rods to
        eliminate the possibility that the carbon rod and copper plate
        might be releasing iron: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This amount [0.22 gr] of iron is an order
        of magnitude less than that which occurs naturally in the
        sample... The excess weight appears to be due to magnetic
        material that is part of or encased in particles of carbon...
        There is a point at which no more magnetic material may be
        removed from the sample using the arc discharge process. It is
        proposed here that the high current density of the arc discharge
        magnetizes magnetic material that exists within the particles of
        the activated carbon. This then allows separation of the
        magnetic material from the sample using a magnet..." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J. Bockris and associates replicated the
        experiment using the underwater arcing method, and found only
        microgram amounts of iron after 24 hours. When the experiment
        was repeated with the reaction vessel covered to exclude air, no
        iron was found. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those results suggest that at least some of
        the reported yields of iron might be due to the arc coagulating
        ORMEs (Orbitally Rearranged Monoatomic Elements) existing in the
        Earth's atmosphere. ORMEs are virtually undetectable by all
        conventional methods except infrared analysis, which can
        distinguish a certain characteristic doublet. As David Hudson
        discovered in the 1980s, ORMEs can be converted to metallic form
        by certain processes involving carbon or nitrogen, which are
        used to insert an electron in the <i>d</i> orbital shell of the
        atoms. The complete process is described in his Australian
        patent. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Joseph McKibben has published his
        suggestion that the transmutative production of iron from carbon
        may be due to what he calls a subquark particle, which has a
        mass of about 1.15 nucleons: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The subquark, when attached the <sup>4</sup>He
seemed
to













        me to be an ideal candidate for an ideal catalytic agent." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1980s, Michio Kushi resumed his
        experiments with the "aim of finding methods of mass
        production": </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time I shall be able to consider
        how to present to the world the transmutation of the atom using
        the principles of Yin and Yang for the future world industry. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The transmutation of the atom can be
        achieved if elements are changed into the state of plasma, and
        if these elements are well understood in their antagonistic and
        complementary relations to other elements, according to the
        principles of Yin and Yang. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The atomic number, mass, density, and
        gravity, physical reaction to temperature such as melting and
        boiling points, chemical reactions to other elements, reactions
        to specific environmental factors, such as ultraviolet and
        infrared wavelengths applied to the elements, as well as
        spectroscopic color analysis --- all of these characteristics of
        the atom can contribute to classify the atom into the Yin group
        or Yang group... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing is solely Yin or Yang: everything
        involves polarity. There is nothing neuter. Either Yin or Yang
        is in excess in every occurrence. Large Yin attracts small Yin;
        larger Yang attracts small Yang. At extremes, Yin produces Yang,
        and Yang produces Yin. All physical forms and objects are Yang
        at the center and Yin at the surface." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hydrogen, the center of the atomic spiral,
        is Yang. It gathers particles to itself, forming the first
        octave of creation. The conditions become apparent upon studying
        the melting and boiling points of the first eight elements. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Within the first octave, the greatest
        attraction is between carbon and oxygen, which represent Yin and
        Yang respectively. It is the fugate interaction of these two
        that form the other elements. Carbon is often replaced by boron.
        In terms of Yin and Yang, these are like brothers in that they
        react in similar ways in forming new elements." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since George Ohsawa and Michio Kushi
        conducted their initial experiments in the 1970s, several other
        researchers have reported the same results and more, thanks to
        modern analytical equipment, computers, and communication. The
        worlds of low-energy transmutations have become much more
        accessible to us. New discoveries are being reported at an
        increasing rate in the scientific literature, particularly cold
        fusion and biological transmutations. Perhaps within a few
        decades we shall see the mass production of elements on demand.

          Jovitschitsch</font></b>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1908, Milorad Z. Jovivitsch
        (Bergau-Akademie in Belgrad) published two unique articles in
        the journal <i>Monatschrift fur Chemie</i>, describing "The
        Mysterious Deficiency of Carbon in the Condensation Products
        from Ethylene and Acetylene." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jovivitsch had been experimenting with
        electrical discharges in these gases, following the methods used
        by Berthelot.The latter had shown that the action of a silent
        electric discharge upon saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons
        will split off hydrogen and produce condensation products. <b>(4,












          6, 12)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jovivitsch introduced pure dry ethylene or
        acetylene and oxygen into an ozonizer containing copper oxide,
        and electrified the mixture with 100 volts/3 amps for 3 days and
        2 nights. His analysis of the resulting compounds showed a
        deficiency in the theoretical amount of carbon and hydrogen, and
        an excess of oxygen. Several determinations of the carbon and
        hydrogen taken together indicated a 7% deficiency in the
        ethylene reaction product, and a 22% deficiency in the case of
        acetylene. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Berthelot had accounted for these losses by
        attributing them to oxygen absorption from the atmosphere.
        Jovivitsch excluded that possibility by employing pure gases,
        and he immediately preserved the products in hermetically sealed
        tubes. There was practically no possibility of absorbing any
        significant amount of atmospheric oxygen. He also determined
        that the condensed ethylene loses no carbon on exposure to air,
        and that the condensed acetylene remains unchanged after many
        weeks. Comparative analysis of the reaction products preserved
        in tubes and those exposed to air showed them to be in close
        agreement. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jovivitsch attempted to explain the
        scientific riddle of this chemical anomaly by attributing it
        either to experimental error or the transformation of elements.
        Because he took great care and made very precise analyses,
        Jovivitsch was convinced that a transmutation had occurred. His
        opinion was reinforced by the fact that the condensation
        products were <u>radioactive</u>. </p>

            De Boismenu</font></b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1913, the French engineer<b> </b>M.E. De
        Boismenu, the director of an electric carbide furnace plant in
        Paris, announced the issuance of his patent for a very easy new
        method to produce artificial diamonds in an electric furnace.
        The largest specimens produced at that time was 2-1/2
        millimeters in diameter; it was "cut with 32 facets with
        remarkable dexterity." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furnace was built of refractory brick
        and had two carbon electrodes (6-1/2" diam.), one of which could
        be adjusted manually. The bed was packed with a mixture of
        powdered lime and carbon; this was found to be the best way to
        support a trough, made of fused calcium carbide (CaC), in which
        the carbon electrodes operated. The trough was filled with 8 lb
        of CaC fragments and melted (34 V/800 A /6 hr). More CaC was
        piled on the trough, and the whole was covered with more of the
        lime-carbon mixture, and finally with refractory bricks. The
        furnace was run for another 12 hours. The negative pole became
        covered with a black carbonaceous deposit weighing about 700 gr.
        The mass was soaked in water and the diamonds were picked out;
        their size varied from 1/2 to 2-1/2 mm diameter. The last
        reported run of the furnace (12 hr @ 700-800 A/24-25 V) produced
        over a dozen diamonds, some as large as 1/10 inch diameter. They
        were indistinguishable from natural diamonds.<b> (21)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar method was developed by Felix
        Sebba, a chemical engineer at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
        &amp; State University (Blacksburg, VA). He improved on the
        technique developed by Charles V. Burton in 1905 (C dissolved in
        molten Pb-Ca, then cooled). Sebba dissolved calcium carbide in
        molten lead. Steam at 550<sup>o</sup> C was passed over the melt
        and reacted with the Ca (but not the Pb), forming calcium
        hydroxide which forms a slag on the surface. Some of the carbon
        crystallizes as diamonds.Although these methods are not
        transmutations, they certainly are most interesting
        allotropisms. <b>(5, 19)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lea Potts was featured in <i>Life</i>
        magazine (March 1993) for his production of diamonds with a
        blowtorch. </p>

            Hannay</font></b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1880, J.B. Hannay of Glasgow made
        diamonds from Dippel's Oil, catalyzed bylithium metal in thick
        iron tubes at red heat. The minute yield (14 mg) of Type B blue
        diamonds exhibited all the characteristics and properties of
        natural diamonds. Hannay was attempting to produce nascent
        carbon. He found that when carbon is liberated from a
        nitrogenous hydrocarbon in the presence of Li, Na, Mg or K at
        red heat and high pressure, the metal hydride is formed, and the
        carbon reacts with (or is stabilized by) the nitrogen and
        assumes diamond form. No diamonds were found in experiments
        without N. <b>(8, 9)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dippel's Oil is a nitrogenous by-product of
        the dry distillation manufacture of bone char. The principal
        N-ingredient is pyridine. The iron tubes were 20" x 4" o.d. x
        1/2" i.d.. Most of them ruptured during the experiments. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The largest yield was obtained from a
        mixture of "paraffin spirit boiling at 75<sup>o </sup>[a
        mixture of light paraffins], 90%, together with 10% of carefully
        rectified bone-oil [Dippel's Oil, bp 115-150<sup>o</sup>]; these
        were placed with metallic Li (4 gr) in an iron tube" (20" x 4"
        o.d. x 1/2" i.d.) which was heated to redness for 14 hours. The
        tubes usually exploded, or the vapors escaped through the porous
        iron, or combined with it. Only 4 experiments (out of 34) were
        successful. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Bakerian Lecture for 1918, Sir
        Charles Parsons reported that he had repeated Hannay's
        experiments without success. He doubted that Hannay had made
        genuine diamonds. Bannister and Lonsdale, however, obtained
        samples of Hannay's diamonds from the British Museum; X-ray
        analysis showed they are genuine. <b>(2, 3, 20)</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hannay's approach to diamonds is
        interesting, but it is not feasible for industrial
        application.Several other methods of manufacturing diamonds have
        been developed since then, but none are so simple as the
        technique developed by De Boismenu. </p>

Dr.

            Brown</font></b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Samuel Brown presented a report to the
        Royal Society of Edinburg in May 1841 concerning his
        "Experimental Researches on the Producton of Silicon from
        Paracyanogen": </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I venture to announce, as the result of my
        inquiries, that carbon and silicon are isomeric bodies, and that
        the former element may be converted into a substance presenting
        all the properties of the latter." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Brown prepared paracyanogen and reacted
        it in various ways to yield residues of silica. The experiments
        were replicated by Dr George Wilson and John C. Brown in August
        1843. Although they obtained residues of silica in several runs
        (8.4 gr in one test), it was probably a contaminant in the
        potassium ferrocyanide. They stated: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We tried the greater number of Dr Brown's
        processes, and rejected them one after another, without pursuing
        their investigation farther, on finding they would not yield
        quantitative proofs of the conversion of carbon into silicon...
        In conclusion we need scarcely say, that we have been unable to
        supply any proof of the transmutability of carbon into silicon."
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof Liebig also reported negative results:
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have repeated all the experiments of Dr
        Brown on the production of silicon from paracyanogen, but we
        have not been able to confirm one of his results. What our
        experiments prove is, that paracyanogen is decomposed by a
        strong heat into nitrogen gas, and a residue of charcoal, which
        is exceedingly difficult of combustion." <b>(24)</b> </p>
