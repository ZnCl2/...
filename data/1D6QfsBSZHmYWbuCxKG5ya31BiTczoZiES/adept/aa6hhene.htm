Dozens








            of scientific papers were published between 1905 and 1927
            concerning the mysterious appearance of hydrogen, helium and
            neon in vacuum tubes. The matter has not been resolved.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The










            first such report, written by Clarence Skinner, was
            published in <i>The Physical Review</i> in July 1905:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"While










            making an experimental study of the cathode fall of various
            metals in helium it was observed that no matter how
            carefully the gas was purified the hydrogen radiation,
            tested spectroscopically, persistently appeared in the
            cathode glow..."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Skinner










            eventually located its source in the cathode. <b>(26)</b></font></font>

In










            1912, Sir William Ramsay reported "The Presence of Helium in
            the Gas from the Interior of an X-Ray Tube", and J.J.
            Thomson published an article "On the Appearance of Helium
            and Neon in Vacuum Tubes" in 1913. Thomson was investigating
            a new gas called X<sub>3 </sub>(atomic weight 3: tritium),
            a polymerized form of hydrogen. He used the positive ray
            method to detect the helium and neon because it is more
            sensitive than spectral analysis and provides much more
            definite data. There was no apparent connection between the
            type of gas used to fill the tubes and the appearance of the
            new gases (X<sub>3</sub> line 3 in H, N, He, O, and air; Ne
            line 20 in H, N, O, HCl, and air). Another line often
            appeared corresponding to atomic weight 10; it is probably
            due to neon with two charges of electricity, but brighter
            than expected. <b>(22, 23, 29, 30)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The










            experimental apparatus was a large glass bulb fitted with
            aluminum electrodes; the discharge was produced by an
            induction coil. Thomson described it as follows:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The










            positive rays for the analysis of the gases were produced in
            a vessel containing gases at a low pressure. I shall call
            this the testing vessel; the vessel in which the various
            processes for generating X<sub>3</sub>, were tried (the
            experimenting chamber) was sealed on to the testing vessel,
            but separated from it by a tap. Thus the pressure in the
            experimenting chamber was not restricted to being the same
            as that in the testing vessel, but might have the value
            which seemed most appropriate for any particular type of
            experiment. After these experiments were over, the tap was
            turned and some of the gas from the experimenting chamber
            let into the testing vessel; a photograph was then taken,
            and by comparing it with one taken before turning on the tap
            the new gases present in the experiment chamber could be
            detected."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thomson










            finally determined that the gases were being occluded by the
            electrodes. He concluded:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"These










            gases are present in the metal independently of the
            bombardment, and are liberated by the action of the kathode
            rays.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I










            would also like to direct attention to the analogy between
            the effects just described and an everyday experience with
            discharge tubes --- I mean the difficulty of getting these
            tubes free from hydrogen when the test is made by a
            sensitive method like that of the positive rays. Though you
            may heat the glass of the tube to melting point, may dry the
            gases by liquid air or cooled charcoal, and free the gases
            you let into the tube as carefully as you will from
            hydrogen, you will still get the hydrogen lines by the
            positive ray method, even when the bulb has been running
            several hours a day for nearly a year. The only exception is
            when oxygen is kept continuously running through the tube,
            and this, I think, is due, not to lack of liberation of
            hydrogen, but to the oxygen combining with the small
            quantity of hydrogen liberated, just as it combines with the
            mercury vapor and causes the disappearance of the mercury
            lines. I think this production of hydrogen in the tube is
            quite analogous to the production of X<sub>3</sub>, of
            helium, and of neon." <b>(31)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prof.










            N.J. Collie and H. Patterson conducted the early stages of
            their work independently and from different points of view.
            They began collaborating when they learned they were getting
            the same results. Patterson was interested in the pure
            physics of the electron, and had developed a hypothesis that
            "by doubling the electrical charge on hydrogen atoms, it
            might be possible to convert this into an a particle, and so
            into helium." He got neon instead. The experimenters took
            all due precautions against error, yet they repeatedly
            obtained traces of helium and neon. The tubes were
            surrounded by an exterior vessel which was evacuated, or
            contained neon or helium; the same results were obtained. In
            one such experiment, Prof. Collie tested the
            vacuum-evacuated exterior vessel and found helium with neon.
            Patterson replicated the experiment, and then repeated it
            with an oxygen atmosphere in the exterior tube. Neon was
            found therein. It appeared that neon was formed by a union
            of helium and oxygen. They also performed numerous blank
            experiments to exclude the possibility of contamination from
            various sources. <b>(4, 9, 21)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
R.J.










            Strutt and other workers found no helium in their
            experiments. <b>(11, 15, 27)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In










            1914, Collie reported his "Attempts to Produce the Rare
            Gases by Electric Discharge." Finely powdered, heated
            uranium was placed in a cathode discharge bombardment tube;
            the equipment was carefully purged in several ways. 1-2
            hours of electrical treatment yielded traces of helium and
            neon in 11 experiments. Collie concluded:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"If










            the neon and helium found were due to an air leak, it is
            difficult to account for the disappearance of the argon,
            which should have been present to the extent of one thousand
            times as much as the neon and helium found. The amount of
            argon present, however, was too little to be measured, as it
            made no difference in the volume of neon and helium... The
            presence of the nitrogen is probably due to a nitride of
            uranium... That comparatively large amounts of neon and
            helium should come off from uranium by bombardment with the
            cathode rays, and not by heating, is a matter of interest;
            also that in one experiment a change of coil should affect
            the result is an observation that must if possible be
            repeated...</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"That










            the presence of neon and helium in vacuum tubes, after the
            electric discharge has been passed, is due to an air leak
            seems most improbable. Where the gases come from has yet to
            be proved. They have been found by Sir J.J. Thomson, by Sir
            William Ramsay, by Mr. G. Winchester, and by the author [J.
            N. Collie], Mr. Hubert S. Patterson, and Mr. Irvine
            Masson... Whatever the source may be, it is only by further
            experiments that the question will be resolved..."</font></font>

Collie,










            Patterson, and Masson described the electrical circuit,
            discharge tubes and testing apparatus, precautions and
            controls, bombardment experiments, results, and possible
            sources of the gases in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal
              Society of London</i> (1914).</font></font> </p>

"The










            coils gave 12-inch sparks with either a mercury or a hammer
            interrupter. The nature of the break has some influence on
            the result of the experiment; in the case of a mercury
            break, better results were obtained with a rectifier. The
            current in the secondary circuit averaged a few millamperes.
            The form of the discharge tubes varied from simple spectrum
            bulbs with disc electrodes to elaborate jacketed designs.
            The gases employed were generated by chemical and electrical
            methods and were tested for purity." <b>(7)</b></font></font>

The










            testing apparatus was either directly connected to the
            discharge tube, or the gases were transferred by means of an
            inverted siphon over mercury after being pumped from the
            reaction vessel. Hydrogen was removed by exploding it with
            oxygen in a burette or in the collection tube, which had
            platinum wires sealed in it. In some designs, the hydrogen
            was removed by copper oxide and phosphorus pentoxide. Oxygen
            and moisture were removed by cooled charcoal, liquid air,
            and Na-K alloy. The He and Ne were collected in a fine
            capillary tube with a fine platinum wire sealed through the
            top:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"It










            is found that the minimum quantity of neon detectable
            probably equals that contained in a few cubic millimeters of
            atmospheric air. If, owing to defective working, the neon
            actually was atmospheric, the accompanying argon would be
            very easily seen (as the ratio Ar:Ne in air is about 700:1)
            when the particular method used was such as might have
            eliminated nitrogen beforehand; in the apparatus depicted,
            nitrogen naturally made its presence at once evident if a
            very small part of a cubic millimeter of air was present...
            In many of the experiments, the total volume of gas used was
            so small that even if it had been all atmospheric air, it
            could not have accounted for the quantities of the neon, and
            still less for those of the helium, which were obtained...
            We wish to point out that a great many of our experiments
            have yielded negative results, for as yet unexplained
            reasons."</font></font> </p>

The










            electrodes were made of Pd, Cu, Pb, Tl, Li, Na, K, Al, and
            Mg. Some bombardment experiments were conducted with
            anti-cathodes of Pt, Tl, U, KF, KCl, KI, RbCl, Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,
            CaO, and BeO. <b>(14)</b></font></font> </p>

Besides










            the several precautions against air-leaks, Collie, <i>et al</i>.,
tested










            for nitrogen; The ratio of N<sub>2</sub>:Ne in air is about
            80,000:1; therefore:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            quantity...</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"If










            atmospheric contamination occurs at any point after the run,
            nitrogen must infallibly be detected during the examination.
            If any contamination occurs before the run, it would
            likewise instantly be made manifest on the first passage of
            the discharge through the experimental tube. It is only when
            an infinitesimally slow leak goes on during the run that it
            is possible that no nitrogen could be seen at any time; and
            to provide against this contingency an additional control is
            necessary, namely the absence of argon from the gas... The
            argon test is in reality superfluously delicate as a
            control; nevertheless it was used.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"In










            all experiments where helium was the chief product,
            atmospheric contamination is <i>ipso facto</i> excluded...
            contamination seems to be thoroughly excluded in all the
            experiments."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two










            hypotheses remained to explain the origin of the He and Ne:
            permeation through the walls of the tubes, and previous
            occlusion from them. Since positive results were obtained
            with electrodeless tubes, the electrodes can be eliminated
            as a source. In addition, when Al and other metals were
            melted <i>in vacuo</i>, no gases were occluded, but did so
            when the metals were bombarded; no He pre-existed in the
            metals. When Al was dissolved in KOH solution, no He or Ne
            was liberated. Melting the glass tubes <i>in vacuo</i>
            yielded no He or Ne. Two specimens of old glass (one
            Egyptian, approximately 1500 years old; another, Kien-lung
            Chinese) were examined; neither yielded He or Ne.</font></font>

The










            authors closed their report with this note:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"We










            have endeavored to put the facts of the case as fully as
            possible, without reference to any preconceived theory. It
            is not our view that our experiments rigidly exclude all the
            possibilities which have been mentioned; but it is evident
            that the trend of the results is toward conclusions which,
            if they turn out to be true, would be of very obvious
            importance."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The










            issue then lay dormant for several years, but research was
            resumed after World War One. In 1926, Prof. Fritz Paneth and
            Dr. K. Peters determined that palladium had effected the
            transmutation of hydrogen to helium in their experiments.
            Paneth and Peters absorbed H in colloidal Pd (sponge, black,
            or palladinised charcoal) for 12 hours, after which time
            they detected the main spectral lines of He. No He
            production was observed with Pd preparations that had not
            absorbed hydrogen. Preparations of Pd stored at room
            temperature should therefore produce He; this was found to
            be the case. After the He had been removed, the sample was
            stored again, then examined; more helium was obtained. The
            experiment was repeated three times with the same results.<b>

            authors excluded all the possible sources of error in their
            experiments, such as the ingress of atmospheric He,
            absorption in glass or electrodes, preferential absorption
            of He by Pd, and the possibility of He being formed as a
            product of radioactive disintegration of Pd. No trace was
            detected of any energy liberated during the transformation,
            either as heat or radiation.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It










            would seem worthwhile and desirable to replicate these
            experiments with modern equipment and techniques.</font></font>
