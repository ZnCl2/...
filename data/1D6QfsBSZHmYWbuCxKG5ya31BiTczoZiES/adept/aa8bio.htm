      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long
            before the discovery of "cold fusion" by Pons and
            Fleischman, other scientists had variously found phenomenal
            evidence of non-radioactive, low-energy transmutation of
            light elements in plant, animals and minerals. These
            reactions have come to be known as "biological
            transmutations" or "nuclido-biological reactions". This
            class of nuclear reactions is of great importance to the
            progress of human knowledge in the fields of physics,
            cosmology, biology, geology, ecology, medicine, nutrition
            and agriculture. The exact mechanisms of biological
            transmutations remain unknown, though a few theories have
            been proposed to explain them. Biological transmutations
            exist and cannot be denied; they are the very core of living
            nature, which could not function without them.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            study of biological transmutation can be said to have begun
            in the 17th century with the famous experiment by von
            Helmont, who grew a willow tree in a clay vase with 200
            pounds of soil. After 5 years, he dried the soil and found
            that its weight had decreased by only 2 ounces: "Water alone
            had, therefore, been sufficient to produce 160 pounds of
            wood, bark and roots" (plus fallen leaves which he did not
            weigh). Presumably, there were some minerals in the water he
            fed to the tree. Nowadays we know that plants form
            carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide, but their
            mineral content is derived from soil, not air. It may be
            possible, however, that the ORMEs (Orbitally Rearranged
            Monoatomic Elements), discovered by David Hudson in the
            1980s, exist in the atmosphere and are utilized by plants.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            1799, the French chemist Vauquelin became intrigued by the
            quantity of lime which hens excrete every day. He isolated a
            hen and fed it a pound of oats that was analyzed for lime
            (CaO). Vauquelin analyzed the eggs and feces and found five
            times more Ca was excreted than was consumed. He concluded
            that lime had been created, but could not figure out how it
            happened.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            1822, the English physiologist Prout studied the increase of
            calcium carbonate inside incubating chicken eggs, and was
            able to show that it was not contributed by the shell.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            1831, Choubard germinated watercress seeds in clean glass
            vessels and showed that the sprouts contained minerals which
            did not previously exist in the seeds.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            1844, Vogel also found evidence of biological transmutation.
            J.J. Berzelius reported the experiment in his <i>Treatise
              on Mineral, Plant and Animal Chemistry</i> (1849):</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He
            sprouted seeds of cress... in crushed glass deprived of
            sulfate or of any other sulfurous compound; he watered them
            with distilled water, covered them with a glass cloche and
            analyzed the air of the room, so as to determine the
            sulfur... A few months later, the adult plants with ripe
            seeds, were dried and burnt with a mixture of potassium
            nitrate and potassium carbonate; the result was that a
            quantity of sulfuric acid double that which was contained in
            the seeds was produced. These experiments demonstrate that
            either sulfur is not a simple element or that the source
            which produced the sulfur has remained unknown, despite all
            the care which had been taken to discover it..." <b>(1)</b></font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circa
            1850, Lauwes and Gilbert observed an inexplicable variation
            in the amount of magnesium in the ashes of plants.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From
            1875-1883, von Herzeele conducted 500 analyses that verified
            an increase in weight in the ashes of plants grown without
            soil in a controlled medium. He concluded that, "Plants are
            capable of effecting the transmutation of elements". His
            publications so outraged the scientific community of the
            time, that they were removed from libraries. His writings
            were lost for more than 50 years until a collection was
            found in Berlin by Dr. Hauscka, who subsequently published
            von Herzeele's findings.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M.
            Baranger (Ecole Polytechnique, Paris) became intrigued with
            Von Herzeele's experiments, but he thought that the number
            of trials had been too limited and the precautions against
            error were insufficient. Baranger decided to repeat the
            experiments with all possible precautions and a very large
            number of cases that would allow a statistical study. His
            research project lasted four years and involved thousands of
            analyses. Baranger verified the content of P, K, and Ca of
            vetch seeds before and after germination in twice-distilled
            water to which pure calcium chloride was/was not added.
            Hundreds of lots of 7-10 grams each were selected, weighed
            to 1/100th milligram, and graded, then germinated in a
            controlled environment. Baranger found a significant
            decrease in P in the Ca-series of tests. Non-germinated
            seeds and seeds germinated in the distilled water showed no
            significant change in their levels of K. Those seeds treated
            with CaCl<sub>2</sub> showed a 10% increase in their K
            content.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None
            of the specialists who examined Baranger's work were able to
            find any experimental errors. Baranger concluded:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These
            results, obtained by taking all possible precautions,
            confirm the general conclusions proposed by V. Herzeele and
            lead one to think that under certain conditions the plants
            are capable of forming elements which did not exist before
            in the external environment.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[The
            practical consequences] cannot be underestimated... Certain
            plants would bring to the soil some elements useful for the
            growth of other plants; this would lead us especially to
            define and revise the current notions on fallows, rotations,
            mixed crop, fertilizers and the manuring of infertile soils.
            Nothing prevents us from thinking that certain plants are
            capable of producing rare elements of industrial
            importance....</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In
            the sub-atomic field, the plant supplies us with an example
            of transformation which we are not capable of performing in
            the laboratory without bringing into action particles of
            high-energy... It seems that the theoretical consequences in
            the field of sub-atomic physics are not negligible."</font></font>

            1946, Henri Spindler, (Director of the Laboratoire Maritime
            de Dinard) investigated the origin of iodine in seaweed, and
            found that the algae <i>Laminaria</i> manufactured iodine
            out of water which contained none of the element. <b>(16)</b></font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.
            Perrault (Paris University) found that the hormone

            plasma K reaches approximately 350 mg/liter.</font></font> </p>

            1959, Dr. Julien (Univ. of Besancon) proved that if tenches

            KCl increases 36% within 4 hours. <b>(5)</b></font></font>

            Kervran (Univ. of Paris) was the most avid researcher of
            biological transmutation, and his work in the field earned
            him a nomination for the Nobel Prize. Kervran elucidated
            several of these nuclear reactions and verified them:</font></font>

            vital phenomenon is not of a chemical order... The nucleus
            of the atom in light elements is quite different from what
            nuclear physics regards as the average type, the latter
            having value only for the heavy elements... Nature moves
            particles from one nucleus to another --- particles such as
            hydrogen and oxygen nuclei and, in some cases, the nuclei of
            carbon and lithium. There is thus a transmutation...
            Biological transmutation is a phenomenon completely
            different from the atomic fissions or fusions of physics...
            it reveals a property of matter not seen prior to this work.

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All
            transmutations proposed by Kervran have two traits in
            common: (1) The initial and final nuclei differ by the
            addition or subtraction of a piece of matter, e.g., a proton
            (a hydrogen nucleus...), an alpha particle (a helium
            nucleus), a nucleus of oxygen or one of its isotopes, or
            perhaps some other familiar nuclei; (2) There is an energy
            excess or deficit in the order of 0.01 atomic mass units
            (a.m.u.)... or 20 electron masses, or 10 MeV, or 1.6 x 10<sup>-12</sup>
            joules. The mass equivalent of this energy gap is of course
            needed in order to have the Lavoisier principle safe... This
            energy gap is very much larger than those occurring in
            chemical reactions. For example, if ... hens are indeed
            transmuting potassium into calcium (which is an
            exo-energetic reaction), the power they are radiating is so
            huge that it would, if in the luminous (electromagnetic)
            form, set everything on fire all around! [In energetic
            terms, such flux would be equal to 10<sup>15</sup> MeV/cm<sup>2</sup>/second,
or









            160 watts/cm<sup>2</sup>] Can we then imagine some sort of
            quasi-occult form into which the 'Kervran power gap' may be
            radiated (or from which it may be absorbed in the case of
            endo-energetic reactions)? No reasonable answer was
            available until... a bold theoretical assumption, due to
            Weinberg in 1967, turned out as experimentally true. Due to
            this 'neutral current hypothesis' we are allowed to write
            such nuclear reactions as:</font></font> </p>

            + v « p' + v' ; or: p + <u>v</u>« p' + <u>v</u>' ; or: p «

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">where p denotes a proton,
            v a neutrino, and<u>v</u> the anti-neutrino. We even have
            two sorts of neutrinos to play with: the electronic and the
            muonic one.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With
            this we can in principle handle the proton type of Kervran's

            of the two protons in the reaction would be a quasi-free
            one, that is, one with only the trivial, chemical binding.
            The other one would be bound inside the nucleus. Of course
            we then have the problem of getting the proton, with its
            electric charge, through the potential barrier of the
            nucleus, by the so-called 'tunnel effect' (a typical effect
            of wave mechanics). But this is part of a problem already
            mentioned: Life playing the information game, the field
            being the nucleus, and the rules being those of the wavelike
            probability calculus... If the Kervran hen does radiate the
            power gap in the form of neutrinos and/or anti-neutrino,
            this will be done in the quietest fashion, and go on
            completely unnoticed.</font></font> </p>

            we also handle in this way the endo-energetic reactions?
            Fortunately Nature provides us with an appropriate supply,

            flying around us as part of the so-called cosmic rays. By
            another chance the upper limit of the energy per cosmic

            we to reconcile this with the hypothesis that the hen is a

            occult mass bound to a particle of complete spin; it is thus
            that the neutrino with a 1/2 spin was invented... you would
            need a particle of complete spin with normally very weak
            interactions with matter, but 'catalyzed' biologically; it
            would not displease me, within this perspective, to try the

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his
            response (7 January 1974), Kervran attributed the
            transmutations in plants in part to the power of enzymes:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a
            Petri dish 9 cm. in diameter I started germinating 50 oat
            seeds. The culture continued for 6 weeks or 3.6 million
            seconds give or take a few ten thousands of seconds... The
            area of 'cosmic interaction' was 63 cm<sup>3</sup>... During
            this time on this surface 3.9 mg of K were transmuted into
            Ca; this must be ~ 6 x 10<sup>19</sup> atoms of K transmuted
            in 3.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> seconds or 1.8 x 10<sup>13</sup>
            atoms per second or 2.6 x 10<sup>11</sup> per cm<sup>2</sup>/second.








            The proportion of K transmuted was ~ 46% in 6 weeks. This
            integration of results for the phenomenon is not constant:
            it is imperceptible during the first days when one witnesses
            the synthesis of enzymes which will provoke the
            transmutations; even at the end of a week the effect is
            hardly to be noticed. It develops rapidly during the 2nd and
            3rd weeks, then slows down during the 4th week... The
            phenomenon seems to be asymptotic and at the end of the 6th
            week transmutation progresses only very slowly.. Which
            demonstrates yet once again that the action of the ambient
            is insufficient, that there is an energy regulated by the
            metabolism of the germination and growth which is at the
            origin of these transmutations... Obviously this calculation
            was one for a macro-section and not for the effective
            section... Moreover, there is in biology an important
            phenomenon which must not be overlooked: some molecules
            assemble in helix shapes (DNA and RNA for example). There
            are also some oriented assemblages which polarize light,
            most often to the left. These oriented constructions have an
            oriented electromagnetic field, and a molecule such as DNA
            can be compared to a solenoid in which charged particles (mu<sup>-</sup>
            for example) are somehow partly channeled in the interior,
            and thus concentrated..."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De
            Beauregard made a suggestion:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            microorganisms responsible for the phenomenon would find in
            the natural radiation a sufficient store of neutrinos of 10
            MeV and more than they need... A diminution of this
            alimentation would consist of an equal numerical flux of
            neutrinos of very low energy to be put in the free
            interstices of the natural distribution. It is a problem of
            the symmetric information... in which (in thermodynamic
            terms) the difference between the 'heat' gained from the hot
            source (high energy neutrinos) and that given to the cold
            source (low energy neutrinos) is converted not into work,
            but into internal energy, or into the rest mass of the
            machine, which is not cyclical... Analogous comments apply
            to the case... implying an absorption of a pair, neutrino
            and anti-neutrino, of an average energy of 5 MeV... [The
            reactions] avail themselves of an abundant hot source like a
            geyser (the neutrinos of average energy of the cosmic
            radiation within the atmosphere) and of an immense cold
            source like an ocean, 'Fermi's lake' of very low energy
            neutrinos."</font></font> </p>

            Kervran also proposed a revolutionary theory about the
            genesis of coal and oil:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coal
            comes from schists, fabricated <i>in situ</i>, by high
            compression that produced the reactions: Si = C + O. If O
            could not escape, and was compressed as well, one would have
            O + O = S, from which one gets sulfurous coals. If there was
            no deformation, the coal remains mixed with argil to produce
            ampelite."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            presence of carbon in metamorphic and silicate rocks, formed
            long before there was any vegetation on Earth, is a clear
            demonstration:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Graphite cannot be of vegetal origin, in which case another
            origin must be found for it, and I propose the silicium of
            these Archaean rocks. As for diamonds... here, too, one
            observes the presence of silicates, thus of silicon... In
            this way one can explain why all coal deposits contain
            silicon (up to 20%, or even 40%, and more) which form
            'ashes'. The great amounts of silicon might be an indication
            that the transmutation from Si to C + O was imperfect,
            incomplete."</font></font> </p>

            Kervran claimed that petroleum was not formed from flesh or
            plants, but from the reaction Mg = C + C at great depth. If
            water is present, the hydrogen combines with carbon, and the
            oxygen forms sulfur (O + O = S), giving sulfurous oil. The
            Mg can come from a pocket of saline water when Na + H = Mg.
            Otherwise, Mg also can come from Ca or from adjacent layers
            of dolomitic rock. Oil deposits in the Sahara have been
            found in pre-Carboniferous rocks (Devonian and
            Cambrian-Ordovician) and in dolomite. Usually there is no
            communication between layers of petroleum deposits of
            different composition that are widely separated by hundreds
            of meters of impermeable rock. Kervran concluded:</font></font>
