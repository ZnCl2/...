      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            March 1924, Prof. Hantaro Nagaoka, <i>et al.</i> (Tokyo
            Imperial University), described their studies on satellites
            of the spectral lines of isotopes of mercury and bismuth, in
            which they detected gold. In May 1925, they reported some of
            the technical details: Nagaoka and his co-workers discharged
            about 15 x 10<sup>4</sup> volts/cm for 4 hours between
            tungsten and mercury terminals under a dielectric layer of
            paraffin oil. They used the Purple of Cassius test to detect
            gold in the viscous residue of C, Hg, etc. The black mass
            was purified <i>in vacuo</i>, then by combustion with
            oxygen and extraction with HCl to yield Au, either in aqua
            regia solution or as ruby-red spots in the glassware.
            Microscopic films of Au were found on occasion. (19, 22)</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Nagaoka stated that when a discharge was passed through
            drops of Hg falling between iron electrodes, the formation
            of silver and other elements was observed. Another run of
            the Hg lamp for more than 200 hours at 226 volts produced a
            milligram of gold, plus some platinum. He noted that it was
            essential to distill the mercury repeatedly below 200<sup>o</sup>C
            to ensure success of the experiment.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Considerations of the satellites of the spectral lines of Hg
            led Nagaoka to the conclusion that a proton is "slightly
            detached" from the nucleus of Hg, and it can be removed:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If
            the above assumption as to the Hg nucleus is valid, we can
            perhaps realize the dream of alchemists by striking out a
            hydrogen-proton from the nucleus by a-rays, or by some other
            powerful methods of disruption [to produce Au from Hg]."
            (21, 26)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At
            about the same time, Professor Adolf Miethe of the
            Photochemical Department at the Berlin Technical High School
            found that the mercury vapor lamps used as a source for
            ultra-violet rays ceased to work after a time because of a
            sooty deposit that formed in the quartz tubes. Miethe tested
            these deposits and detected gold. Subsequently, Dr. Miethe
            and Dr. Hans Stammreich were issued German Patent
            Specification #233,715 (8 May 1924) for "Improvements in or
            Relating to the Extraction of Precious Metals":</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An
            electric arc is formed between mercury poles, in the same
            way as is done in mercury quartz lamps. With sufficient
            difference in potential, gold is then produced in the
            mercury. It is advisable to condense again the evaporated
            mercury. The quantity of gold produced depends, all other
            conditions being equal, on the quantity of current and also,
            among others, on the vapor pressure of the mercury or on the
            difference of potential in the arc. The difference of
            potential in the arc must therefore be sufficiently great.
            If it drops to excessively small amounts, the efficiency
            will be greatly reduced. If the difference of potential is
            increased, the quantity of gold formed will be considerably
            increased, beginning with a certain difference of
            potential." (12)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            July of 1924, Drs. Miethe and Stammreich announced that they
            had changed mercury into gold in a high-tension mercury
            vapor lamp. The experiment produced $1 of gold at a cost of
            $60,000, equivalent to over $2 million (gold then sold for
            $330/lb). Miethe used a potential of 170 volts applied for
            20-200 hours. The lamp consumed 400-2,000 watts. A minimum
            potential difference is necessary. The yield of gold was
            minute: 0.1-0.01 mg. The mercury and the electrodes were
            analyzed and determined to be free of gold before the
            experiments. Miethe was not able to attempt to prove the
            production of alpha or beta rays, hydrogen or helium. (22)</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O.
            Honigschmid and E. Zintl determined the atomic weight of
            Miethe's mercuric Au, using potentiometric titration of
            auric salt with TiCl<sub>2</sub>. It was found to be 197.26,
            which is heavier than ordinary Au (197.2). They emphasized
            the need for a mass spectrographic analysis. (10)</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Frederick Soddy suggested that such a change might be
            effected by attaching an electron to the mercury nucleus:</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Consider the collision of high-speed electrons with mercury
            atoms. A small proportion of these electrons must be
            directed upon the nucleus. If they possess sufficient energy
            to penetrate the external levels of electrons in the mercury
            atom, they must reach the positively charged nucleus and be
            captured by it. Since the loss of an electron (as a b-ray)
            by the nucleus of an element results in the atomic number of
            the element in question being increased by one, the gain of
            an electron by an atomic nucleus must result in the
            diminution of the atomic number by one. This is quite
            general. In the case of an isotope of mercury of atomic
            number 80, the product will be an isotope of gold of atomic
            number 79. Upon existing knowledge it is simply a question
            of (1) the potential sufficient to drive the electron
            through the outer levels of electrons surrounding the
            mercury nucleus until it comes within the sphere of
            attraction of the powerfully charged nucleus; (2) whether
            the exceedingly small fraction of direct collisions with the
            nucleus that is to be anticipated will be sufficient to
            enable the gold produced to be detected.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As
            regards the first, it may be expected that the repulsion of
            the external shell of mercury electrons will diminish rather
            than prevent altogether the chance of the radiant electron
            reaching the nucleus; for once the shell is penetrated, the
            resultant force on the radiant electron must be on the
            average an attraction... The chemical detection of the gold
            produced would probably be the more formidable experimental
            difficulty." (30)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A.S.
            Russell offered this opinion:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
            experiments on the transformation of Hg into Au suggest the
            possibility of the transformation of a nucleus into that of
            the element next below it by the absorption of one electron
            when both nuclei are stable. This occurs most obviously as
            an isobare. The possibility of the existence of two isobares
            of odd mass-number, Tl 205 and Au 199, among non-radioactive
            elements may be inferred from experimental work... Aston has
            shown the existence of the Hg isotope 199... This type of
            transformation may occur in the two pairs of elements Pb and
            Tl, Hg and Au... The masses of the Tl and Au produced are
            205 and 199 respectively".</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aston
            advanced strong arguments against the probability of the
            alleged Hg-Au transmutation. Conceivably it could be
            effected by the addition of an electron to the nucleus of
            Hg, or by removing a proton from it, but the chance of an
            electron hitting a nucleus is extremely remote, and its
            weight would not make a significant contribution.
            Theoretically, a Hg isotope of atomic weight 197 could
            absorb an electron and produce common Au, but none of the
            six Hg isotopes (198, 199, 201, 202, 204, 209) identified by
            Aston have that weight. According to Aston, the removal of a
            proton from the nucleus by Miethe's method is untenable:</font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
            December 1924, the journal <i>Scientific American</i>
            announced that it would arrange for a comprehensive and
            exact test of the Miethe experiment. It was conducted at New
            York University by Prof. H.H. Sheldon and Roger Estey. They
            used a quartz lamp that contained no gold, and pure tungsten
            wires were sealed into the quartz to provide electrical
            contacts. The mercury was tested for purity. Three runs were
            made lasting from 30-50 hours each, at about 170 volts/13
            amperes. The mercury was removed and tested:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In no
            instance was any trace of gold detected... According to
            Prof. Miethe's reports, taken in connection with the
            theoretical interpretation of Prof. Soddy, this experiment
            should have produced a substantial quantity of gold; at
            least ten times as much as could easily have been detected
            by the analytical methods used. The negative result of the
            three experiments established, therefore, a strong
            probability that the transmutation announced by Prof. Miethe
            could not be confirmed. "(27)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            researchers procured from the manufacturers in Germany a
            replica of the lamp used by Miethe, and repeated the exact
            technique described by him. The final run lasted 172 hours,
            at 165-174 volts/12 amps, depending upon the temperature of
            the lamp:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After
            the run the most careful analytical tests failed to show any
            trace whatsoever of the precious metal. It is necessary to
            conclude, therefore, that the experiment described by Prof.
            Miethe does not always result in the transmutation of
            mercury atoms into gold atoms. The experiments recorded by
            Prof. Miethe and our on experiments, conducted as far as
            humanly possible in exactly the method described by Prof.
            Miethe, are entirely discordant with each other.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It
            would be improper to assert on the basis of these results
            alone, that Prof. Miethe's experiments have been proved to
            be definitely wrong. All that is proper to say is that a
            careful, competent, and long continued effort to confirm the
            German results has resulted in an entire failure to do so."</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Scientific








              American</i> offered a suggestion:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One
            very vital possibility of mistake in experiments of this
            character lies in the accidental presence of a small
            impurity of gold in the mercury employed... It is at least
            possible that such was the case... Perhaps it will be
            discovered that some minor and unnoticed detail in the
            arrangements or in the conduct of the experiment was really
            responsible for a successful transmutation in Prof. Miethe's
            case... We must confess, however, that we do not believe
            that this will prove to be the case. On the basis of all the
            evidence now available, including the experiments of Dr.
            Sheldon and Mr. Estey... it is our belief that a
            transmutation of mercury atoms into gold atoms does not
            occur and will not occur under the conditions which have
            been described by Prof. Miethe.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is
            to be freely admitted, of course, that a transmutation of
            mercury atoms into gold atoms is a theoretical possibility.
            The internal structures of the two atoms are similar. The
            removal of one unit of positive electric charge from the
            nucleus of a mercury atom, or the insertion of one
            additional electron into this atomic nucleus would result,
            it is believed, in the conversion of the mercury atom into
            an atom indistinguishable from the ordinary atoms of gold.
            Quite aside from the failure to confirm the results of Prof.
            Miethe, it remains entirely possible that one of these
            changes of atomic structure can be accomplished by some
            physical or chemical method yet to be discovered...</font></font>

            theory, but incredible in fact, for the potential drop per
            mean free path of a Hg molecule is only about 0.1 volt in
            these arcs." (28)</font></font> </p>

            Siemens &amp; Halske Akt.-Ges. registered their German
            Patent Specification (#243,670) in June 1925 for "Treating
            Mercury" with spark discharges, cathode rays, and canal
            rays. The difference of potential could be between
            100-150,000 volts; capacitance was adjustable. Paraffin,
            ether, or carbon tetrachloride were used as dielectrics.

            researchers were not so optimistic. Erich Tiede, <i>et al</i>.,








            reported "The transmutation of Hg into Au is considered
            theoretically possible but all experiments carried out under
            strict control of the original Hg proved to be failures.
            When the Hg, which was purified according to Miethe and
            Stammreich, was distilled in an all-glass apparatus similar
            to the one used by Bronsted and von Hevesey to separate the
            isotopes of Hg, it showed still up to 10<sup>-9</sup>% Au.
            Optical detection is not sufficiently accurate, so they
            considered it necessary to melt the Au granule, which still
            held Hg, and weigh it on a microbalance. (32)</font></font>

            Garrett (Clarendon Lab, Oxford) published completely
            negative results of his repeated attempts to reproduce the
            Hg-Au transmutation experiment by several methods. Garrett
            also attempted to prepare indium from tin, and scandium from
            titanium by X-ray bombardment, also without success. (5)</font></font>

      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Mercury distilled according to Miethe still had 0.3 mg Au
            per kg Hg. After two high-vacuum distillations, no more Au
            could be detected. With this preparation the experiments of
            Miethe were repeated in several forms; no resultant Au
            formation was observed in any case."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.
            Duhme and A. Lotz confirmed this negative finding. Duhme and
            Lotz also conducted numerous experiments with the initial
            cooperation of Miethe and Stammreich. They used very large
            arcs carrying 10 kw at 40 kv/800 A/cm<sup>2</sup> through Hg
            vapor. Gold was found in some instances, such as when a
            sufficiently powerful current was passed between electrodes
            dipped in mercury, but those experiments were rejected
            because there had been too much contact with foreign metals.
            They found that Au will escape detection if certain
            impurities are present, producing an inhomogenous
            distribution of Au that becomes detectable only after the
            arc treatment has coagulated it. (3, 4, 31)</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.
            Fritz Haber, <i>et al</i>., made careful attempts to repeat
            the work of Nagaoka and Miethe. Mercury in which no Au could
            be detected was subjected to six different treatments, but
            no Au was formed. In some cases, Au was found, but only in
            amounts smaller than what could have come from the
            materials, or from contamination. Nor could the yield be
            increased at will. The applied treatments were made with
            liquid and solid dielectrics with high-tension discharges,
            arcs in low, normal and high pressures, and high-vacuum
            electron bombardments.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
            extraordinary sensitivity of their detection methods was
            exemplified by the instance of a co-worker who suddenly
            found traces of gold in some material he was analyzing. No
            one else could detect Au in the other samples. It was found
            that the chemist habitually removed his gold frame
            eyeglasses before making an observation; on this occasion,
            he had removed the glasses and then picked up a strip of
            ultra-pure lead to perform an analysis. Another incident
            occurred when a lab worker was melting some Au; soon
            afterwards, another worker in the next room found Au in
            material which previously had none in it. The authors proved
            "merely that no method has yet been published whereby
            analytically detectable amounts of Au can be formed in Hg."

              Scientific American</i> (April 1926) reported on a recent
            meeting of the German Chemical Society, at which positive
            results were announced:</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prof.
            Haber, who previously cherished the greatest doubt as to the
            accuracy of the experiments, congratulated Prof. Miethe and
            related... that he himself could confirm the results by
            repetition of the experiment."</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haber
            apparently made the comment before he had completed his
            analyses of the electrodes, etc, and determined them to be
            the source of the Au.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
            of the criticism of Miethe, Stammreich, and Nagaoka's
            experimental work focused on the questionable purity of the
            mercury they used. Their Hg had been purified by
            distillation and by dissolving it in nitric acid (1:4) and
            fusing the residue with borax (0.1 gr). The resulting bead
            of Au, if any, was examined under the microscope. Usually
            they distilled the Hg twice, but in some cases as many as 15
            times. Other researchers showed that no matter how carefully
            or often Hg was distilled, Au could be detected.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miethe
            and Stammreich showed that the formation of Au from Hg
            depends on the application of intermittent electrical
            discharges. No gold forms when Hg is exposed to direct
            current. They also described a Hg-turbine which allowed
            2,000 breaks/minute with a potential of 110 volts; the
            current varied from 1-12 amps. The experiments showed a
            linear proportionality between the yield of Au and the
            product of wattage and time. The average yield of gold was
            0.0004 mg/amp/hour. The production of Au was facilitated by
            high-pressure. When the discharge was passed between Hg
            poles in a paraffin dielectric, the gold was found dispersed
            along the line of discharge, but not in the Hg poles. (15)</font></font>

            Gaschler attempted to reverse the Miethe-Nagaoka experiment
            by treating gold with high-speed hydrogen nuclei. He assumed
            that one of them might penetrate deeply into the electron
            shells of Au, be held by the innermost shells as a
            "paranucleus", and form a "Tiefenverbindung". After 30 hours
            bombardment, the spectrum of the tube began to show Hg lines
            that steadily increased in intensity. Gaschler postulated
            that Hg is a gold hydrogen compound, similar to Manley's
            "Hg-Helide". (6, 7, 13)</font></font> </p>

            elements arranged according to a system of harmonic
            frequencies and atomic weights.</font></font> </p>

            K (76 gr), Na (55 gr) amalgamated with Hg (131 and 365 gr)
            melted under paraffin. Reaction of Part 1 (17.4 gr) with

            Mercury was used to produce a species of Philosophers'
            Stone. The process can be described in chemical terms as
            follows: Prepare (1) b-meta-cinnabarite (a-cinnabarite will
            not produce the same results, in my experience), (2) a
            concentrated solution of a mixture of lime and potash and
            (3) sulfureted potash (potassium polysulfide). Saturate the
            cinnabarite with the lime-potash mixture solution, then dry
            it. Repeat several times until albedo appears. Then saturate
            with a concentrated solution of potassium polysulfide, and
            strip the solvent (methyl or ethyl alcohol also can be
            used). Repeat this step until white needles appear (the
            Dragon's Teeth). The color changes from yellow to orange to
            red. The Stone is multiplied by grinding it to powder and
            repeating (7x) the wash with lime-potash. At this point, the
            Stone emits lights --- probably from the calcium sulfide
            byproduct of the reaction mixture. Further elaboration and
            transmutation of lead to gold can be accomplished according
            to the skill of the Artist.</font></font> </p>
