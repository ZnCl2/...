                    Prof. Arthur Smits and Dr. A. Karssen (Univ. of
                    Amsterdam) published reports of their alleged
                    transmutation of lead into mercury and thallium in
                    1924. Their work was inspired by that of Prof.
                    Miethe, who claimed to have transformed mercury into
                    gold in a modified Jaenicke mercury ultraviolet
                    lamp. <b>(4, 5)</b></font></font> </p>
              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The lamp was constructed of lead quartz. Two legs
                    (A, B), ending in narrow tubes, contain two steel
                    electrodes cemented with sealing wax. The electrodes
                    were inserted in two small removable copper water
                    coolers (G, H). Pure liquid lead was poured into
                    storage vessel C, after which the open end was
                    sealed off. The lead was kept liquid at 350<sup>o</sup>
                    C by an electric furnace around C. Tube D contained
                    capillary F and terminated in stopcock K, which was
                    connected to a mercury diffusion pump (Fig. 5.1).</font></font>
              </p>
              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    When a high vacuum was attained, vessel C was
                    further heated with a Bunsen burner to dissociate
                    all the oxide and gases. Stopcock K was then closed
                    and disconnected from the pump. The apparatus was
                    tilted so the liquid lead ran into the two legs (A,
                    B) of the lamp. The legs of the lamp were heated to
                    redness to drive off the gases from the electrodes,
                    and the lamp was evacuated again. Then copper water
                    coolers were placed around the legs, and the lamp
                    was ready to use. At the end of the experiment, the
                    liquid lead was returned to vessel C, which was
                    continuously heated. The lead was specially prepared
                    and purified by the firm of Kahlbaum of Berlin to
                    prevent every contamination, especially mercury.</font></font>
              </p>
              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    The experiment was monitored with a quartz
                    spectroscope. After a current of 30-35 amperes/8
                    volts was passed through the system for 6 hours, a
                    few mercury lines began to appear in the spectrum.
                    After 10 hours, the entire series of lines of
                    mercury, plus those of thallium, were apparent in
                    the visible and ultraviolet spectrum.</font></font>
              </p>
              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    In 1926, Smits and Karssen reported further
                    developments of their experimental protocol. The
                    lamp was redesigned, and the mercury diffusion pump
                    was replaced by a mechanical pump to eliminate the
                    possibility of contamination from that source. The
                    use of a mercury manometer was avoided by employing
                    a glass spring manometer. All the equipment was
                    examined with a spectroscope to make certain it was
                    free from mercury and thallium. They described their
                    method as follows:</font></font> </p>
              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    "After filling the storage vessel, the lamp and the
                    lead were heated in high vacuum to redness. The lead
                    oxide being dissociated, the liquid lead was as
                    brilliant as mercury. Then the lead was brought into
                    the lamp, and after ignition the spectrum was
                    observed at 25 V/36 A, by a Hilger
                    quartz-spectrograph. Further, the spectrum of a
                    quartz mercury lamp was observed, and also the scale
                    in such a way that, to facilitate comparison, the
                    different spectra were adjacent. Thus we obtained
                    the spectrum of the lead in its initial state. After
                    that we burned the lamp at 40 A/80 V for 10 hours.
                    After having done this the lead was poured into the
                    storage vessel to obtain thorough mixing; the lead
                    was then brought into the lamp again, and after
                    ignition the spectrum was observed at 25 V/36 A. The
                    result was that, whilst initially the lead spectrum
                    showed only very weakly the mercury line 2536 in the
                    ultra-violet, after 10 hours' burning the strongest
                    mercury lines had appeared in the visible as well as
                    in the ultra-violet part of the spectrum, and also
                    the most characteristic thallium line, indicating a
                    transmutation of lead into mercury and thallium.</font></font>

              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    "Since our experiments showed that a high current
                    density is very favourable to this transformation,
                    we used currents up to 60 A, but that seemed to be
                    dangerous, because only by intensive air cooling
                    could melting of the quartz-lamp be prevented.</font></font>

              <p><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    "We thought it better, therefore, to change our
                    method a little, by applying not a continuous
                    electrical current but sparks of high current
                    densities... While the lamp was kept oscillating by
                    a mechanical arrangement... a current of
                    high-density [60-100 A] was breaking and making...
                    This method was very successful... After 9-1/4
                    hours' sparking all mercury lines, even the very
                    weak ones, were present...</font></font> </p>

                    "This, however, does not yet prove the transmutation
                    to be strong, as it is known that a relatively
                    strong quantity of mercury can cause the spectrum of
                    another element to disappear. But at all events our
                    spectra show in a very convincing way the
                    transmutation of lead into mercury..."</font></font>

                    The researchers also conducted experiments with a
                    nitrogen atmosphere at various pressures and a
                    liquid dielectric (carbon disulfide) with 100kv/2
                    milliamperes for 12 hours. The mercury was
                    chemically detected as the iodide. Similar results
                    were obtained with 160 kv/10-20 milliamps. In six
                    such experiments, 0.1-0.2 mg of mercury was
                    recovered. The researchers suspected that the CS<sub>2</sub>
                    had contained a trace of some organic mercury
                    compound. Positive results were still obtained,
                    however, even after it had been thoroughly purified.</font></font>

                    distinctly different properties in burning and

                    unknown until now, so that transmutation in the

                    intermediate production of thallium, one would
                    expect to find evidence of a relatively large amount
                    of thallium compared with the amount of mercury
                    produced. Prof. Smits does not seem to have found
                    such an effect, for he records stronger evidence of
                    the production of mercury than of the production of
                    thallium...</font></font> </p>

                    "When atoms are bombarded by electrons, it is
                    possible that in a few instances an electron
                    penetrates within the <i>K</i> shell of
                    extra-nuclear electrons, though it is certainly
                    surprising that this is possible in the
                    circumstances of these experiments. When such a
                    penetration does occur, the electron will be
                    attracted towards the nucleus and may possibly be
                    absorbed by it. Even so, in some cases the
                    absorption of an electron by the nucleus may render
                    the latter unstable and disruption may occur with
                    the ejection of a proton and an electron, either
                    separately or together, in which case the final
                    chemical state of the disturbed atom will be the
                    same as if the electron had been absorbed by the
                    nucleus and a stable condition attained."</font></font>

                    For some unknown reason, these explorations were not
                    continued, and the issue disappeared from the
                    scientific literature after 1928. This line of
                    research remains open to exploration, since the
                    questions it raised remain unanswered to this day.</font></font>
