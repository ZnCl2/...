              Gerald L. Wendt and Clarence E. Irion (University of
              Chicago) reported their "Experimental Attempts to
              Decompose Tungsten at High Temperatures" to a meeting of
              the American Chemical Society in Illinois in April 1922. <b>(4,

              Wendt and Irion claimed to have completely disintegrated
              tungsten wire into helium by means of a high-voltage
              discharge in glass bulbs. In the mean of 21 experiments,
              1.01 cc of helium was obtained from a wire length of 39.62
              mm with a weight of 0.713 mg, exploded with 29.6
              kilovolts. The procedure consisted of charging a condensor
              to 100 Kv and discharging it at high speed through an
              extremely fine wire. The resulting explosion generated a
              pressure of about 1,000 lb/in<sup>2</sup> and a
              temperature over 50,000<sup>o</sup> F. The method
              introduced as much as a coulomb of electricity into the
              tungsten wire within 1/300,000th of a second. The
              accompanying flash of light was about 200 times as bright
              as sunlight, and lasted less than 1/100,000 of a second.
              No smoke or other residue was ever found after the
              explosions.</font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







              Wendt and Irion described the electrical circuit and bulb
              (Fig. 4.1, 4.2) as follows:</font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              "The primary circuit of the transformer, T, operates on a
              220-volt alternating current power line through an
              inductive resistance, E. In order to prevent a destructive
              back-pulse into the power line should the charged
              condenser accidentally be discharged through the secondary
              circuit of the transformer, 2 condensers of 1 microfarad
              capacity each are bridged across the primary circuit with
              a ground connection, as shown at A. The primary circuit
              was heavy enough to carry 40 amperes during the brief
              period necessary to charge the large condenser; the
              secondary circuit furnished 100,000 volts though
              ordinarily only some 30,000 were used. The secondary
              circuit was connected to the two sides of the large
              condenser, C, one side leading through the hot cathode
              'kenotron' rectifier, R, which was especially designed for
              heavy service and a large factor of safety. Its cathode
              filament was heated by the battery of dry cells, B. The
              discharge circuit led from the two sides of the condenser
              and contained only the spark gap, S, and the wire to be
              exploded, H. This discharge circuit was made as short and
              compact as possible, of heavy copper strip, in order to
              reduce resistance and inductance to a minimum and thus
              allow a rapid and non-oscillating discharge through the
              wire in the minimum time, thus concentrating the energy
              input and giving the maximum temperature in the material
              to the wire. To give maximum capacity and hold maximum
              voltage the condenser was built of 100 glass plates 60 by
              75 cm covered with heavy tin foil and cast into solid
              paraffin with a gap of 5 mm between plates. The condenser
              showed brushing at the edges of the plates at 30,000 volts
              but held 45,000 volts without puncturing. The capacity was
              about 0.1 microfarad. The spark gap consisted of two 2 cm
              brass spheres, their separation adjustable to the maximum
              voltage of the condenser. Its use is important since it is
              the only means for protecting the condenser from excessive
              charge by the transformer, and for insuring a complete and
              sharp discharge at the proper moment.</font></font> </p>

              "Tungsten was chosen for the material of the wire to be
              exploded chiefly because its high atomic weight made its
              decomposition probable on the hypothesis adopted, and also
              because it is hard enough to allow convenient manipulation
              and support even in excessively thin wires. The wires were
              0.035 mm in diameter, about 4 cm long and weighed 0.5 to
              0.7 mg. They had sufficient strength to be sprung into
              place between the larger electrodes shown in Fig. [4.2]
              without welding or clamping.</font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              "The construction of the explosion bulb is shown in Fig.
              [4.2]. It has a volume of about 300 cc, and was
              constructed of heavy Pyrex glass without strain and in
              good spherical form, for it was required to withstand
              momentarily a tremendous outward pressure. Thick bulbs
              invariably broke during the explosion because of
              insufficient elasticity. Thin bulbs may be used is the
              bulb is immersed in a vessel of water, which gives
              sufficient support together with elasticity. The large
              side-tube is the neck at which the bulb was sealed from
              the pump system after evacuation, and through which the
              wire was sprung into place between the electrodes by means
              of pincers. The smaller side tube contained a third
              sealed-in electrode, and served for the spectroscopic
              examination of the gas within, one of the electrodes being
              used for the other terminal of the exciting induction
              coil.</font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              "The three electrodes were constructed as is shown in
              detail in Fig. [4.2]. B was the electrode itself, made
              of... # 20 tungsten wire. This was firmly sealed directly
              through the Pyrex walls in the manner shown, for
              mechanical strength. The entire surface of the electrodes
              was first covered with a thick layer of Pyrex glass, A.
              The tip was then carefully ground off until the tungsten
              was exposed. Then a hole, C, was drilled in the end with a
              # 80 drill, 0.343 mm in diameter, the hole being less than
              0.76 mm deep, to receive the fine wire for explosion. The
              electrodes were then sealed into the bulb. This method of
              sealing in the electrodes had the two purposes of
              excluding the chance of leakage of air inward through the
              seal after evacuation and of preventing the liberation of
              gas from these electrodes by the heating effect of the
              explosion itself. With such electrodes only the surfaces
              of the three small holes were exposed to the effects of
              the explosions, and one of these, in the spectroscopic
              capillary, was far removed from the scene of the
              explosion. In some of the early explosions brass
              electrodes were used welded to a tungsten wire sealed
              through the glass.</font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              "The bulb was vacuum-evacuated for 15 hours by a
              mechanical pump and two mercury-vapor diffusion pumps in
              series with a liquid-air trap to capture any mercury
              vapor. The bulb was supported in a furnace and heated to
              above 350<sup>o</sup> C to drive off any gases contained
              in the glass, and out-gassed coconut charcoal (immersed in
              liquid air) was employed inline to absorb gases just prior
              to sealing the bulb. In addition, about 0.2 amperes from a
              battery was passed through the electrodes and the filament
              to heat them above 2000<sup>o </sup>C for 15 hours to
              drive off any other absorbed gases. Bulbs prepared in this
              manner showed no spectrum, florescence, or conductance."</font></font>

              After the wire was exploded, spectroscopic analysis of the
              gas revealed the strong yellow line of helium, and the
              faint green line of mercury. Other faint lines were
              detected but not identified: two red, one bright blue, and
              one pale violet. On some occasions, two unidentified faint
              yellow lines and a second violet line were detected.
              Hydrogen and neon were absent. Wendt and Irion commented:</font></font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              "The appearance of helium and the absence of hydrogen is
              interesting for two reasons. In the first place, it seems
              to dispose of the objection that the helium arose from gas
              remaining in the wire, for in that case hydrogen should
              also have been visible, for it was probably originally
              present in the wire in much larger quantity than was
              helium. In the second place, if the helium does arise from
              a decomposition of the tungsten atoms, the absence of
              hydrogen is also interesting because the atomic weight of
              tungsten is exactly 46 times the atomic weight of helium,
              and Rutherford was also unable to detect hydrogen from the
              bombardment with a-rays of carbon, oxygen, magnesium,
              silicon, and sulfur, whose weights are multiples of 4,
              though he did detect it with boron, nitrogen, fluorine,
              sodium, phosphorus and aluminum, whose weights are not
              such multiples." <b>(2, 3)</b></font></font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;






              The possibility that helium could have been present in the
              tungsten could have been excluded by exploding the wire
              using a greater inductance to obtain a slower explosion at
              a lower temperature, giving complete vaporization without
              decomposition. However, there was not enough time
              available to conduct such tests. The vacuum method of
              preparing the tubes rigorously excluded contamination, but
              did not allow the collection, measurement and analysis of
              the gas produced. Therefore, Wendt and Irion also
              conducted explosions in carbon dioxide at atmospheric
              pressure in slightly modified bulbs; this enabled them to
              study the helium they produced. The carbon dioxide was
              carefully purified and blank-tested. This method also
              excluded the possibility of contamination from leakage of
              air into the bulbs, or by the release of gas from the
              glass bulb or the electrodes, because the explosion was
              too rapid to liberate any helium from those sources by
              heat from the tungsten vapor. The brief duration of the
              high temperature could not cause the carbon dioxide to
              decompose into carbon monoxide and oxygen, and the
              scientists performed pertinent tests to prove the point.</font></font>

              Unfortunately, the Associated Press widely published an
              exaggerated account of the "transmutation" experiment,
              based on the oral presentation which Wendt and Irion had
              made to the American Chemical Society in April, 1922. In a
              footnote to their article published in the <i>Journal </i>of







              the ACS (September 1922), they emphasized that, "this
              report is preliminary, and that nothing is proved beyond
              the importance of the problem and the promise of this
              method... For the sake of clarity it is suggested that the
              term <i>disintegration</i> be reserved for the
              spontaneous processes of radio-activity, that <i>decomposition</i>
              be applied to the splitting of complex atoms into simpler
              parts, and that <i>transmutation</i> be understood to
              imply some degree of synthesis of atomic nuclei."</font></font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000"><font size="-0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;







              Wendt and Irion planned a compete analysis of the gas they
              collected, but the sample was lost in an accident. "Then
              the work was stopped by the failure of health of the
              senior author..." Two years later, S.K. Allison and
              William Harkins reported inconclusive negative results
              from their version of the experiment. <i>Scientific
                American</i> magazine, however, sponsored a test of the
              experiment and published the successful results! The issue
              remains unresolved to this day. <b>(1)</b></font></font>
