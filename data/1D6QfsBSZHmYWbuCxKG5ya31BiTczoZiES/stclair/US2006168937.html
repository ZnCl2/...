          A spacecraft propulsion system that utilizes a dual method of
          providing lift on the hull by means of magnetic monopoles and
          electromagnetic spacetime curvature pressure.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] This invention is a spacecraft propulsion system that
          generates a field of wormholes which are threaded with a
          magnetic field. Acting as two attracting magnets, the
          spacecraft's north magnetic field is attracted to the
          constantly regenerating south magnetic monopoles of the
          wormholes which provides lift on the hull.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0002] According to one of Maxwell's electromagnetic
          equations, the curl of the electric E field is equal to the
          negative time rate of change of the magnetic flux density B
          field. [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The curl can be thought of as a circulation around a closed
          loop specified by the right-hand rule where the fingers curl
          in the direction of the electric field and the thumb
          represents the changing magnetic flux density field through
          the area of the loop. At no time is the electric field
          diverging around the loop. That is, the divergence of the curl
          is zero which is a well-known vector operation [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          The partial derivatives of divB are zero at all points in
          space. Performing the integration, therefore, the divergence
          of B is equal to a constant<br>
          div B=constant<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Referring to FIG. 1, the following discussion is made
          in cylindrical coordinates {r,[theta],z}. In cylindrical
          coordinates, the divergence of the radial B field, div B, is
          equal to a constant C [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          where the prime (') represents differentiation with respect to
          the radius r. The solution to this equation resides in
          determining the constant C. In the vacuum of space without any
          wormholes, the constant C is zero. Because the spacecraft is
          surrounded by a field of wormholes, there is a magnetic flux
          density field threading each one. That is, each wormhole is
          actually a magnetic monopole, and therefore the entire field
          of monopoles constitutes a large magnet with one pole in this
          dimension and the other pole in the hyperspace dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The concept of the wormhole involves a new type of
          scientific thinking involving the creation of a gateway
          between our spacetime and that of a hyperspace co-dimension.
          The gateway is created electromagnetically as shown by my
          patent applications Rotating Magnetic Vortex Generator,
          Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator, and Sulfur 8 Wormhole
          Generator. The gateway can also be created ultrasonically
          through bubble cavitation as shown in my patent application
          Cavitating Oil Hyperspace Energy Generator. In one experiment,
          smoke was blown through one side of the coil of the magnetic
          vortex wormhole generator and no smoke came out the other
          side. The smoke was blown through the wormhole into another
          dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The existence of hyperspace is not generally known in
          the scientific community. The reason it exists can be thought
          of in the following manner. Referring to FIG. 2, the corners
          of a tetrahedron (2) circumscribed by a sphere (1) touch the
          sphere at an angle (3) of -19.47[deg.]. Looking at the planets
          of the solar system, the Giant Red Spot vortex of Jupiter,
          which can hold two planets the size of Earth, is located at
          this angle. On Mars, the Olympic Mons volcano, which is the
          size of France, is located at north 19.5[deg.] Here in the
          Caribbean there is a slow moving rock mantle vortex at north
          19.5[deg.] that curves the islands down toward Venezuela. So
          the geometry of space is related to the tetrahedron. What this
          suggests is that there is a subspace manifold whose
          tetrahedral geometry projects all the constants of physics
          into our dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Referring to FIG. 3, this subspace geometry is shown in
          the tetrahedron diagram which plots the natural logarithm of
          mass on the vertical axis versus the natural logarithm of
          wavelength on the horizontal axis. With this diagram, it is
          possible to visualize the entire universe on a single sheet of
          paper. Triangle (4) is the tetrahedron whose vertical
          centerline shown by the small [pi] circle (a) is equal to
          Planck's constant h divided by the speed of light c, known as
          the base constant. The base constant in logs is equal to
          -95.91546344. Line (5) is the diameter of the sphere (6). A
          circle (7), centered on (a), with a radius equal to the speed
          of light squared, is tangent to the tetrahedron. It can be
          shown that all the constants of physics, such as the speed of
          light squared and the Planck mass and the Planck wavelength,
          are determined geometrically by this logarithmic subspace
          tetrahedral geometry.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Referring to FIG. 4, the complex plane consists of a
          real horizontal axis, and a complex vertical axis where the
          value of the complex number z is given by a radius r and an
          angle [theta]<br>
          z=re&lt;i([theta]+2[pi]m) &gt;<br>
          The logarithm of z is<br>
          Log[z]=Log[r]+i([theta]+2[pi]m)<br>
          where m is an integer m=0,1,2 . . . corresponding to multiple
          rotations of 2[pi]. What this means in terms of the
          tetrahedron diagram, referring to FIG. 5, is that there are
          multiple diagrams separated by 2[pi] rotations. Each multiple
          is another hyperspace dimension. Only the log manifold has
          this characteristic. Referring to FIG. 6, the hyperspace
          dimension, shown as 2[pi] circular surface (8), has a cut (9)
          on the undefined Log[0] origin line such that another
          hyperspace dimension is created below it (10).<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Referring to FIG. 7, this branch cut does not bring one
          back to the original surface nearing the origin. It takes one
          down to another level of the universe into another hyperspace
          dimension. I can attest personally that I have been able to
          look into another hyperspace co-dimension as well as jump into
          another dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Furthermore, Dr. Stephen Hawking of Cambridge
          University has shown that our dimension is connected to a
          wormhole through complex time. That is, the hyperspace
          dimension is rotated forward by 90[deg.] which makes it
          orthogonal to us. While this is the mathematical explanation
          as to why there are hyperspace co-dimensions, I can attest
          personally to the fact, as described in my patent application
          Full Body Teleportation, that I was teleported through
          hyperspace and returned to our dimension over a distance of
          100 meters. Because hyperspace exists, it is then possible,
          using electromagnetic fields, to open wormholes between our
          dimension and other hyperspace dimensions.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Referring to FIG. 8, the constant C in the magnetic
          flux density B field equation is determined as follows. The
          end of a solenoid (11) is equivalent to a local magnetic
          source of flux [Phi] which represents the wormhole. A charge
          (12) encircling the solenoid has the same value at P1 and P2
          but there is a phase difference of 2 [pi] n where n is an
          integer equal to the number of times the charge encircles the
          solenoid. The change in phase is equal to the charge q divided
          by Planck's reduced constant times the flux for a solenoid of
          radius r=R [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          Solving for the magnetic flux density field threading the
          wormhole [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The differential equation becomes [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          Solving the equation for the radial field Br [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          Equating this Br field with the B field and solving for the
          C[2] constant [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          Substituting for C[2], the C[1] constant drops out and
          therefore the wormhole magnetic flux density field becomes a
          constant inside the throat radius R [mathematical formula -
          see original document]<br>
          but the divergence moving from outside to inside the radius is
          a constant due to the discontinuity.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Referring to FIG. 9, the wormhole has a constant
          cylindrically-shaped magnetic field of radius R with a
          negative south pole due to the negative charge on the
          electron, Using a wormhole radius equal to one hundred times
          the electron radius with n equal to 10 turns, the magnetic
          flux density B field has a magnitude of 1.4*10&lt;6 &gt;
          tesla.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Referring to FIG. 10, the wormhole surface (14) is a
          connection through a throat area (20) between space and
          hyperspace (13) to another surface in hyperspace (15). The
          electron path (19) is actually spiraling down the surface of
          the wormhole. The magnetic flux density field (18) points into
          the wormhole such that the cross product of the electron
          velocity (16) with the field (v*B) points toward the outside
          rim of the wormhole. Because the electron has a negative
          charge, the force (17) on the electron (-q v*B) is inward
          toward the centerline of the wormhole. Since one pole of the
          field is in space, and the other pole is in hyperspace, the
          wormhole appears to us as a magnetic monopole. The key to this
          invention is how to generate this magnetic wormhole field.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Referring to FIG. 11, the aluminum spacecraft is
          constructed of a flattened, shallow spherical lower hull (21),
          a circular upper hull with a flat sloping surface (22), a
          spherical dome cupola (23), and a cylindrical section (24)
          housing a circular array of radial microwave waveguides.
          Surfaces (22) and (23) are electrically charged, using
          high-voltage transformers, to an alternating electrostatic
          potential such that the potential on the dome is +V when the
          sloping hull has a -V potential and vice versa. This creates
          an electric field from the positively charged surface to the
          negatively charged surface.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Referring to FIG. 12, the dome (25) is charged to a
          positive potential. The spherical potential lines (26) emanate
          from the dome and curve around toward the sloping hull. The
          negative gradient of this potential field is the electric E
          field (27) which is perpendicular to the potential lines. The
          electric field lines from the dome then terminate on the
          sloping hull which can be seen in the lower right hand comer
          of the graph.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] Looking down from above at the top of the dome,
          referring to FIG. 13, the oscillating electric field generates
          a circular oscillating magnetic field around the hull at
          various elevations. The last two graphs in the right-hand
          comer are near the top of the dome as seen by the smaller
          radius contour lines.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] Referring to FIG. 14, the oscillating electric field
          lines (28) are between the dome and the sloping hull. The
          oscillating magnetic field (29) encircles the hull at the
          level of the microwave waveguides.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] From gravitation physics, it is known that negative
          energy is required to open up the throat of the wormhole. In
          terms of differential forms mathematics, the negative energy
          is created by wedging the magnetic field with the radial
          microwave beams of the waveguides. This generates an
          increasing time rate of change of negative energy [rho] as
          shown by [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where (*) is the Hodge Star operator, (d) the differential
          operator and () the wedge operator which joins the circular
          magnetic flux density B field with the electromagnetic wave
          (Bwave, Ewave).<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Referring to FIG. 15, the interaction of the circular
          magnetic field (33), generated by the oscillating electric
          field (34), interacts with the radial electromagnetic field of
          the microwave beams (31) of the waveguides (30) to generate
          negative energy (32) over the sloping hull (35).<br>
          <br>
          [0019] This combination of fields also creates the wormhole
          field over the hull. The spacetime curvature pressure T in the
          vertical z-direction is equal to the square of the circular
          magnetic flux density field [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          This stress-energy-momentum tensor can be thought of as a
          spacetime curvature proportional to the inverse of the radius
          squared, or as a pressure term which acts on the surface area
          of the hull. Thus there is the combination of a pressure
          stress and negative energy which creates the wormhole field
          over the sloping hull. Even though the magnetic flux density B
          field is oscillating, it is the square of the field which
          creates the stress. Thus the tension is still in the positive
          vertical z-direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Due to the low speed of light of hyperspace, the
          hyperspace energy is low density. Thus there is a positive
          gravitational potential between hyperspace and our dimension
          such that the hyperspace energy flows through the wormholes
          and onto the hull of the spacecraft. When this happens, a
          white mist forms over the hull. The effect of the hyperspace
          energy is to lessen the mass of the spacecraft, and
          relativistically increase the strength of the electromagnetic
          fields due to the smaller speed of light.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Referring to FIG. 16, the circular magnetic flux
          density field (36) is interacting with the magnetic monopole
          (37). The monopole acts as one pole of a magnet and therefore
          has a magnetic moment equal to the area times the electrical
          current circulating through it as the electrons move from our
          dimension into hyperspace. The great physicist Maxwell (1870)
          pointed out that the energy associated with charges and poles
          is potential energy and that therefore these objects tend to
          move in a direction that will decrease the potential energy,
          similar to a brick sliding down an inclined plane. Now to
          reduce the potential energy is the same as to reduce the field
          which gives a measure of the potential energy. If two like
          charges are brought together they strengthen one another's
          field, while opposite charges reduce one another's field. Thus
          like charges repel and unlike ones attract.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] However, the energy associated with electric currents
          is not potential but kinetic in origin, because it is
          associated with moving charges. Now in mechanics it is well
          known that bodies move in a direction to increase their
          kinetic energy, if there is a source of external energy. The
          magnetic field of currents is a measure of kinetic energy and
          currents will try to move in a direction that will increase
          the field. Thus similarly-directed currents attract and unlike
          currents repel. In FIG. 16, the monopole will act so as to
          increase the field of the circular magnetic B field generated
          by the spacecraft. The monopole will then rotate into
          alignment with the flux tube. This increases the field
          strength of the flux tube. There is a torque [tau] on the
          monopole equal to the cross product of the magnetic moment
          with the B field<br>
          [tau]=[mu]*B<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Referring to FIG. 17, when the monopole is aligned with
          the flux tube, the cross product is zero and there is zero
          torque on the monopole. Notice that even if the oscillating B
          field points in the opposite direction, there is still zero
          torque since the torque depends on the sine of the angle
          between them. The sin(0[deg.]) or sin(180[deg.]) is the same
          zero value. With the monopole aligned with the flux tube, the
          kinetic energy is now maximized. That is, both the flux tube
          and the monopole point in the [theta]-direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] The magnetic B field can be represented as a vector
          having three components. The only component is in the angular
          direction<br>
          B={Br,B[theta],Bz}={0, B[theta](z), 0}<br>
          where the field varies, as was seen in FIG. 13, in the
          vertical z-direction. The magnetic monopole field also points
          in the [theta]-direction<br>
          [mu]={0,[mu][theta](z),0}<br>
          where there is a negative gradient of the monopole field in
          the z-direction due to the location of the microwave
          waveguides near the sloping hull.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] The force F on the monopole is the gradient of the
          monopole's magnetic moment [mu] with the magnetic flux density

          which says that there is a force on the monopole in the
          z-direction equal to the magnetic moment times the gradient of

          times the gradient of the magnetic moment in the z-direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Referring to FIG. 18. differentiating the magnetic
          field in the z-direction shows that the gradient is negative
          outside the hull. This can also be seen visually in FIG. 13
          where the graphs decrease in intensity.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] A negative gradient for both the magnetic moment and
          the field means that the force on the monopole is negative.
          The force on the tube connected to the hull is therefore the
          negative of a negative, yielding a positive lift force.<br>

          which says there is an upward lift force on the hull due to
          the combination magnetic monopole and flux tube. This lift
          force is in addition to the vertical lift force generated by
          the spacetime curvature created by the electromagnetic fields
          themselves.<br>

          </b><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0028] This invention is a spacecraft propulsion system that
          utilizes electromagnetic fields and microwaves to generate
          negative energy and a spacetime curvature over the hull. The
          hull consists of a hemispherical dome, a circular array of
          radial microwave waveguides, a sloping flat hull, and a
          shallow spherical hull on the bottom. Alternating current high
          voltage transformers connected to the dome and the sloping
          hull generate a curving oscillating electric field between the
          dome and the sloping hull. Due to this oscillation, a
          horizontal circular oscillating magnetic flux density B field
          is created around the dome.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] By firing the microwaves at right angles to the B
          field, negative energy is created over the hull. The negative
          energy and spacetime curvature pressure generate wormholes
          between space and hyperspace. Because hyperspace has a low
          speed of light and positive gravitational potential, low
          density hyperspace energy flows through the wormholes and onto
          the hull. The effect of the hyperspace energy is to lessen the
          mass of the vehicle and to increase the strength of the
          electromagnetic fields. Because the resistance of hyperspace
          is less than the resistance of space, electrons spiral down
          the wormholes into hyperspace. This creates a magnetic field
          through the wormhole with one pole in our dimension and the
          other pole in hyperspace. Thus a field of magnetic monopoles
          is created over the hull.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] The magnetic monopoles, which represent kinetic energy,
          align themselves with the magnetic flux tubes in order to
          maximize the total magnetic field. Because there is a gradient
          of the monopoles and field in the vertical direction, a
          negative force develops on the monopoles equal to the gradient
          of the dot product of the magnetic moment of the monopole with
          the B field. Thus the opposite reaction is a positive force on
          the flux tubes attached to the hull which is equivalent to
          bringing the north pole of a magnet together with the south
          pole of a second magnet. Because the hull constantly
          regenerates the wormhole field, the hull experiences a
          constant upward lift force. This is in addition to the lift
          generated by the spacetime curvature pressure which is
          proportional to the square of the magnetic flux density B
          field.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0049] 1. The aluminum hull is made by a technique called
          stretch forming which uses hydraulic cylinders to stretch a
          large sheet of aluminum to its yield point. This makes the
          aluminum sheet soft and pliable. Using a die which has been
          CNC machined to the desired hull profile, the sheet is then
          die pressed into a very rigid, smooth and lightweight
          structure requiring no other support. There are actually three
          dies consisting of a spherical dome, sloping hull, and shallow
          spherical dome.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] 2. The rest of the hull consists of a cylindrical hull
          with a radius equal to the upper dome. A segment of this hull
          is designed on a 3D computer graphics program and stored as a
          stereolithography *.stl file. The file is then transmitted
          over the Internet to a server who prints up the part on an
          xy-plotter with an ultraviolet laser and ultraviolet light
          sensitive polymer bath. The computer model is sliced by a
          special program into many thousands of slices which are
          printed one over the other until the part is completed. The
          server returns the part next day by Express Mail. Several
          parts are then molded using liquid plastic such as to form the
          complete ring. A sand mold is then constructed from all the
          molds to form a plastic cylindrical hull having the waveguide
          slots molded into it. The waveguide silver-coated aluminum
          boxes are then installed in the slots and connected to the
          frequency generators and amplifiers. The purpose of the
          plastic waveguide cylinder is to separate the electrostatic
          charges on the dome and the sloping hull In this particular
          case we used a dome from another spacecraft design which saved
          on the cost of the die.<br>
