          <b> </b>A propulsion system for a train that uses permanent
          magnets mounted on a rotating iron cylindrical plate carrying
          a radial current in order to create a spacetime curvature
          distortion which pulls the locomotive along the track.<br>
          <b><br>
            BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0001] This invention is a propulsion system for a train
          that utilizes spinning cylindrical magnets in order to create
          a spacetime pressure distortion ahead of the vehicle that
          pulls the locomotive along the track.<br>
          <b><br>
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0002] At the present time, referring to FIG. 1, proposed
          permanent magnet propulsion systems use a dual railway track
          (A) supporting a series of coil windings (B) located along the
          track. The vehicle is attached to two permanent magnets (D)
          between steel pole pieces (C). The north pole of each magnet
          faces the interior pole piece such that the magnetic flux path
          (E) follows the center pole piece up through the railway bed
          and then back to the south pole of the magnet. As the magnets
          move along the track, the coil windings are activated at the
          correct time by Hall sensors. With the coil energized as a
          north pole, the permanent magnet north pole is repelled which
          drives the vehicle along the track The problem with this
          design, and other similar designs, is that it is not practical
          to wind huge numbers of sensor-activated electrical coils
          along a steel track.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] From Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, it is
          known that a spacetime curvature pressure develops
          perpendicular to direction of vibration of the electric and
          magnetic field. As an example, the photon has an electric
          field vibrating in the vertical y-direction and a magnetic
          field vibrating in the horizontal x-direction. The spacetime
          curvature pressure is therefore along the z-axis of radiation
          which pushes the negative mass of the photon along. Thus in
          order to create a spacetime curvature pressure in the
          z-direction along the track which would pull the train
          forward, a magnetic flux density field is required in the
          radial direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Referring to FIG. 2, four equally-spaced north
          permanent magnets (B) surrounding a centrally-located south
          permanent magnet (C) are mounted on an iron cylinder which
          acts as the radial flux return path. The magnetic flux density
          field (D) is in the radial direction from the north pole to
          the south pole. In order to provide strength, the magnets are
          molded onto a steel shaft and coated with epoxy so that they
          don't rust. During the molding process, a capacitor-discharge
          magnetizer is used to create the magnetic field of the magnet.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] In Cartesian coordinates {-ct,x,y,z}, the elemental
          spacetime length ds squared is the sum of the squares of the
          incremental lengths {cdt,dx,dy,dz}<br>
          (ds)&lt;2&gt; =-(dt)&lt;2&gt; +(dx)&lt;2&gt; +(dy)&lt;2&gt;
          +(dz)&lt;2 &gt;<br>
          where the speed of light c is unity. The coefficients
          (-1,1,1,1) of this equation make up the g metric 4*4 tensor
          [mathematical formula - see original document][mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The Faraday electromagnetic tensor contains the
          magnetic fields which determine how the spacetime length ds is
          curved. For a magnetic flux density field in the x-direction,
          Bx, and a magnetic flux density field in the y-direction, By,
          the Faraday tensor is [mathematical formula - see original
          document][mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The stress-energy-momentum tensor T, which determines how
          space is curved, is calculated from the following equation
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The stress-energy in the z-direction ahead of the locomotive
          is [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where the sum of the squares of the fields in the x and y
          directions is the radial B field. In Einstein's General
          Relativity Theory, the curvature G tensor is equal to the
          stress-energy tensor divided by 8[pi]. The G tensor is the
          curvature of space having units of inverse radius squared.
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          Therefore the curvature Gzz generated along the z-direction
          ahead of the train is proportional to the square of the
          magnetic flux density field [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          where G is Newton's gravitational constant (not to be confused
          with the curvature tensor), [epsilon] is the linear
          capacitance of space, and c is the speed of light. The linear
          mass of space [Omega] is the speed of light c squared divided
          by the gravitational constant G, so that the equation can be
          written as [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where the conversion factor is the square of the magnetic
          vector potential A [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          which is actually the momentum per charge. Therefore the
          curvature equation can be written as [mathematical formula -
          see original document]<br>
          This equation shows that it is necessary to create a magnetic
          vector potential together with the radial magnetic flux
          density field in order to create a curvature of space. Looking
          at the units of A shows that it is a mass momentum per charge
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          or a mass m rotating with angular velocity c) per current
          along the radius. In terms of the invention, what this means
          is that the mass of the iron cylinder has to be rotating and
          there has to be a radial electrical current I in order to
          produce the linear charge along the radius. The differential
          mass dm depends on the circumference times the differential
          radius dr, the mass density p, and the length L of the
          cylinder<br>
          dm=[rho]2[pi]rLdr<br>
          so that the magnetic vector potential becomes [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          The value of A for the iron cylinder is [mathematical formula
          - see original document][mathematical formula - see original
          document][mathematical formula - see original
          document][mathematical formula - see original
          document][mathematical formula - see original

          document][mathematical formula - see original
          document][mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          What makes this possible is that the new N-machines can easily
          generate a minimum of 6 million amps which is twice the value
          of the electrical current above.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Referring to FIG. 3, the assembly consists of a large
          induction motor (A) mounted on the train's base plate (B)
          driving a motor shaft (C) attached to the iron cylinder (D).
          The shaft is held in place by two thrust bearings mounted in
          two pillow blocks (E,F). The current-generating N-machine (G)
          is electrically connected by a copper bus (H) to a
          copper-beryllium brush (I) on the motor shaft with a similar
          return brush (J) on the edge of the iron cylinder. The current
          (K) flows through the motor shaft to the center of the
          rotating cylinder and then radially outward to the edge. The
          magnetic flux density flows from the north poles of the outer
          permanent magnets to the central south pole, along the central
          magnet to the center of the rotating cylinder and then
          radially outward to the south poles of the outer magnets.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] The thrust F developed is the radius of curvature of
          spacetime rc calculated above times the magnet flux density
          field times the current I [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          Using conservation of tensor coordinates, the radius of
          curvature is in the z-direction, the magnetic flux density
          field is in the radial direction and the current is in the
          radial direction<br>
          F&lt;z&gt; =x&lt;z&gt; BrI&lt;r &gt;<br>
          where the radial indices cancel, leaving the z-index as the
          direction of the force.<br>
          <b><br>
            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
          </b><br>
          [0009] It is the object of this invention to create a
          spacetime curvature in front of a train locomotive in order to
          pull the vehicle along the track It is known from
          gravitational physics that a spacetime curvature is generated
          perpendicular to the direction of vibration of the electric
          and magnetic field. A radial magnetic field, which can be
          produced by permanent magnets attached to the flat faces near
          the rim of a iron cylinder rotating about the z-axis, will
          create a curvature in the z-direction. Four cylindrical
          north-pole-oriented magnets produce a radial magnetic flux
          density with is channeled into a central cylindrical
          south-pole-oriented magnet. The flux lines then flow radially
          outward through the steel rotating cylinder and reconnect with
          the south poles of the four outer magnets. The rotating iron
          cylinder generates the equivalent of a magnetic vector
          potential when an electrical current flows from the center of
          the cylinder to the edge. This current is generated by an
          N-machine current generator. The square of the magnetic flux
          density divided by the magnetic vector potential is equal to
          the spacetime curvature. The square root of the inverse of the
          spacetime curvature is the radius of curvature. The thrust
          developed is this radius of curvature times the magnetic flux
          density field times the current.<br>

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>1. The permanent magnets are made of neodymium-iron-boron
          material which is heated to its melt temperature and injection
          molded around a steel shaft threaded at one end while at the
          same time a pulsed magnetic field is applied to the material
          using a charge-discharge magnetizer. Because of the iron in
          the material, a coat of epoxy is applied to the magnet in
          order to protect it from the environment. Holes are drilled
          into the iron plate 90[deg.] apart near the rim, threaded, and
          then the steel shaft with the magnet is then inserted. Another
          hole is drilled and tapped in the center of the circular plate
          for attaching the south pole magnet which is used as the
          return path for the magnetic flux.<br>
          <br>
          2. Another easier way to make the magnets is to purchase short
          lengths of tubular NdFeB magnets and then stack them on the
          steel shaft with a cylindrical iron pole piece on the end of
          the shaft. The pole piece then holds the magnets down in place
          when the shaft is threaded into the plate.<br>
          <br>
          3. Referring to FIG. 4, the propulsion system is mounted
          inside the train cabin such that the rotor/magnet assembly
          extends out in front of the locomotive where the spacetime
          curvature is generated.<br>
