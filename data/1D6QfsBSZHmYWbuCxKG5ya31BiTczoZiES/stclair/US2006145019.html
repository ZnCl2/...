      A spacecraft having a triangular hull with vertical electrostatic
      line charges on each corner that produce a horizontal electric
      field parallel to the sides of the hull. This field, interacting
      with a plane wave emitted by antennas on the side of the hull,
      generates a force per volume combining both lift and propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention is a spacecraft having a triangular hull
      with vertical electrostatic line charges on each corner. The line
      charges create a horizontal electric field that, together with a
      plane wave emitted by antennas on the side of the hull, generates
      a force per volume providing a unique combination of both lift and
      propulsion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Referring to FIG. 1, the spacecraft has a hull in the shape
      of an equilateral triangle. A parabolic antenna (E) is centrally
      located in the bottom of the hull. An array of horizontal slot
      antennas is located along the side of the hull (A). Each back
      corner (F,G) has a corner conducting plate which is charged to a
      positive voltage +V. The forward corner (C) has a conducting plate
      charged to a negative voltage -V. A motion control hemisphere (D)
      is located on the bottom surface in each of the three corners.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Referring to FIG. 2, two planes (A,B) intersect at the
      origin O at an opening angle [beta]. Each plane (x,y) is charged
      to a voltage V. The potential at point P is determined in polar
      coordinates {[rho][phi]}. The Laplace equation for the potential
      [Phi] in polar coordinates is given by:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Using a separation of variables solution, the potential is given
      as the product of two functions:<br>
      [Phi]([rho],[phi])=R([rho])[Psi]([phi])<br>
      which when substituted into the Laplace equation becomes:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Since the two terns are separately functions of [rho] and [phi]
      respectively, each one has to be constant with the sum of the
      constants equal to zero:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      These two equations have solutions:<br>
      R([rho])=a[rho]&lt;v+b[rho]&gt; &lt;-v &gt;<br>
      [psi]([phi])=Acos(v[phi])+Bsin(v[phi])<br>
      The azimuthal angle [phi] is restricted to a value in the range
      0=[phi]=[beta]. The boundary condition is that the potential [Phi]
      is equal to V for any radius [rho] when [phi]=0 and [phi]=[beta].
      This means that v has to be an integer value of [pi] so that the
      sine function is zero:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which in turn means that the coefficient A of the cosine term has
      to be zero in the solution above. Choosing b=0 makes the general
      solution for the potential equal to:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which shows that when the angle is zero, the sine is zero and the
      potential is V. If the angle is [beta], then there is a multiple
      of [pi] such that the sine is zero again.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Because the series involves positive powers of the radius,
      for small enough [rho], only the first term m=1 in the series is
      important. Thus around [rho]=0, the potential is approximately<br>
      [phi]([rho],[phi])ËœV+a,[rho]&lt;[pi]/[beta]&gt;
      sin([pi][phi]/[beta])<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The electric field component is the negative gradient of
      the potential:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      The surface charge distribution [sigma] at [phi]=0 and
      [phi]=[beta] is equal to the electric field perpendicular to the
      surface times the permittivity of space [epsilon]0:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Notice that if angle of intersection [beta] is less than [pi],
      then the equation says that there is a very small radius to a
      positive power which means little charge density accumulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Referring to FIG. 3, the value of [beta], in the case of
      the triangular hull, is equal to 360[deg.] less 60[deg.] for a
      total of 300[deg.] or:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document][mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      which says that there is a charge density singularity to the two
      fifths power for small radius. Thus, the corner plates on the hull
      create a huge line charge density along the sharp vertical corner
      edge. The equation for the potential of a line charge density is
      given as:<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where [lambda] is the charge per unit length in the vertical
      z-direction, and x0 and y0 are the location of the line charge in
      the xy-plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Referring to FIG. 4, the triangular hull (D) is plotted
      together with the potential contours (A) and the electric field
      arrows (B) created by the three corner line charges. The line
      charges are perpendicular to the paper. Notice that the electric
      field arrows are parallel crossing the center parabolic antenna
      (C). The electric field is also parallel to the sides (D) of the
      triangle.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Referring to FIG. 5, along the side of the triangle (A), an
      array (B) of horizontal slot antennas emit electromagnetic waves
      that have a vertically polarized electric E field (C). These
      traveling waves interact with the electric field (D) produced by
      the line charges on the corners of the triangle.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Using differential forms mathematics, this combination of
      fields is represented by the Hodge star of the differential of the
      wedge product of the two fields. The antenna electromagnetic field
      is a combination of a traveling magnetic field Bw, and electric
      field Ew. The stationary field E created by the line charges is
      perpendicular to the traveling wave.<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where [epsilon] is the linear capacitance of space and c is the
      speed of light. Thus there is a force per volume around the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] This combination of fields produces a spacetime curvature
      as determined by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. The
      traveling electric field has an amplitude in the vertical
      z-direction and travels in the x-direction<br>
      Ew=Ezcos(x-t)<br>
      The Faraday electromagnetic tensor contains all the electric and
      magnetic fields in all the {x,y,z} directions. The first row and
      first column contain the two electric fields<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      The stress exerted on spacetime occurs in the xx, yy and
      zz-direction as calculated from the stress-energy tensor T of
      gravitational physics<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where g is the metric tensor for Cartesian space<br>
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where the diagonal components are the coefficients of the
      elementary spacetime length ds squared<br>
      (ds)&lt;2&gt; =-(dt)&lt;2&gt; +(dx)&lt;2&gt; +(dy)&lt;2&gt;
      +(dz)&lt;2 &gt;<br>
      The calculation produces three stresses T&lt;xx&gt; ,T&lt;yy &gt;
      and T&lt;zz &gt; in their respective {x,y,z} directions.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Referring to FIG. 6, these three stresses are plotted
      together as a 3D vector field animated over time in nine frames.
      The graphs show that there is a lift force as depicted by the
      vertical arrows as well as a force of propulsion as shown by the
      interspersed horizontal arrows. With the passage of time, these
      vectors exchange places with each other so that the lift becomes
      the propulsion and vice versa, creating a wavy stress-energy field
      around the hull.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] This invention is a spacecraft with a triangular hull
      having charged flat plates on the vertical corners of the three
      sides. The two rear corners are charged to a potential V. The
      forward corner is charged to a potential -V. The 60[deg.] angle on
      the corner creates a line charge density singularity that produces
      a huge horizontal electric field pointing from the back to the
      front of the craft which is also parallel to the sides of the
      triangle. An array of horizontal slot antennas located on the
      sides of the triangular hull produce an electromagnetic wave with
      the electric field polarized in the vertical direction. This
      combination of fields produces a spacetime force in both the
      vertical and horizontal directions such that the spacecraft
      receives a lift force and a force of propulsion.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] Referring to FIG. 7, the antenna (A) is made out of sheet
      copper in which a rectangular horizontal slot (B) has been notched
      out using a die press and sheet metal fixture. A coaxial cable
      from the amplifier and frequency generator is attached across the
      slot by soldering the outer cable (D) to one side of the slot and
      the inner cable (E) to the other side of the slot. This creates
      the positive and negative charges across the gap which forms the
      vertical electric field (F) which radiates out perpendicularly to
      the copper sheet.<br>
