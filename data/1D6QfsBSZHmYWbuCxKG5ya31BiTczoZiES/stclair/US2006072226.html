      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention enhances the ability of a person to perform
      remote viewing by connecting the spiritual eye to the tetrahedral
      geometry of subspace.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Remote viewing is the projection of spiritual modules of
      the human energy field to distant locations in order to see,
      communicate and interact with other entities who live in subspace,
      space and hyperspace co-dimensions of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] One of my first remote viewings was made at night to a
      distance of 10,000 miles on the sunlit side of the earth. My
      spiritual eye and body projected together while my mental
      facilities remained in my physical body. I found myself looking
      down on a palm tree from a height of about one hundred feet. The
      palm tree had several coconuts in it as seen in FIG. 1. I then
      gave the command to lower myself to the ground. At that moment I
      went sailing down past the coconuts, barely missing the tree!
      Finding myself on a pathway through the tropical forest, I then
      came to an extremely long wooden bridge which crossed over a river
      gorge. On the other side of the bridge I could see three soldiers
      running toward me as shown in FIG. 2. The two soldiers in front
      were carrying rifles and wearing light blue berets. The man
      running behind them was wearing an officer's cap with a red band.
      My first reaction was that I was going to be shot. I edged over on
      the right side of the wooden railing. They ran right past without
      seeing me. I then asked to see the building that these soldiers
      were guarding. Everything went dark, and then I found my spiritual
      eye peeking out of the floor of a computer room as seen in FIG. 3.
      There was one man using a computer on the opposite side of the
      room near an open door. He got up from his chair and came over to
      sit in front of a second computer located a few feet from where I
      was located. From the glare of the computer monitor, I could
      clearly see his face. Everything went dark as my spiritual eye and
      body projected back to my physical body.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Another time my spiritual eye, spiritual body and mind were
      standing outside the closed front door of my condominium. Upon
      patting my legs with my hands, I couldn't find the keys in my
      trousers. When I looked down, I realized I wasn't in my physical
      body. I then shot through two solid walls of concrete and returned
      to my awakening body.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] What these two examples show is that the human spiritual
      energy system is modular. The reason it is modular is because
      there are seven hyperspace co-dimensions, each vibrating at a
      slightly different frequency, which receive energy from space
      through seven vortices located along the physical body. Over a
      lifetime, these vortices build up the human aura. Because all
      energy systems have to be grounded, the remaining six modules are
      the legs, body, arms/hands, voice, eye and mind. When the entire
      group is out-of-body as a single entity, then the soul energy
      powers the body in a manner similar to a battery. The soul looks
      like a two-inch diameter orange ball of plasma. If the soul is
      removed from the body, then the body becomes paralyzed except for
      a small movement of the eyelids. Upon death, all these separate
      modules are assembled into a single energy being. A light cord
      from the soul provides the battery power and information required
      to join these modules together. A second light cord from the
      pituitary gland transfers the modules into the energy being for
      assembly. This energy information transfer is the reason that
      people in a near-death situation say they saw their entire life
      flash before them.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Moving to a larger picture of things that are happening in
      the galaxy, I was able to make contact with the Pleiadian
      Federation which is located about 400 light years from earth. The
      Federation is a group of over one hundred intelligent beings that
      were brought to the Pleiades from around the galaxy. One member of
      the Federation calls itself the Intelligent Insect Beings. They
      are the ones who fly the black triangles over Belgium and France
      for the purpose of evacuating human beings back to the Pleiades
      for relocation on a planet called Earth II. The reason for this
      evacuation was that it was not known if it would be possible to
      win the battle of Revelations, which would take place about two
      years later here on earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As could be expected, the humans were angry and hysterical
      at being abducted. So the Intelligent Insect Beings asked me if I
      could calm them down. I was in telepathic communication with them,
      and they were in telepathic communication with their computer
      system, which meant that I could have my thoughts displayed to the
      humans on the computer monitor. It turned out that one woman was
      from Central America and only spoke Spanish. The Intelligent
      Insect Beings didn't speak Spanish so they thought there would be
      no way I could communicate with her. So I told them that I would
      spell the Spanish words letter-by-letter and she could then read
      my message. Since most Spanish people are Catholics, I thought a
      religious message would be of importance to her. I spelled out the
      phrase, "Que Dios te bendiga." which means, "May God bless you." I
      also asked the two beings to put their hands together in a form of
      prayer, and the woman followed suit. At that moment the
      Intelligent Insect Beings were reading her mind to understand her
      emotional state. They said, "She is crying tears . . . " After a
      slight but tense pause, they continued, "of joy!" They said the
      woman had a big smile on her face and was successfully
      transitioned into her new life.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] One year later, the Blond Aliens of the hundred member
      council of the Pleiadian Federation remote viewed me so that I
      could celebrate with them the success of their mission to earth.
      The Blond Aliens, which is not their real name, fly the Beamship
      spacecraft. This hyperspace vehicle can teleport itself to any
      location in the galaxy. It dematerializes into the black void for
      an instance and then re-materialize anywhere in the galaxy. This
      ship can be seen in Billy Meier's video from Switzerland along
      with a picture of their envoy, Semjase.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Just recently I had a demonstration of the Beamship's
      ability. I heard an emergency distress call by a commander of a
      spacecraft who said that they had a fire onboard their spacecraft.
      I immediately remote viewed a Federation maintenance mothership,
      they got the frequency and location of the ship, and dispatched
      the Beamship in time to rescue the commander. The burned-out
      cables, which had caused the fire, were repaired by the Federation
      and the commander arrived home safely on his planet in his own
      spacecraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The Federation then received a message from the commander
      saying that he wanted his planet to join the Federation now that
      there was this type of communication available. So the Federation
      visited his planet for the signing ceremony, and I was invited to
      attend the proceedings by remote view. Word got around about this,
      and within three weeks another 20 planets joined the Federation
      for the same reason.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] At one ceremony, which was attended by Admiral Third Class
      of the Pleiadian Defense Department, His Highness of the planet
      was signing the document of incorporation. At that moment, I could
      see him signing, so I exclaimed, "He is signing with his left
      hand." The Admiral was almost apoplectic at hearing this. After
      giving her the signed document, His Highness held up his hand and
      asked me how many fingers he was holding up. He had a fist so I
      said none. Then he put his index finger out and I said one. He
      then made a fist again and I said none. Then he held out all
      fingers and I said five. The Admiral said that he had a big smile
      on his face as he went to announce the agreement because he knew,
      even though his planet was located 90,000 light years away on the
      other side of the galaxy, he could instantly communicate any
      problems to the Federation. So this is the importance of
      developing inventions that can enhance our remote viewing ability
      because one day it will mean that we can become a vital part of
      the Pleiadian Federation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] Referring to FIG. 4, the spiritual eye of the human energy
      system is located at the pituitary gland in the forehead. It has
      the shape of a hollow cone which is composed of the misty white
      energy of hyperspace. Light coming into this vortex is then
      transferred by a light cord to a visual energy module which is
      located in a co-dimension of hyperspace. Because these modules are
      interconnected by light cords, the mind module is able to
      interpret the visual pattern the eye is seeing. More importantly,
      the mind can give logical instructions to this spiritual eye
      module for it to rotate around or move in a particular direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The reason that hyperspace has a white misty look to it is
      that the speed of light is very much less than the speed of light
      in our spacetime. The Lorentz transformation says that the
      distance L is shortened relativistically to a distance L' in a way
      related to the ratio of the velocity v of the object to the
      velocity of light c. [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      If the velocity of light is very low, then a small velocity
      creates an enormous contraction in length. By moving through
      hyperspace, therefore, enormous distances can be traversed. And
      this is the reason that it is possible to project the spiritual
      eye, voice and hearing to remote locations in the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The universe is composed of subspace, space and hyperspace
      which are co-dimensions of each other. Subspace is defined by the
      geometry of the tetrahedron which is a four-sided solid whose
      faces are equilateral triangles having three 60[deg.] angles.
      Referring to FIG. 5, a tetrahedron whose sides are the square root
      of three (A), has a height of the square root of two (B), and base
      length equal to the square root of one (C). This forms the basic
      number set {[square root of]{square root over (1)}, [square root
      of]{square root over (2)}, [square root of]{square root over
      (3)}}.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Referring to FIG. 6, the tetrahedron (A) is circumscribed
      by the sphere (B). Rod (C) is the sphere radius. A second rod (D),
      of equal length to rod (C), from the center of the sphere to the
      corner of the tetrahedron makes an angle [phi] of [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      So the four corners of the tetrahedron touch the sphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This tetrahedral geometry can be seen throughout the
      planets of the solar system Referring to FIG. 7, the islands of
      the Caribbean curve down from Puerto Rico to Venezuela forming an
      island vortex. The low density hyperspace energy releasing from
      the corner of the tetrahedron softens the rock mantle. The hot
      magma then rises through the rock with the least resistance. This
      creates a circular arc of volcanic islands along the edge of the
      vortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Referring to FIG. 8, the Giant Red Spot of Jupiter is
      located at a southern latitude of 19.5[deg.]. This vortex is so
      large that the entire earth can fit in it.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Referring to FIG. 9, the Olympus Mons volcano is located at
      a northern latitude of 19.5[deg.] as shown by the marker. This
      volcano is the size of France. Notice the fallen plume of volcanic
      debris toward the north east.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The double harmonic of the tetrahedral angle is twice
      19.5[deg.] or 39[deg.] which is the location of the Silver Bridge
      in Point Pleasant, West Va. A large wormhole opened up around the
      bridge during Christmas rush hour when the bridge was full of
      cars. Due to the low density hyperspace energy, the rivets holding
      the cables down popped loose and all the cars were dumped into the
      river. A computer simulation using Schrodinger's quantum mechanics
      equation for a particle in a potential well shows that as the
      energy becomes less dense, the particle is no longer contained in
      the potential well. The electron jumps out. Thus the atomic bonds
      are broken which softens the rivets. This is the first time that
      there has been an understanding of the failure mechanism of this
      bridge.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] After downloading from the Internet several pages of the
      index of refraction of a wide range of materials, I noticed that
      the index of refraction for Plexiglas was 1.50. Another source
      said it was 1.51. One of the Internet sites had a movable
      flashlight which showed the incident ray and the refracted ray.
      For Plexiglas, surprisingly enough, the incident ray was coming in
      at an angle of 60[deg.] to the normal, and the light was refracted
      at 35.26[deg.], both of which are tetrahedral angles. The angle of
      the equilateral face of the tetrahedron is of course 60[deg.]. The
      angle at the top of tetrahedron is the arc-cosine of the ratio of
      the height over the edge length. [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      According to Snell's law, the index of refraction n, times the
      sine of the angle sin([theta]1) of the ray leaving material m1, is
      equal to the index of refraction n2 times the sine of the angle of
      refraction sin([theta]2) of the ray entering material m2.
      Referring to FIG. 10, the equation is<br>
      n1 sin([theta]1)=n2 sin([theta]2)<br>
      The index of air n1 is equal to one. The index n2 of Plexiglas is
      1.50. If the incident ray is at [theta]1=60[deg.] to the normal,
      then the output angle is [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      which is equal to the angle of the tetrahedron.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Then I recalled several months earlier that I had gone to
      the Subway restaurant to get a sandwich. I was sitting by the
      Plexiglas window communicating with the Admiral whose mothership
      was in earth orbit. She mentioned that they were bringing two
      people aboard. At that moment I looked out through the window and
      I could see both of them clearly and easily through my spiritual
      eye. To my amazement, I saw both of the captives start to pull out
      guns from behind their backs. I then projected by spiritual hands
      which resulted in preventing the attack on the security guards. To
      say the least, the Admiral was rather surprised at these events.
      She then asked me to look at the design of the window because she
      thought it had something to do with my enhanced remote viewing
      capabilities. Looking at the Plexiglas, I noticed that on the edge
      of the large window pane there was a shorter piece of Plexiglas
      which was mounted parallel to the window pane. This smaller panel
      acted to protect the yellow neon fluorescent tube. I took the
      measurements of the design using a piece of paper that I found
      near the table.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] I then went home and designed up a mounting bracket with my
      3D computer software. I had already installed the
      stereolithography software that converts the design to the *.STL
      file format. How stereolithography works is that it slices the
      design into many thin horizontal sections. The machine has a
      platform which is mounted in a bath of liquid polymer. An
      ultraviolet laser, mounted on an xy-table, then traces out the
      slice. Because the liquid polymer is light sensitive, it
      polymerizes immediately into solid plastic. Then the platform is
      lowered a few thousandths of an inch and the second slice is
      added. This process eventually builds up the complete 3D part.
      Using the Internet, the *.STL file is sent by e-mail to the
      stereolithography service provider who returns the part overnight.
      So the next day I had the piece from which I made a plastic mold
      and several additional pieces for mounting the Plexiglas bracket
      on a full sheet of Plexiglas that I ordered locally. It never
      occurred to me to measure the angles, so after I got the index of
      refraction for Plexiglas, I measured the incident angle and it
      turned out to be 61[deg.]. So then I realized that the spiritual
      eye was being diffracted across these two Plexiglas plates which
      connected it to the tetrahedral geometry of subspace. Because
      subspace is the foundation of space, this created a much more
      efficient route for remote viewing. The result is that this
      invention has allowed me to make contact with 430 alien
      civilizations. Since then I have been awarded the Aphysics prize
      for my work in the invention and elaboration of the tetrahedron
      diagram of which there are now over 4000 graphs. The scientific
      discoveries contained in the diagram are (1) the electron and
      proton are one and same particle, (2) the existence of hyperspace,
      (3) how mass can be taken out of dimension, (4) cosmology
      determines the elementary particles, (4) all the physics constants
      and the tetrahedral geometry are contained in the two 360[deg.]
      circles of the infinity symbol and (5) all the physics constants
      are determined geometrically and projected from a subspace
      manifold into our dimension. For my work in Revelations, I was
      awarded four beautiful galloping riderless white horses of the
      Apocalypse.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0037] 1. Referring to FIG. 11, the remote viewing station is
      a rectangular box wooden frame (A) on which is mounted on one side
      a large sheet of Plexiglas (B). The diffraction panel (C), made of
      a shorter length of Plexiglas, is mounted with acrylic glue on the
      Plexiglas sheet using clear polyoptic molded plastic spacers (D).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Referring to FIG. 12, the wedge-shaped spacers (D) hold the
      diffraction panel (C) to the sheet of Plexiglas (B). The angle of
      the wedge is 30[deg.] which makes the incident angle 60[deg.] to
      the normal.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Referring to the top view perspective FIG. 13, sitting on
      the wide bench, the remote viewer can adjust his sight along the
      wedge for proper alignment at an angle of 60[deg.]. Due to the
      1.50 index of refraction of Plexiglas, the spiritual eye is
      diffracted across the edge of the first panel and then refracted
      across the second panel at the tetrahedral angle of 35.26[deg.].<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Referring to FIG. 14, the remote viewing image is seen
      superimposed on the large sheet of Plexiglas which acts as the
      viewing screen.<br>
