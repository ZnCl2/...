          <big>A spacecraft propulsion system utilizing thrusters
            comprised of a motor-driven electrostatically charged
            cylinder rotating within an electrostatically charged
            annular ring for the purpose of creating a spacetime
            curvature stress-energy tension in the horizontal direction.
            The thrusters are augmented by magnetic vortex generators,
            either embedded in the cylinders or located above each
            thruster, for the purpose of increasing the permittivity of
            space by permeating each thruster with low density
            hyperspace energy generated by a wormhole created between
            our space and hyperspace. A combination of three thrusters
            mounted on the underside of the hull of the spacecraft
            provide thrust and yaw motion control.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
            <br>
            [0001] The invention, which is the object of my present
            application, is a spacecraft propulsion system which
            develops a spacetime curvature tension utilizing a
            combination of a rotating radial electrostatic field and a
            fixed vertical electrostatic field. The two fields create a
            stress-energy T&lt;zr &gt;gradient in the radially direction
            which is equal to force. The radial field is created on the
            side of a charged rotating cylinder on the underside of the
            hull. The vertical field is created by an annular charged
            ring concentric with the cylinder. Three rotating cylinders
            are located in a triangle on the bottom of the hull in order
            to produce a force in any direction in the horizontal plane.<br>

            <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0003] When working with Maxwell's equations in tensor
            notation, it became apparent that a tensor can change
            identity depending on what permutation of variables is
            involved. For example, one single equation can involve both
            charge density and current density. And all of Maxwell's
            equations can be reduced to just two equations.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] In the tensor equation for momentum, if the lever arm
            is length then the equation is equal to the flow rate of
            angular momentum. If the lever arm is time, then you get
            linear momentum. And if the field rotates with time, then
            the time rate of change of linear momentum is a force which
            is the basis for this invention.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] Einstein said that mass curves space and space tells
            mass how to move. In this sense, generalized mass can be
            mass, electromagnetic fields, charge or angular momentum
            which create a spacetime curvature that produces a force on
            the spacecraft.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0006] The invention relates to a spacecraft utilizing a
            rotating electrostatically charged cylinder and a concentric
            annular charged ring to create a stress-energy spacetime
            curvature in the horizontal plane on the spacecraft's
            underside hull. A motor drives the rotating cylinder which
            extends below the hull. A charged surface produces an
            electric field in the direction normal to the surface. The
            vertical and rotating electric fields combine to create a
            rate of change of linear momentum which creates a horizontal
            propulsive force on the hull.<br>

            </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><b><br>
            </b>[0020] 1. Referring to FIG. 1, the spacecraft comprises
            an upper hull (A) with three rotating electrostatically
            charged cylinders (C) with their concentric annular
            electrostatically charged rings (D) located on the
            spacecraft's bottom hull (B).<br>
            <br>
            [0021] 2. In a closer view of one of the cylinders seen in
            FIG. 2, motor-driven rotating cylinder (A) has an
            electrostatically charged surface which produces an electric
            field (C) normal to said surface. The fixed,
            electrostatically charged annular ring (B), which is
            concentric with the cylinder, produces a vertical electric
            field (D) normal to its surface. This crossed field (E)
            creates a negative spacetime curvature tension which is the
            product of the two fields divided by 4[pi] as seen in the
            equation, FIG. 3.<br>
            <br>
            [0022] 3. Notice that the equation involves the permittivity
            of space [epsilon]0 divided by the linear mass of the
            universe [Omega] and the speed of light. This produces units
            of inverse meter squared which is the spacetime curvature.
            In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, the spacetime
            curvature tensor is equal to the stress-energy tensor or
            G=8[pi]T where G is the curvature, and T is the product of
            the electromagnetic fields. The problem with this equation,
            which has been resolved with this invention, is that the
            linear mass [Omega] times the speed of light c is an
            enormous number. Even with the square of enormous electric
            fields, the curvature would be too small even to notice, and
            little force would be generated.<br>
            <br>
            [0023] 4. In another patent application of mine entitled
            Magnetic Vortex Generator, it was shown that a rotating
            cylinder containing embedded and stacked bar magnets
            produces a negative mass and negative spacetime spring
            constant. It can be shown that this combination produces a
            small wormhole or interdimensional connection between our
            space and hyperspace along the centerline of the rotating
            cylinder. Co-dimensions of hyperspace have different physics
            constants. A low pressure region of hyperspace has a very
            low mass density and a very low speed of light. The wormhole
            allows this low density hyperspace energy to enter into our
            space and permeate the cylinder and annular ring. The
            permittivity is proportional to the inverse of the speed of
            light squared. The hyperspace speed of light, obtained from
            my tetrahedron physics diagram, is 8971 meters per second.
            The speed of light in our dimension is 299792458 meters per
            second. As shown by the enclosed reference calculation, the
            hyperspace permittivity is about a trillion times larger.
            Because the force is equal to this new permittivity times
            the electric fields squared times the area around cylinder,
            the force is greatly amplified by this increase in the
            permittivity of space.<br>
            <br>
            [0024] 5. It is pertinent to this invention how the
            stress-energy is created due to the two electric fields in
            the vertical and radial direction. In gravitational physics,
            there is a Faraday F tensor which contains all the
            components of the electromagnetic fields. It is a 4 by 4
            matrix whose rows and columns correspond to the coordinates
            of spacetime which in cylindrical coordinates are {t, r,
            [theta], z} where t is time, r the radius, theta the
            horizontal angle and z the vertical height. These
            coordinates are shown in FIG. 4.<br>
            <br>
            [0025] 6. The radial electric Er field and the vertical
            electric Ez field can be inserted into the Faraday tensor
            seen in FIG. 5. The sign of the vertical field is positive
            because it points in the positive z-direction due to the
            fact that the annular ring has a negative charge. The
            cylinder has a positive charge. This produces the negative
            stress-energy tensor T&lt;zr &gt;as drawn in FIG. 6.<br>
            <br>
            [0026] 7. In order to calculate the force on the cylinder,
            it is necessary to calculate the flow rate of angular
            momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity or mass meter per
            second. If the mass is moving in a circle, then there is a
            lever arm times the momentum which makes it mass meter
            squared per second. If this is differentiated with respect
            to time, then a flow rate of angular momentum is produced
            with units of mass meter squared per second squared. As
            mentioned previously, tensors have this dual nature where
            depending on the permutation of the variables, it means one
            thing or another. In this case, the lever arm will be time,
            rather than length which converts the flow rate of angular
            momentum into just linear momentum. If you change linear
            momentum with respect to time, then you get a force.<br>
            <br>
            [0027] 8. The flow rate of angular momentum S is shown in
            FIG. 7. The force has to be against the area whose normal
            vector is in the radial direction which is also the
            direction of the momentum. So S has an r subscript
            indicating that it flows in the radial direction. The
            permutation tensor [epsilon] has three subscripts which
            keeps track of the tensor notation. The first subscript is
            the same as the momentum subscript. Permutations of the
            coordinate variables which are in order have a plus one
            sign. Permutations which are in reverse order have a minus
            one sign. Permutations in which the variable are repeated
            are zero. For example,
            [epsilon]tr[theta]z=-[epsilon]rt[theta]z because the r and t
            are in reverse order in cylindrical coordinates. Because the
            permutation tensor starts with r, then we can have
            permutations such as {r,t,z} which is a reverse order
            negative permutation. This negative sign cancels the
            negative sign of the stress tensor. The reason this
            permutation is chosen is because the first subscript on the
            stress-energy tensor is now z. Because the normal to the
            area is in the radial direction, then the stress-tensor
            matches the electric fields that we have available, which
            are also in the zr-direction.<br>
            <br>
            [0028] 9. In this case, the second subscript of the
            permutation tensor is time, rather than length. So the units
            become, as shown in FIG. 8, those of linear momentum. To me,
            this was very surprising. Then I realized that the radial
            electric field rotates with time which means the
            differential of the linear momentum produces a force on the
            hull. In exponential notation, the radial electric field
            rotates with Exp[i[omega]t]. This is multiplied by the time
            lever arm, so the term that has to be differentiated is t
            e&lt;i[omega]t&gt;. The time lever arm saves the
            differentiation by making one term real so that the force is
            real. This is shown in FIG. 9. The units of the first term
            are real newtons. In the second term, the time t multiplied
            by the frequency cancels out in terms of units, so the units
            are still force, but imaginary<br>
            <br>
            [0029] 10. There is an area involved in the force equation
            which is depicted in FIG. 10. The charged rotating cylinder
            (C) located inside the charged annular ring (B) is driven by
            motor (A). The radial electric field (E) is normal to the
            area (D) whose normal vector is also in the radial
            direction. The angular momentum flows through this area
            which surrounds the cylinder. In doing so, it curves
            spacetime which produces the force.<br>
            <br>
            [0030] 11. If the radial electric field is continuous around
            the cylinder, then the net force is zero. Referring to FIG.
            11, one section (A) of the rotating cylinder is charged,
            which means that there is a force once per cycle in a
            selected direction depending on when the annular ring is
            charged. The other option, referring to FIG. 12, is that the
            annular ring is divided up into two or three sections with
            the feature that the charge can be turned on (A) or off (B)
            on a particular segment. As the rotating electric field goes
            around, one of the annular ring sections will have an
            electric field in order create a force on that side.<br>
            <br>
            [0031] 12. Since there are three force cylinders, this
            allows for yaw motion control so that the hull of the
            spacecraft can pivot to change direction. After the
            directional change, the two back cylinders can be
            synchronized to produce thrust in the forward direction.<br>
            <br>
            [0032] 13. There could also be a polarity change for the
            vertical electric field such that a positive stress-energy
            is produced which would reverse the direction of the thrust.<br>
