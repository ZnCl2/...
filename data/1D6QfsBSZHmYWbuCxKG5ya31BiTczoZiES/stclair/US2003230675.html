          A spacecraft having a circular, domed hull around which dual
          electrically-charged rotors one above the other are
          counter-rotating on the edge of the hull. Embedded in the hull
          are three solenoids which create a positive vector potential
          at the rotors. The surface charge density times the radius
          times the vector potential times the area of the rotors
          creates an angular momentum in the vertical direction. This
          angular momentum produces a positive spacetime curvature over
          the dome of the hull and a negative spiking spacetime
          compression over the rotors. By machining circumferential
          grooves of decreasing height along the radius of the rotor, a
          negative surface inductance is generated. This negative
          inductance gradient times the negative spacetime compression
          time the rotor current density squared times the rotor area
          squared is a positive lift force on the spacecraft.<br>

          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] The invention, which is the object of my present
          application, is a spacecraft with a circular, domed hull
          around which are located dual electrically-charged
          counter-rotating rotors. The top surface of the upper rotor is
          etched with circular metallic grooves which give the rotor a
          surface inductance. The groove height decreases from the
          inside radius to the outside radius of the rotor giving it a
          radial inductance gradient. The surface charge density times
          the angular velocity produces a current density. The
          counter-rotating rotors produce a negative spacetime curvature
          over the rotors. The negative surface inductance gradient
          times the negative spiking spacetime curvature times the
          current density squared times the area squared is the positive
          lift force on the rotor.<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0007] I was reading several articles about the development of
          the magnetron during World War II in the Bell System Technical
          Journal. I was trying to understand why the device resonates
          because it must contain a spring constant which would arise
          from an inductance and capacitance due to the geometry of the
          cavity. As given by Feynman, inductance of a solenoid is the
          permeability of space times the turns per length squared times
          the volume of the solenoid. Referring to FIG. 1, the magnetron
          cavity (A) has a circular region connected to a planar region.
          The electrical current flows on the sides of the cavity shown
          by the arrows (B). In this case, there is only one turn per
          height of the cavity times the volume of the cavity times the
          permeability which produces the inductance. The two planar
          regions produce a capacitance across the ends which creates
          the resonant frequency.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] From my previous patent application Dual Rotor
          Propulsion System I know that the two rotors produce a current
          density in the angular direction along the rotor. If I spread
          out the magnetron cavity into a circular groove around a
          rotor, then the current would flow on the side walls enclosing
          the groove volume. The rotors also produce a spacetime
          curvature profile as shown in FIG. 2. Curve (A) is a positive
          spacetime curvature tension over the dome. Curve (B) is a
          negative spiking spacetime curvature over the rotors. The
          curvature is measured in inverse meter squared. So the surface
          inductance times the negative curvature times the current
          density squared times the rotor area squared is magnetic
          energy. The differential of the magnetic energy would be a
          force. So there has to be a gradient of the surface
          inductance. The volume element of a groove is equal to the
          circumferential length times the height times the width of the
          groove. The easiest is to vary the height with radius. Since
          the curvature is negative, the gradient has to be negative as
          well in order to get a positive lift force. Thus the height
          goes from large to small from the inside to the outside
          radius.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0009] The invention relates to a spacecraft with a domed,
          circular hull of elliptical cross-section having dual
          electrically-charged counter-rotating rotors located one above
          the other on the edge of the hull. The upper rotor is
          positively charged and rotates clockwise with a negative
          angular velocity per the right-hand rule. The lower rotor is
          negatively charged and rotates with a positive angular
          velocity. The current density is the surface charge density
          times the velocity of the rotor. This particular combination
          of velocity and charge produces an angular momentum which
          creates a negative spiking spacetime curvature over the
          rotors.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The top surface of the rotor is etched or machined with
          circular grooves around the rotor. This creates a surface
          inductance which is equal to the permeability of space times
          the turns per length squared times the volume of the groove.
          In this case, there is only one turn per height of the groove.
          If the height of the groove decreases from one groove to the
          next, then there is a negative surface inductance gradient in
          the radial direction. So the lift force on the rotors would be
          the negative surface inductance gradient times the negative
          spacetime curvature times the current density squared times
          the rotor area squared.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b>[0035] 1. Referring to FIG. 3, the spacecraft has a
          circular, domed hull of elliptical cross-section with dual
          electrically-charged counter-rotating rotors one above the
          other on the edge of the hull.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] 2. Referring to FIG. 4, embedded within the hull are
          three solenoids or current loops carrying a constant
          electrical current in the positive sense per the right-hand
          rule.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] 3. Referring to FIG. 5, Feynman has shown that the
          vector potential {A} of a solenoid is equal to the number of
          turns per length {n} times the current {I} times the radius of
          the solenoid {a} squared divided by half the permittivity of
          space {[epsilon]0} times the speed of light {c} squared times
          the radius {r'} prime from the center of the coil to some
          location in space such as the rotors. It has been found by
          physicists Bohm and Aharanov that the vector potential field
          is not confined to an infinitely long solenoid as is the
          magnetic B field. The vector potential has units of
          kilogram-meter per second-coulomb as seen in FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] 4. Referring to FIG. 7, the three solenoids of varying
          radius and area produce a positive vector potential at the
          centerline of the rotors as seen in the graph.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] 5. This graph is then rotated ninety degrees so that it
          can be located in relation to the rotors as seen in FIG. 8.
          The vector potential (D), which is created by solenoids
          (A,B,C), passes through rotors (E) and (H). Rotor (E), which
          has a positive charge (G), is rotating clockwise (F), and
          rotor (H), which has a negative charge (K), is rotating
          counter-clockwise (J).<br>
          <br>
          [0040] 6. Referring to FIG. 9, rotor mechanics uses the
          exponential function for the harmonic motion of the rotor. The
          radius is {r e&lt;i[omega]t&gt;} which when differentiated
          with respect to time becomes a velocity {i [omega] r
          e&lt;i[omega]t&gt;} where the imaginary {i} is a 90[deg.]
          phase lead which makes the velocity tangential to the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] 7. The rotor surface charge {[sigma] sigma} is rotating
          around at some radius {r}. For the upper rotor the surface
          charge density is positive (+[sigma]} but the rotor has a
          negative angular velocity {-[omega]}. For the lower rotor, the
          surface charge density is negative {-[sigma]} but the rotor
          has a positive angular velocity {+[omega]}. So the combined
          surface charge rotation is {-[sigma] r
          e&lt;i[omega]t&gt;+[sigma] r e&lt;-i[omega]t&gt;}. This charge
          rotation times the positive vector potential due to the
          solenoids times the rotor surface area is equal to angular
          momentum S as shown in FIG. 10. The units are given in FIG.
          11. The angular momentum is equal to the negative of the
          difference of the exponentials times a constant. I then
          recalled that this difference is equal to twice imaginary sine
          of the angle as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] 8. Referring to FIG. 13, the angular momentum is equal
          to minus two times the imaginary number times a constant times
          the sine of the rotational angle. In most of my spacecraft
          designs, the electromagnetic fields determine the flow rate of
          angular momentum. When the flow rate is integrated with
          respect to time, the angular momentum becomes imaginary. In
          this invention, the angular momentum is imaginary due directly
          to the rotors. The importance of being imaginary is that the
          radius resonates with the angular momentum. In some spacetime
          curvature equations, the denominator has a term equal to the
          radius to the fourth power plus twice the square of the
          angular momentum. In spacetime units, angular momentum is
          viewed as meter squared. So the square of imaginary angular
          momentum is negative angular momentum equal to negative meters
          to the fourth power. So at some radius, these two terms are
          equal, the denominator goes to zero, and the spacetime
          curvature becomes infinitely-large, creating a huge spike.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] 9. This next section calculates the spacetime curvature
          from the equation for the angular momentum.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] 10. Referring to FIG. 14, the elemental length ds&lt;2
          &gt;is curved by the presence of the angular momentum which is
          one of the energies, such as mass, charge, and electromagnetic
          fields, that Einstein showed can curve spacetime. Because the
          angular momentum is pointing in the vertical z-direction, due
          to the direction of the unit normal vector to the surface of
          the rotor, it rotates around in the angular direction
          {dtd[theta]} as found in cylindrical coordinates
          {t,r,[theta],z}.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] 11. In gravitational physics there is a g metric tensor
          which is a measure of length in spacetime coordinates. It is a
          4 by 4 matrix with rows and columns equal to the cylindrical
          coordinates. Referring to FIG. 15, the diagonal of the matrix
          is {-1,1,r&lt;2&gt;,1} where the minus one corresponds to time
          which is Einstein's convention. Half the angular momentum goes
          in the {t[theta]} slot of the g metric tensor, and the other
          half goes in the {[theta]t} slot.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] 12. From this g metric tensor, Einstein's G curvature
          tensor can be calculated in the various directions. In
          Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, his equation is
          G=8[pi]T where G is the spacetime curvature measured in
          inverse meter squared, and the T tensor is the
          stress-energy-momentum matrix containing all the
          electromagnetic pressures, mass and momentum components that
          curve spacetime. The spacetime curvature tension Gzz in the
          vertical direction, as a function of radius, is shown in FIG.
          16. A positive curvature indicates that there is a spacetime
          tension over the hull which produces lift. The curvature has a
          large positive spike over the dome of the hull (A) which means
          that there is a large lift force over the center of the hull.
          The curvature then falls off and spikes with a negative
          spacetime curvature compression over the rotors (B). This
          curvature also oscillates back and forth a short distance due
          to the sinusoidal term. The problem is to convert this
          compression into a lift force which this invention solves.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] 13. This next section shows how the spacetime
          compression over the rotors generates lift.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] 14. As I mentioned, I have been reading some of the
          World War II magnetron scientific papers of the Bell System
          Technical Journal. It turns out that inductance of a solenoid
          is equal to the permeability of space times the number of wire
          turns per length squared times the volume of the solenoid.
          Imagine having a copper strip in the shape of the magnetron
          cavity in FIG. 1. The electrical current (B) flows around the
          height of the strip (A), so there is only one turn per the
          height. Then that is multiplied by the volume of the cavity
          and permeability to get the inductance. The inductor is
          storing magnetic energy equal to half the inductance times the
          current squared. In this invention, current density J in amp
          per meter is used rather than current. So taking a hint from
          this information, the magnetic energy would have to be related
          to the inductance times the square of the current density
          times the area squared of the rotor and times the negative
          spacetime curvature. The curvature is measured in inverse
          meter squared. That product produces a negative magnetic
          energy when in fact I want a positive force. This means that
          there has to be an inductance gradient in the equation instead
          of pure inductance and, furthermore, the gradient has to be
          negative in order to cancel out the negative sign of the
          compression curvature.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] 15. The equation for the magnetic energy in terms of
          the inductance {&lt;custom-character
          file="US20030230675A1-20031218-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20"
          id="custom-character-00001"/&gt;}, curvature {K}, current
          density {J} and area {A} is shown in FIG. 17 with the units in
          FIG. 18. The inductance in the equation is proportional to the
          volume of the circular groove in the top surface of the rotor.
          That volume is equal to {2[pi] r h w} where {h] is the height
          of groove (depth) and {w} is the width located at some radius
          {r}. In terms of machining, it would be more difficult to
          machine a variable width groove rather than a deeper groove of
          a constant width. So I am going to say the gradient is in the
          radial direction with the height of the groove decreasing
          going from the inside radius to the outside radius as depicted
          in FIG. 19.<br>
          <br>
          [0050] 16. FIG. 20 gives the equation for the height of the
          groove along the radius of the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0051] 17. FIG. 21 gives the inductance gradient by
          differentiating the inductance with respect to the radius. The
          initial groove height ho is not very large, and the inductance
          gradient becomes negative at the rotor as seen in the graph of
          FIG. 22.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] 18. Referring to FIG. 23, the lift force on the rotor
          is now positive due to the combined negative inductance
          gradient times the negative spacetime compression. The square
          of the negative current density is positive also. This means
          that that the top surface of the lower rotor can also have a
          surface inductance gradient which would double the lift force.<br>
