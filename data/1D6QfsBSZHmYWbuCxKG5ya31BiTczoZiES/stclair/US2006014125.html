      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention is a training system that enables a human
      being to acquire sufficient hyperspace energy in order to pull the
      body out of dimension so that the person can walk through solid
      objects such as wooden doors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] A human being is a hyperspace energy being living in a
      physical container or body that is comprised of 67% water. This
      high percentage of water makes this invention possible. Referring
      to FIG. 1, the hyperspace energy being receives energy from our
      dimension through seven vortices that run the length of the body.
      Each vortex connects to a separate hyperspace dimension having its
      own particular frequency. This arrangement allows for the
      development of seven modular energy components corresponding to
      the mind, spiritual eye, voice, body, abdomen, plasma energy ball
      (battery), and ground connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Vortex (A), known as the top vortex, supplies energy to the
      mind and provides a channel of communication to other entities in
      the universe. This channel has been tested up to 100,000 light
      years which is the diameter of the galaxy.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Vortex (B), known as the spiritual eye, has a hollow
      cone-like appearance surrounded by white, misty, low-density
      hyperspace energy. Because the eye is modular, the mind can
      project it to vast distances, a process known as remote viewing.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Vortex (C), known as the voice and hearing module, can also
      be projected to enormous distances in order to communicate
      verbally with other entities. Using the proper remote viewing
      instruments, it is possible to project both the eye and verbal
      modules to see and talk at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Vortex (D), known as the heart vortex, provides protective
      energy to the upper internal organs, arms and hands.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Vortex (E) provides protective energy for the lower organs
      such as the intestines, liver and kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Vortex (F), known as the battery of the body, consists of
      an orange-colored plasma energy ball about one to two inches in
      diameter. The body becomes paralyzed if this ball is removed from
      the body. When the hyperspace energy being leaves the body, the
      vortices close and the battery takes over in order to keep the
      body functioning. This vortex also plays a role in the creation of
      the astral energy baby that attaches to the fertilized egg.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Vortex (G) is the ground vortex which rotates in the
      counter-clockwise direction in order to provide an energy ground
      for the electrical circuit. All the other vortices rotate in the
      clockwise direction as seen from the front such that energy flows
      into the vortex according to the right-hand rule of physics.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Vortex (H) is the hand vortex which rotates
      counterclockwise on the right hand and clockwise on the left hand
      as seen looking at the palm. Thus there is a rotating flow of
      hyperspace energy between the two hands when the palms are facing
      each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Referring to FIG. 2, each vortex feeds energy into its own
      hyperspace module shown by the lettered box. In terms of quantum
      mechanics, each box is actually a potential energy well in which
      each module develops separately. At the time of death of the body,
      these modules are joined together as a single energy being. The
      process is powered by the plasma energy ball battery which also
      contains the logical instructions for assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Different people, as tested by the pendulum on the hand
      vortex, have different vortex sizes. Three people were tested. The
      first person had almost no rotational movement showing very little
      energy. The second person had a vortex radius of one inch. Another
      had a vortex radius of four inches which covered his entire hand.
      The latter also has the ability to lift another human being, lying
      prone on a table, off the table by flowing low-density hyperspace
      energy into the person through the hand vortices. He has also
      experienced walking through a solid wooden door with a dog at his
      side. What this means is that there is a way, as described in this
      invention, of creating large energy vortices which will enable a
      person to acquire sufficient energy to walk out of dimension
      through solid objects such as wooden doors.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Researching the historical records, referring to the statue
      in FIG. 3, a humble black Catholic Dominican friar of the Santo
      Rosario Convent, by the name of San Martin de Porres, living in
      Peru in the 1500's, also developed this ability to walk through
      doors. For his beatification, many witnesses came forward to
      recount his extraordinary abilities. For example, a witness, who
      worked in the Convent, went to the cell of San Martin to ask for
      something to eat. When he reached the cell, he saw San Martin
      leaving with some medications apparently to heal someone sick. The
      witness waited by the open door of the cell for his return. After
      having waited awhile without being distracted by anything else, he
      saw said venerable brother fray Martin come out from his cell from
      the inside and call him by name. The witness was terrified, not
      understanding how this was possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The woman who gave me the statue told me that he would walk
      miles and miles each day to visit the poor. The task of walking
      means that there is a velocity involved. Because the body has
      mass, then there is a mass times a velocity, or momentum, involved
      in this ability. Notice also that the statue shows him walking
      with his right arm crossed over his left arm in the form of an X.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] What this walking momentum means in terms of physics is
      given in the following analysis. The human body consists of 67%
      water. A water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one
      oxygen atom having the atomic formula H2O. The atomic weight of
      one atom of hydrogen is 1.008 awu. The atomic weight of one atom
      of oxygen is 16.000 awu. The molecular weight of one atom of water
      is therefore:<br>
      <br>
      Weight of two atoms of hydrogen 2 * 1.008 awu =&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.016
      awu<br>
      <br>
      Weight of one atom of oxygen 1 * 16.000 awu =&nbsp; 16.000 awu<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; 18.016 awu<br>
      The formula weight is just the atomic weight expressed in grams.
      Thus the formula weight of water would be 18.016 grams or 0.018016
      kilograms. According to Avogadro's law, the formula weight
      contains N=6.02*10&lt;23 &gt; molecules. Thus the mass of one
      water molecule is the formula weight divided by the number of
      molecules: [mathematical formula - see original
      document][mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0016] According to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity,
      energy is equal to the mass times the speed of light squared. The
      energy of a photon is equal to Planck's constant h times the
      frequency f of the photon. Equating these two energies shows that
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which says that the natural logarithm of the mass plus the natural
      logarithm of the wavelength is equal to the natural logarithm of
      Planck's constant divided by the speed of light c, known as the
      base constant in the tetrahedron diagram. This diagram plots the
      mass versus wavelength in natural logarithms. Notice that the left
      hand side of the equation is the sum of mass and wavelength, so
      the right hand side must also be the same. [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      where [Omega][Lambda], known as the Planck mass, is the linear
      mass [Omega] of the universe times the bottom dimensional limit of
      the universe [Lambda], and 2[pi][Lambda] is the bottom dimensional
      wavelength, known as the Planck wavelength. That is, our dimension
      is bounded by the Planck box having sides Planck mass and Planck
      wavelength. These boundaries have values:<br>
      ln([Omega][Lambda])=-17.64290101<br>
      ln(2[pi][Lambda])=-78.27256243<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Referring to FIG. 4, these two lines are plotted on the
      tetrahedron diagram. The Planck mass line (A) reflects off the
      sphere (C) and returns as the Planck wavelength (B) which shows
      the dual nature of quantum physics. This creates the Planck box
      (a,b,c,d) which is the boundary of our dimension.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Referring to FIG. 5, the mass of the water molecule is
      plotted as horizontal line (D) on the diagram. The energy of the
      water molecule is the mass times the speed of light squared.<br>
      E=mc&lt;2 &gt;<br>
      ln(c)=19.51860099<br>
      ln(mc&lt;2&gt; )=ln(m)+2 ln(c)<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Referring to FIG. 6, a circle (E), having a radius equal to
      the speed of light squared, centered on the mass of the water
      molecule at the vertical axis, generates a circle (F), centered at
      the origin, that intersects (e) the mass of the water molecule at
      the Planck wavelength. That is, this intersection point sits right
      on the Planck box boundary between space and hyperspace. The
      radius of circle (F) is actually the mass of the water molecule
      divided by the speed of light squared. [mathematical formula - see
      original document][mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Taking the positive square root, the speed of light is one meter
      per second at the Planck boundary. The experiments with brain
      hemisphere resonance show that the resonant frequency of the human
      energy field is between 1 Hz to 5 Hz which is well below the
      hearing threshold of 20 Hz. Because the traveling wave has a
      wavelength of 0.3048 m and the speed of light is unity at the
      boundary, the frequency should be [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      which is within the middle of the experimental male range. At this
      resonant frequency, the human energy being pops out of the body.
      This represents only a first stage in the development of the
      energy being. But what is really wanted is to have both the
      physical body and the energy field move out of dimension together
      as San Martin did.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Referring to FIG. 7, the 45[deg.] base line (G) is added to
      the diagram. Notice that the Planck mass intersects (b,d) the
      Planck wavelength on this line because they sum to the base
      constant. The mass of the water molecule crosses this line at
      point (f). A circle, centered (f), with a radius equal to the
      speed of light, is tangent to the Planck wavelength (h) and the
      Planck mass (g). Since mass times velocity is momentum, the
      diagram says that the momentum of the water molecule is tangent to
      the boundaries of the Planck box which separates space from
      hyperspace. In order to get to point (e) from the momentum of the
      water molecule, a second circle is added to the momentum.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Referring to FIG. 8, a circle (I), centered on the water
      molecule mass at the speed of light circle (i), is made tangent to
      the Planck wavelength at point (e). The momentum M of space is
      equal to the Planck mass times the Planck scale times the speed of
      light. At point (e), the speed of light is unity, so that the
      momentum is just the Planck mass in momentum units: [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      Circle (I) has a radius equal to<br>
      ratio=e&lt;21.572952&gt; =2338912700<br>
      Therefore the walking momentum in order to get to point (e) is the
      momentum of space M times this ratio [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      The stride length L per second that a person of mass W has to walk
      is the walking momentum divided by the mass W times a period T of
      one second [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      For a person with a mass W of 99.79 kg (220 pounds), then the
      stride length L is 20.08 inches or one foot and eight inches. The
      person has to walk this length in one second on each foot.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Looking at the statue of San Martin, his arms are crossed
      over each other. The vortex of the right hand points backward, and
      the left hand vortex points forward due to the reversed rotation.
      Referring to FIG. 9, this creates a rotational energy channel (D)
      around his body (A). The stride length (C) is calculated according
      to the body mass, and then a banner printout is made showing where
      the footprints (B) are to be placed each second. The question is:
      "What happens when one walks the walk?".<br>
      <br>
      [0023] On the very first experiment, referring to FIG. 10, what
      happens is that, after taking only six strides on the banner
      printout (A), a huge spinning vortex (C) develops over the top of
      the head and the vertex locks onto the heart vortex in the center
      of the chest (B). In everyday life, this vortex is not created
      because normal walking is much faster and the hands are held at
      the side of the body. The energy rush through the pineal gland is
      so intense that one feels immediately sleepy and starts yawning
      excessively due to the increased flow of melatonin.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] After practicing with the banner printout, long walks were
      made through the park. In this case, a vertical white line rotated
      around a vertical axis located about six feet perpendicular to the
      path on the right side of the body. When the walking speed was
      correct, this white line would lock onto the centerline of the
      body. Speeding up or down caused the white line to lose
      synchronization and rotate away. This white line is related to the
      ability to levitate the body. San Martin had so much energy that,
      according to witness testimony, he could float horizontally in the
      air with his head resting against the bowed head of Christ on a
      carved wooden cross. Thus San Martin's energy sources were
      channeling energy from Christ, collective broom energy as
      described in a separate patent application, and the walking
      momentum vortex energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] During the early part of the 20th century, a man's parents
      were lying in bed dying of tuberculosis. With their permission, he
      placed a weighing scale under each of their beds. When they passed
      away, he found that each scale registered a loss in weight of 2.5
      ounces. This is equivalent to 0.071 kg, which is the mass of the
      human energy being.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] After conducting a number of experiments with water
      vortices draining from a cylindrical tank, it can be stated from
      Bernoulli's theorem that the potential energy plus the kinetic
      energy is a constant [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      The shape of the inner surface of the water circulation has a
      velocity proportional to the inverse of the radius, so the shape
      of the surface is [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which says that the height of the vortex is proportional to the
      inverse of the square of the radius.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The hand vortex area ratio between the second test subject
      and the third test subject is equal to the square of their radii:
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Because the speed of light at the boundary was determined to be
      one meter per second, the energy of the third test subject is
      [mathematical formula - see original document][mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring to FIG. 11, a circle (K), having this radius, is
      added to the energy of the water molecule (E), to produce
      augmented energy circle (J). This circle (J) intersects the mass
      of the water molecule outside the Planck box at point (j). This
      means that the increased hyperspace energy moves the water
      molecule, and hence the body, out of dimension. Furthermore,
      circle (J) is tangent to the walking momentum ratio circle (I)
      which keeps the geometry locked together.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] It is the object of this invention to create a training
      system that allows a person to develop the ability to walk around
      out of dimension, passing through solid objects. This invention is
      based on one of the most remarkable relationships between the
      water molecule and the boundary between space and hyperspace. The
      mass of the water molecule is equal to the energy of the water
      molecule at this boundary. Because the body is composed of 67%
      water, the body sits on the boundary such that any additional
      increase in energy would move the body out of dimension into
      hyperspace. Because human beings are actually hyperspace energy
      beings living in physical bodies, the additional energy required
      to move the body out of dimension comes from increasing the energy
      of the hyperspace being. One source of this energy comes from
      walking cross-handed at the proper velocity in order to generate a
      large hyperspace energy vortex that flows energy into the
      potential wells of the hyperspace being. This increased hyperspace
      energy will then allow the person to walk around out of dimension
      through solid wooden doors. Because the door and the person are in
      two slightly different dimensions at the same moment, it appears
      that the person is walking through the door. After passing through
      the closed door, the person then returns to our dimension and
      emerges in the interior of the closed-door room.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This technique can be used in reverse to heal an infected
      hand instantaneously. A salve made from the St.Mary's herb is
      applied to the skin of the infected hand. The hyperspace energy
      then flows through the right-hand vortex such that the infected
      hand and the salve are taken slightly out of dimension. What
      happens is similar to when a short piece of straw is embedded in a
      hard wooden telephone pole as a tornado passes over the pole. The
      straw and pole are taken out of dimension such that they briefly
      merge together. As the tornado moves on, both objects come back to
      dimension merged together. Thus the salve (straw) is merged with
      the bacteria (pole) in hyperspace such that the bacteria is killed
      instantly. Removing the hand vortex brings the infected hand back
      into dimension cured.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Based on this information and the results of many
      experiments, this invention creates a large vortex by walking at a
      certain velocity with the hands crossed over the chest. The proper
      walking momentum is created by a computer program that inputs the
      person's weight, shoe length, and the number of strides to be
      taken. The program then prints out a banner showing the footprints
      where the person has to step each second. When a person obtains
      sufficient energy from these methods, the person is then tuned to
      the subspace geometry of the universe as will be shown using the
      tetrahedron physics diagram.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0052] 1. Referring to FIG. 12, a tetrahedron (A, path abc) is
      added to the diagram. The tip of the tetrahedron (e) falls on the
      base constant which is equal to Planck's constant divided by the
      speed of light. A second tetrahedron (B, path def) is inverted
      around horizontal line (D) which has a geometrical relationship to
      the base constant. The line is located at [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      Notice that the intersection of the two inverted tetrahedrons (g)
      occurs at the Planck wavelength which is the boundary between
      space and hyperspace. Line (D) is referred to as the merging of
      two worlds or the connecting of two worlds, a phrase obtained by
      means of remote viewing. That is, it is the dividing line between
      space and hyperspace. This is the reason that the two boundaries
      intersect at this point.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Referring to FIG. 13, the proton wavelength (E) is added to
      the diagram. The proton wavelength has a value of the electron
      wavelength divided by 1836.1527 [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      A line (hd), from the base constant at the proton wavelength (h),
      to the corner of the inverted tetrahedron (d), intersects the
      merging of two worlds line at point (i). A circle, with a radius
      equal to the Planck mass (G), centered (i), is tangent to the
      inverted tetrahedrons. Thus the proton is defined by the base
      constant and the geometry of subspace. The reason that the proton
      is tangent to both tetrahedrons is because the electron and proton
      follow one single path between space and hyperspace. Thus there is
      only one single particle in nature. Because the particle enters
      our space at two different locations, we see the one particle as
      two distinct elementary particles. This relationship can be seen
      in Library of Congress tetrahedron diagram tet0565.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Referring to FIG. 14, the mass of the universe MU is equal
      to the linear mass Q of the universe times the radius R of the
      universe which is 10&lt;26 &gt; meters<br>
      ln(MU)=ln([Omega]R)=122.3347509<br>
      as shown on the diagram as line (A). The electron wavelength (B)
      reflects off the circumscribing sphere (H) and returns as the
      electron mass (C). The distance between reflection points is the
      hyperspace charge which is equal to the charge of space less the
      electron charge. So the electron goes from wavelength to electric
      charge to mass. The proton wavelength (D) reflects off the sphere
      and returns as the proton mass (E) which intersects the horizontal
      axis at point (c). A line (abc) from the mass of the universe at
      the vertical axis (a) to the proton at the horizontal axis (c)
      intersects the electron (b) which determines the electron's mass
      and wavelength since this point is on the 45[deg.] base line. What
      this means is that cosmology determines the values of the
      elementary particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Referring to FIG. 15, the mass of the water molecule (C)
      intersects the 45[deg.] base line at point (a). A circle (F), with
      a radius equal to the Planck mass is centered on point (c) at the
      Planck wavelength boundary (B) where the mass of the water
      molecule numerically equals the energy of the water molecule and
      where the speed of light is unity. The Planck mass is tangent to
      the base constant which is the vertical centerline (I) of the
      diagram. The large circle (H), centered (a) on the water molecule,
      is tangent to the mass of the universe (b) and tangent to the
      inverted tetrahedron (E). The difference between this circle (H)
      and the base constant (I) is the energy the hyperspace being has
      to acquire in order to be tuned to the mass and geometry of
      subspace. This difference, shown as circle (G), has a mass<br>
      m=e&lt;-4.792671 &gt; kg=8.29.10&lt;-3 &gt; kg<br>
      Thus the hand vortex radius ratio has to be the square root of the
      mass of the hyperspace energy being divided by this tangent mass,
      or: [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which is a vortex radius that is three times larger than that of a
      normal person, but one inch smaller than the third test subject
      who had a hand vortex radius of 4 inches. This is the reason that
      the third test subject was able to walk through walls and teleport
      to other locations because his energy was sufficiently large
      enough to cross over the inverted tetrahedron into a co-dimension
      of hyperspace. Notice also that dotted circle (J) with a radius
      equal to the mass of the water molecule, centered (c) on the
      boundary, is tangent to the tetrahedron (K). This makes the
      combined geometry tangent to the inverted tetrahedrons and the
      mass of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] 2. Referring to FIG. 16, a computer program generates a
      banner printout with footprints spaced for walking according to
      the weight, shoe size and length of banner desired. Some banners
      could fit in a small room, or be placed on the floor of a long
      corridor. As shown in the block diagram the program inputs these
      three variables with error checking. Then the program calculates
      the stride length L per second from the equation [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0057] 3. In the above equation, the value of the momentum M, as
      determined by the tetrahedron diagram, is preferably 50.9095736 kg
      m/s. The weight of the person is converted to mass W in kilograms.
      The stride period is preferably 1 second. Referring to FIG. 17,
      the data is entered in the dialog input window.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] 4. Once the stride length has been calculated, the program
      displays the stride length and the required number of banner
      sheets in the message window, as seen in FIG. 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] 5. The print banner menu is selected and the foot prints
      are printed on continuous banner paper. A six-stride scaled screen
      version of the banner is shown in FIG. 19. The banner paper is
      then placed on the floor, and a one-second beeping timer is
      activated from the toolbar or menu. The person then walks beside
      the printed foot prints, taking one stride per beep, which
      produces the correct walking momentum to generate the hyperspace
      vortex. The vortex, which forms in only six strides, brings
      additional hyperspace energy into the quantum potential wells of
      the hyperspace energy being.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] 6. A help system consists of a project tree which explains
      the various steps in using the program. Double mouse clicking on a
      project tree node displays the help instructions in a dialog
      window as shown in FIG. 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] 7. In summary, the purpose of the training system is to
      substantially increase the energy of a human being who will then
      have the capability of walking through walls, body levitation,
      instantaneous healing of infections, full-body teleportation to
      another location, remote viewing at vast distances in terms of
      light-years, and looking into hyperspace co-dimensions. The third
      test subject and I have been able to experience all the above
      phenomena. He did it through augmenting his energy, and I have
      done it through the application of electromagnetic fields, by
      spinning on my vortex accelerator machine and using this
      invention.<br>
