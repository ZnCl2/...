          </small><b><big>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0001] This invention is a rotating spacecraft
            that utilizes four spherical conducting domes perturbing a
            uniform electric field in order to create a lift force by
            means of a magnetic moment times the gradient of a magnetic
            field.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><b><big>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0002] An electric dipole p is two electrical
            charges of opposite sign {q, -q} separated by a distance a.</big><small><br>
          </small><big>p=qa=coulomb.meter</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0003] If this dipole is moving with a velocity
            v, it produces a magnetic moment [mu]. [mathematical formula
            - see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0004] The magnetic moment is equal to a current
            I circulating around an area. The magnetic field B has units
            of kilogram per second per charge coulomb. [mathematical
            formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0005] The gradient of the magnetic field in the
            vertical direction z has units of [mathematical formula -
            see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0006] This gradient interacting with a magnetic
            moment creates a force F measured in newtons. [mathematical
            formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0007] In terms of vectors, the force is equal to</big><small><br>
          </small><big>F=[Nabla]([mu].B)</big><small><br>
          </small><big>which is the gradient [Nabla] of the dot product
            (.) of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field. This
            means that the magnetic moment has to be aligned with the
            field. The lift force on the spacecraft would then be the
            magnetic moment in the vertical z-direction [mu]z times the
            magnetic field in the z-direction Bz. For constant magnetic
            moment, the gradient affects the magnetic field only,
            resulting in the same force equation</big><small><br>
          </small><big>Fz=[Nabla]([mu]z.Bz)=[mu]z[Nabla]Bz</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0008] Referring to FIG. 1, the electric dipole
            has a positive charge q located on the z-axis at a distance
            a from the origin of the graph. A second negative charge -q
            is located at a distance -a from the origin. The positive
            charge produces an electrostatic potential [phi]1 at a
            radius r1 equal to the charge q divided by 4[pi] times the
            permittivity of space [epsilon]0 [mathematical formula - see
            original document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>where the permittivity is linear capacitance,
            measured in farads per meter. The electrostatic potential
            has units of volts [mathematical formula - see original
            document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>because the charge in coulombs held by a
            capacitor is equal to the capacitance, measured in farads,
            times the capacitor voltage. Because the second charge has
            the opposite sign, the potential [phi]2 at a radius r2 to
            the same point in space is [mathematical formula - see
            original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0009] The total potential [phi] at some point in
            space is equal to the sum of the two potentials, or
            [mathematical formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0010] As seen in the diagram, the point of space
            is a distance r from the origin. Using the law of cosines,
            radius r1 can be written as [mathematical formula - see
            original document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>where t is the ratio of the charge location over
            the radius, and x is cos([theta]). The potential for
            positive charge q1 can be written [mathematical formula -
            see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0011] Dropping the factor q/4[pi][epsilon]0r,
            the square root can be expressed in terms of the Legendre
            polynomial Pn cos([theta]) of the nth power [mathematical
            formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>where the absolute value of t is less than one.
            The polynomial coefficients of t&lt;n &gt; can be obtained
            by using the binomial theorem to expand the generating
            function g(t,x) as [mathematical formula - see original

          </small><big>which evaluates to [mathematical formula - see

          </small><big>[0013] The electrostatic potential for both
            charges of the electric dipole is [mathematical formula -
            see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0014] The potential can be evaluated in terms of
            the Legendre polynomials as [mathematical formula - see

            <br>
          </small><big>[0015] The first and most dominant term when the

            <br>
          </small><big>[0016] Now imagine a constant electric field E0
            which is perturbed by a conducting sphere of radius a. The
            unperturbed electrostatic potential outside the sphere would
            the negative of the electric field times the radius times

            <br>
          </small><big>[0019] Referring to FIG. 2, the previously
            uniform electric field is shown perturbed by the neutral
            conducting sphere. The center of the sphere is taken as the
            origin and the z-axis is oriented parallel to the original
            uniform field.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0020] The electric field induces a surface
            charge density [sigma] on the sphere equal to the negative
            of the permittivity of space times the gradient of the
            electrostatic potential [mathematical formula - see original
            document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0021] The electric field also induces an
            electric dipole moment on the sphere equal to the
            [mathematical formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>with units of coulomb-meter. If this sphere is
            rotating around a central axis at a velocity v, it will
            create a magnetic moment [mu] equal to the dipole moment
            times the velocity.</big><small><br>
          </small><big>[mu]=pv</big><small><br>
          </small><big>with units of ampere-meter&lt;2&gt; .</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><b><big>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0022] As shown in the preceding background
            section, a neutral conducting sphere placed in a uniform
            electric field will generate a magnetic moment when rotated
            around a central axis. The electric field can be created by
            two points charges of opposite sign separated by a distance
            between them.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0023] Referring to FIG. 3, the spacecraft has a
            spherical cabin (A) to which are attached cone-shaped
            electrostatic towers (B,C) above and below the cabin along
            the direction of travel in the z-direction. Because the
            electric field goes from the positive charge to the negative
            charge, the tip of the lower tower has a positively charged
            electrode, and the upper tower has a negatively charged
            electrode. Four equally-spaced neutral conducting spheres
            (D) are connected to the cabin by non-conducting tubes (E).
            The tubes make an angle with the cabin such that the
            distance (CD) is greater than distance (DB). The angle
            [theta] of the tube with respect to the cabin can be seen in
            side view FIG. 4.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0024] Referring to FIG. 5, the charges create a
            uniform spherical field between the towers. The conducting
            spheres perturb this field such that the electric field (E)
            points toward the upper tower in a manner similar to that
            shown previously in FIG. 2.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0025] Referring to FIG. 6, the conducting sphere
            produces an electric dipole moment (A) pointing at an angle
            toward the upper tower.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0026] Referring to FIG. 7, by the law of
            addition of vectors, the electric dipole {overscore (p)} can
            be represented by two orthogonal vectors pointing in the
            vertical z-direction pz and in the inward radial direction
            pr.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0027] Referring to FIG. 8, the hollow tube (A)
            connecting the cabin with the conducting sphere contains a
            spiral-wound electrical solenoid (B) which produces a
            magnetic field (C). This magnetic field {overscore (B)} can
            be decomposed into two orthogonal vectors pointing in the
            vertical z-direction Bz and in the outward radial direction
            Br as shown in FIG. 9.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0028] Referring to top-view FIG. 10, the
            spacecraft has a clockwise angular velocity [omega] (A)
            which gives the conducting sphere a velocity v as shown by
            the vector (B). By the right-hand rule of physics, the
            angular velocity vector points in the negative z-direction.
            The angular velocity in the z-direction crossed with the
            radius r in the radial direction produces a velocity v in
            the clockwise [theta]-direction using cylindrical
            coordinates {r,[theta],z}.</big><small><br>
          </small><big>v[theta]=wz*rr=-[omega]r</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0029] Referring to FIG. 11, the negative radial
            dipole moment pr crossed with the negative velocity v[theta]
            of the sphere produces a positive magnetic moment [mu]z in
            the z-direction.</big><small><br>
          </small><big>[mu]z=pr*v[theta]=(-pr)(-v[theta])=pv</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0030] Referring to FIG. 12, the magnetic field
            Bz in the vertical z-direction is dotted with the magnetic
            moment [mu]z in the z-direction to produce a force Fz in the
            vertical z-direction on each conducting sphere (FIG. 13).</big><small><br>
          </small><big>Fz=[Nabla]([mu]z.Bz)=[mu]z[Nabla]Bz</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0031] The magnetic field that is produced by the
            solenoid actually curves away and around. Thus there is a
            gradient of the field in the z-direction.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0032] The force can also be expressed in tensor
            notation. The magnetic B field in the vertical direction is
            part of an electromagnetic 4*4 matrix Faraday tensor F
            [mathematical formula - see original document][mathematical
            formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>which shows that the magnetic field is located in
            slot F&lt;r&gt; [theta] of the Faraday tensor. In tensor
            notation the subscripts and superscripts have to match up on
            both sides of the equation. Matching subscripts and
            superscripts on the same side of the equation cancel. In
            this case, the electric dipole moment is in the radial
            direction pr. The velocity can be represented as a time
            derivative of the [theta]-coordinate x&lt;[theta]&gt; or
            [mathematical formula - see original document]</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0033] Thus the force component in the
            z-direction becomes [mathematical formula - see original
            document]</big><small><br>
          </small><big>where the angular and radial tensor components
            cancel and comma-z (, z) represents differentiation of the
            magnetic field in the z-direction.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0034] The spacecraft design also has an inherent
            motion control system for moving in various directions. If
            the magnetic field of one solenoid arm is increased or
            decreased, the force on that sphere will be increased or
            decreased. Thus the spacecraft can turn in a particular
            direction.</big><small><br>

            </small></b><b><big>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0049] 1. Referring to the cut-away view FIG. 14,
            the construction of the spacecraft is a thin-wall insulating
            thermoplastic having a dielectric constant in the range of
            20 kilovolts per millimeter (A). An insulated electrode (B)
            runs from the cabin power supply and high-voltage
            transformer (C) to the tip of each tower (D). The four
            spheres (E) are silver plated to make them conducting. The
            tube solenoids (F) are driven by a direct current power
            supply (G).</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0050] 2. The present model uses 3D computer
            design software and stereolithography fabrication techniques
            to create the thin-wall, low-weight, hollow structure of the
            hull. The computer model is sliced into many thin horizontal
            slices. A laser, mounted on an x-y table, draws out the
            slice on a table immersed in a bath of liquid polymer. Due
            to its sensitivity to the light, the liquid polymerizes. The
            table is then lowered a few thousandths of an inch more and
            the process is repeated. Thus making hollow spherical and
            conical shapes is extremely easy to do. Parts can be
            designed and stored in *.STL stereolithography files for
            transmission by Internet e-mail to the service bureau
            machine shop which sends the finished parts back the next
            day by express mail.</big><small><br>
