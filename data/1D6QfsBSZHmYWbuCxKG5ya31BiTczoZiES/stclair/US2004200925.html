          </small><b><big>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0001] This invention is a hyperspace energy
            generator that uses cavitating oil bubbles within a magnetic
            field in order to create wormholes between space and
            hyperspace for the purpose of permeating the hull of a
            spacecraft with low-density, low-speed-of-light hyperspace
            energy.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><b><big>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0002] As shown by physicist Dr. John Archibald
            Wheeler of Princeton University, there is a second term in
            Newton's gravitational equation which includes an additional
            force depending on whether or not the body is
            spinning.F=mg+m(v*[Omega]) where F is the force, m the mass,
            g the acceleration of gravity, v the forward velocity of the
            body, and [Omega] the angular velocity of the body.
            Referring to FIG. 1, a rotating cylinder (A) is moving with
            a velocity (B) while spinning counterclockwise as shown by
            the angular velocity vector (C). The velocity crossed with
            the angular velocity vector produces a force in the upward
            direction (D).</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0004] Referring to FIG. 2, a pendulum (A) held
            in the left hand over the right hand will spin in the
            counterclockwise direction due to the hyperspace energy
            vortex (B) emanating from the palm of the right hand. This
            vortex arises because human beings are hyperspace energy
            beings that live in physical containers located in this
            universe. The vortex might be considered a wormhole between
            space and hyperspace. Notice that the angular momentum
            vector of the vortex points up out of the palm of the hand.
            If the hand were spinning from left to right, then there
            would be a force exerted, as shown by the above equation,
            that would bring hyperspace energy into the right arm.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0005] Referring to FIG. 3, in order to test this
            hypothesis, a Chakra Vortex Accelerator was built for the
            purpose of spinning this hand vortex. The motor-driven
            machine has a base (A) on which is mounted a warehouse
            palletizing ring and platform (B). A control column (C) has
            a speed control and on/off switch. A person (D) stands on
            the platform with his right arm outstretched and palm facing
            upward (E). The platform spins from left to right.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0006] Referring to FIG. 4, the velocity vector
            (A) points to the right. The angular momentum vector of the
            rotating chakra energy vortex points up. The cross product
            A*B=C produces a force that brings in high permeability
            hyperspace energy into the arm.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0007] Referring to FIG. 5, after spinning 99
            times per day for a few months, it was noticed that the
            right arm (A) would remain out at an angle [phi] from the
            body without making any exertion to do so. The left arm,
            which was not receiving the energy, remained at the side of
            the body. That is, the low-density hyperspace energy in the
            right arm was making the arm lighter and producing a
            subsequent antigravitational effect. The conclusion was that
            it might be possible to invent some device which would
            produce large amounts of hyperspace energy. This would make
            possible relativistic electromagnetic fields which can be
            used to produce the lift force for electromagnetic field
            propulsion vehicles.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0008] Then in the February 1995 issue of
            Scientific American, an article appeared entitled Producing
            Light from a Bubble of Air which gave the details for
            producing sonoluminescence from a cavitating bubble using a
            kit for sale containing the piezoelectric transducers.
            Referring to FIG. 6, the experimental setup includes a ring
            stand (A) with a three-finger clamp (B) holding a 100
            milliliter flask containing degassed water produced by a
            Walsh vacuum/pressure pump. Piezoelectric drive transducers
            (D) are mounted on the sides of the flask in order to create
            sound pressure waves which create the cavitation bubble (M)
            in the center of the flask. The transducers are connected by
            insulated wire (I) to a pair of inductors (E) having a
            mutual inductance between them. These inductors are driven
            by a frequency generator (H) connected to an audio amplifier
            (G). The oscillation signals are picked up by the
            oscilloscope (J) which is connected to the resistors (F)
            using the probes (K). The piezoelectric drive transducers
            act electrically as capacitors. The inductors are wired in
            series with the capacitance such that the combination
            resonates at the frequency at which acoustic resonance
            occurs. Bubbles introduced into the flask tend to coalesce
            in the center of the flask Above a certain sound intensity,
            the bubble will collapse and emit a dim light visible to the
            unaided eye in a darkened room, a process called
            sonoluminescence.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0009] Further research showed that there were
            some earlier doctoral theses available. One of them by Dr.
            Steven DeWitt Horsburgh entitled Radial Instabilities of a
            pulsating air bubble in water mentioned a most interesting
            observed phenomenon of the surface oscillations called a
            "beaconing effect." When a bubble exhibited a stable or
            long-lived shape oscillation lasting more than two minutes,
            the bubble had a tendency to slowly precess. The precession
            rate was on the order of a few hertz which can be taken to
            mean around 3 Hz. Visually, the beacon looked like a light
            house beacon. It was a very obvious effect and when the
            beacon crossed the photodiode, the output voltage increased
            by at least an order of magnitude.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0010] Upon reading this, it became apparent that
            sonoluminescence is involved with gravitational hyperspace
            physics. Einstein's theory says that inertia is a
            manifestation of the geometry of spacetime. It also says
            that geometry is affected by the presence of matter to an
            extent proportional to the factor G/c&lt;2 &gt; where G is
            the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light. The
            inverse of this factor is the linear mass [Omega] of the
            universe. A spherical shell of mass m with a radius R will
            create a drag angular velocity on a pendulum equal to
            [mathematical formula - see original document] The mass of
            the shell divided by the linear mass (mass per length)
            converts the mass into a length which is then divided by the
            radius of the shell which is also a length. The numerical
            factor 4/3 is found only by a detailed calculation. The
            calculation, starting from a flat background spacetime
            manifold, showed the effect of the moving current of mass on
            the metric. Expressed in polar coordinates, the metric
            acquires a non-zero coefficient g[phi]t. Inserted into the
            equation for geodesic motion, this off-diagonal metric
            coefficient gives rise to a precession according to the
            above equation. The numerical factor corresponds to a
            pendulum located anywhere inside the rotating shell of mass.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0012] In other doctoral theses, books and
            physics articles on cavitation, light is emitted after the
            bubble starts to collapse. A very sharp peak of light is
            produced which lasts in terms of picoseconds. Thus this type
            of sonoluminescence is very different than the beaconing
            effect where the bubble remains stable for long periods of
            time. The beaconing effect is actually a rotating wormhole
            between space and hyperspace.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0013] Briefly what happens is that there is
            ionized gas in the bubble which releases electrons. As the
            electrons spiral down through the wormhole from space into
            hyperspace, they give off light. This situation puts the
            electrons in contact with the charge of hyperspace. Space
            has a charge which is equal to the sum of the electron
            charge qe and the hyperspace charge qh. The charge of space
            q is equal to the Planck mass times a conversion factor
            between mass and charge. The Planck mass is equal to the
            linear mass [Omega] of the universe times the bottom
            dimensional limit of the universe known as the Planck scale
            [Lambda]. The conversion factor is the square root of the
            gravitational constant G times the permittivity of space
            [epsilon]. The permittivity is linear capacitance or
            capacitance per unit length. Thus the charge of space
            isq=[Lambda][Omega]{square root}{square root over
            (G[epsilon])}=qe+qh Because the electron comes in contact
            with the hyperspace charge, the drag angular velocity in the
            above equation has to be modified. Notice that if the
            angular velocity of the shell is modified by the electron
            fine structure constant [alpha], and the mass involved is
            the mass of the electron, moving through a radius into
            hyperspace of the Planck scale [Lambda], then the drag
            angular velocity would be [mathematical formula - see
            original document] The angular frequency of the shell is
            2[pi] times the electron frequency
            fe.[omega]shell=[omega]electron=2[pi]fe</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0016] The inverse of the electron fine structure
            constant [alpha] is equal to Planck's reduced constant
            -times the speed of light c times the factor 4[pi] times the
            permittivity of space [epsilon] divided by the square of the
            charge of the electron qe. [mathematical formula - see
            original document] Planck's constant is equal to the Planck
            scale [Lambda] squared times the linear mass [Omega] times
            the speed of light.-=[Lambda]&lt;2&gt; [Omega]c Notice that
            the fine structure constant has a square in it and Planck's
            constant also has a square. If the electron charge were
            traveling through the Planck scale into hyperspace, then
            there would be a linear charge equal to the electron charge
            divided by the Planck scale [mathematical formula - see
            original document] The constant equal to the linear mass
            [Omega] times the permittivity times the square of the speed
            of light is actually the square of the linear charge [chi]
            of space. So the fine structure constant can be written
            [mathematical formula - see original document] So the
            electron fine structure constant is related to the ratio of
            the charge of hyperspace to the charge of the electron,
            which is the reason that the equation had to be modified.
            The electron moving across the Planck scale wormhole is
            modified by the hyperspace charge it is seeing in a
            hyperspace co-dimension. This confirms that the beaconing
            effect is a rotating wormhole into hyperspace.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0021] The electron fine structure constant is
            actually the fastest velocity in the Bohr atom. The fine
            structure constant is the ratio of the electron orbital
            velocity to the speed of light. [mathematical formula - see
            original document] where the permitted quantized n orbital
            speeds are vn/n or v/1, v/2, v/3 and so on. Using a value of
            v/3, the fine structure constant would be [mathematical
            formula - see original document] which when substituted into
            the drag angular frequency equation [mathematical formula -
            see original document] The frequency of precession is
            [mathematical formula - see original document] which is
            close to the 3 Hz observed in the experiment. The ionized
            electrons are moving at a slower velocity in the bubble. The
            1/3 ratio could also come from the subspace tetrahedron
            geometry where the tetrahedral angle is determined by this
            ratio[theta]=asin(1/3)=19.47122063[deg.] This is an
            alternative possibility because this angle determines the
            charge of hyperspace according to the tetrahedron diagram of
            [Delta]physics. In geometrical physics, all the constants of
            physics are determined geometrically by the tetrahedron. The
            tetrahedron diagram plots the natural logarithm of mass
            versus the natural logarithm of wavelength. The tetrahedron
            is circumscribed by a sphere which reflects the electron
            wavelength into the electron mass. Thus the diagram combines
            the dual reality of classical physics, involving point mass
            particles, and quantum physics, involving wave-like
            particles. The scientific discovery that the electron and
            the proton are one and the same particle was made using this
            diagram. It also shows that hyperspace exists.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0027] Referring to the tetrahedron diagram in
            FIG. 7, a line drawn at the tetrahedral angle produces the
            tetrahedral lines (A,B) along path (abc). This tetrahedron
            is circumscribed by sphere (C) with diameter (G). The
            electron wavelength (vertical dotted line D) reflects off
            the sphere (d,f) and returns as the electron mass (F). The
            distance (df) between reflection points is equal to the
            natural logarithm of the hyperspace charge. It can be shown
            that the electron charge is related to the geometry around
            the top of the sphere. Part of the geometry is outside the
            sphere which makes the charge immune to relativistic
            velocities.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0028] Referring to FIG. 8, a current-carrying
            solenoid (A) produces a magnetic flux (B) through the center
            of the coil. The end of the solenoid behaves like a magnetic
            monopole. One end has a positive magnetic charge density
            +[rho]m and the other has a negative magnetic charge density
            -[rho]m. One of Maxwell's electromagnetic equations states
            that the divergence of the magnetic field is equal to the
            magnetic charge density.[Nabla].B=[rho]m=+[rho]m-[rho]m=0
            Because the magnetic field is solenoidal, the sum of the
            charges in our spacetime is equal to zero, which is the
            usual Maxwell equation. In the case of the wormhole, one
            pole of the magnetic flux is in our spacetime and the other
            pole is in a co-dimension of hyperspace. In our universe,
            there is a net magnetic charge density, and Maxwell's
            equation becomes[Nabla].B=[rho]m When working with bar
            magnets, bringing two north poles together shows that there
            is a spring constant involved. The electrons on the surface
            of the pole spin in the same direction which creates an
            electrical current around the surface. The magnetic pole
            strength g is therefore a spring constant K divided by the
            current per area J. [mathematical formula - see original
            document] The magnetic charge density is then the pole
            strength per volume V or [mathematical formula - see
            original document] The divergence of the magnetic field has
            units of [mathematical formula - see original document]
            which are the units of the magnetic charge density. Notice
            that the units can also be formatted as a pressure per
            electrical current in the wire. [mathematical formula - see
            original document] The current flowing through the coils of
            the solenoid, or around the pole face of the bar magnetic
            creates a pressure on spacetime. And it is this pressure
            that can punch through spacetime into hyperspace. Referring
            again to FIG. 8, an electrical charge winding n times around
            the end of the spacetime solenoid, as seen by path (C), is
            equal to the charge divided by Planck's constant times the
            pole flux [mathematical formula - see original document]
            which shows that the flux [Phi] is quantized by the winding
            number n [mathematical formula - see original document]
            where the flux is equal to the winding number n times
            Planck's constant h divided by the charge. Since the flux is
            the pole strength in webers, the pole strength g has a value
            of [mathematical formula - see original document] The
            magnetic charge density is the pole strength divided by the
            Planck volume or [mathematical formula - see original
            document] The magnetic B field of space divided by the
            Planck length of the wormhole, acting as a linear magnetic
            field, times the winding number is equal to the magnetic

          </small><big>[0039] Referring to FIG. 9, the wormhole (A),
            connecting space and hyperspace (D), is precessing (C) in
            the counterclockwise direction with the angular velocity
            vector in the vertical z-direction. The magnetic flux (B)
            through the wormhole is in the radial direction. The mouth
            of the wormhole is an area with a normal vector in the
            radial direction also. This arrangement creates an electric
            field which circulates around the interior periphery of the
            wormhole. Maxwell's equation says that the curl of the
            electric field E is equal to the negative time rate of
            change of the magnetic B field. [mathematical formula - see
            original document] This equation is difficult to manage in
            differential form. As both Maxwell and Feynman have said, it
            is better to use the integral form involving Stokes' theorem
            where the area da is converted into a line integral ds which
            goes well with Maxwell's idea of flux linkage. [mathematical
            formula - see original document] The flux [Phi], which is
            precessing around at the drag angular velocity calculated
            previously, is equal to the negative of the electric field
            around the interior perimeter (E) of the wormhole. This is
            the reason that the beaconing effect lasts for such a long
            length of time. The force on the electron is equal to the
            charge of the electron times the electric field. Because the
            charge is negative, the electron rotates counterclockwise in
            the opposite direction to that of the electric field. The
            electrons continuously circulate around the inside periphery
            of the wormhole. Quantum theory predicts that any radiated
            electromagnetic energy from an accelerated electron will
            give off one or more discrete quanta, or photons. The
            electron is accelerating because it is moving in a circular
            path. Because the water vapor is ionized in the cavitating
            bubble due to shock waves, surface oscillations and high
            temperatures, there are huge numbers of electrons available
            for producing an intense light which, as registered by the
            photodiode, increased by an order of magnitude when the
            beacon rotated by the photodiode.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0042] From gravitational physics it is known
            that negative energy has to be produced in order to create a
            wormhole. Most experimenters are using collapsing spherical
            bubbles that do not produce negative energy and therefore do
            not produce the beaconing effect. This next background
            section shows that if the bubble collapses asymmetrically,
            then negative energy is produced.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0043] Referring to an experiment carried out by
            Fizeau, FIG. 10, water flows (B,C) in opposite directions in
            two tubes of water (A). A light beam from a lamp (D) is
            projected through both tubes using half-silvered mirrors
            (E). Fizeau measured an interference (F) between light
            propagating with the flow and light swimming against the
            current, indicating that the flow of the medium does affect
            light propagation. A moving medium turns out to drag light
            to an extent quantified by a dragging coefficient
            [mathematical formula - see original document] where n is
            the index of refraction of the medium. Einstein's addition
            theorem of velocities states [mathematical formula - see
            original document] In the limit of slow flows compared with
            the speed of light in a vacuum, the effective velocity of
            light v in the medium flowing at a velocity u is
            [mathematical formula - see original document] The
            relationship between cavitating bubbles and light dragging
            is that when the bubble collapses, the surface has a
            tremendous acceleration and velocity which creates internal
            shockwaves that bounce back and forth within the medium. At
            the same time, the water vapor and air are ionized which
            creates short bursts of light. Thus there is light that is
            being dragged along by the collapsing surface of the bubble.
            This moving medium appears to light as a change in the
            metric of spacetime resembling, it turns out, a
            gravitational field. The velocity of the medium affects the
            elemental length ds&lt;2 &gt; of spacetime as given by the
            metric for light draggingds&lt;2&gt; =c&lt;2&gt; dt&lt;2&gt;
            -dx&lt;2&gt; +k(c&lt;2&gt; dt&lt;2&gt; -u.dx)&lt;2&gt; where
            k is equal to [mathematical formula - see original document]
            and dx is the elemental length in the {dx,dy,dz} directions.
            The velocity u in the dot product is equal to the velocities
            {ux,uy,uz} in the x, y and z-directions. Expanding the
            equation produces the following metricds&lt;2&gt;
            =(1+k)dt&lt;2&gt; +(kux&lt;2&gt; -1)dx&lt;2&gt;
            +(kuy&lt;2&gt; -1)dy&lt;2&gt; -dz&lt;2&gt;
            -2kuxdxdt-2kuydydt+2kuxuydxdy where velocity uz is zero and
            the speed of light is equal to one.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0050] The dt&lt;2 &gt; energy density term is
            modified by one plus the k factor. Thus the index of
            refraction of the medium, the speed of light and the overall
            light dragging velocity u affects the energy density. It can
            be shown that the speed of light in hyperspace is much
            lower. The difference of the squares of the velocities in
            the denominator creates the possibility for amplification of
            this term.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0051] The factors of the elemental lengths are
            then inserted into the g metric tensor which is then used to
            calculate the spacetime distortion generated by the
            collapsing bubble. The g metric tensor is a 4*4 matrix
            having rows and columns that correspond to the elemental
            lengths {t, x, y, z}. [mathematical formula - see original
            document] In Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, the G
            curvature tensor, which is a 4*4 matrix having units of
            inverse meter squared, is equal to a stress-energy-momentum
            T tensor that is calculated from the electromagnetic fields.
            The stress tensor T combines energy density, electromagnetic
            flux, and pressure terms in one matrix.G=8[pi]T</big><small><br>

            constants such as linear mass which is mass per unit length.
            The permittivity of space [epsilon] is linear capacitance or
            capacitance per meter. The permeability of space [mu] is
            linear inductance or inductance per meter. The speed of
            light converts time into meters. What this means is that
            energy, pressure and momentum can all be converted into
            meters using these linear constants. The inverse squared of
            the length in meters is the curvature which is measured in
            units of m&lt;-2&gt; .</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0054] Referring to FIG. 11, a square bubble (A)
            in the xy plane collapses with a velocity in the x-direction
            (C), and a velocity in the y-direction (B). This produces a
            curvature in the vertical z-direction (D). The curvature in
            the z-direction is the curvature tensor component Gzz. which
            can be computed directly from the g light dragging metric
            tensor. The result of the calculation is an equation in
            terms of the velocity, acceleration and the time rate of
            change of the acceleration, known as jerk.</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0055] Because the profile of the bubble radius
            expanding and collapsing with time has been published by
            those researching cavitation, it is possible to
            differentiate the profile to get the velocity, acceleration

            acceleration which is then integrated twice (1/S) to get the
            velocity and position. These variables are then fed back to
            the input through the various constants involving the
            viscosity, surface tension, pressure and air density. The

            mentioned previously. This profile was then fitted with a
            polynomial equation which is plotted in FIG. 14. By
            differentiating the equation, the velocity, acceleration and

            respect to time. In the Scientific American plot, the light
            flash occurs at the end of the collapse marked "LIGHT FLASH"
            around 22 microseconds (FIG. 13). This corresponds to the
            two intense positive curvature Gzz spikes at the end of the
            collapse. This represents a symmetrical spherical bubble
            collapse where the velocities are the same in the x and y

            the velocity in the x-direction ux is equal to the velocity
            in the y-direction uy, and the acceleration in the
            x-direction ax is equal to the acceleration in the
            y-direction, then the equation reduces to zero.
            [mathematical formula - see original document] which means
            that the symmetrical collapse with equal velocities does not
            produce any negative energy with which to create the
            wormhole. Only sharp pulses of light are emitted at the end
            of the bubble collapse where the intense positive curvature
            spikes are encountered. In order to get the rotating
            wormhole beaconing effect, the velocities have to be
            different.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0063] Referring to FIG. 16, the bubble is given
            an asymmetrical profile as shown by the two curves. The
            upper curve is in the x-direction, and the lower curve is in
            the y-direction. The collapse in the y-direction is not as
            severe.</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0064] Referring to FIG. 17, the asymmetrical
            collapse has the curvature spikes at the beginning similar
            to the symmetrical case of FIG. 15. Notice that there are no
            spikes at the end of the collapse. However, the energy
            density is much different.</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0065] Referring to FIG. 18, the energy density
            Gtt is plotted as a function of time. Rather than being zero
            as in the symmetrical case, there is a large region of
            negative energy density as the bubble collapses. This
            negative energy is what creates the wormhole. Because there
            are no large curvature spikes at the end of the collapse,
            the wormhole bubble is stable and precesses for a few
            minutes.</big><small><br>

            When a television set is brought in to the shop, the large
            capacitor has to be discharged first. The repairman with the
            large chakra vortices was standing behind a second repairman
            who was approaching the television set. As the second
            repairman got closer to the set, an enormous streaming blue
            spark sailed over his head and zapped the first technician.
            Hyperspace has a much higher permittivity than our
            spacetime. The resistance of space R is equal to the square
            root of the permeability [mu] over the permittivity
            [epsilon]. [mathematical formula - see original document]
            Since the technician with the large chakra vortices was
            producing large quantities of hyperspace energy, his
            resistance was very much lower due to his larger

            electrons, which are created by ionization of the hydrogen
            atoms of the water vapor, see a very low path of resistance
            and flow toward the wormhole. There they are trapped in
            accelerated motion due to the presence of the circular
            electric field and give off substantial numbers of photons

            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0075] As described in the previous section, the
            cavitating bubble has to collapse asymmetrically in order to
            generate the negative energy which creates the wormhole. In
            order to collapse asymmetrically, the forces on the bubble
            surface have to be unequal. The force on the bubble is given
            in terms of the a dragging coefficient, the bubble radius R,
            the surface charge density Dr, the magnetic B field in
            spherical coordinates {Br, B[theta], B[phi]}. The fields are
            integrated over the entire solid angle [Omega] of the bubble
            to determine the force F. [mathematical formula - see
            original document] The integration of the tangential
            components of the magnetic field such as {B[theta], B[phi]}
            over the solid angle of the bubble will sum to zero. The
            surface charge density Dr and the radial magnetic field Br
            are the only fields which can be used to create an
            unbalanced force. If there is no surface charge density,
            then the force equation reduces to [mathematical formula -
            see original document] where the conversion constant is the
            linear charge squared divided by the linear mass of the
            universe [chi]&lt;2 &gt; /[Omega]m.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0078] In this invention, referring to FIG. 21,
            the magnetic field is created by two cylindrical solenoids
            (A,B) which are wrapped around the top and bottom of the
            glass container (C). The container has flat sides in the
            shape of an octagon. Each solenoid consists of a continuous
            roll of very thin sheet copper which are separated by beaded
            mylar line. The mylar beads separate the sheets electrically
            and provide air cooling to the coil which can get rather
            hot. This makes it easy to assemble the coil because the
            copper roll and mylar line are wound together as the
            solenoid is formed. The lines of magnetic flux flow
            vertically through the container yet do not interfere with
            the transducers (D) which are mounted on the flat sides of
            the container.</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0079] Referring to FIG. 22, the cavitating
            bubble which forms in the liquid in the container
            experiences a vertical magnetic field (B) due to the two
            solenoids. These flux lines create a radial force on the top
            and bottom of the bubble (D,C). The flux lines on the
            outside (E) do not create any radial force because they are
            tangential to the surface. The spherical bubble flattens
            into an asymmetrical ellipsoidal shape (A) which enables the
            creation of the wormhole and lighthouse beaconing effect.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0080] Referring to FIG. 23, the spacetime
            curvature of the wormhole (D) creates a tunnel (C), known as
            the throat of the wormhole, between flat space in our
            universe (A) and flat hyperspace (B) which exists in a
            co-dimension of our universe. In general, the co-dimensions
            have different physics constants. Going back to the chakra
            vortices of the human energy field, the vortices remove
            energy from space and deliver it to several hyperspace
            co-dimensions. This energy builds up human aura modules at
            different frequencies in astral space. Astral space has a
            very low speed of light and small linear mass. This is the
            reason that human beings can leave their bodies and pass
            through solid concrete walls, or project their spiritual eye
            to remote locations for viewing. On the other hand, the
            linear mass and speed of light of space is very much greater
            than hyperspace. Therefore, the pressure of the space is
            much greater than the pressure in hyperspace. In terms of
            the wormhole with a throat area A, the pressure would be the
            linear mass times the speed of light squared over the area
            [mathematical formula - see original document] The pressure
            of hyperspace on the other side of the wormhole is
            [mathematical formula - see original document] Because the
            linear mass and the speed of light of hyperspace are lower
            than that of space, there is a positive net pressure going
            into hyperspace.Pnet=Pspace-Phyperspace This is the reason
            that the human vortices can obtain energy from this
            universe. Because the cavitating bubble produces negative
            energy, the linear mass is negative on the side of space.
            The pressure equation is then given by [mathematical formula
            - see original document] which shows that there is a reverse
            pressure going from hyperspace into our space. The
            asymmetrical cavitating bubble generates hyperspace energy.
            The hyperspace energy flowing into our universe also gives
            the light generated by the wormhole a soft white misty look.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0085] There are many reasons for generating this
            hyperspace energy. Electromagnetic fields are subject to the
            Lorentz transformation which involves comparing the frame
            velocity with that of the velocity of light. [mathematical
            formula - see original document] If the ratio of the
            velocity v to the velocity of light c is close to unity,
            then huge relativistic fields can be produced. These fields
            can curve spacetime to such an extent that a large lift
            force can be produced on the hull of an electromagnetic
            field propulsion vehicle.</big><small><br>

            </small></b><b><big>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0112] 1. Referring to FIG. 24, the transducer
            driving circuit uses a frequency generator (A) driving a
            linear amplifier (B) into a pair of variable inductors (C)
            which resonate with the capacitance of the transducers (D)
            attached to the sides of the octagonally-shaped glass
            container (H). Resistors (L,M,G) provides voltage measuring
            points for the oscilloscope.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0113] A DC current source (I) drives the two
            solenoids (E,F) which produce a vertical magnetic field (J)
            through the container. The magnetic field produces an
            asynmetrical force on the bubble surface (K) such that the
            collapsing bubble produces negative energy. The spacetime
            curvature produced by the light dragging of the collapsing
            bubble surface, together with the negative energy, create a
            wormhole between space and hyperspace. The negative
            spacetime energy produces a negative pressure which brings
            low-density hyperspace energy into our dimension.</big><br>
