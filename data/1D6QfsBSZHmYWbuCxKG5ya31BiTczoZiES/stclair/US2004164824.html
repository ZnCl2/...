      This invention is a braided gold wire coaxial cable of micron size
      which generates hyperspace energy by coupling to the tetrahedral
      geometry of subspace, dimension and the Planck mass.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention is a braided gold wire coaxial cable of
      micron size which generates hyperspace energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Electrical experiments with micron-sized braided gold wire
      coaxial cable show that it is capable of generating substantial
      amounts of hyperspace energy. Referring to the electron microscope
      photograph shown in FIG. 1, the white mist emanating from the
      cable is low-density hyperspace energy that is flowing in from a
      co-dimension of our universe. The dimensions of the cable are of
      such a particular size as to couple the cable to the tetrahedral
      geometry of subspace, the dimension of space, the Planck mass and
      the linear inductance of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to physicist Dr. Edward Witten of Princeton
      University, space has twenty-four dimensions, of which ten
      dimensions are non-redundant. Imagine taking a path around the
      Pythagorean triangle, as known as the planar tetrahedron, with
      sides equal to {{square root}{square root over (1)}, {square
      root}{square root over (2)}, {square root}{square root over (3)}}
      as shown in FIG. 2. There are three squares denoted the one-square
      (A), the two-square (B) and the three-square (C). Each square has
      four sides. The edge of each square can be traversed in two
      directions. Thus the total number of dimensions is
      dimtotal=2.(4+4+4)=24<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Referring to FIG. 3, there is a path starting at the corner
      of the triangle, along the one-square (1), around the two-square
      (2,3,4,5), back along the one-square (6), around the three-square
      (7,8,9,10) and back to the corner of the triangle. The numbering
      of the edges shows that there are ten edges. Because the path is
      traversed in only one direction, the number of reduced dimensions
      is dimreduced=1.(10)=10<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Referring to FIG. 4, the planar tetrahedron (B) forms one
      edge of the three-dimensional tetrahedron (A). Rotating the planar
      tetrahedron Â±120[deg.] produces the other two edges. The
      tetrahedron has four faces which are equilateral triangles. The
      ten dimensional path starts and ends at (C), the corner of the
      tetrahedron known as the zero point.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Referring to FIG. 5, the projection of the 3D tetrahedron
      (A) onto a plane is called the tetrahedron diagram (B) which is
      the main diagram of the new geometrical physics known as
      [Delta]physics. All the constants of physics can be derived
      geometrically from the tetrahedron diagram and its associated
      planar tetrahedron. An example of this is shown in FIG. 6 where
      the edges are given specific constants related to tetrahedral
      geometry, dimension, curvature, and the mass and wavelength of the
      elementary particles such as the electron and proton. The ten
      dimensional path includes the following constants<br>
      <br>
      [0007] a. electron wavelength<br>
      <br>
      [0008] b. proton wavelength<br>
      <br>
      [0009] c. 47[pi] The solid angle of the sphere. The tetrahedron is
      circumscribed by a sphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] d. ln(2[pi]) The natural log of the curvature. The subspace
      geometry is a logarithmic manifold. The tetrahedron diagram plots
      the logarithm of mass versus the logarithm of wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] e. 0.599547652 A constant related to fractal dimension and
      the speed of light factor 2.99792458.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] f. {square root}{square root over (2)} The edge of the
      two-square.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] g. {square root}{square root over (10)}/10 The square root
      of ten dimensions per 10 dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] h. ln([Omega][Lambda]c)-1 The natural log of the momentum
      of space less one.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] i. [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The curvature of space per 10 dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] j. {square root}{square root over (2)} The edge of the
      two-square.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The length of each edge is multiplied by the constant
      assigned to that edge. The ten edges have the order of {{square
      root}{square root over (1)}, {square root}{square root over (2)},
      {square root}{square root over (2)}, {square root}{square root
      over (2)}, {square root}{square root over (1)}, {square
      root}{square root over (3)}, {square root}{square root over (3)},
      {square root}{square root over (3)}, {square root}{square root
      over (3)}}. What subspace geometry does is to multiply the edge
      length, such as {square root}{square root over (1)}, times the
      square root of two {square root}{square root over (2)}. Then it
      takes the square root of that number and multiplies it by the next
      edge, which is {square root}{square root over (2)}, times the
      curvature per 10 dimensions [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It then takes the square root of that number and so on. In
      equation form, this looks like the following calculation
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0020] where the letters correspond to those in the list of
      constants. The square root sum total is equal to the Planck scale
      [Lambda]which is the bottom dimensional limit of the universe. The
      sum of the ten constants per a speed of light circumference is
      equal to unity [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0021] where the log of the speed of light is
      ln(c)=ln(299792458)=19.51860099<br>
      <br>
      [0022] and multiplying by 2[pi] is the circumference of a circle
      with a radius equal to the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Referring to FIG. 7, the tetrahedron diagram plots the
      natural logarithm of mass on the vertical axis (C) versus the
      natural logarithm of wavelength on the horizontal axis (A). The
      reason for this is that the mass of the electron times its
      wavelength is equal to the mass of the proton times its wavelength
      which in turn is equal to Planck's constant h divided by the speed
      of light, known as the base constant (B). If two numbers multiply,
      they sum in logarithms. In subspace geometry, the sum of the
      logarithm of the mass of the electron plus the logarithm of the
      wavelength is equal to the logarithm of the base constant which
      has a value of -95.91546344. [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0024] What this means is that the mass and wavelength slide on a
      45[deg.] base line (D) which has end points on the vertical and
      horizontal axes equal to the base constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring to FIG. 8, a line (af) drawn from the origin at
      the tetrahedral angle of 19.47122063, equal to the asin([1/3]),
      creates a tetrahedron (F) along path (afg). This tetrahedron is
      circumscribed by a sphere (G) with sphere diameter (K).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The Planck scale path calculation showed that the electron
      mass and the proton wavelength were the last two edges. The
      electron mass has a value of ln(me)=-69.17083217<br>
      <br>
      [0027] and the electron wavelength has a value of
      ln([lambda]E)=-26.74463127<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring to FIG. 9, the electron wavelength (A) is plotted
      as a vertical line on the tetrahedron diagram. The wavelength
      reflects off the circumscribing sphere (G), and returns as the
      electron mass (B). So the diagram incorporates the concepts of
      both classical physics (point mass particles) and quantum
      mechanics (wave particles).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The proton wavelength has a value of
      ln([lambda]p)=-34.26005901<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The proton wavelength (C) is plotted as a horizontal line
      in order to get the intersection (b) with the electron mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Referring to FIG. 10, a circle (D) with a radius equal to
      the Planck scale is drawn centered (b) on the intersection of the
      electron mass with the proton wavelength, which are the last two
      edges of the Planck scale calculation. A line (ac) from the origin
      to the intersection of the base constant with the rotated
      tetrahedron creates the vertical tetrahedron (acd). As can be
      seen, the Planck scale is tangent to the tetrahedron on side (cd).
      This tetrahedron is the projection of the 3D tetrahedron shown
      before in FIG. 5. What this means is that the tetrahedral geometry
      of subspace determines the bottom limit of our universe. And this
      bottom limit, called the Planck scale, contains within itself the
      mass and wavelength of the elementary particles, curvature,
      dimension and planar tetrahedral geometry. Tetrahedron diagram
      tet0565 shows that the electron and proton are one and the same
      particle because the electron path rotates counterclockwise around
      the curvature and then returns clockwise as the proton path. This
      path occurs moving through space and hyperspace. Because the
      single particle enters our universe from hyperspace at two
      different positions, we see it as two distinct particles. Thus the
      tetrahedron diagram shows that hyperspace exists.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The speed of light is equal to the inverse of the square
      root of the permeability [mu] of space times the permittivity
      [epsilon] of space [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The permeability is linear inductance or inductance per
      length which you would find in a solenoid for example. The
      permittivity is linear capacitance or capacitance per length which
      you find in a capacitor. In an electrical circuit, the inductance
      and capacitance form a resonant circuit. The resonance frequency
      can be changed by changing the inductor or capacitor. In a similar
      manner, the speed of light is not constant, but can be lowered by
      increasing the permittivity. Hyperspace energy has a high
      permittivity and therefore a low speed of light. This low speed of
      light gives hyperspace energy a luminescent quality which is seen
      as a white mist (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0034] From Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, the stress
      pressure T on spacetime is proportion to the square of the ratio
      of the electric field E to the speed of light c. [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Thus substantially lowering the speed of light creates an
      enormous spacetime pressure which can be used to generate the lift
      force on electromagnetic field propulsion vehicles. Furthermore,
      the electric field is subject to the Lorentz transformation
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The electric field E0 moving in a frame velocity of v, can
      quickly attain relativistic proportions because the speed of light
      could be 1 meter per second, rather than the enormous value in our
      universe of 299792458 meters per second. Thus one would like to
      permeate the hull of the electromagnetic field propulsion vehicle
      with this hyperspace energy in order to increase the electric
      field and hence the spacetime curvature around the hull which
      produces the enormous lift force on the vehicle. The method of
      bringing in this hyperspace energy is to use braided gold wire
      coaxial cable which is coupled to the geometry of subspace. The
      subspace geometry is contained in the [Delta]physics tetrahedron
      diagram.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Just as space has a linear inductance and linear
      capacitance, it also has a linear mass [Omega] or mass per meter.
      Physicist Dr. John A. Wheeler of Princeton likes to invert this
      and call it "mom" for meter of mass. The Planck mass is equal to
      the Planck scale [Lambda]times the linear mass
      [Omega]ln(mPlank)=ln([Omega][Lambda])=-17.64290101<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Planck's constant h is equal to 2[pi] times the Planck
      scale squared times the linear mass [Omega] times the speed of
      light c. h=2[pi][Lambda]&lt;2 &gt;
      [Omega]c=2[pi][Lambda]([Omega][Lambda])c<br>
      <br>
      [0039] which shows that Planck's constant is actually the
      circumference of a circle of radius Planck scale times the Planck
      mass times the speed of light. The base constant is therefore
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0040] which is an area, known as the Planck box, bounded by the
      Planck wavelength (2[pi][Lambda]) and the Planck mass. Everything
      outside the Planck box is hyperspace. Everything inside the Planck
      box is our universe. Thus the boundary between space and
      hyperspace is the Planck wavelength and the Planck mass. In
      logarithms, notice that the Planck mass and Planck wavelength,
      just like the electron and proton, sum to the base constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Referring to FIG. 11, the Planck mass (A) and the Planck
      wavelength (B) are plotted on the diagram and reflected off the
      sphere. The Planck wavelength intersects the tetrahedron at (b)
      which is the boundary between space and hyperspace known as the
      centerline of the diagram. The centerline has a value equal to the
      base times the square root of {fraction (4/3)}. [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Referring to FIG. 12, the centerline (C) is drawn on the
      diagram and the tetrahedron (E) is mirrored (F) across the
      centerline to indicate the co-dimensions of hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Referring to FIG. 13, a circle (H), centered at the base at
      the base (c), tangent to the centerline (C), has a radius equal to
      base times the square root of 4/3 less one [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0044] This is the length that has to traversed in order to cross
      over the centerline from the base constant of our universe to the
      co-dimension of hyperspace. Furthermore, the Planck mass, which is
      the other boundary, has to be crossed in order to get to either
      axis as seen by the length between the vertical axis and line (A).
      It can be looked at also as the length needed to go from the
      Planck wavelength (B) to the tangent point of circle (H) in order
      to reach the center of the mirror tetrahedrons.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] This invention is a braided gold wire coaxial cable of
      micron size that is coupled to the subspace geometry of the
      universe for the purpose of bringing in low-density hyperspace
      energy into our universe from the co-dimensions of hyperspace. The
      dimensions of the coaxial cable are of such particular size as to
      enable it to couple to the ten dimensions of space, the 3:1
      geometrical ratio of the tetrahedron, the coaxial wave function
      based on the logarithm of the ratio of the outer radius to the
      inner radius of the cable, the length between the base constant of
      our universe and the centerline between mirror tetrahedrons, and
      the geometrical relationship between the Planck mass and the
      linear inductance of the cable.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Referring to FIG. 14, the coaxial guide has an outer
      braided conductor (A) and an inner braided conductor (B) in which
      the outer and inner conductors are at radii a and b respectively.
      The linear inductance L of the cable is equal to the natural
      logarithm of the ratio of the radii times the permeability [mu] of
      space divided by the curvature 2[pi] [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0047] It can be shown that the ratio of the area-to-volume ratio
      of the tetrahedron to the area-to-volume ratio of its
      circumscribing sphere is 3:1. It is also the ratio of the area of
      the three-square to the area of the one-square on the planar
      tetrahedron. It is also the tetrahedral angle asin([1/3]) equal to
      19.47122063[deg.]. It is also a maximum work condition between the
      velocity ratio of a fluid stream and a moving vane such as in
      turbomachinery. So the first constraint on the radii is
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The second constraint is that the radius c of the circle,
      equal to the difference between the base constant and the
      centerline, is related to ten dimensions. The value of the radius
      projected into our universe is [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0049] and the dimensional constraint is [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The coaxial wave function constraint is [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The linear inductance of the coaxial cable has to be such
      that it gets geometrically across the Planck mass which is the
      second boundary of our Planck box [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0052] With these four subspace constraints, the outer radius a
      and inner radius b of the cable are<br>
      <br>
      [0053] a=8.342461828 microns<br>
      <br>
      [0054] b=7.559058141 microns<br>
      <br>
      [0055] so the cable has an outside diameter of roughly 16 to 17
      microns.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0072] 1. Referring to FIG. 15, the coaxial cable has a braided
      gold wire outer conductor (A) and a braided gold wire inner
      conductor (B) separated by a dielectric (C). The open braiding
      promotes the conduction of the electromagnetic wave while allowing
      the hyperspace mist to seep out of the braid and permeate the
      surrounding material in which it is embedded.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] 2. The radius of the outer conductor a and the radius of
      the inner conductor b have the following values in order to couple
      the cable to the tetrahedral geometry of subspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] a=8.342461828.microns<br>
      <br>
      [0075] b=7.559058141.microns<br>
      <br>
      [0076] 3. Even though the wire size is very small, the cable can
      be made in limited lengths using the new nanotechnology and
      silicon micromotors.<br>
