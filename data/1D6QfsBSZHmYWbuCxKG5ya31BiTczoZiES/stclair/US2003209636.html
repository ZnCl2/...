            produce lift on the hull. The magnetic moment is generated

            uses a magnetic vortex wormhole generator to lower the speed
            of light in order to efficiently create highly relativistic

            <br>
          </small><big>[0001] This invention, which is the subject of my
            present application, is comprised of a toroidal core around
            which are wound a plurality of electromagnetic bobbins. The
            bobbins are pulsed electrically to create an amplified
            magnetic wave that travels around the core. At the same
            time, a circular electrical conductor carrying direct
            current creates a magnetic field around its area which
            results in the formation of a magnetic moment. This magnetic
            moment, together with the spacetime curvature distortion
            created by the traveling magnetic wave, produces a lift
            force on the vehicle.</big><small><br>

          </small><b><big>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0004] The idea for this invention comes from
            experiments I have done using thin transformer laminations
            wound in intervals with bobbins of wire connected to a
            frequency generator. Pulsing the bobbins electrically
            creates a slow traveling magnetic wave along the surface of
            the lamination. The velocity of the wave, as shown by
            Hammond in the reference paper, is the square root of the
            frequency divided by the conductivity and permeability of
            the material. From Einstein's General Theory of Relativity,
            this type of wave around the circumference creates a
            spacetime curvature distortion in the vertical direction
            that looks like a tilted plate. The magnetic field traveling
            around the circumference has to follow this curvature. This
            creates a magnetic gradient in the z-direction which
            together with the magnetic moment developed by a solenoid
            produces lift on the vehicle.</big><small><br>

          </small><big>[0005] It is the object of this invention to
            create a magnetic field gradient and magnetic moment in
            order to produce a lift force on the hull of a vehicle. The
            magnetic field gradient is produced by a traveling magnetic

            circular wire carrying direct current around its area.</big><small><br>

            </small></b><b><big>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</big></b><small><b><br>
            </b><br>
          </small><big>[0015] 1. Referring to the equation in FIG. 1,
            the lift force on the bobbin spacecraft is equal to its
            magnetic moment times its magnetic field gradient. The
            magnetic moment has units of electrical current, measured in
            amps, times the area enclosed by the current. Thus the units
            of the magnetic moment are amp-m&lt;2&gt;. The magnetic
            moment can be created by a large, circular coil of wire
            carrying direct current I as shown in FIG. 2. The spacetime
            cylindrical coordinates {t, r, [theta], z} are shown to the
            right of the drawing where t is time, r the radius, the
            horizontal angle [theta], and the vertical height z.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0016] 2. The wire coil solenoid also produces a
            magnetic field in the vertical z-direction equal to the
            permeability of space [mu] times the number of turns per
            unit length of the solenoid n, times the current I in the
            winding. The equation is shown in FIG. 3 which can be
            developed from Ampere's law that the magnetic field around a
            loop is equal to the current passing through the loop.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0017] 3. Referring to FIG. 4, the bobbin
            spacecraft consists of a large, horizontal, highpermeability
            toroidal core (D) wrapped at intervals with electrical
            bobbins (B) which can be pulsed electrically to create a
            traveling magnetic wave around the core. Interior to this
            core is a large direct current solenoid (C) which produces
            said magnetic field in the z-direction. These devices are
            enclosed in a circular hull (A) containing the coils on the
            outer rim and a cabin area in the center.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0018] 4. Referring to FIG. 5, the velocity of
            the magnetic wave on the surface of the core is equal to the
            square root of the wave frequency [omega] divided by the
            conductivity a times the permeability [mu] of the core
            material. When the first bobbin is pulsed, a wave starts to
            propagate along the surface of the core. As the wave passes
            the second bobbin in sequence, another electrical pulse is
            generated to amplify the wave. After many cycles, the wave
            traveling around the core becomes larger and larger in
            amplitude.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0019] 5. A traveling wave has a wave function
            equal to a sinusoidal function with an argument of the angle
            [theta] around the periphery less the time t, or
            Sin[[theta]-[omega]t].</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0020] 6. In gravitational physics, there is a g
            metric tensor which is a measure of length in spacetime
            coordinates. When mass or electromagnetic fields are
            involved in a certain region of space, a curvature of space
            is created. The curvature of space can then be calculated
            directly from this metric tensor. The result is Einstein's G
            curvature tensor which shows the spacetime distortion. The g
            metric tensor is a 4 by 4 matrix having rows and columns
            equal to time t, radius r, angle theta, and vertical height
            z. The diagonal from top left to bottom right has a
            signature equal to {-1, 1, r&lt;2&gt;, 1}.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0021] 7. Because the magnetic wave traveling
            around the core is varying with time t in the theta
            direction, the wave function has to go into the {t,[theta]}
            and {[theta],t} slots of the metric tensor, as shown in FIG.
            6.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0022] 8. From this metric tensor, Einstein's G
            curvature tensor is calculated using a general relativity
            software program. The spacetime curvature in the vertical
            z-direction is contained in the Gzz component. A 3D plot of
            this curvature with respect to radius and theta is shown in
            FIG. 7. The axis on the right side is the angle around the
            periphery, and the axis on the left is the radius which goes
            from 0 to 20 meters. The vertical axis of the graph is the
            spacetime curvature in the vertical z-direction. The center
            of the vertical axis is zero. At a small radius, there is a
            sinusoidal curvature which is positive from 0 to [pi] and
            which is negative from [pi] to 2[pi]. What this looks like
            is a tilted plate as depicted in FIG. 8.</big><small><br>
            <br>
          </small><big>[0023] 9. In flat spacetime with no
            electromagnetic fields or mass, the curvature would be the
            horizontal plate as seen FIG. 8. Due to the traveling
            magnetic wave, the spacetime curvature looks like the tilted
            plate. The flat-space magnetic field was pointing up in the
            vertical direction, having no divergence and no gradient. In
            curved spacetime, however, the magnetic field becomes tilted
            just like the plate and a magnetic gradient dBz/dz is
            created. This spacetime curvature gradient of the magnetic
            field times the magnetic moment of the second coil produces
            a lift force on the hull which is anchored to these coils.</big><br>
