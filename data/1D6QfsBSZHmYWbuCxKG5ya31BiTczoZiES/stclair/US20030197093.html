          <b>Abstract: </b>This invention relates to a magnetic vortex
          generator which has the ability to generate negative mass and
          a negative spring constant which, according to Einstein's
          General Theory of Relativity, is required in order to create a
          stable wormhole between our space and hyperspace. Two
          separate, but electrically connected, toroidal coils of
          differing radii, carry magnetic flux in opposite directions
          about their common centerline. According to Maxwell's
          equation, this produces bucking electric fields along said
          centerline. Because the two solenoids have different radii,
          the parallel spring constant of both coils is negative. The
          negative mass together with the negative spring constant
          produce a real resonant frequency which can distort the
          spacetime curvature due to the creation of powerful spikes of
          negative mass. This phenomenon, similar to the common
          electrical thunderstorm, opens up a wormhole into hyperspace
          through which low-density hyperspace energy can enter into our
          dimension.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] This invention, which is the subject of my present
          application, is comprised of two solenoids wound with a common
          wire in opposite directions on two separate toroidal
          curved-sheet transformer laminates of differing radii. The
          smaller solenoid is mounted along the centerline of the larger
          solenoid. This circular magnetic geometry creates linear
          bucking electric fields along the centerline of the coils.
          Because the magnetic flux in the laminates travels in opposite
          directions along arcs of differing radii in the two coils, a
          negative mass and a negative spring constant are generated by
          the system. From the theory of gravitational physics, a
          negative mass is prerequisite to producing a wormhole because
          it allows the throat of the wormhole to remain open and
          stable. The creation of the wormhole is facilitated by the
          appearance of a negative spring constant which allows the
          spacetime curvature to resonate to such a degree that said
          wormhole develops between our dimension and another
          co-dimension of hyperspace. Because the physics constants of
          hyperspace are different from ours, the wormhole allows
          hyperspace energy having a low speed of light to enter our
          dimension. Because electromagnetic fields obey the Lorentz
          transformation, it is now possible with this lower velocity of
          light to create huge relativistic fields which can drive the
          new electromagnetic field propulsion vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0002] The idea for this coil configuration comes from the
          observation of powerful thunderstorms, as described by
          physicist Dr. Richard Feynman in his Lectures on Physics, a
          copy of which is enclosed as a reference. Upon reading his
          explanation, I realized that the thunderstorm is actually a
          hyperspace physics phenomenon.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] After the passage of a large lightning storm, people
          have observed that a car tire rim has merged with the trunk of
          a tree growing in the ground. Due to the large branches of the
          tree, there is no possible way that it could slide down the
          branches and around the trunk. It was observed also that a
          straw of wheat became embedded in the hard wood of a telephone
          pole. It turns out that the thunderstorm offers an explanation
          as to how this can occur.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] After reading Feynman's explanation, it can be seen
          that the key to this phenomenon is that there is a downward
          and an upward lightning bolt, sometimes occurring together if
          the leader branches into two paths. Bolts of lightning also
          like to strike tall objects such as telephone poles or trees.
          Now an electrical current moving downward produces a clockwise
          magnetic B field, as seen from above. On the return stroke,
          the current is moving upward which produces a counterclockwise
          magnetic B field. Thus the thunderstorm produces two huge
          bucking magnetic B fields which is the magnetic geometry of
          this magnetic vortex generator. Using my tetrahedron diagram,
          I will then show that the low density hyperspace energy with
          its low speed of light is able to pull the rim out of
          dimension so that it can merge with the tree at the moment the
          lightning strikes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0005] It is the object of this invention to produce two
          toroidal oppositely-directed magnetic flux fields in two
          separate yet electrically connected solenoids of differing
          radii. Because the lines of flux are traveling in toroidal,
          curved-sheet transformer laminates along arcs of different
          curvature, the fields produce what is known in gravitational
          physics as negative mass. Negative mass has the property that
          if you project it onto a hot surface, the surface will cool
          rather than heat up. The negative mass, together with the
          resonance of the spacetime curvature involving a negative
          spring constant, create a wormhole into hyperspace. This
          interdimensional connection allows low speed of light
          hyperspace energy into our dimension which can be used to
          decrease the weight of an object, or produce huge relativistic
          electromagnetic fields that can be used to drive the new
          electromagnetic field propulsion spacecraft.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0019] 1. The fact that negative mass is required to keep the
          throat of a wormhole open has been shown to be valid by
          physicist Dr. Kip Thorne in the enclosed reference physics
          paper. The key point of this invention is that if you have a
          negative mass, you also require a negative spring constant in
          order to get a real frequency and vice versa. The angular
          frequency of vibration is equal to the square root of the
          spring constant K divided by the mass M, or [omega]={square
          root}{square root over (K/M)}. If the mass is negative, and
          the spring constant is positive, the frequency is imaginary.
          Therefore, in order to get a real frequency, the spring
          constant has to be negative also.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] 2. Referring to FIG. 1, the magnetic vortex generator
          consists of a large toroidal solenoid (A) and its support
          structure (C), a smaller toroidal coil (B) with its support
          structure (D) which holds the coil along the centerline of the
          larger coil. The entire structure sits on a base (E).<br>
          <br>
          [0021] 3. The two solenoids are wound with a common wire in
          opposite directions on two separate toroidal curved-sheet
          transformer laminations of differing radii. From the right
          hand rule, a changing circular magnetic field in the direction
          of the fingers produces a linear electric field in the
          direction of the thumb. Because there are two coils producing
          two magnetic fields in opposite directions, there are two
          bucking electric fields down the centerline of the coils. This
          duplicates the thunderstorm conditions. A perspective view of
          the generator is shown in FIG. 2.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] 4. A enlarged view of the non-linear coil winding is
          shown in FIG. 3. The wire (B) is wound around the thin
          transformer laminations (A) with a non-linear coil spacing as
          shown by the difference in spacing between length (C) and
          (C'). On this inner side of the coil, the wire is wound
          straight across where it can be seen that the wire is normal
          to the edge of the laminations. Not shown are two strips of
          Velcro which keep the wire aligned and offset from the
          tape-covered metal laminations.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] 5. Since the wire is straight across on this side, the
          opposite side has to have the wire run in a diagonal manner as
          seen in FIG. 4A. In terms of cylindrical coordinates, the
          components of the electrical current in the coil flow in the
          z-direction across the breadth of the lamination and in the
          O-direction around the lamination.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] 6. The reason for the non-linear spacing is to preserve
          the vector potential of the coil. The vector potential is a
          more important field than the magnetic field because it can
          extend out past the windings of a long solenoid. If you look
          at the units, it is the field momentum per charge or kilogram
          meter per second coulomb. Notice that the derivative of the
          vector potential with respect to time is an electric field,
          while a derivative with respect to length is the magnetic
          field. The inductance of the coil times the current density is
          equal to the vector potential. Thus the inductance gradient of
          the coil times the current per meter is the magnetic field. So
          the non-linear coil picks up an additional magnetic field
          around the coil besides the one created in the laminations by
          the winding itself<br>
          <br>
          [0025] 7. Taking a closer look at the coil in FIG. 5, it is
          constructed of thin laminations taped together to form a
          cylindrical shape with a wire coil wrapped around it. This
          creates a magnetic field in the theta [theta] direction within
          the laminations. Because the coil is wrapped as a helix, there
          is a current component I[theta] in the theta direction. The
          cross-sectional area Area through which the magnetic flux
          flows times a normal vector n in the theta direction is the
          tensor area n[theta] Area. If the radius of the coil is r,
          then the curvature K is 1/r&lt;2 &gt;pointing in the radial
          direction. Because there are two coils with differing radii,
          the generator has two curvatures associated with it.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] 8. In the geometry of electromagnetism, the magnetic
          field is part of the electromagnetic Faraday tensor F&lt;[mu]v
          &gt;which is a 4 by 4 spacetime matrix having rows and columns
          of time t, radius r, angle [theta] and height z in cylindrical
          coordinates. The first index [mu] refers to the row, and the
          second index v refers to the column. The diagonal of the
          matrix is zero. The first row and column belong to the
          electric field. All the other slots are filled by the
          components of the magnetic field. The B[theta] component is
          located in the complementary slots of r and z as shown in FIG.
          6. Now a tensor product can be written with the available
          variables I&lt;[theta]&gt; no Area KrF&lt;rz=k&lt;z&gt;. This
          says that the current around the loop in the theta direction
          times the lamination area vector in the theta direction times
          the curvature K of the coil in the radial direction times the
          magnetic field in the theta direction is equal to a spring
          constant in the z-direction, or normal to the plane of the
          coil. All the tensor components cancel out except for the
          z-direction. That is, the coil produces a spacetime spring
          constant through the center of the coil where there are
          resonant bucking electric fields. So the coil is creating a
          magnetic spring. The units of the spring constant are shown in
          FIG. 7 as force per meter.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] 9. Because there are two coils operating in opposite
          directions in regions of differing curvature, there are two
          parallel spring constants generated along the centerline. Two
          springs in parallel sum, but the inner coil is negative due to
          the triple product of negative signs of current, field and
          area. Looking at the front view of the coils, the right hand
          rule shows the field going counterclockwise with the thumb
          pointing along the electric field in the positive z-direction.
          The inner coil with the field going in the clockwise direction
          has the electric field in the negative z-direction. Therefore
          the outer coil's positive spring constant sums with the inner
          coil's negative spring constant to produce an overall negative
          spring constant as shown in FIG. 8. The inner coil has a
          radius r, and the spacing between the outer and inner coil is
          a. In this design, the inner radius is 1, and the outer radius
          is 3 which is the magic ratio in physics of 1/3. That makes
          length a equal to 2. Substituting r=1 and a=2 into the spring
          constant equation shows that the ratio is negative 8/9. That
          is, the spring constant is negative as previously asserted. If
          the spring constant is negative, it must produce negative mass
          in order to have a real frequency of resonance. Since it
          produces negative mass, then it can produce a wormhole as
          shown by Dr. Kip Thorne.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] 10. The geometry of hyperspace physics is based on the
          geometry of the tetrahedron which is circumscribed by the
          sphere. The corners of the tetrahedron touch the sphere at a
          latitude of 19.47122063[deg.] which turns out to be, in terms
          of planet cosmology, the location where all the large
          volcanoes and vortices occur on Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus
          and Neptune. Furthermore, the cosine squared of this angle is
          8/9, which is the spring constant ratio for the magnetic
          vortex generator. That is, the coil is interacting with the
          geometry of spacetime which is why it is such an effective
          wormhole generator. As will be demonstrated later, the
          tetrahedral geometry of hyperspace shows that the electron and
          proton are one and the same particle. This is a new discovery
          in science coming out of this research. The diagram also shows
          that when the speed of light is reduced, due to the low
          density of energy coming into our dimension through the
          wormhole, Planck's constant divided by the speed of light puts
          the electron at the boundary between space and hyperspace.
          That is, the electron and the proton go out of dimension which
          is the reason that the car tire rim can become merged with the
          tree. The ramifications of this magnetic vortex generator are
          enormous. It means developing new types of crystals through
          interdimensional merging which will be needed in the
          development of these spacecraft and their crystal rotors. It
          means the possibility of teleporting spacecraft through
          hyperspace over distances of light years using the new folding
          space waveguides. It means light-weight or inertia-less
          spacecraft which can be accelerated at hundreds of thousands
          of g's. It means the ability to lift extraordinary loads in
          construction work. It means surgery-less medical tables where
          tumors can be pulled directly out of the patient's body.<br>

          [0029] 11. Because we have a magnetic spring, then there is
          some resonant frequency at which the coil can be operated in
          order to create a large spacetime distortion. It is this
          distortion that creates the wormhole into hyperspace. From
          this it follows that the wormhole attaches to a low pressure
          region with a magnetic monopole. Because pressure is linear
          mass times the speed of light squared divided by area, a low
          pressure signifies a low speed of light and less dense matter.
          What this means is that opposite polarity spacetime curvature
          at two ends of an electrode will produce a voltage along the
          electrode, effectively creating a power supply. The reason for
          this is that spacetime curvature, as shown by Einstein's
          General Theory of Relativity equation
          G[alpha][beta]=8[pi]T[alpha][beta], is equal to the square of
          the electromagnetic fields in the stress-energy tensor T. So
          the curvature on the ends of the electrode appear as voltages
          and the system acts as a battery supply to power the
          spacecraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] 12. The other characteristic of the magnetic vortex
          generator is that it can pull objects out of dimension
          allowing the object to apparently move through solid walls.
          The object doesn't actually move through the wall because the
          object is not in the same dimension as the wall; it just
          appears that way. Moving out of dimension and then back again
          on the other side of the wall would effectively move the
          object through the wall for all intents and purposes.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] 13. The tetrahedron diagram is a physics diagram which
          plots the natural logarithm of mass to the natural logarithm
          of wavelength. The product of mass times wavelength is equal
          to Planck's constant divided by the speed of light. So the
          product of the electron mass times its wavelength is equal to
          the proton mass times its wavelength is equal to the Planck
          mass times the Planck wavelength. The Planck wavelength is the
          bottom dimensional limit of the universe. We live in the
          Planck box which is bounded by the Planck wavelength and
          Planck mass. Outside this box is hyperspace.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] 14. Because logarithms sum, the sum of the log of the
          mass plus the log of the wavelength is a constant sum. Thus
          the electron and proton and Planck mass slide on a 45[deg.]
          line known as the base constant which is equal at the axes to
          the log of Planck's constant divided by the speed of light.
          Planck's constant is measured in joule-sec so that multiplying
          it by the frequency 1/second of light gives the energy of the
          photon particle.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] 15. Planck's constant is equal to the Planck wavelength
          times the Planck mass times the speed of light. The 45[deg.]
          base constant is Planck's constant divided by the speed of
          light, which means that the speed of light cancels out top and
          bottom, leaving the area of the Planck box as the value of the
          base constant. Hyperspace has a low linear mass compared to
          our dimension. Therefore, Planck's constant is reduced when
          this energy enters our dimension through the wormhole created
          by the generator. And the base constant is also so reduced. In
          terms of logs, this means that the 45[deg.] base line becomes
          more negative and moves to the right on the diagram. As it
          does so, the base line intersects the electron at the Planck
          wavelength which is the separation point between space and
          hyperspace. That is, the electron moves out of dimension.
          Because the electron and proton are one and the same particle,
          as shown in reference tetrahedron diagram tet0565, the proton
          and hence the entire atom is taken out of dimension as well.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] 16. All of this can be seen more easily graphically on
          the tetrahedron diagram itself, referring to reference
          tetrahedron diagram tet3025. The 45[deg.] line which
          intersects the electron at point (b) is the base constant for
          our dimension. As you can see, this base line intersects the
          horizontal axis at a value of -95.91546344 which is the log of
          Planck's constant h divided by the speed of light. Because
          Planck's constant is proportional to the linear mass, it is
          reduced in value by the low density hyperspace energy and, in
          terms of logs, becomes more negative. This moves the base line
          to the right at a value of around minus 105. The new base line
          intersects the electron at point (a) which is located on the
          Planck wavelength that is the boundary between space and
          hyperspace. Thus the electron at point (a) goes out of
          dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] 17. It was inferred previously that a negative spring
          constant meant a negative mass was produced by the wormhole
          generator. This can actually be calculated using Einstein's
          General Theory of Relativity. The calculation starts with the
          g metric tensor which is a spacetime measurement of distance
          in terms of time t, radius r, horizontal angle [theta] and
          length z. This 4 by 4 matrix is shown in FIG. 9 where the
          diagonal line has a signature in cylindrical coordinates of
          values equal to {-1, 1, r&lt;2&gt;, 1}. All the other terms of
          the matrix are zero except for the magnetic fields in the two
          coils. Because the field is changing sinusoidally with time in
          the theta direction, the field has to go into the {t, [theta]}
          and {[theta], t} slots of the matrix. Because the field in the
          inner coil is in the negative direction compared to the outer
          coil, and including a 90[deg.] phase shift between the two
          fields, a suitable magnetic field function would be B
          (cos([theta])-sin([theta])).<br>
          <br>
          [0036] 18. Using a general relativity software package,
          Einstein's G curvature tensor can be calculated for this
          particular metric. The first term G t in the upper left hand
          slot in the corner is the mass term for the tensor. All the
          other terms are either electromagnetic fluxes or pressure
          terms involving the squares of the fields.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] 19. Referring to FIG. 10, a plot of the mass as a
          function around a small circle shows that two negative mass
          spikes occur around the circumference of the circle. Because
          the radius is almost zero, the two spikes are actually
          coincident.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] 20. This next section shows the electrical system used
          to drive the magnetic vortex generator. Referring to FIG. 11,
          the system is driven by a sinusoidal voltage source (A) into a
          1:1 turns isolation transformer (B). The voltage is stepped up
          into the range of thousands of volts using a step-up hi-pot
          transformer (C). The first loop consists of a direct current
          blocking capacitor (D), a transformer choke (E), a variable
          inductance (G) and the current in the loop (F). The variable
          inductance is a coil winding on a toroidal core wound with
          thousandth-inch thick SuperMalloy tape. This coil acts as a
          magnetic switch due to its variable permeability.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] 21. Referring to the accompanying drawing in FIG. 12,
          the slope of the BH curve is actually the permeability of the
          core. At point (a) on the curve, the slope is very low and
          therefore the permeability is very small. The resistance of
          the coil is the frequency of the current times the inductance
          of the coil. If the permeability is small, then the inductance
          is low, which means that the coil resistance is low initially.
          With a low resistance in the coil, current (F) flows through
          the winding rather easily. Then the coil goes from point (a)
          to point (b) where the permeability and resistance increase.
          This change in resistance from a low to a high value dumps the
          magnetic energy into capacitor (H). Then the non-linear coil
          saturates between points (b) and (c) where again the coil has
          a small slope and the coil resistance switches to a low value.
          Capacitor (D) then dumps its charge (I) through coil (G)
          producing a large voltage spike in the input and output
          winding of transformer toroidal coil (J). The magnetic flux in
          coil (J) then produces a voltage spike in coils (L) and (M) of
          the magnetic vortex generator. The frequency of oscillation of
          the generator is determined by capacitor (K) and the overall
          inductance of the two coils. The diagram shows that the
          winding is non-linear and in opposite directions going from
          outer coil to the inner coil.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] 22. Frequency of oscillation has to be kept under 20
          MHz in order to create a soft wormhole that connects to low
          pressure regions of hyperspace. The pressure regions of
          hyperspace are similar to the pressure produced by a dam
          holding water. The upper surface of the water, where there is
          no water pressure, is analogous to the black void into which
          our universe is expanding. In the middle of the dam, there is
          a region just above us having a lower water pressure which
          corresponds to the low density hyperspace energy. This analogy
          is not perfect because the many frequencies of hyperspace are
          quantized, as we know from quantum physics, rather than being
          a continuous spectrum of lower and lower frequencies down to
          the zero frequency of the black void.<br>
