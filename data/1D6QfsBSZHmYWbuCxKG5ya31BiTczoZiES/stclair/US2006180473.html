          A water energy generator that generates electricity using a
          magnetic vortex wormhole generator and a water injector/vacuum
          chamber to produce low density hyperspace energy that causes
          the hydrogen atoms of water molecules to decay into electron
          pairs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0001] This invention is an energy generator that uses the
          transition through wormholes of the hydrogen atoms of water
          molecules to break the bonds of the atoms and convert the
          protons into photons and electrons which can be collected for
          energy.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0002] A molecule of water consists of two hydrogen H atoms
          and one atom of oxygen O which has the chemical formula<br>
          H2O<br>
          The hydrogen atoms can be separated from the oxygen atom by
          electrolysis. In this process, a direct current of
          electricity, such as from a battery, is passed through water
          decomposing it into hydrogen and oxygen. Pure water, however,
          is a poor conductor of electricity. It is therefore necessary
          to add some substance to form a solution that will conduct an
          electric current. Such a solution that will conduct electric
          current is called an electrolytic solution. A small amount of
          sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide is added to the water to
          form an electrolytic solution. Water electrolyzed yields
          hydrogen plus oxygen<br>
          Water-&gt;hydrogen+oxygen<br>
          2H2O-&gt;2H2+O2<br>
          Because this invention is to be used on spacecraft, the oxygen
          can be used for breathing and the hydrogen can be used to
          produce energy that will be used to create the electromagnetic
          fields which provide lift and propulsion.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Referring to FIG. 1, a single hydrogen atom consists of
          one proton (1) in the nucleus and one electron (2) moving in
          an orbital (3) around the nucleus. In quantum physics
          notation, there is only one main K shell and one orbital
          containing a single electron in the 1 s subshell. An orbital
          is an energy level containing one or two electrons in a
          subshell of an atom. Only a total of two electrons may be
          placed in one orbital with the added constraint that the
          electrons spin in opposite directions. Looking at the 1 s
          orbital, it can be seen that only half of it is occupied. What
          this means is that it is possible to add another hydrogen atom
          in which its electron occupies the other position in the
          orbital to from the hydrogen molecule H2.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] In 1925, a physicist by the name of Edwin Schrodinger
          developed a wave equation, which bears his name, that models
          the hydrogen atom. Even though the classical picture of FIG. 1
          showing a distinct electron orbiting the proton is easy to
          visualize, in reality the electron is a wavefunction [Psi]
          whose square indicates the probability of finding the electron
          at a particular point. This then was the start of quantum
          physics where it was found that the electron energy can only
          take on certain discrete values.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] A traveling wave moving in the positive x-direction can
          be represented by the function [Psi]1=[Psi]1(x,t) of the form<br>
          [Psi]1=A1 cos(2[pi](x/[lambda]-v t))<br>
          where x is the distance along the x-axis, A the wave
          amplitude, [lambda] the monochromatic wavelength, v the
          velocity of the wave and t time.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] A similar monochromatic wave moving to the left can be
          represented by<br>
          [Psi]2=A2 cos(2[pi](x/[lambda]+v t))<br>
          where the sign of the velocity is reversed. The superposition
          of these traveling waves results in a standing wave, or
          stationary waves, of the form<br>
          [Psi]=[Psi]1+[Psi]2=A cos(2[pi]x/[lambda]) cos(2[pi]v t)<br>
          which is now a product of a spatial-dependent term A
          cos(2[pi]x/[lambda]), and a time-dependent term cos(2[pi]v t).
          Taking the partial derivative of [Psi] twice with respect to x
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The momentum p of a particle is equal to Planck's constant h
          divided by the mass m of the particle [mathematical formula -
          see original document]<br>
          where h bar is the reduced Planck constant. Thus Schrodinger's
          equation can be written as [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          For a particle whose potential energy is V(x), the total
          energy is the kinetic energy K plus the potential energy<br>
          E=K+V=(p&lt;2&gt; /2m)+V<br>
          Therefore,<br>
          p&lt;2&gt; =2 m (E-V)<br>
          and Schrodinger's equation becomes [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          The potential V is just the Coulomb potential of the product
          of two charges e divided by the radius r between them
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where [epsilon] is the linear capacitance of space. A general
          wavefunction can be separated into a radial R part and a
          spherical harmonics part Y<br>
          [Psi]=Rn,1Y1,m([theta],[phi])<br>
          where the first term is called a radial wavefunction which
          describes the "in-out" motion of the electron. When
          Schrodinger's equation is separated, it is found that the
          radial part of the wavefunction, R, must be a solution of the
          quantized differential equation [mathematical formula - see
          original document]<br>
          This can be expressed in a simpler form by defining the
          function<br>
          f=rR<br>
          which is then found to satisfy the equation [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          where the effective potential is given by [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          where the 1's are the quantum orbital numbers. For s orbitals
          equal to 1=0, the effective potential is just the
          electrostatic potential of the nucleus. For 1 greater than
          zero, the first term is equal to the kinetic energy owing to
          the angular motion of the electron at a distance r and with
          angular momentum [square root of]1(l+1)h.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Referring to FIG. 2, the effective potential is graphed
          as a function of radius r and the orbital numbers. For orbital
          number l=0, which is the lower of the three curves, the
          potential does not provide a stable position for the electron
          (black disk) and the negatively-charged electron just crashes
          into the positively-charged proton nucleus as shown by the
          arrow. For orbital l=1, the first term is called the
          centrifugal repulsion which together with the electrostatic
          potential provides for a stable position for the electron as
          seen in the middle curve. The potential energy is negative
          which creates a slight valley in which the electron obtains a
          stable orbit. Higher orbital numbers l=2 produce a similar
          valley potential further out on the radius. The l=1 orbital
          does not allow the electron to come near the proton which
          provides for a stable hydrogen atom. So the key to this
          invention is how to destabilize this hydrogen atom energy
          system and produce usable energy which can propel the
          electromagnetic spacecraft and run other hyperspace
          inventions. Refer to my patent applications such as Dipole
          Moment Spacecraft, Dual Potential Hull Spacecraft, Photon
          Spacecraft, Electromagnetic Field Propulsion System, Full Body
          Teleportation, Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator, Electric
          Vortex Wormhole Generator, Sulfur S8 Wormhole Generator,
          Cavitating Oil Hyperspace Energy Generator, Rotor Inductance
          Propulsion System and Triangular Spacecraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Many of these patent applications involve wormholes and
          hyperspace which are not well-known concepts in the scientific
          community. Hyperspace consists of those dimensions which are
          co-dimensional with our spacetime. The reason I know about
          hyperspace is because (1) I have been in hyperspace on a
          number of occasions and have experienced Einstein's time
          dilation according to his General Theory of Relativity, (2) I
          have experienced more than one full-body hyperspace
          teleportation over a distance of 100 meters, (3) we have been
          able to create a wormhole between space and hyperspace with
          the magnetic vortex wormhole generator in which smoke was
          blown through one side of the coil into hyperspace, a first
          contact verified by the Grey Aliens, (4) I have seen the green
          mist associated with moving out of dimension and crossing over
          into hyperspace, (5) I have looked into another dimension and
          have seen another building, a car and a man who waving at me
          in the presence of an artificially-intelligent Cyborg with the
          "high-tech look" from the Pleiadian Defense Department, (6) I
          can remote view through hyperspace subgeometry to distances of
          100,000 light years to the edge of the galaxy and have made
          first contact with around 500 extraterrestrial civilizations
          involving the use of patent applications such as Remote
          Viewing Amplifier, Quantum Dot Energy Cylinder and Walking
          Through Walls Training System, (7) I am the only person on
          Earth who has communicated with the designers of the crop
          circles found in England and explained their design to them in
          terms of subspace geometry, (8) I can walk through walls as a
          hyperspace energy being, and (9) I have discovered how
          anti-gravity is possible using low density hyperspace energy,
          not to mention all the other research work on these
          electromagnetic field propulsion vehicles. For my work in
          developing the geometry of the subspace manifold known as the
          tetrahedron diagram, I was given the Aphysics award by the
          Admiral, who is third in line to the Admiralty of the
          Pleiadian Defense Department. For my work in Revelations, she
          awarded me four beautiful galloping white riderless horses of
          the Apocalypse. The reason that the Pleiadian Defense
          Department was involved was that the Admiral had the task of
          creating the energy being that would protect the subspace
          manifold during the battle of Revelations which took place in
          the year 2001. So these are some of my personal experiences in
          the field of hyperspace physics.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] As to the scientific aspect of hyperspace physics,
          observations of the solar system have noted that large
          vortices occur on the planets at a latitude of ±19.5[deg.]. On
          the planet Jupiter, for example, the Giant Red Spot vortex,
          which is the size of two planets like Earth, is located at
          -19.5[deg.] latitude.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Referring to FIG. 3, the Olympus Mons volcano, which is
          the size of France, occurs in the northern hemisphere at
          19.5[deg.]. The plume of volcanic ash can be seen being blown
          to the upper right.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Here on Earth, just north of me at +19.5[deg.] in the
          Caribbean, there is a slow moving rock mantle vortex that
          curves the islands down toward Venezuela. Since the
          tetrahedron has three corners, another corner occurs at
          120[deg.] to the west where the Marshall Islands are located.
          The reason that the volcanic islands form is that low density
          hyperspace energy softens the atoms and molecules to such an
          extent that the atomic bonds are broken. The hot magma from
          the core has an easier path to the surface through the soft
          rock compared to the hard rock of surrounding areas. As the
          vortex rotates, the rising hot magma creates volcanoes which
          form the chain of islands.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] As another example of this, the Silver bridge, which is
          located at a double harmonic of 39[deg.] between Ohio and West
          Virginia, collapsed because a large wormhole opened up and
          flooded the bridge with low density hyperspace energy. The
          metal rivets softened and pulled out of the plates holding
          down the suspension cables. Thus the roadway tilted to one
          side and all the cars fell into the river.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] If you look at the quarried granite polygonal
          megalithic stone blocks that were used to build Machu Picchu,
          the blocks are put together as though they were soft putty.
          They fit together perfectly. Machu Picchu, or Great Picchu, is
          the Quichua name for a sharp peak which rises ten thousand
          feet above the sea. How this was achieved is described in my
          patent application Rotating Magnetic Vortex Generator which
          shows that rotating permanent magnets can create a wormhole
          between space and hyperspace. The low density hyperspace
          energy then floods the block as to make it weightless. The
          block is then floated up from the quarry which is 2500 feet
          below Machu Picchu. The huge 1000-ton blocks found in the
          platform at Baalbek in the Cedar Mountains of Lebanon were
          also lifted into position in this manner.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Using a technique called Chi Kung breathing, not
          necessarily known to the Chinese, one of our researchers has
          been able to levitate himself to a height of six feet. He
          might have gone higher but he lost his balance and his arm
          touched a nearby metal pipe. He then floated back to the
          ground. Contracting the abdominal muscles causes hot air to
          rise in the lungs while at the same time cold air is inhaled
          through the nose. This combination of hot and cold air mixing
          together creates environmental oscillators having a
          temperature fluctuation. This changes Planck's constant such
          that the body goes out of dimension and low density hyperspace
          energy fills the body.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The final example comes from Biblical times. Jesus and
          his father Joseph were both carpenters. A chair that Joseph
          had made for a client was found to be too small. So Jesus
          placed his hands on either side of the chair and stretched the
          chair to fit. The phrase in Spanish is "mas silla" which means
          that Jesus made more chair. In the dictionary, the Spanish
          word for putty is "masilla." The reason that Jesus could do
          this is that he passed hyperspace energy through his hand
          vortices which softened the wood. See my patent application
          called Hyperspace Torque Generator which shows this in more
          detail. The hand vortex is actually a planar co-gravitational
          K field that can rotate a pendulum around in circles. This
          solenoidal field corresponds to the magnetic H field. The
          electric field corresponds to the linear gravitational g
          field. The equations are identical for both sets of fields. I
          learned that Jesus actually reincarnated here on Earth in
          order to identify the planet on which the battle of
          Revelations would take place.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] In summary, these are some examples as to how low
          density hyperspace energy can soften and break the bonds of
          atoms and molecules.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] As mentioned previously, the astronomical observations
          suggest that the structure of the universe is related to the
          tetrahedron. Referring to FIG. 4, the corners of a tetrahedron
          circumscribed by a sphere, touch the sphere at an angle of
          19.47122063[deg.]. The ratio of the area-to-volume ratio of
          the sphere to the area-to-volume ratio of the tetrahedron is
          [1/3] which is the magic ratio in physics. The arcsin([1/3])
          is 19.47[deg.].<br>
          <br>
          [0018] In order for all the physics constants to be projected
          into our universe and the co-dimensional hyperspace
          dimensions, there has to be a tetrahedral subspace manifold.
          The only mathematical function which allows multiple rotations
          of the complex plane is the logarithmic function Log[z].<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Referring to FIG. 5, the complex number z in the
          complex plane is equal to x+I y where x and y are real
          constants and I&lt;2&gt; =-1. The complex number z can also be
          written in terms of a radius and an angle<br>
          z=r Exp[I [theta]]<br>
          Because the angle can rotate more than once in 2[pi] m
          multiples, the complex number z is actually<br>
          z=r Exp[I([theta]+2[pi] m )]<br>
          Taking the logarithm of z<br>
          Log[z]=Log[r]+I([theta]+2[pi]m)<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Referring to FIG. 6, it can be seen that it is not
          possible to go around multiple times on the same surface due
          to a branch cut along the origin where Log[0] is undefined.
          What happens is that as you rotate around on surface (4) and
          get to the origin, you go down along the branch (5) to the
          next hyperspace plane (6). Thus the universe is composed of
          many hyperspace co-dimensions. From personal experience, I
          estimate that the distance separating the two dimensions is
          about 3 meters when I was looking into another dimension at
          the man waving at me. The physics is even more complicated
          because there is a Lorentz dimensional transformation in which
          higher dimensions appear smaller and lower dimensions appear
          larger. In one case I was looking at a huge mothership at a
          much higher dimension and it looked like a tiny toy model
          spacecraft. They fired a laser cannon at me, and I then curved
          space which made the beam change course. You can see why I was
          awarded the four horses.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] The antilog of Log[z] is<br>
          e&lt;Log[z]&gt; =z=re&lt;I [omega]t &gt;<br>
          where the angle is the angular frequency [omega] times the
          time t. The subspace geometry remains stationary or fixed, but
          the projection of the antilog into our dimension generates a
          system which is frequency dependent. This is why we get
          oscillating fields.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] From Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, it is
          known that various kinds of energy can curve spacetime such as
          mass, electromagnetic fields, angular momentum and electrical
          charge. The elemental spacetime length ds in cylindrical
          coordinates {t,r,[theta],z}, known as the Schwarzschild
          metric, shows that spacetime can be curved using mass M and
          charge Q [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where you can see that the elemental time dt is dilated by the
          mass M and the elementary radius dr is reduced. I have
          actually experienced this time dilation in which, as I was
          jumping into hyperspace, I was hit by a car which broke my
          shoulder. When I came back into dimension which appeared to be
          a few seconds later, I found that I had an 8-inch blood ring
          down the right side of my chest. My shoulder blade, which
          sticks up about two inches, is still broken to this day.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Referring to FIG. 7, flat space (7) can be curved (9)
          by a massive body (8) such as a planet. For example, the mass
          of the Earth gives space a negative curvature such that
          objects tend to fall toward the center of the mass (bowl). On
          the other hand, using electromagnetic fields, it is possible
          to produce a positive curvature such that a spacecraft rises
          by falling upward.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Referring to FIG. 8, if the fields are intense enough,
          then a wormhole (12) forms between space (10) and hyperspace
          (11). This depiction is called an embedding diagram because
          there is no open space going through the wormhole. An object
          traversing the wormhole moves along the surface from one
          dimension to another. In order to open the throat (12) of the
          wormhole, negative energy is required. Referring to my patent
          application Dual Potential Hull Spacecraft, negative energy is
          produced by the interaction of a microwave beam with an
          oscillating magnetic H field. In terms of differential forms
          mathematics, this is given as the Hodge Star * of the
          differential d of the wedge product of the magnetic H field
          with the electromagnetic wave {B,E} [mathematical formula -
          see original document]<br>
          which says that there is an increasing rate of change of
          negative energy (-[rho]). Due the presence of negative energy
          together with the spacetime curvature pressure produced by the
          electromagnetic fields, wormholes open up between space and
          hyperspace. There is a positive gravitational potential
          between hyperspace and space because the low density
          hyperspace energy is more dense than the negative energy in
          this dimension. Thus the hyperspace energy flows into our
          dimension which reduces the mass of the spacecraft. The upward
          spacetime pressure stress over the hull due to the
          electromagnetic fields creates a lift force on the nearly
          massless vehicle. Because the hyperspace energy has a speed of
          light equal to one meter per second, the electromagnetic
          fields become relativistically strong since they obey the
          Lorentz transformation. Due to the low mass, high spacetime
          lift pressure and strong EM fields, the vehicle can attain
          very high rates of acceleration.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Another method to produce a wormhole is to use bucking
          magnetic fields which is described in my patent application
          Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator. In gravitation physics,
          the Faraday F tensor, which is a 4*4 spacetime metric
          {t,x,y,z}, contains all the components of the electromagnetic
          fields in the various spatial directions {x,y,z} [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          where contravariant index a refers to the rows, and the
          covariant index [beta] refers to the columns. For example, the
          component F&lt;t&gt; x=Ex is the electric field in the
          x-direction. If there were two magnetic bucking fields in the
          x-direction the Faraday tensor would be [mathematical formula
          - see original document]<br>
          which says that the Faraday tensor is zero. Thus no spacetime
          curvature is generated from two bucking magnetic fields at the
          same position. On the other hand, if the two bucking magnetic
          fields are concentric at different radii, then the Faraday
          tensor becomes [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          which is not zero due to the presence of the Kronecker [delta]
          delta function which locates the fields at different
          positions. The spacetime stress-energy-momentum tensor T is
          then computed from the following equation [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          where g is the metric tensor containing the coefficients of
          the elemental spacetime length ds. With the mass M and charge
          Q term equal to zero, there being just electromagnetic fields
          involved, the g metric tensor in cylindrical coordinates
          becomes [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Referring to FIG. 9, the magnetic vortex generator has
          two concentric, thin, flat cylindrical silicon-iron cores
          (13,14), each consisting of a stack of three 0.020 inch thick
          transformer laminations wrapped with insulating tape. Using
          insulated magnetic wire, a flat helical coil (16) is wrapped
          counter-clockwise around the outer laminations. The coil
          receives power through connection (15). The winding then
          continues around the core until coil (17) where the wire (18)
          is extended to the inner core and the wrapping of coil (19)
          proceeds in the clockwise direction. The inner core wrapping
          terminates on coil (20) with the extension of the second power
          connection (21). Because the coils are wound in opposite
          directions, the generator produces two bucking magnetic fields
          at different radii (22,23).<br>
          <br>
          [0027] According to Maxwell's electromagnetic equations, the
          curl of the magnetic flux density B field times the square of
          the speed of light squared is equal to the rate of change of
          the electric E field [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          Multiplying both sides by the elemental area of the core and
          integrating over the area [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          The curl of the field can be converted into a line integral
          around the core contour using Stokes' Theorem [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The magnetic flux density B field oscillates with
          angular frequency [omega]<br>
          B=B0e&lt;I[omega]t &gt;<br>
          Substituting this into the equation and integrating over time
          for the inner core field [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          This can be solved for the electric E field that is produced
          by the oscillating magnetic flux density B field [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          The electric field for the outer core is the same equation
          except that the opposite sign of the magnetic flux density B
          field and the radius r1 [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          Adding these two fields together is the total electric field E
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The electrostatic energy of the field is equal to half the
          linear capacitance of space times the summation over the
          volume of the dot product of the electric field with itself
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          Because the electric field points in the z-direction out of
          the coil, the dot product is actually the square of the
          electric field.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Referring to FIG. 10, the energy U per volume is
          plotted as a function of time with a radius ratio r1/r0 of
          3/1. As the graph shows, the magnetic vortex wormhole
          generator produces mostly negative energy which is required in
          order to create the wormholes. Because the
          stress-energy-momentum T tensor is also the square of the
          electric field, this graph gives the spacetime curvature
          pressure. Thus the electric field produces both the pressure
          and negative energy required to open up wormholes between
          space and hyperspace.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Going back to the effective potential equation,
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          it can be seen that the first term is divided by the mass of
          the particle. In current gravitation physics, the mass of the
          particle is invariant with velocity. It does not obey the
          Lorentz transformation. The mass is related to the energy E of
          the particle and its momentum p by<br>
          m&lt;2&gt; =E&lt;2&gt; -p&lt;2 &gt;<br>
          In different inertial frames moving with a relative velocity
          v, the energy and the momentum obey the Lorentz
          transformation, but no matter what the relative motion, the
          mass of the particle is constant. In the first term of the
          effective potential, the mass is constant which leaves just
          Planck's constant.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Having worked for over ten years on the subspace
          manifold, known as the tetrahedron diagram, I found a most
          incredible intersection on the diagram when working with the
          water molecule. The water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and
          one oxygen atom as mentioned previously. The atomic weight of
          one atom of hydrogen is 1.008 atomic weight units (awu). The
          atomic weight of oxygen is 16.000 awu. Therefore the molecular
          weight of water is [mathematical formula - see original
          document]<br>
          The gram molecular weight is the atomic weight expressed in
          grams, so there are 18.016 grams in Avogadro's number of
          molecules. So the mass per molecule in logs is [mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Referring to FIG. 11, the tetrahedron diagram plots the
          natural logarithm of mass versus the natural logarithm of
          wavelength. The reason for this is that mass times wavelength
          is equal to Planck's constant divided by the speed of light c,
          known on the diagram as the base constant. At the present time
          there are over 4000 diagrams which are copyrighted in the
          Library of Congress. In logarithms, the product of two numbers
          is the sum of the two numbers. This means that the sum of the
          mass and the wavelength are equal to the base constant which
          has a value of<br>
          ln[m]+ln[[lambda]]=ln[h/c]=-95.91546344=base constant<br>
          Our dimension has a lower limit on mass and length known
          respectively as the Planck mass and the Planck wavelength. The
          Planck mass is the linear mass [Omega] of the universe times
          the Planck scale [Lambda]. The Planck wavelength is
          circumference of a circle of radius Planck scale. In terms of
          logs, the Planck mass and Planck wavelength are<br>
          Planck mass=ln([Omega][Lambda])=-17.64290101<br>
          Planck wavelength=ln(2[pi][Lambda])=-78.27256243<br>
          <br>
          [0033] When these values are plotted on the tetrahedron
          diagram shown in FIG. 11, the Planck box (abcd) is formed
          which are the boundaries of our dimension in subspace. The
          line numbering is as follows<br>

          The energy of the water molecule, circle (37), is equal to the
          sum of the water molecule mass (29) plus the speed of light
          squared circle (30). The energy circle (37) intersects the
          mass of the water molecule (29) at the Planck wavelength (28,
          point e), which is the boundary between space and hyperspace.
          What this means is that the mass is equal to the energy at the
          Planck box boundary. The only way that this is possible is if
          the speed of light c is equal to one meter per second<br>
          E=m c&lt;2&gt; =m c=1 meter/second<br>
          A water molecule traversing a wormhole into hyperspace
          undergoes a change in the speed of light from 299792458 m/s to

          [0034] Planck's constant [Planck over 2pi] is equal to the

          [Planck over 2pi]=[Omega][Lambda][Lambda]c<br>
          By having the speed of light go to 1 m/s, the orbital term in
          the effective potential Veff is reduced by a factor of the
          speed of light squared equal to 9*10&lt;16&gt; . This
          unbalances the equation to such an extent that only the
          Coulomb potential term remains. [mathematical formula - see

          The electron is attracted to the proton nucleus because the
          centrifugal term no longer provides a stable orbit for the
          electron. Thus the atomic binding is destroyed and the water
          molecule becomes soft as putty.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] Referring to FIG. 12, the collision of the electron
          with the proton together with the enormous change in the
          proton's energy causes the proton p to become unstable and
          decay. According to the Standard Model of particle physics,
          the elementary particles are composed of smaller particles
          known as quarks. The six quarks have been named up u, down d,
          strange s, charm c, top t, and bottom b. The subscript on the
          quark indicates one of three colors {red r, blue b, green g).
          As shown in the diagram, the proton is composed of three
          quarks {ur, ug, db}, two of which are up quarks of which one
          is red and the other green, and a third blue down quark. The
          proton p decays into a positron e&lt;+&gt; which is an
          electron with a positive charge, and a neutrally-charged pion
          [pi]&lt;0 &gt; particle through the exchange of an X boson
          particle. The pion has a mass between the electron and the
          proton.<br>

          <br>
          [0036] Referring to FIG. 13, the pion [pi]&lt;0 &gt; then
          decays into a proton p and antiproton {overscore (p)} which
          annihilate each other to produce two photons shown on the
          right by the traveling waves. So the overall energy exchange
          is [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where hv is the energy per gamma photon with frequency v. The
          electron of the hydrogen atom would then annihilate the
          positron for additional photon energy.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] Referring to FIG. 14, the hydrogen H atom is composed
          (38) of the proton and electron as seen in the upper left
          corner. The proton decays (39) into the neutral pion and a
          positron. The electron from the hydrogen atom and this
          positron form one electron pair (40). The pion then decays
          (41) into two gamma photons which produce an electron pair
          production energy cascade into 132 pairs (42,43) for a total
          of 133 electron pairs. These electrons can then be captured
          electrostatically and used for the production of electricity.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] Referring to FIG. 15, the electrons are captured with
          the water droplet injector . The plunger (46) of a
          spring-loaded cylindrical solenoid (44) is attached to a
          tapered piston (47). By means of ring collar and bolts (45),
          the solenoid is bolted to the injector (48). A supply of
          purified water is attached to the water inlet connection (49).
          When the solenoid is activated, it pulls back slightly so that
          water can enter the valve. When the solenoid is deactivated,
          the piston forces the water droplet out through the nozzle
          (50) into a cylindrical glass vacuum chamber (52). Two
          cylindrical glass disks (51) hold the nozzle in place. On the
          other end of the vacuum chamber is the sealed-tube connection
          (56,57,58) to the vacuum pump. In the middle of the vacuum
          chamber, two metal plates (53) are attached through sealed
          glass collars (54) to electrical pins (55). The plates are
          electrostatically-charged with opposite charges so as to form
          a capacitor. This creates an electrical field between the
          plates which attracts the electrons to the positively-charged
          plate.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] Referring to FIG. 16, the vacuum tube and water
          injector (61) are mounted along the centerline of the inner
          (60) and outer (59) magnetic vortex wormhole generator coils.
          The low density hyperspace energy traversing the wormhole
          along the centerline of the coils causes the injected water
          molecules to soften and decay into a cascade of electrons. The
          oscillating electric field along the centerline causes the
          electrons to vibrate back and forth. The crossed electric
          field between the charged capacitor plates causes the
          electrons to flow toward the positively-charge plate in order
          to produce electricity.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Referring to FIG. 17, the vacuum tube is connected to
          the vacuum pump through a hose connection to the pump air
          inlet (64). A 5 Hp electric motor (62) drives dual rotating
          flights of screws which trap the air and move it toward the
          exhaust outlet (65) shown with no muffler. On a spacecraft
          operating in the vacuum of outer space, this component would
          not be needed.<br>

          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0041] It is the object of this invention to generate
          electricity by using low density hyperspace energy to soften
          water molecules such that the atomic binding is broken which
          causes the hydrogen nucleus to decay into a cascade of
          electron pairs. These electrons are then collected on a
          positively-charged plate in order to produce electricity. The
          water molecules are softened by flooding them with low density
          hyperspace energy that is produced by a magnetic vortex
          wormhole generator. The generator creates negative energy and
          a spacetime curvature along the centerline of two concentric
          coils. This combination opens up wormholes along the
          centerline. Because the gravitational potential of low density
          hyperspace energy is greater than the negative energy, the
          hyperspace energy flows through the wormhole from hyperspace
          into our dimension. The hyperspace energy has a speed of light
          equal to one meter/second. This causes a change in Planck's
          constant h such that the proton orbitals of the hydrogen atom
          are unable to produce a centrifugal repulsion which keeps the
          electron in orbit. The Coulomb potential term dominates and
          the electron is attracted to the proton. Due to the vast
          change in the speed of light, and the collision of the
          electron with the proton, the proton becomes unstable and
          decays into a neutral pion and a positron. The pion then
          decays into two gamma photons which produce a large cascade of
          electron pairs.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] A water injector, consisting of a solenoid-activated
          valve and nozzle, injects water droplets into a vacuum chamber
          which is positioned along the centerline of the two concentric
          coils where the wormholes form. Due to the low density
          hyperspace energy passing through the wormholes into our
          dimension, the water molecules soften and decay into electrons
          which are collected on an electrostatically-charged capacitor
          plate having a positive charge located in the glass vacuum
          chamber.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0060] 1. The coils of the magnetic vortex wormhole generator
          are made of three stacks of 0.020 inch silicon-iron
          transformer laminates. These are washed to remove the oil, and
          then wrapped with insulating tape in order to keep the
          laminations together. Using a very long bench made of wooden
          planks and 2*4 sawhorses, the outer coil is wrapped
          counter-clockwise right to left using a large spool of 14 AWG
          magnetic wire. A thin spacer is used between windings in order
          to reduce the winding capacitance. Once the outer coil is
          wound, the wire is continued to the second inner coil which is
          wrapped clockwise, leaving enough wire between coils such that
          when the coils are mounted in the wooden frame, the coil is
          one continuous winding having an input and output connection.
          Using an inductance meter, the inductance of the coil is
          measured. Using a standard frequency of 60 Hz, the capacitance
          of a sheet metal capacitor is calculated such that the
          generator is electromagnetically resonant at this frequency.
          The generator is connected to the line voltage by a 1:1
          isolation transformer which is connected to a small primary
          coil wrapped on a toroidal core whose similar secondary coil
          is connected to the sheet metal capacitor and inductance coil.
          Resonance is achieved by adjusting the spacing and overlap of
          the sheet metal.<br>
          <br>
          [0061] 2. The vacuum chamber is made of a glass tube with
          sufficient wall thickness to withstand the vacuum pressure. A
          number of glass blowing techniques are used to make the
          glass-electrode connection for the capacitor plates. Then
          circular pieces of glass plate are cut out and ground to the
          inside diameter of the tube, fitted with the nozzle and vacuum
          connection, and then heat sealed to the chamber. The chamber
          and water injector are then attached to a wooden bracket
          mounting which is doweled and glued to the wooden frame of the
          generator.<br>
