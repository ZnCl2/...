      A spacecraft propulsion system utilizing photon particles to
      create negative energy over the hull in order to generate a lift
      force on the hull <br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention is a spacecraft propulsion system that
      employs photon particles to generate a field of negative energy in
      order to produce lift on the hull.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Referring to FIG. 1, an electromagnetic wave traveling in
      the z-direction consists of an electric E field vibrating in the
      x-direction and a magnetic flux density B field vibrating at right
      angles in the horizontal y-direction. The energy-stress-momentum
      of this photon can be analyzed using Einstein's General Theory of
      Relativity and the Faraday F tensor. The Faraday tensor is a 4*4
      matrix containing the electromagnetic wave components as shown
      here in general where c is the speed of light [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      For this particular photon, this tensor is [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The elemental spacetime length ds squared is equal to sum
      of the squares of the Cartesian elemental lengths<br>
      (ds)&lt;2&gt; =-(dt)&lt;2&gt; +(dx)&lt;2&gt; +(dy)&lt;2&gt;
      +(dz)&lt;2&gt;<br>
      The coefficients of this equation, {-1,1,1,1} are the diagonal
      components of the g metric tensor [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      The stress-energy-momentum tensor T can then be calculated for the
      photon using the Faraday tensor and the g metric tensor in the
      following equation from gravitation physics [mathematical formula
      - see original document]<br>
      The stress-energy-momentum tensor indicates the curvature of space
      due to the application of electromagnetic fields, mass, angular
      momentum and charge. The mass of the Earth, for example, generates
      a negative curvature of spacetime such that objects fall toward
      the mass. The T tensor, which is also a 4*4 matrix, contains the
      momentum or flux terms in the first row and first column. The
      normal pressure stress is located along the diagonal. The shearing
      stresses are located off the diagonal. The energy term is in the
      upper left corner as depicted here, [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Since B&lt;2&gt; =E&lt;2&gt; /c&lt;2&gt; , the
      stress-energy-momentum tensor for the photon is therefore
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      This remarkable result shows that the photon is actually a
      negative energy particle (top left corner) which is pushed along
      by a positive pressure wave (lower right corner). The particle has
      a positive flux (upper right corner) in the z-direction, as well
      as a balancing negative flux in the lower left corner so that the
      overall momentum of the universe remains the same. All four
      components cancel and we see the photon as a massless particle
      moving at the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Thus the key idea behind this invention is that it is
      possible to cancel out the pressure term and leave a stationary
      vibrating electromagnetic field of negative energy over the hull
      of the spacecraft. The importance of negative energy is that it is
      a prerequisite to generating wormholes between space and
      hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hyperspace consists of the those co-dimensions which have
      different physics constants such as a low speed of light. The
      existence of hyperspace, which has a white misty look, is not a
      well-known scientific concept. Experiments with our magnetic
      vortex wormhole generators, hyperspace torque generator, full body
      levitation using Chi Kung breathing, arm levitation by spinning
      the co-gravitational K field, full body teleportation through
      hyperspace a distance of 100 meters using a pulsed gravitational
      wave, jumping into hyperspace, having a plate of toast enfold off
      the breakfast table and disappear into thin air, walking through
      walls and doors out-of-dimension, looking into other dimensions,
      remote viewing through subspace to distances of 100,000 light
      years, and other electromagnetic experiments carried out by
      co-researchers, have shown us the reality and existence of
      hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Referring to FIG. 2, the spacecraft consists of an upper
      (1) and lower (2) hull attached by ceramic insulators to a
      circular ring (3). The ring provides support and is attached to an
      outer sharp-edged rim which is electrostatically charged to a
      potential -V. The purpose of the charged rim is to generate a
      radial electric E field around the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Referring to FIG. 3, the radius of the ring (4) is equal to
      a. The distance from a point on the ring to the z-axis is r. The
      potential on the z-axis is therefore the charge divided by the
      distance, [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      This potential is expanded as a series in terms of inverse radius
      r [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      The potential outside the ring can be written in terms of the
      Legendre polynomials P [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      where s is the number of terms in the expansion. By equating the
      known particular solution potZout on the z-axis with the general
      Vout solution, the coefficients A[n] are found to be [mathematical
      formula - see original document][mathematical formula - see
      original document][mathematical formula - see original
      document][mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which are substituted back into the Vout equation to get the
      potential outside the ring.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Referring to FIG. 4, the potential (dotted lines 6) looking
      at a slice through the ring (5) is shown together with the
      electric E field. The negative gradient of the potential is the
      electric field (7) shown by the direction of the arrows. The
      importance of this diagram is that the electric field points in
      the radial direction toward the negatively charged ring. The force
      on an electron is the electron charge times the electric field<br>
      F=qeEr=-qe(-Er)=+F<br>
      Because the electron charge is negative and the radial field
      points in the negative direction toward the ring, the force on the
      electron is positive. Thus the electron moves away from the ring
      in the positive radial direction. A 3-dimensional plot of the ring
      (8) and the electric field (9) is shown in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The stress-energy-momentum generated by a radial electric
      field is calculated using the Faraday F tensor [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      The g metric tensor has to be given in spherical coordinates
      {r,[theta],[phi]} [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where [theta] is the angle from the vertical to the radius r. The
      stress tensor T&lt;rr &gt; along the radial direction is
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which shows that the pressure is negative along the radial line
      equal to the square of the radial electric field divided by the
      square of the speed of light. Because the field is squared, it
      doesn't matter that the electric field points in the negative
      direction. The square makes it positive, but the overall curvature
      pressure is negative. Thus this negative pressure cancels out the
      positive pressure propelling the photon along. The second key idea
      of the invention is how to generate this photon moving in the
      radial direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It has been known for a long time in physics that an
      electron moving in a circular path will emit photons in a process
      known by the German word Bremsstrahlung which is translated as
      "breaking radiation." There are several types of radiation such as
      classical Bremsstrahlung involving a charged particle making a
      collision with another charged or uncharged particle in which
      photons are emitted. The quantum mechanical Bremsstrahlung
      involves the sudden appearance or disappearance of a charged
      particle which also emits radiation. In space, having a field of
      wormholes in which the electrons are spiraling down into
      hyperspace would result in the emission of photons by the quantum
      mechanical method. Also, in the atmosphere, having collisions with
      air molecules results in emission of photons in the classical way.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In order to get the electrons to spiral around and emit
      photons, a crossed electromagnetic field is used as shown by the
      following equation<br>
      F=q(Er+vr*B[theta])<br>
      where the velocity v is in the positive radial direction due to
      the force of the electric field. The velocity crossed with a
      magnetic flux density B field in the [theta]-direction makes the
      electron move sideways back and forth in a wiggling motion.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Referring to FIG. 6, a direct current solenoid (10),
      represented by multiple current loops, running vertically through
      the center of the hull, generates a magnetic field that curves
      around the outside of the hull, as shown by contour lines (12).
      The north pole (11) is at the bottom of the hull. A radial arrow
      (13) from the electrostatically-charged rim is perpendicular to
      the magnetic field lines. The cross product in the force equation
      becomes the electron radial velocity times the magnetic field vr
      B[theta].<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Referring to FIG. 7, the electric field is in the
      y-direction and the magnetic field is in the z-direction. The flat
      looping path in the x-direction is the motion of the electron. The
      electron, which has a negative charge, starts to move in the
      direction opposite to that of the electric field. In this
      particular diagram, the electron acquires a velocity in the
      negative y-direction. Then a sideways force in the x-direction is
      produced due to the cross product of the velocity with the
      magnetic field times the negative charge<br>
      -q(-vy*Bz)=+Fx<br>
      Depending on the magnitude of the velocity, various size loops can
      be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In terms of the hull coordinates, because the flat loop is
      in the plane of the electric field which points in the radial
      direction, the electron emits light in the radial direction. This
      condition means that the negative radial pressure created by the
      electric field cancels the radial pressure of the photon. Thus the
      photon becomes a stationary vibrating quantum of negative energy.
      This has the appearance of a luminescent light source. The stress
      tensor for this condition is therefore [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      residual negative energy<br>
      which leaves a residual negative energy per photon.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Referring to FIG. 8, the negatively charged rim (14)
      produces a radial electric field (16) that crosses the magnetic B
      field (15) of the solenoid. Electrons emitted by the charged rim
      then encounter this crossed field which makes them spiral (17)
      around the hull. Because of the tight loop, the electron emits
      Bremsstahlung radiation in the radial direction (18). The positive
      pressure field of the photon, which is directed in the radial
      direction, is canceled by the negative pressure field (19) created
      by the electric field. Because the photon energy is negative, a
      stationary vibrating electromagnetic quantum of negative energy
      (20) surrounds the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] This negative energy and the pressure stress created by the
      electromagnetic fields open up wormholes between space and
      hyperspace. The potential head is positive from hyperspace into
      space because the energy of hyperspace is more positive than the
      negative energy field. The low-density hyperspace energy fills the
      hull and its surrounding space with a white misty hyperspace
      energy which makes the spacecraft lighter in mass, and therefore
      lighter in weight within a gravitational field. The actual physics
      is more complicated still because the electrons find that the
      resistance of hyperspace is lower than the resistance of space.
      Thus they spiral down the wormholes which results in a sudden
      disappearance of charge. The quantum mechanical effect of this is
      to radiate even more photons which in turn produce even more
      negative energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The lift on the hull is generated by the radial electric
      field. In cylindrical coordinates, the g metric tensor is
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Using this metric tensor, the pressure stress in the vertical
      direction T&lt;zz &gt; is [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      which is a positive curvature over the hull. The mass of Earth
      produces a negative curvature in which objects fall toward the
      mass. By counteracting this negative curvature with a more than
      positive curvature, lift is developed on the spacecraft. Because
      the negative energy lowers the effective mass of the vehicle, the
      acceleration is large with a modest electric field. Moreover, in
      our dimension, the speed of light is 299792458 meters per second.
      Hyperspace energy has a speed of light equal to one meter per
      second. Thus the stress is amplified by a factor of [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      Because electromagnetic fields are relativistic, motion in a
      low-velocity-of-light energy field amplifies their strength.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] It is the object of this invention to create a spacecraft
      propulsion system that produces wormholes between space and
      hyperspace using negative energy in order to generate lift on the
      hull. It was discovered in the Riemannian curvature calculations
      of gravitation physics that negative energy is required to keep
      open the throat of the wormhole. From experiments with the
      magnetic vortex wormhole generator, it is known that the proper
      combination of electromagnetic fields, together with this negative
      energy, can create a wormhole through which smoke can be blown
      into hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Referring to FIG. 9, the directions of force, velocity, and
      electromagnetic fields are referred to in the cylindrical
      coordinate system {r,[theta],z}. An electrostatically charged
      sharp-edged ring in the [theta]-direction around the hull of the
      spacecraft produces a radial electric field. A vertical solenoid
      in the z-direction through the center of the hull produces a
      magnetic field which is perpendicular at the rim to the electric
      field. With the current in the solenoid flowing in the clockwise
      (-[theta]) direction, using the right-hand rule, the magnetic
      field points in the upward z-direction outside the rim. Because
      the rim is charged to a negative voltage, the electric field
      points toward the hull in the negative radial (-r) direction.
      Electrons emitted by the rim travel outward (+v) because the
      charge on the electron is negative which, together with the
      negative electric field, produces a positive radial force. The
      radial force on the electron causes it to acquire a velocity which
      interacts with the magnetic field. The cross product of the
      velocity (+v) with the positive (+B) magnetic field produces a
      sideways force on the electron in the negative [theta]-direction.
      However, because the charge on the electron is negative, the force
      is<br>
      F=-q{vr0,0}*{0,0,Bz}={0,qBzvr,0}<br>
      which is positive in the [theta]-direction. It is this sideways
      force that produces a flat spiraling or looping motion whereby the
      electron emits photons, known in German as Bremsstahlung
      radiation, in the radial direction. The photon, which is actually
      a quantum of negative energy, has a positive radial pressure which
      propels it along. Because the radial electric field produces a
      negative pressure in the radial direction, the two opposite fields
      cancel in the radial direction to form a residual stationary
      vibrating negative energy. Thus the hull becomes surrounded by
      negative energy which, together with the pressure stresses created
      by the electric field, generates wormholes between space and
      hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The gravitational potential between hyperspace and space is
      positive because the hyperspace energy is more positive than the
      negative energy around the hull. Thus the low-density,
      low-speed-of-light hyperspace energy flows through the wormhole
      and fills the hull. This has the effect of reducing the effective
      mass of the hull. Because the electric field generates a positive
      pressure over the hull in the vertical z-direction, there is an
      upward force on the vehicle due to the pressure times the hull
      area. Since the vehicle has a low mass, there is a modest upward
      acceleration on the spacecraft equal to the force divided by mass.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. The hull is made from a single sheet of aluminum which has been
      stretched to its yield point by hydraulic cylinders. An upper and
      lower die is CNC machined to the profile of the hull. The soft
      sheet is then clamped in the die where it takes on the smooth
      shape of the hull without any wrinkles. The hull is extremely
      rigid after forming and does not require any structural
      reinforcements.<br>
      <br>
      2. A section of the aluminum ring is made in a 3D computer
      graphics program. The model is stored as a stereolithography file
      (*.stl). The computer model is then sent via Internet e-mail to
      the stl server who prints the part in an ultraviolet light-cured
      polymer. The part is returned the next day by Express Mail. Using
      a rubber blanket mold to create several ring sections, the entire
      ring is assembled together in another wooden mold box having thin
      circular laminate-coated particulate wall boards on either side of
      the ring. Then a liquid rubber mold is poured on top of the ring
      and allowed to harden overnight at room temperature. Since the
      rubber mold is flexible, the ring can be extracted fairly easily.
      This ring model is then sent to the foundry where it is cast in
      aluminum using the lost wax process in which a wax mold evaporates
      out of the sand casting. We are also experimenting with
      non-magnetic copper casting metals containing beryllium having
      good conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      3. A 11.5 cm plastic pipe is mounted on a rotating fixture driven
      slowly by a microcontoller, stepper motor, and power electronics
      board. Using a large diameter insulated wire, such as a 17 AWG
      with a wire diameter of 0.127 cm, the wire is wound slowly on the
      pipe and expoxied so that the windings don't come loose. The
      solenoid is then mounted vertically in the hull supported by the
      support ring and driven by a current generator located nearby on
      the test rig.<br>
      <br>
      4. The ring is driven by a high voltage electrostatic generator
      similar to the night vision scope high voltage power supplies. The
      ring charge is isolated from the hull by ceramic insulators.<br>
