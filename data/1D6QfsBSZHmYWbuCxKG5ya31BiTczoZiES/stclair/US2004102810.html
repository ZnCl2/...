          <b> </b>A hyperspace torque generator which comprises a flat
          bifilar magnetic bucking field electrical coil, crystal ball,
          lever arm and frequency generator for producing a linear flow
          of hyperspace energy at right angles to a rotating flow of
          astral chakra energy.<b><br>
            <br>
            BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0001] This invention generates a body torque using a
          crystal ball mounted on a cylindrical stand above a bifilar
          electrical coil. The coil is driven by a ten-volt sine wave
          frequency generator. The bipolar rotating hand chakras are
          placed across the ball in order to condense the astral energy
          of the aura. The magnetic bucking field of the coil flows low
          density hyperspace energy up through the ball. The torque
          generated is equal to the lever arm times the linear momentum
          of the hyperspace energy crossed with the angular velocity of
          the hand chakras. The device is used to demonstrate the
          existence of co-dimensional hyperspace energy and to show the
          nature of the human hyperspace energy being.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0002] A human being is a hyperspace energy being residing
          in a physical body. Our energy is located in astral space has
          which has a very low velocity of light. In our
          four-dimensional spacetime universe where the physical body is
          located, the speed of light is enormous, equal to 299792458
          meters per second. In astral space, on the other hand, the
          speed of light is much lower, resulting in a low density (0.03
          to 0.07 kg) energy being that has the ability to move through
          solid concrete walls as well as interpenetrate the watery
          human body and control its movements.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] This interpenetration takes the form of energy vortices
          that funnel energy into several co-dimensions of astral space.
          Over the lifetime of the individual, this energy creates the
          aura of the human astral being. The aura, in turn, provides
          protection for the organs of the body. As shown in FIG. 1, the
          human body has seven major vortices, known as chakras, located
          along the length of the body in addition to a vortex in each
          hand. The chakras are (A) the crown or top chakra through
          which energy (information) can be channeled from other energy
          beings, (B) the spiritual eye which allows us to see when out
          of the physical body, (C) the throat chakra which allows
          verbal communication with other beings, (D) the heart chakra
          which protects the cardiovascular system, (E) abdomen chakra
          which protects the digestive system, (F) the soul chakra which
          is related to the creation of newborn astral entities during
          fertilization, and (G) the ground chakra which grounds the
          energy system to earth, similar to an electrical ground. The
          soul is actually an orange-colored plasma energy ball which
          acts as a battery for the body when the astral being is out of
          body. It is located behind the soul chakra.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] There is a vortex in each hand (H). This vortex can be
          readily observed by placing the right hand face up on a table.
          The left hand holds a pendulum over the palm of the right
          hand. The pendulum will start to rotate counter-clockwise over
          the right hand. Over the left hand, the vortex rotates
          clockwise. They rotate in opposite directions. Placing the
          hands together in the prayer position then creates a rotating
          cylindrical flow of energy between the hands as shown in FIG.
          2. The energy (C) flows out of the right hand (B) in a
          counterclockwise motion (D) and enters the left hand (A).<br>
          <br>
          [0005] As seen in FIG. 3, the astral energy (A) is rotating,
          according to the right-hand rule of physics, with the fingers
          pointing in the direction of the arrow and the thumb pointing
          to the left. Thus the angular momentum vector (C) points to
          the left.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Physicist John A. Wheeler of Princeton University has
          made it clear that there is a second term in Newton's
          gravitational formula as seen below:<br>
          F=-mg+m(v*[Omega])<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The downward force F or weight of the body is equal to
          the mass (m) of the body times the acceleration of gravity
          (g). If the body is rotating, the force is either more or less
          depending on the direction of the angular velocity ([Omega])
          which is crossed with the linear velocity v of the mass. As an
          example of this, notice that basketball player Michael Jordan
          is able to float more than the other players. As he moves down
          the court and jumps with the ball in his hands, he accelerates
          the chakra energy between the hands and resonates the energy
          inside the spherical ball. His forward velocity then becomes
          crossed with the rotating chakra energy which provides him
          sufficient extra lift to out jump his opponents. It was also
          learned that Jordan clears out the locker room just before a
          game and meditates. This allows him time to concentrate on
          increasing the spin of his chakra energy.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Experimentation with flat bifilar magnetic bucking
          coils has shown that this type of coil can create a flow of
          low density hyperspace energy up through the center of the
          coil. This creates a linear momentum of hyperspace energy
          which is in the second term of the equation. Crossing this
          linear momentum with the angular momentum of the hand chakras
          located a lever arm above the coil in a crystal ball produces
          the hyperspace torque.<br>
          <b><br>
            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0009] It is the object of this invention to produce a
          body torque using a crystal ball mounted on a fixed lever arm
          above a flat bifilar magnetic field bucking coil. The coil
          creates a small wormhole into hyperspace which allows low
          density and hence low velocity speed of light hyperspace
          energy to enter into our four-dimensional spacetime universe.
          By placing the hands on either side of the ball, rotating
          astral energy flows from the right-hand chakra to the
          left-hand chakra. The linear momentum of the hyperspace energy
          crossed with the angular momentum of the astral energy times
          the lever arm offset above the coil generates an oscillating
          body torque. If the crystal ball is placed on the coil, no
          torque is generated because the lever arm is zero. Because the
          oscillation occurs in both space and hyperspace, the torque
          oscillates for nine seconds and then stops oscillating for the
          same period, whereupon it continues in this periodic fashion.<br>

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0015] The hyperspace torque generator is shown in FIG. 4.
          A circular bifilar coil (A) and wooden board form the base of
          the unit with a crystal ball (B) mounted on a lever arm (C)
          attached to the center of the base. The bifilar coil is made
          by taking a length of insulated wire and then doubling it in
          half. Starting near the center of the base, the two wires of
          the coil are wound together in a circular manner on the flat
          base and then glued to the wooden base. The double wire on the
          inside is brought out from the center of the coil, with one
          side serving as one lead to the frequency generator (D). The
          other inner wire is connected to a wire on the outside so that
          the electricity flows in the opposite direction in each
          succeeding coil. Due to Maxwell's law, this creates a magnetic
          bucking field down the center of the coil which opens up
          hyperspace and allows energy to flow into our dimension. This
          energy can actually be felt as it rises through the feet. The
          remaining length of wire on the outer wrap forms the second
          terminal for the frequency generator. Both these wires are fed
          to the frequency generator (E).<br>
          <br>
          [0016] FIG. 5 shows a close-up of the hand chakra energy (A)
          flowing between the hands through the crystal ball. In this
          configuration, the body rocks forward and backward in an
          oscillating manner for nine seconds. If the hands are rotated
          ninety degrees such that one hand is on the outside of the
          ball and the other is on the inside of the ball, the body
          rocks sideways left and right according to the right hand rule
          of physics.<br>
