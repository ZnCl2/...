        <big><b> </b><b>Abstract: </b>A Chi energy amplifier that
          utilizes a co-gravitational K field to generate a flow of
          hyperspace energy into or out of a ceramic dome containing a
          slot antenna.<br>
          <b><br>
            BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0001] This invention is an energy amplifier that controls
          the direction of the second co-gravitational K field by means
          of a slot antenna located in a resonating sphere. The
          hyperspace mass flow rate entering into this dimension is
          determined by the frequency of the antenna. This energy flow
          is used to increase the energy of the human energy field known
          as Chi.<br>
          <b><br>
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0002] Referring to FIG. 1, a pendulum suspended by a
          string (3) is held by the string with the right hand (1) over
          the upright palm of the left hand (2). The pendulum swings in
          circles shown by the clockwise direction of the arrow (4). The
          pendulum swings at a constant frequency at about 1 to 2 Hz.
          What this means is that there is a second gravitational K
          field (5) that can cause a mass to rotate in circles.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Everyone is familiar with the linear gravitational g
          field which is defined as Newton's gravitational constant G
          times the mass of the earth divided by the square of the
          radius of the earth. This is the field that causes objects to
          accelerate radially toward the earth's surface. Newton's
          gravitational constant G is equal to the speed of light c
          squared divided by the linear mass [Omega] of the universe.
          The speed of light is<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          The mass and radius of the earth are<br>
          <br>
          [0004] [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0005] From electromagnetism, the electric E field is linear
          and the B magnetic field is circular or forms closed loops.
          The electric field starts and ends on electric charges. Since
          there are two electromagnetic fields, it makes sense that
          there are also two gravitational fields. A flow of electric
          current through a straight wire causes a circular magnetic B
          field to form around the wire. In a similar manner, a flow of
          mass through a channel causes a circular gravitational K field
          to form around the channel.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Referring to FIG. 2, the right hand rule (6) shows that
          if the flow is along the direction of the thumb of the right
          hand, then the field curls around in the direction of the
          fingers. If an electric current is flowing through the wire
          (7) in the direction of arrow (8), then a counter-clockwise
          magnetic field circles the wire shown by arrow (9). In the
          bottom view, a mass flowing through a channel (10) in
          direction (11) generates a counter-clockwise gravitational K
          field shown by arrow (12). This field is the reason that the
          pendulum swings in circles. The gravitational K field only
          exists if there is a mass flow. In the wire there is also an
          electric field driving the electrons, so it must be that there
          is a g gravitational field driving the mass along the channel.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The correspondence between electromagnetic and
          gravitational constants must be the following:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Electric&nbsp; Gravitational<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Charge q&nbsp; Mass m<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Electric Field E&nbsp; Gravitational Field g<br>

          &nbsp; Permeability of Space [mu]0&nbsp; -4[pi]G/c&lt;2&gt;<br>

          &nbsp; Convection Current Density J&nbsp; Mass Current Density
          J<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Maxwell's equation for the curl or circulation of B
          involves the current density J and an electric field E
          changing with time t<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          The corresponding gravitational equation is therefore<br>
          <br>
          [0009] [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0010] If the g field is constant with time, then the
          circulation of the K field only depends on the mass density
          flow through the channel. Notice the minus sign in front of
          the first term which says that if energy is entering our
          dimension through a channel, then the K field is in the
          counterclockwise direction as indicated by the pendulum. As
          seen in FIG. 1, the energy is leaving through the left hand
          because the rotation is clockwise. On the right hand, the
          pendulum rotates in the counterclockwise direction indicating
          that energy is coming from the hand. Thus there is a flow of
          energy between the hands known as the Chi energy. The purpose
          of this invention is to amplify this energy.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The g gravitational field is due to a negative
          space-time curvature created by the mass of the earth. In many
          physics books this is depicted as a bowl. So the idea was to
          acquire a ceramic kiln which could produce ceramic bowls using
          earthenware clay and a bowl mold. The curvature created by the
          bowl, if any, could be detected by the pendulum.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Referring to FIG. 3, a pendulum (13) held in the right
          hand with the left hand near the side of the concave mold (14)
          starts to swing toward the right, away from the plaster mold
          as shown by arrow (15).<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Referring to FIG. 4, a pendulum (16) held in the right
          hand over a positive curvature dome (17) swings toward the top
          of the dome as shown by arrow (18). Supposedly the K
          gravitational field rotates in circles, but these experiments
          showed that the pendulum movement was radial.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Referring to FIG. 5, the pendulum (19) swings radially
          (20) toward the top of the dome (23) because the forces (24)
          around the dome counteract each other as shown by arrows (21,
          22). Thus there is no sideways pressure on the pendulum.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] The next question was what is the value of the
          co-gravitational K constant? In electromagnetism the electric
          field is the speed of light times the magnetic field. So the g
          gravitational field should be the speed of light times the
          co-gravitational K field.<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document][mathematical
          formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0016] where the radius RU of the universe is 10&lt;26 &gt;
          meters and c is the speed of light. The speed of light divided
          by the radius is angular frequency measured in Hz. Recall that
          the pendulum over the hand has a frequency f of 1 Hz which
          makes the angular frequency o equal to 2[pi] radians per
          second since [omega]=2[pi]f So the question is whether or not
          this value of K means anything in terms of hyperspace physics?<br>
          <br>
          [0017] The universe has a geometrical sub-manifold based on
          the tetrahedron. All the physics constants of the universe are
          determined by this tetrahedral geometry. As shown in diagram
          tet0565 stored in the Library of Congress, the electron and
          proton are one and the same particle. There is a continuous
          clockwise path from the electron wavelength, through electric
          charge to electron mass and returning out-of-dimension back
          along a counterclockwise path as the proton. Because the paths
          are in opposite directions, the proton has a positive charge
          and the electron has the opposite negative charge. Because
          this path crosses into our dimension from hyperspace, we see
          two different particles. Thus Nature only has one particle.
          The tetrahedron diagram also shows that our dimension is
          offset from the origin of the diagram by the Cabibbo angle
          which is found in particle physics. Our dimension is
          determined by the Planck mass and the Planck wavelength which
          are the bottom limits of our dimension, known as the Planck
          box. If the proton mass is centered on the Planck mass, a
          tangent line to the circle can only be made by using the down
          quark and up quark which comprise the proton (duu). And the
          tangent line is drawn at the Cabibbo angle. So the diagram
          verifies some important experimental physics data.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Referring to FIG. 6, the tetrahedron diagram is drawn
          with a vertical axis (35) corresponding to the natural
          logarithm of mass. The horizontal axis (36) is the natural
          logarithm of wavelength. The inverted tetrahedrons (25, 26)
          cross at the centerline (28) which is known through remote
          viewing as "the merging of two worlds." The centerline is the
          separation point between space and hyperspace. The
          circumscribing sphere (27) has a horizontal diameter (29) and
          a vertical diameter (30). The electron wavelength (34)
          reflects off the sphere and returns as the electron mass (33).<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Because the K co-gravitational field is related to
          circular or spinning motion, as well as vorticity per area, it
          might be imagined that it has something to do with the
          spinning electron. The energy E of the electron is equal to
          the mass me of the electron times the speed of light c
          squared.<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0020] The tips of the inverted tetrahedrons pass through the
          base constant, vertical line (37), which is equal to Planck's
          constant h divided by the speed of light.<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          <br>
          [0021] On the tetrahedron diagram, the co-gravitational circle
          K (31) is centered on the base (37) at the electron energy
          (32) shown by the small [pi] circle at the intersection (38).
          As can be seen, the K circle determines the electron mass (33)
          at the horizontal axis (36) as shown by intersection (39).
          Because the electron is the proton, it also sets the constants
          of the proton such as wavelength, charge and mass. Thus the K
          co-gravitational field determines our elementary particles.
          Because these particle paths go in and out of dimension, it
          means that hyperspace exists. And because the K field is
          circular, depending on the direction of the energy flow,
          another purpose of this invention is to control the direction
          of the field.<br>
          <b><br>
            SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0022] Referring to FIG. 7, the Chi energy amplifier
          consists of two ceramic domes (40, 41) resting one on the
          other such as to form a hollow internal clam-like structure.
          The domes are mounted on a cylindrical ceramic base (42)
          containing a reinforced passageway for the coaxial cable and
          BNC connector (43). The BNC connector plugs into the frequency
          generator (not shown) which has a frequency range of 0.4 Hz to
          5 MHz.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] Referring to FIG. 8 with the upper dome removed, the
          coaxial cable (44) extends vertically through the base into
          the lower dome. The cable is soldered to a slot antenna (45).
          The center conductor of the cable is soldered to the left side
          of the slot and the ground shielding is soldered to the right
          side of the slot. Thus there is a voltage difference on the
          two sides which produces an oscillating electric field across
          the slot which radiates electromagnetic energy into the hollow
          dome.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] A close-up of the slot antenna is shown in FIG. 9. The
          antenna is a 0.050'' thick copper sheet (46) with a width of
          [3/4] wavelength by a height of [1/2] wavelength. A slot (47)
          of [1/2] wavelength is electric-discharge machined into the
          copper sheet (47). The center conductor (48) from the coaxial
          cable is soldered to the top of the slot. The ground wire (49)
          is soldered to the bottom of the slot. This configuration
          produces a voltage difference between the inner top and bottom
          surfaces of the slot. The frequency generator produces an
          oscillating voltage across the slot which generates an
          electric field that radiates from the antenna into the ceramic
          cavity.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] The wavelength of the antenna and the dimensions of the
          ceramic cavity have to be tuned to the geometry of our
          dimension. Newton's gravitational constant G is equal to<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          The frequency of the antenna is the inverse of the
          gravitational constant. The reason for this is that when a
          circle of radius natural logarithm G is centered on the proton
          on the tetrahedron diagram, the circle intersects the corner
          of the Planck box which bounds our dimension between space and
          hyperspace. It is the low-density hyperspace energy that the
          amplifier will bring into this dimension.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The size of the ceramic cavity based on the angular
          frequency [omega]=2[pi]f is<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          where b is inside radius of the cavity, a is the radius of an
          object at the center of the cavity and c is the speed of
          light. Using the object radius as a=0.020 meter to account for
          the antenna, the inside radius of the cavity is b=4.25 inches
          which is the size of the 8.5 inch diameter ceramic dome using
          [1/4] inch thick clay. The frequency is then equal to<br>
          [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
          which is close to the inverse of the gravitational constant G
          of -23.43. Thus the amplifier is tuned to the gravitational
          constant of the universe both in size of the cavity and the
          frequency of the slot antenna. Using a SMD surface mount
          capacitor and inductor in the picofarad and nanohenry range,
          it is possible to get up to this high frequency, but it was
          found that it was not necessary because the amplifier works at
          lower frequencies that are pulsed.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] Referring to FIG. 10, the swinging movement of the
          pendulum measured in inches at the side of the dome is plotted
          against a range of frequencies from 20 kHz to 120 kHz. At 20
          kHz, the pendulum swings [3/4] inch away from the dome. Then
          at 40 kHz, the pendulum swings [3/4] inch toward the dome.
          This pattern is repeated until 120 kHz. What this means is
          that the amplifier can control the direction of the
          co-gravitational field using frequency. The tetrahedron
          diagram shows that this phenomenon is related to the two axes
          of the circumscribing sphere of the tetrahedron.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Referring to FIG. 11, the swinging of the pendulum is
          plotted for a range of frequencies from 1 MHz to 5 MHz. At a
          frequency of 2.78 MHz the pendulum was swinging strongly from
          the vertical to the horizontal, a distance of six inches. On
          the tetrahedron diagram, the distance from our base constant
          to the centerline between inverted tetrahedrons is equal to
          14.838168. This corresponds to a frequency of<br>
          f=e&lt;14.838168&gt; *Hz=2.780574169 MHz<br>
          which is close to the experimental value.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Referring to FIG. 12, the Chi energy flowing between
          the hands, shown by the arrows, is amplified by placing the
          hands across the dome. This energy from the right hand mixes
          with the hyperspace energy entering the dome from hyperspace.
          The combined energy is then absorbed in the left hand vortex.
          The effects of this amplified energy are simply amazing and
          have to be experienced to appreciate what it means.<br>

            DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
            <br>
          </b>[0042] The dome of the amplifier is made of red
          earthenware clay from Minnesota having a cone 06 kiln firing
          temperature of 1828[deg.] F. over a period of 7.5 hours. The
          clay is placed between two hardwood [1/4] inch thick slats. It
          is then rolled flat with a rolling pin. The sheet of clay is
          cut in half and one half is placed in a 9-inch diameter bowl
          mold using a soft sponge to push it into position. The second
          half is then added to the first with the seam between worked
          flat with a metal kidney and elephant ear sponge. The top of
          the mold is scrapped flat to create the bowl shape. The moist
          clay is left to dry for one day after which it falls out of
          the mold due to shrinkage. After completely drying, the dome
          is then placed in a kiln which runs the computer-controlled
          cone 06 temperature firing profile. A preheat at 180[deg.] F.
          for one hour is required to make sure the dome is completely
          bone dry. It takes 7 to 8 hours to fire the dome with another
          12 hours to cool down naturally.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] The base is also made of [1/4] inch clay. A circular
          shape is cut out and fitted with a ribbon of extruded clay
          from a clay gun to make the cylindrical wall. Using a hole
          cutter made of hollow tubing, a hole is made in the side of
          the base for the coaxial cable. The second lower dome has a
          hole cut in the bottom when the clay is leather hard.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] A 0.050'' thick copper sheet is EDM machined to cut a
          half wavelength slot in the copper. The inner conductor of the
          coaxial cable is soldered using silver epoxy to the one side
          of the slot. The ground shielding of the cable is silver
          epoxied to the other side of the slot. The other end of the
          coaxial cable has a BNC connector which plugs into the
          frequency generator.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] The pendulum is made out of soft brass rod and machined
          on a lathe into a plumb bob shape. A hole is drilled in the
          stem to hold the 6'' long string.<br>
