      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention is a system that teleports a human being
      through hyperspace from one location to another using a pulsed
      gravitational wave traveling through hyperspace.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The basis for this invention is an event, referring to FIG.
      1, occurring on May 2, 2004, in which the inventor ("he")
      personally experienced a full-body teleportation while walking to
      the bus stop (A) along a road (B) that runs perpendicular to the
      nearby commercial airport runways where planes are landing. There
      is a wide iron grating (D) for water drainage that crosses the
      road at the center of the bus stop. The grating width is such that
      one has to make a concerted effort to jump across it in order to
      get from one side to the other. Approximately 50 meters from the
      iron grating, he (E) felt a vertical wave (F), similar to a flag
      waving in the breeze, traveling down the street toward the bus
      stop. The wave velocity was about 1 meter per second, which was
      slightly faster than his walking speed. In the next instance, he
      (G) found himself down the street near the corner of the next
      block. Realizing that he had passed the bus stop, he turned around
      to see the iron grating approximately 50 meters up the street in
      back of him. Because there was no recollection of having jumped
      across the iron grating nor of having passed the bus stop's yellow
      marker line, he realized that he had been teleported a distance of
      100 meters while moving along with the traveling wave. It was
      obvious that the wave was pulsed because the front edge overtook
      the inventor, moved with him momentarily, and then the back edge
      of wave left him as it moved on down the street. While
      contemplating this sequence of events, he then looked up and saw
      in a span of a few seconds a twin-turboprop airplane (C) in the
      distance crossing above the road while making a shallow descent in
      order to land at the airport.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It took a number of days in order to understand this
      sequence of events. The explanation involves knowledge of a wide
      range of subjects such as gravitation physics, hyperspace physics,
      wormhole electromagnetic theory and experimentation, quantum
      physics, and the nature of the human energy field.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is obvious from the above scenario that the airplane
      momentarily crossing perpendicular to the road generates the
      aforementioned pulse. Because the airplane has an engine on each
      wing, there are two propellers which conceivably are rotating
      out-of-phase with each other. That is, the blade of one propeller
      could be pointing up and the equivalent blade on the other engine
      could be pointing in a slightly different direction. Notice that
      the tip of the blade traces out a helix as the plane is landing.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In gravitation physics, referring to FIG. 2, it is known
      that two masses of mass m1 and m2 (A,B) attached by lever arms
      slightly offset by an angle [delta][theta] along the radial
      direction to the rotating shaft (C), will produce a gravitational
      wave (D) traveling perpendicular to the shaft. The mass and wave
      are referred to as the source and receptor respectively. Referring
      to a side view looking along the shaft FIG. 3, the product of the
      mass m times the angular acceleration a is a constant such that
      m1a1 is equal to m2a2. The distance between the masses is length
      L, which makes an angle [theta] with the horizontal axis. The
      difference in time of travel to the receptor gives rise to a
      difference in phase [delta][theta] equal to the angular velocity
      [omega] of the rotating shaft times the length L times the cosine
      of the angle [theta]<br>
      [delta][theta]=[omega]L cos([theta])<br>
      <br>
      [0006] At the receptor, the amplitude of the wave is equal to the
      mass times the acceleration times the phase difference divided by
      the radius r to the receptor [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      Even though the turboprop airplane engines have a high rotational
      speed and a large separation distance between masses, the
      gravitational wave which is produced is small and not noticed. The
      problem is that the gravitational constant G in this dimension has
      such a small value equal to the speed of light c squared divided
      by the linear mass [Omega] of the universe [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0007] On the other hand, a gravitational wave traveling in
      hyperspace would be magnified enormously due to the face that the
      linear mass is so small. The magnitude of the gravitational
      constant in hyperspace can be estimated in the following manner.
      At the beginning of the 20th century, a man's parents were dying
      of tuberculosis. With their permission, he placed them and their
      beds on weighing scales. When each one passed away, each scale
      registered a drop in mass equal to 0.071 kilograms. This is the
      mass of the hyperspace energy being which resides in the physical
      body. Because hyperspace is co-dimensional with our dimension, the
      energy being interpenetrates the body and controls its movement.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Referring to FIG. 4, a human being has seven vortices (A
      through G) which are aligned along the centerline of the body.
      Each vortex is actually a co-gravitational field K which causes a
      pendulum placed in the field to spin in circles. For this reason,
      the K field has units of inverse seconds similar to an angular
      velocity. The vortex transports energy from our dimension to the
      energy being located in hyperspace. The gravitational field g and
      the co-gravitational field K are equivalent gravitationally to the
      electric E field and the magnetic B field found in
      electromagnetism. The equivalent gravitational solution to an
      electromagnetic problem can be obtained by substituting the
      following gravitational constants for the electromagnetic
      constants<br>

      <br>
      [0009] Referring to FIG. 5, each vortex is connected through the
      pineal gland by light cords to a separate hyperspace quantum well
      having its own frequency and dimension. The reason for this
      separation is that the conical spiritual eye, attached to vortex
      B, has to have its own energy structure which is different from
      vortex (A) which is connected to the quantum energy field in which
      the mental processes are developed. Due to the high speed of light
      in our dimension, the quantum wells are the size appropriate to
      molecules and atoms. In hyperspace, where the speed of light is
      one meter per second, the quantum wells are huge and can be
      manipulated. This manipulation has shown that the quantum wells
      are in the shape of a cube about a meter on a side. This makes the
      whole structure about seven meters tall for a volume of seven
      cubic meters. Thus the mass density [rho] of hyperspace is about
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which per unit area is the same value. Therefore the hyperspace
      gravitational constant is equal to [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      The enormous magnification of the gravitational constant is
      therefore of the order of [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      The question is how does this amplified gravitational wave created
      by the rotating propellers and turbines get into hyperspace from
      our dimension?<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The answer comes from experiments done using the ancient
      Chinese form of breathing known as Chi Kung. Using this breathing
      technique, we have been able to levitate the human body over six
      feet in the air. The internal temperature of the stomach is around
      200 degrees Fahrenheit. By simultaneously squeezing the diaphragm
      to bring hot air up through the lungs, and breathing through the
      nose to bring cold air down, rotating vortices are generated in
      the lung passages when these two air masses meet and twist around
      each other as depicted in the famous Yin-Yang diagram. Because the
      lung has variable diameter passages from the large diameter at the
      throat to the final small air sacs, there is a spectrum of
      rotating frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] From quantum physics it is known that if there is a
      temperature fluctuation occurring among a group of harmonic
      oscillators in the environment, then Planck's reduced constant -
      is increased by the cotangent of the constant times the frequency
      [omega] of the oscillator divided by twice Boltzmann's constant k
      times the temperature T [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The effect of increasing Planck's constant, referring to
      FIG. 6, can be seen in the tetrahedron diagram. This diagram, of
      which there are now over 4000, plots the natural logarithm of mass
      on the vertical axis versus the natural logarithm of wavelength on
      the horizontal axis. In terms of mathematics, it is a subspace
      logarithmic manifold which projects geometrically the physics
      constants into our 4D spacetime dimension. That is, it is the
      geometry of the tetrahedron circumscribed by the sphere that
      determines the mass of the proton and electron. The mass of the
      electron times its wavelength is equal to the mass of the proton
      times its wavelength which in turn is equal to Planck's constant h
      divided by the speed of light c [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      Taking the natural logarithm of the above equation shows that the
      mass plus the wavelength is equal to what is termed the base
      constant [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      which is represented in FIG. 6 by the 45 degree line (A) from
      point (a) on the horizontal axis to the vertical axis at point
      (b). The electron is located at point (c) which is the
      intersection of the electron wavelength (B) with line (A). The
      electron wavelength (B) reflects off the sphere (D) at points (d)
      and (e) and returns along line (C) as the electron mass. As shown
      in tetrahedron diagram tet0565, stored in the Library of Congress,
      the clockwise path of the electron transitions into the
      counter-clockwise path of the proton showing that the electron and
      proton are one and the same particle. Because the electron and
      proton travel in opposite directions along the path, they have the
      same charge but of opposite sign.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Our dimension is represented by Planck box (E) which is
      bounded by the Planck mass and the Planck wavelength. The Planck
      mass is equal to the linear mass of the universe times the Planck
      length which is the bottom limit of our dimension. The Planck
      wavelength is 2[pi] times the Planck length. Notice that the
      electron is located within the Planck box.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Referring to FIG. 7, if there is an increase in Planck's
      constant due to the temperature fluctuations among the harmonic
      oscillators, the 45 degree base line (A) moves to the left on the
      tetrahedron diagram as shown by line (F). Because of the increase
      in the base constant, there is a corresponding increase in the
      electron mass and wavelength. The electron moves from point (c) to
      point (f) which places it at the edge of the Planck box (F) which
      is the boundary between space and hyperspace. At point (f), the
      electron is essentially no longer in our dimension.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Referring to FIG. 8, imagine a box (A) filled with nine
      electron oscillators (B). If Planck's constant is increased near
      the three oscillators in the middle, these electrons will leave
      this dimension. This leaves six oscillators as shown in the box
      (C). However, box (C) is the equivalent of box (D) in which there
      are still nine positive mass oscillators together with 3 negative
      mass oscillators. Thus there is an accumulation of negative energy
      (-[rho]) when information is lost from the environment to another
      dimension.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Dr. Kip Thorne, who co-authored the book Gravitation with
      Dr. Archibald Wheeler of Princeton University, has shown in a
      General Relativity spacetime curvature calculation that negative
      energy is required to open and stabilize the throat of a wormhole
      between space and hyperspace. The accumulation of negative energy
      in the aforementioned example generates wormholes between into
      hyperspace. Hyperspace has a low energy density because of the
      reduced speed of light in that dimension. Ordinarily, energy would
      not flow from hyperspace to space because space has a higher
      potential than the potential of hyperspace. This, of course, is
      the reason that the body vortices can flow energy into the energy
      field of the human being who is located in hyperspace. By creating
      negative energy, the potential becomes reversed such that low
      density hyperspace energy flows into our dimension as seen by the
      positive head<br>
      PE=[rho]hyperspace-(-[rho]space)=+2[rho]<br>
      The low-density energy fills the body which allows a human being
      to float upwards like a helium balloon as verified by Chi Kung
      breathing as well as spinning on a motorized platform known as the
      Chakra Vortex Accelerator. The latter device resulted in the first
      mechanical means to produce anti-gravity.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The process of creating spinning thermal fluctuations is
      the same as found in the hot air vortices created by the jet
      airplanes landing at the airport near the road where the full-body
      teleportation occurred. Large vortices are created over the wing
      of the airplane at the same time that the turbine engines are
      spinning hot vortices into relatively cold air. These conditions
      produce wormholes between space and hyperspace. It takes a twin
      turboprop airplane landing behind the jet to generate the
      gravitational wave in the region where the wormholes have formed.
      The gravitational wave then traverses the wormholes into
      hyperspace, becoming highly amplified due to the change in linear
      mass and speed of light. Because the propeller blades are
      co-linear with the road, the gravitational wave travels in the
      direction along the road where it was encountered by the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] From experiments with cavitating bubbles (see patent
      application Cavitating Oil Hyperspace Energy Generator), it was
      found that it is possible to produce a wormhole if the surfaces of
      the bubble collapse asymmetrically. A symmetric collapse of a
      spherical bubble produces enormous spacetime curvature
      distortions. An asymmetric collapse, using a magnetic field to
      distort the collapse, produces, in addition to the same severe
      spacetime distortions, negative energy as the bubble collapses.
      Due to some General Relativity considerations, the wormhole that
      is created starts rotating in a manner similar to the beacon light
      produced by a lighthouse.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Referring to FIG. 9, due to the forward helical motion (A)
      of the propellers (B) as the airplane crosses the road, the pulsed
      gravitational wave (C) is skewed backward at an angle (D). Due to
      the wormholes created by the presence of thermal vorticity
      fluctuations generated by the wing and turbines of the airplane,
      this skewed wave moves into hyperspace where it is highly
      magnified and detected by the inventor.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Referring to top view FIG. 10, the gravitational wave (A)
      causes a skewed compression and expansion of the hyperspace
      quantum wells (B) which constitute the human energy being. Due to
      this asymmetric distortion in the xy-plane, the quantum wells take
      the physical body out of dimension as long as the wave pulse is
      traveling with the human energy field. Once the back edge of the
      gravitational wave moves on past the quantum wells, the body is
      then brought back into dimension.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0021] It is the object of this invention to teleport a human
      being from one location to another by creating a pulsed
      gravitational wave traveling through hyperspace that
      asymmetrically compresses and expands the quantum wells of the
      human energy being. This spacetime curvature distortion of the
      hyperspace quantum wells pulls the physical body out of dimension
      such that the human being is teleported along with the wave. As
      the pulsed wave moves on past the quantum wells, the human is
      brought back into dimension at some distant location. The
      invention requires (1) a device that will generate a wormhole
      between space and hyperspace, and (2) a device that will generate
      a gravitational wave which can be inserted through the wormhole.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Referring to FIG. 11, a magnetic vortex wormhole generator
      has already been developed which generates a wormhole between
      space and hyperspace as described in a previous patent application
      entitled Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator. Using this generator,
      it was found that smoke blown through one side of the coil does
      not appear on the other side of cylindrical coil. The smoke flows
      through the wormhole and appears in a hyperspace co-dimension. It
      was this experiment that resulted in making first contact with the
      androids of the Grey aliens who told me, in a remote viewing
      session, that "We saw you blowing smoke into hyperspace."<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The wormhole generator consists of two concentric
      cylindrical coils (A,B), one of larger radius than the other, made
      of thin transformer iron laminate wrapped in opposite directions
      with one continuous wire driven by a sinusoidal current. The
      solenoidal coil generates a magnetic field through the laminate.
      Because the electrical current flows in opposite directions at
      different radii through the two windings, bucking electric fields
      (C) are created along the centerline of the generator. These
      radially-offset magnetic fields and bucking electric fields, as
      shown by a calculation using Einstein's General Theory of
      Relativity, generate both an enormous spiking spacetime curvature
      and negative energy at small radius along the centerline where the
      wormhole is formed. The gravitational wave generator is then
      coupled to this wormhole generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Referring to FIG. 12, it is known from gravitation physics
      that injecting an electromagnetic wave (A) into a hollow toroidal
      waveguide (B) produces a hyperbolic spacetime curvature stress (C)
      in the plane of the waveguide. The tips of the arrows indicate
      compression and the tail of the arrows indicate expansion or
      stretching of spacetime. The reason for this spacetime curvature
      is because the waveguide forces the electromagnetic wave to curve
      around and travel in a circle. Spacetime has to compensate for
      this toroidal-generated stress by creating hyperbolic lines of
      stress in the inner plane of the toroid so that the overall
      spacetime curvature is zero. For a greater gravitational effect,
      three toroidal waveguides, phased 120 degrees apart, are used to
      seal off the curvature.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring to FIG. 13, the three toroids create a rotating,
      twisting, vertical propagating gravitational field (A) through the
      centerline of the toroids provided that the period of the
      electromagnetic wave is twice the period of the gravitational
      wave. This phase relationship is adjusted by selecting the correct
      radius for the frequency of the monochromatic wave.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In order to effectively use this gravitational wave,
      referring to FIG. 14, three phased toroidal waveguides (A,B) are
      mounted at the top of each of two identical square granite
      obelisks (C,D). The two obelisks are offset by a short distance
      between them. As the vertical gravitational wave rotates around
      along the vertical axis inside the obelisk, the edges of the
      square obelisks are compressed and expanded such as to create two
      cylindrical asymmetric gravitational waves traveling radially
      outward.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Referring to FIG. 15, these waves meet to form a plane
      gravitational wave (A) which travels down the centerline between
      the two obelisks.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Referring to FIG. 16, the full body teleportation system
      consists of the twin granite obelisks (A,B) on which are mounted
      near the top of each the toroidal waveguides (C,D) which produce
      the pulsed gravitational waves (E,F) that run the length of the
      obelisks. Because the gravitational wave is rotating inside the
      obelisk, the granite stone undergoes a very small asymmetrical
      compression and expansion. A cylindrical gravitational wave
      propagates out from each obelisk such that along the centerline
      between the two there is generated a plane gravitational wave.
      This wave enters the wormhole (H) created by the magnetic vortex
      generator which is located a short distance from and parallel to
      the obelisks. The wave is amplified by a factor of almost 10
      &lt;13 &gt; when it enters the hyperspace co-dimension.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      1. The obelisks are quarried out of granite stone and cut with a
      large-diameter diamond saw that is used in highway construction.
      The beveled piece at the top is cut separately and cemented in
      place. A tapered aluminum bracket holds the toroids in place.<br>
      <br>
      2. The electronics for the magnetic vortex generator are similar
      to that used in the patent application Magnetic Vortex Wormhole
      Generator.<br>
      <br>
      3. The electronics for the toroidal waveguides is the familiar
      stub and coaxial cable driven by an amplifier and pulsed
      variable-frequency generator.<br>
