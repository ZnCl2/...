      A spacecraft propulsion system utilizing a rotating octagon of
      trapezoidal electrically charged flat panels to create an electric
      dipole moment that generates lift on the hull. On the interior
      side of each panel are electrostatically charged rods which
      produce a planar electric field that emerges from holes in the
      panel to form an ellipsoidal potential energy bubble on the
      outside of the hull. The rotating hull dipole moment generates a
      magnetic moment which, together with the magnetic field gradient
      developed by the rotating electric field of the electrostatically
      charged panels, produces said lift force. The potential energy
      field is enhanced by using a double cladding of hull material with
      different ranges of permittivities.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention, which is the object of my present
      application, is a spacecraft utilizing trapezoidal
      electrostatically charged flat plate panels which form a pyramidal
      hull. A panel contains three holes each of which produces a
      potential energy ellipsoidal bubble that creates an electric
      dipole moment. The rotation of the hull generates a magnetic
      moment and a magnetic field gradient in the vertical direction
      that produces a lift force on the spacecraft.<br>

      Hole.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] I was reading Dr. Jackson's book about the formation of a
      potential energy bubble by a hole in a conducting plane, a picture
      of which is shown on page 134 of his book. It turns out that this
      bubble creates an electric dipole moment from which it is possible
      to get a magnetic moment. Then I realized that a rotating tilted
      hull having a velocity gradient would produce a magnetic field
      gradient in the vertical direction. This combination produces a
      lift force on the spacecraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] I did quite a number of computer simulations of the bubble
      using an electromagnetic simulation software program. I found that
      the hole in the plate doesn't produce a very large potential
      energy bubble. So I created another simulation where the hole
      protrudes out of the plate in an ellipsoidal shape. This produces
      a much larger field. I then found that using a double cladding, in
      which each layer has a different permittivity, confined the field
      to the outside of the hull for even better results.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The planar potential energy is created by a grid of
      electrically charged wires or rods running the length of each
      panel. As shown by Feynman, the circular potential energy from
      each rod very quickly sums to form a flat sheet of energy which
      emerges from the hole to form said potential energy bubble.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The invention relates to a spacecraft utilizing a rotating
      octagon of trapezoidal electrically charged flat plate panels to
      form a hull in the shape of a pyramid. Each panel has three
      protruding ellipsoidal bubbles that produce an electric dipole
      moment from a planar potential energy field created by a group of
      charged rods parallel to the panel. Because the panels are tilted
      and the hull is rotating, there is a tangential velocity gradient
      in the vertical direction. This creates the magnetic moment.
      Because the hull rotates, the radial electric field produces a
      magnetic field gradient in the vertical direction. This
      combination of magnetic moment and magnetic field gradient
      produces a lift force on the hull of the spacecraft.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] On the underside of each panel is a group of high voltage
      electrically charged rods which run parallel to the panel. These
      wires or rods produce a planar electrical potential field
      underneath the holes in the panel. This potential energy field
      then bubbles out of the holes in the panel to create a large
      ellipsoidal potential energy field above the hull. The potential
      energy bubble carries an electric dipole moment which when rotated
      with the hull generates a magnetic moment in the vertical
      direction.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0035] 1. Referring to FIG. 1, the spacecraft is a rotating
      octagon of trapezoidal electrostatically charged flat panels which
      form a closed hull (A). Each panel has three ellipsoidal domes (B)
      of varying size centrally located along the major length of the
      panel. The purpose of the dome is to create a large ellipsoidal
      potential energy bubble over the hull which develops an electrical
      dipole moment. Because the hull is rotating, a magnetic moment is
      created in the vertical direction. A magnetic field gradient
      created by the rotating electric field on the hull in combination
      with said magnetic moment produces a lift force on the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] 2. Referring to FIG. 2, the trapezoidal hull panel (A)
      contains three ellipsoidal holes (E). A group of wires or rods (C)
      running parallel to and just underneath the panel are electrically
      charged to a high voltage at the end terminals (B). Said rods
      produce a planar potential energy field (D) just under the holes
      in the panel. The field emerges from the holes in the shape of an
      ellipsoidal bubble and is amplified by an ellipsoidal dome (F) on
      the outside of the hull.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] 3. Referring to FIG. 3, the group of parallel rods (A) are
      given a linear charge [lambda] in units of charge per meter. The
      electric field E developed by the rod is the linear charge divided
      by the circumference of a circle of radius r around the wire times
      the permittivity [epsilon] of space. The analysis of this
      arrangement shows that within a few grid width spacings, the
      potential energy field [phi] has become planar (B) in the
      z-direction given by the equation in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] 4. The forthcoming analysis is done in cylindrical
      coordinates, FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] 5. Referring to FIG. 6, the ellipsoidal potential energy
      (B) emerges through the hole in the panel plate (A). In doing so
      it creates an electrical dipole moment (C) shown by the arrow
      normal to the hole area. The theoretical analysis matched a
      computer simulation of this emergence of the bubble (B) through
      plate (A), as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] 6. Because the bubble has the shape of an ellipse, the
      centroid of the bubble would be four thirds the radius a divided
      by [pi] as given in FIG. 8. The electric dipole moment is then
      given as the charge times said centroid. The charge of the hole is
      equal to the permittivity times the electric field emerging from
      the hole times the area of the hole as seen in the equation of
      FIG. 9 with the units of charge, FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] 7. The electric dipole moment is said centroid times said
      charge, as seen in the equation given in FIG. 11 and having units
      of coulomb-meter. Notice that the electric dipole moment p times a
      velocity v is equal to a magnetic moment [mu] which is what
      creates the lift force on the hull as shown in the next FIG. 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] 8. The rotating hull creates the electric dipole moment
      velocity so that the entire hull develops a magnetic moment. In
      tensor notation, FIG. 13, the magnetic moment is in the vertical
      direction because there is a radial component of the electric
      dipole moment times the velocity. The velocity is the radius r in
      the radial direction times the angular velocity in the
      z-direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] 9. The force on the hull is the gradient of the dot product
      of the magnetic moment with the magnetic B field given in equation
      FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] 10. By electrically charging the hull of the vehicle, a
      radial electric field is produced. By rotating the hull, the
      radial electric field changes with time. Thus Maxwell's equations
      will involve the curl of the magnetic field in the radial
      direction because the radial electric field is varying with time.
      Maxwell's equation is seen in FIG. 16.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] 11. The cross product involves the magnetic field in the
      theta direction which is zero. The electric field varies with time
      as shown in FIG. 17. Substituting the derivative of the electric
      field and integrating with respect to angle theta gives the
      vertical magnetic field as the tangential velocity times the
      radial field divided by the speed of light squared (FIG. 18).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] 12. Now the force on the hull is the gradient of the
      magnetic moment times the magnetic field. In the equation for the
      magnetic field, the only available variable to work with in order
      to get a gradient is the velocity. To me this was the surprise in
      this invention. The velocity had to be a function of the height of
      the hull (FIG. 19) which meant that the hull had to be in the
      shape of a pyramid, FIG. 20. Using eight flat sides keeps the
      radial electric field pointing in the same direction in each
      panel. Each panel has three domes to produce the magnetic moment
      for a total of 24 magnetic moment generators.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] 13. Referring to FIG. 21, the electric dipole moment (A)
      points in the radial direction, the rotating hull produces a
      tangential velocity (B), and the result is a magnetic moment (C)
      along the panel.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] 14. Because the magnetic moment is parallel to the panel,
      there are vertical and radial components of the magnetic moment.
      The vertical magnetic moment creates the dot product with the
      magnetic field gradient, which is equal to the lift force, as
      depicted in FIG. 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] 15. FIG. 23 shows a cross-section of the dome (A) and the
      plate hole (B) with double cladding to enhance the field as
      determined by computer simulation. The upper cladding (D) has a
      low relative permittivity in the range of 2 to 40, and the lower
      layer has a high relative permittivity in the range of 1200 to
      4000. This dome and cladding configuration creates a much larger
      electric dipole moment compared to a hole in the plate, comparing
      FIG. 23 to that of FIG. 7. The wavy lines are the equi-potential
      energy lines from the dome (C) and the upper layer (B) and the
      lower level (A).<br>
