      CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Researchers at the University of Illinois are
      developing panels of microcavity plasma lamps that may soon
      brighten people’s lives. The thin, lightweight panels could be
      used for residential and commercial lighting, and for certain
      types of biomedical applications.<br>
      <br>

        lamp having a radiating area of 225 square centimeters. The
        inset is a magnified view of several diamond-shapes
        microcavities.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      “Built of aluminum foil, sapphire and small amounts of gas, the
      panels are less than 1 millimeter thick, and can hang on a wall
      like picture frames,” said Gary Eden, a professor of electrical
      and computer engineering at the U. of I., and corresponding author
      of a paper describing the microcavity plasma lamps in the June
      issue of the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics.<br>
      <br>
      Like conventional fluorescent lights, microcavity plasma lamps are
      glow-discharges in which atoms of a gas are excited by electrons
      and radiate light. Unlike fluorescent lights, however, microcavity
      plasma lamps produce the plasma in microscopic pockets and require
      no ballast, reflector or heavy metal housing. The panels are
      lighter, brighter and more efficient than incandescent lights and
      are expected, with further engineering, to approach or surpass the
      efficiency of fluorescent lighting.<br>
      <br>
      The plasma panels are also six times thinner than panels composed
      of light-emitting diodes, said Eden, who also is a researcher at
      the university’s Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Micro and
      Nanotechnology Laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      A plasma panel consists of a sandwich of two sheets of aluminum
      foil separated by a thin dielectric layer of clear aluminum oxide
      (sapphire). At the heart of each lamp is a small cavity, which
      penetrates the upper sheet of aluminum foil and the sapphire.<br>
      <br>
      “Each lamp is approximately the diameter of a human hair,” said
      visiting research scientist Sung-Jin Park, lead author of the
      paper. “We can pack an array of more than 250,000 lamps into a
      single panel.”<br>
      <br>
      Completing the panel assembly is a glass window 500 microns (0.5
      millimeters) thick. The window’s inner surface is coated with a
      phosphor film 10 microns thick, bringing the overall thickness of
      the lamp structure to 800 microns.<br>
      <br>

      foil encapsulated in saphire and a thin glass coating. The lower
      right portion of the figure presents photographs at two
      magnifications of an electrode screen with diamond cross-sectional
      microcavities. The smallest graduation of the scale is 1
      millimeter.<br>
      <br>
      Flat panels with radiating areas of more than 200 square
      centimeters have been fabricated, Park said. Depending upon the
      type of gas and phosphor used, uniform emissions of any color can
      be produced.<br>
      <br>
      In the researchers’ preliminary plasma lamp experiments, values of
      the efficiency – known as luminous efficacy – of 15 lumens per
      watt were recorded. Values exceeding 30 lumens per watt are
      expected when the array design and microcavity phosphor geometry
      are optimized, Eden said. A typical incandescent light has an
      efficacy of 10 to 17 lumens per watt.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also demonstrated flexible plasma arrays sealed in
      polymeric packaging. These devices offer new opportunities in
      lighting, in which lightweight arrays can be mounted onto curved
      surfaces – on the insides of windshields, for example.<br>
      <br>
      The flexible arrays also could be used as photo-therapeutic
      bandages to treat certain diseases – such as psoriasis – that can
      be driven into remission by narrow-spectrum ultraviolet light,
      Eden said.<br>
      <br>
      With Eden and Park, co-authors of the paper are graduate students
      Andrew Price and Jason Readle, and undergraduate student Jekwon
      Yoon.<br>
      <br>
      Funding was provided by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific
      Research and the Office of Naval Research.<br>

      provides methods of making arrays of thin sheet microdischarge
      devices. In a preferred method of fabricating an array of
      microdischarge devices, a multi-layer dielectric layer thin sheet
      is position with respect to a first thin electrode. A second
      electrode thin sheet is joined on the dielectric layer sheet. An
      array of microcavities is provided through at least a portion of
      the dielectric layer sheet. The method can produce thin large
      arrays inexpensively. In preferred embodiments, each of the
      multi-layer dielectric layer thin sheet, the first thin electrode
      and the second electrode thin sheet have a thickness of less than
      less than 100 mum. In preferred embodiments, the multi-layer
      dielectric is formed of polymer, and in other embodiments from
      oxides and/or nitrides. In a particular preferred embodiment, the
      multilayer dielectric is formed from oxide and nitride films.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] This invention was made with government support under
      Contract Number F49620-98-1-0030 awarded by the U.S. Air Force
      Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR). The Government has certain
      rights in the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to microdischarge devices
      and, in particular, new structures for light emitting devices and
      low-cost methods of producing ultraviolet or visible light from
      thin sheets.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It has long been known that electrical discharges are
      efficient sources of light and, today, gas discharge lamps
      (including fluorescent sources, and metal-halide, sodium, or
      mercury arc lamps) account for most of the world's
      light-generating capacity (several billion watts on a continuous
      basis). Most of these devices are, unfortunately, bulky and
      frequently have fragile quartz or glass envelopes and require
      expensive mounting fixtures. In addition to general lighting,
      discharges produce ultraviolet and visible light for other
      purposes such as germicidal applications (disinfecting surfaces
      and tissue), cleaning electronic and optical surfaces in
      manufacturing, and activating light-sensitive molecules for
      medical treatments and diagnostics.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Although microdischarges were demonstrated by A. D. White
      in 1959, only recently were microdischarge devices fabricated in
      silicon by techniques developed in the integrated-circuit
      industry. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,016,027, the first
      microdischarge devices made in silicon had a cylindrical
      microcavity that served as the cathode of the device. The
      semiconductor cathode was affixed to a copper heat sink with
      conductive epoxy. The anode for the microdischarge device was
      typically a metal film such as Ni/cr. A thin dielectric layer
      deposited onto the silicon electrically insulates the cathode from
      the anode. When the microcavity is filled with the desired gas and
      the appropriate voltage imposed between the anode and cathode, a
      discharge is ignited in the microcavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Microdischarges have several distinct advantages over
      conventional discharges. Since the diameter of single cylindrical
      microdischarge devices, for example, is typically less than
      400-500 [mu]m, each device offers the spatial resolution that is
      desirable for a pixel in a display. Also, the small physical
      dimensions of microdischarges allows them to operate at pressures
      much higher than those accessible to conventional, macroscopic
      discharges. When the diameter of a cylindrical microdischarge
      device is, for example, on the order of 200-300 [mu]m or less, the
      device will operate at pressures as high as atmospheric pressure
      and beyond. In contrast, standard fluorescent lamps, for example,
      operate at pressures typically less than 1% of atmospheric
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Despite their applications in several areas, including
      optoelectronics and sensors, silicon microdischarge devices have
      several drawbacks. For example, the annular metal anodes used in
      early microdischarge devices have short lifetimes because of
      sputtering. After operating for as little as several hours, damage
      to the anode is visible and devices frequently fail after only
      tens of hours of operation. Optical emission from metal atoms
      evaporated from the anode is easily detected prior to failure of
      the device. One solution is to replace the metals tested to date
      with a more robust material, such as polycrystalline silicon or
      tungsten. However, these materials increase the fabrication cost
      and difficulty, do not yield significantly increased output power
      and may not yield significantly improved device lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Furthermore, silicon is brittle, comparatively high in
      cost, and single wafers are limited in size (12'' in diameter
      currently). In addition, silicon fabrication techniques, although
      well-established, are labor and time intensive and, therefore, not
      suitable for low-cost applications. Therefore, a number of
      potential applications of microdischarge devices, not presently
      accessible with silicon (or other) semiconductor technology, could
      be pursued if low-cost, flexible microdischarge arrays, requiring
      voltages no higher than that available in common wall sockets,
      were available.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Two other drawbacks of previous microdischarge devices and
      arrays concern the inefficiency of extracting optical power from
      deep cylindrical cavities and the difficulty in scaling the size
      of arrays. If the cylindrical cathode for a microdischarge is too
      deep, it will be difficult for photons produced below the surface
      of the cathode to escape. Another problem arises in fabricating
      arrays of microdischarge devices is that devices at the perimeter
      of the array ignite preferentially and arrays as small as 10*10
      are difficult to ignite at all.<br>

        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0023] The invention provides methods of making arrays of thin
      sheet microdischarge devices. In a preferred method of fabricating
      an array of microdischarge devices, a multi-layer dielectric layer
      thin sheet is position with respect to a first thin electrode. A
      second electrode thin sheet is joined on the dielectric layer
      sheet. An array of microcavities is provided through at least a
      portion of the dielectric layer sheet. The method can produce thin
      large arrays inexpensively. In preferred embodiments, each of the
      multi-layer dielectric layer thin sheet, the first thin electrode
      and the second electrode thin sheet have a thickness of less than
      less than 100 [mu]m. In preferred embodiments, the multi-layer
      dielectric is formed of polymer, and in other embodiments from
      oxides and/or nitrides. In a particular preferred embodiment, the
      multilayer dielectric is formed from oxide and nitride films.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The present invention provides microdischarge devices and
      arrays of microdischarge devices that are inexpensive to
      manufacture and have electrical and optical characteristics that
      are superior to previous microdischarge devices. These
      microdischarge devices and arrays may operate at atmospheric
      pressure and at voltages of 120V or less, and preferably at
      voltages of not greater than 100V. Either direct current (DC) or
      alternating current (AC) voltages may be applied to the
      electrodes. The microdischarge devices and arrays of
      microdischarge devices may also be flexible.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] An embodiment of a microdischarge device (not drawn to
      scale) is shown in FIG. 1. The microdischarge device 100 includes
      a first electrode 106, a second electrode 104 and a dielectric
      layer 108 (also called an insulating layer or an insulator)
      disposed between the first electrode 106 and second electrode 104.
      A cavity 102 is formed in the insulator 108 and may be
      additionally formed in either or both of the first electrode 106
      and the second electrode 104 such that the openings or holes in
      each of the first electrode 106, insulator 108, and second
      electrode 104 are aligned with each other. The cavity 102
      preferably has a substantially cylindrical shape to more easily
      couple to optical fiber, for example, and is formed in a direction
      transverse to the planes containing the electrodes 104 and 106 and
      insulator 108. The first electrode 106 and second electrode 104
      are both electrically and thermally conductive and a potential
      difference across the insulator 108 is established by a voltage
      source 110 connected between the first electrode 106 and the
      second electrode 104. The potential difference creates a discharge
      in the cavity 102 when a gas is present. The resulting light has
      emission spectra that are characteristic of the gas selected. This
      light is subsequently emitted from at least one end of the cavity
      102.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The first electrode 106 and second electrode 104 preferably
      serve to establish the potential difference across the insulator
      108 and thereby energize the microdischarge device 100. Thus, the
      first electrode 106 and second electrode 104 are fabricated from
      materials having good electrical and thermal conductivity. The
      first electrode 106 and second electrode 104 may be planar and may
      be fabricated from thin layers of conductive material, preferably
      having a thickness of less than 100 [mu]m, more preferably
      thicknesses from about 10 A-10 [mu]m and from 50 A-5 [mu]m. Common
      metals that may be used to form the electrodes include copper,
      aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, and zinc and alloys thereof. Other
      conductors include polymers containing carbon black and other
      conducting polymer materials or highly doped crystalline,
      polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor films. Alternatively,
      rather than the electrodes being formed from an optically opaque
      material, at least one of the electrodes may be fabricated from a
      solid layer of optically transmissive material that does not
      significantly absorb light at the wavelength of the discharge,
      such as indium tin oxide (ITO). Optically transmissive material
      transmits preferably at least 50% of the light impinging
      substantially normal to the surface of the material at wavelength
      emitted by the discharge. More preferably, the optically
      transmissive material transmits at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or
      even 95% of the light impinging substantially normal to the
      surface of the material at a wavelength emitted by the discharge.
      The first electrode 106 and second conducting electrode 13
      preferably form a cathode and an anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] At least one of the electrodes is preferably deposited,
      plated, or otherwise disposed onto the dielectric layer to
      establish a film of conducting material around the rim of the
      cavity in the dielectric layer. Furthermore, although not shown,
      at least one of the electrodes may be fabricated from multiple
      layers, at least one of which (preferably the layer closest to the
      discharge) is electrically conducting. The other layers may serve
      as a mirror to reflect light of undesired wavelengths back into
      the microdischarge.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The first electrode 106 may additionally act as a support
      for the microdischarge device 100. One example of such a structure
      would be using Kapton onto which a thin conducting film is
      deposited or a foil is in contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The second electrode 104 is preferably thinner than the
      first electrode 106. The insulator 108 is formed of a material
      having a resistivity of at least 0.1 [Omega]-cm, preferably from
      0.5 [Omega]-cm-100 [Omega]-cm or from 1.0 [Omega]-cm-10.0
      [Omega]-cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The insulator 108 acts as a dielectric layer to
      electrically isolate the first electrode 106 and second electrode
      104 of the microdischarge device 100. Preferably, the insulator
      108 has excellent thermostability and high dielectric strength,
      e.g. Tg&gt;200[deg.] C. and at least 10&lt;4 &gt; V-cm,
      respectively. More preferable ranges for the thermostability
      include 400[deg.] C.&gt;Tg&gt;250[deg.] C. and 350[deg.]
      C.&gt;Tg&gt;275[deg.] C. and for the dielectric strength from
      5*10&lt;4 &gt; V-cm-5*10&lt;6 &gt; V-cm or 10&lt;5 &gt;
      V-cm-5*10&lt;5 &gt; V-cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The insulator 108 may be a polymer such as polyimide, which
      has exceptional thermostability and dielectric strength. For
      example, the breakdown voltage for a polyimide film about 5 [mu]m
      thick is approximately 1.2 kV, giving a dielectric strength in
      excess of 10&lt;6 &gt; V-cm. Other dielectrics, resins and
      polymers-for example, oxide and nitride films such as metal
      oxides, SiO2, Si3N4 or KAPTON-may be used as long as the material
      retains its insulation properties at the material thickness
      required for adequate dielectric strength. Furthermore, multiple
      films of different materials (having different dielectric
      constants) may be used to fabricate the insulator in order to
      improve both individual device and array performance. Tests have
      shown that a multiple layer dielectric (containing, for example,
      0.5 [mu]m Si3N4, 0.5 [mu]m SiO2, and several microns of polyimide)
      not only improves the voltage-current characteristics of an
      individual microdischarge device but also makes it possible to
      realize stable operation of large arrays (for example, 30*30) of
      devices. If, on the other hand, the insulator 108 is a single film
      of polyimide, for example, it is difficult to operate arrays
      larger than approximately 5*5.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The insulator 108, in addition to the first electrode 106
      and second electrode 104, may also be thin, preferably less than
      100 [mu]m. Preferred thickness ranges for the insulator 108 may be
      from 10 A-100 [mu]m or 100 A-10 [mu]m. The voltage applied between
      the first electrode 106 and second electrode 12 to create the
      discharge is directly related to the thickness of the dielectric
      layer 108; as well as the particular gas and gas pressure in the
      cavity. Scaling the thickness of the insulator 108 thus changes
      the magnitude of the operating voltage of the microdischarge
      device 100. Some applications may additionally require fabrication
      of the first electrode 106, insulator 108, and second electrode
      104 using materials that have appropriate conductive/dielectric
      properties at the desired device thicknesses.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The cavity 102 formed in the insulator 108 may extend
      through either (or both) the first electrode 106 or the second
      electrode 104. The cavity 102 is preferably cylindrical and has a
      diameter of 0.1 [mu]m-1 mm. More preferably, the diameter ranges
      from 0.1 [mu]m-500 [mu]m, 1 [mu]m-100 [mu]m, or 100 [mu]m-500
      [mu]m. The cavity 102 will be filled with a gas selected for its
      breakdown voltage or light emission properties at breakdown. Light
      is produced when the voltage difference between the first
      electrode 106 and the second electrode 104 creates an electric
      field sufficiently large to electrically break down the gas
      (nominally about 10&lt;4 &gt; V-cm). This light escapes from the
      microcavity 102 through at least one end of the cavity 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The gas that fills the cavity 102 may be selected for its
      light emission properties. The term gas herein refers to
      acceptable single gases, gas mixtures, and vapors. Examples of
      common gases that work well alone are the rare gases (He, Ne, Ar,
      Xe, and Kr), N2, and air. A wide variety of gas mixtures also
      produce intense emission from atomic or molecular species. An
      example of the former is Ar/Hg vapor and the latter includes rare
      gas/halogen donor gas mixtures (such as one or more rare gases
      mixed with F2, NF3, XeF2, N2F4, HCI, Cl2, I2, HI or other
      halogen-bearing molecules). Another example is the XeO (xenon
      oxide) excimer that is produced in mixtures of Xe and O2, N2O or
      NO2 gases. Such gases, however, need not be present in the
      channel: breakdown may occur when air is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The microdischarge device 100 may be less than 50 [mu]m
      thick (approximately two one-thousandths of an inch), thus giving
      rise to a thinner device than is typical of conventional
      microdischarge devices. One feature of arrays of such devices is
      that the finished array may be flexible and light. Thus, these
      arrays are able to conform to various shapes and can, if desired,
      be rolled into a tube. This feature enhances the portability and
      utility of microdischarge arrays.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The possible radius of curvature of the microdischarge
      device 100 (or array of devices) may be much smaller than that of
      conventional brittle silicon-based microdischarge devices. For
      comparison, the radius of curvature of a silicon wafer is several
      meters while that of an adult human arm is approximately five cm.
      The realizable radius of curvature of the microdischarge device
      100, is preferably from several meters to less than a single mm.
      For flexible microdischarge devices, the realizable radius of
      curvature may be substantially less, preferably between 1 cm and 1
      m or 10 cm and 100 cm. Thus, a feasible radius of curvature of an
      array of microdischarge devices may be that of human limbs or
      smaller. In a group of these flexible discharge devices (either a
      planar array or stack), when first bent by less than the maximum
      possible radius of curvature, a substantial percentage of the
      discharge devices should continue to operate. Preferably, the
      device failure rate should not significantly change when bending
      the array as long as the operating conditions remain the same.
      This is not to say that problems such as fractures will not appear
      in the devices, but only that the operating characteristics (e.g.
      voltage, current, emission intensity) should not decrease beyond
      acceptable levels. For the purposes of the specification and
      claims herein, the radius of curvature is defined as the minimum
      radius of curvature to which the device is able to be bent before
      the device failure rate rises beyond acceptable levels, preferably
      above 50%. Alternatively, the radius of curvature may be defined
      as the minimum radius of curvature to which the device is able to
      be bent before a specific percentage of the devices in an array
      fail. Preferably fewer than 50% of the devices fail to insure
      adequate operation when used during therapeutic treatment, for
      example; more preferably fewer than 20%, 10%, 5%, 2%, or even 1%
      fail.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] One method of fabrication of the microdischarge device 100
      is to mechanically assemble the various layers that comprise the
      microdischarge device 100. Thus, assembly begins with individually
      positioning the first electrode 106, insulator 108 and second
      electrode 104 on each other and then forming the cavity 102 in the
      assembled layers by any of several processes such as mechanical or
      ultrasonic drilling, optical drilling (preferably by a pulsed
      laser), dry etching or wet chemically etching. These techniques
      are all well developed in the semiconductor industry. In an
      alternate method of fabrication, holes may be formed in the
      insulator 108 and either (or both) of the first electrode 106 and
      second electrode 104. After forming the hole(s), the first
      electrode 106, insulator 108 and second electrode 104 may be
      assembled such that the insulator 108 is sandwiched by the first
      electrode 106 and second electrode 104. Preferably, the layers are
      positioned such that the holes in the layers coincide to form the
      cavity 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In another method of fabrication, the first electrode 106
      may be positioned and the insulator 108 formed on the first
      electrode 106. The insulator 108 may be fabricated by spin coating
      or otherwise depositing a film on the first electrode 106. The
      second electrode 104 is subsequently deposited on the insulator
      108. The cavity 102 is then preferably formed through the
      insulator 108 and at least one of two electrodes 11 and 13.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Alternatively, the first electrode 106 may preferably be
      deposited onto an insulating substrate (not shown), which provides
      a supporting surface for first electrode 106. The insulator 108
      and second electrode 104 may next be fabricated as above, i.e.
      spin coating and subsequent deposition, and then the cavity 102
      formed. In this case, the first electrode 106 may either be
      temporarily attached to the insulating substrate and the
      insulating substrate removed after assembling the layers or the
      first electrode 106 may be permanently attached to the insulating
      substrate. In either case, the cavity 102 may be formed through
      the insulating substrate (if present), the first electrode 106,
      and the insulator 108 after the layers are assembled. Similarly,
      the cavity 102 may be formed through the second electrode 104 and
      the insulator 108 after the layers are assembled, whether or not
      the insulating substrate is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In an embodiment in which the insulating substrate
      permanently covers the cavity 102, the insulating substrate may
      preferably comprise an optically transmissive material. However,
      for embodiments in which the insulating substrate is temporarily
      attached to the first electrode 106 or in which the cavity 102 is
      formed through the insulating substrate, the insulating substrate
      may comprise any suitable insulating material. An example of such
      an insulating substrate may be
      poly(pyromellitimido-1,1',4,4'-diphenylene ether), also known as
      PMDA-ODA poly(pyromellitimido-oxydianiline) or KAPTON.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Other methods for forming the first electrode 106 on the
      insulating substrate include evaporation, growth, sputtering,
      deposition, or attaching with conductive paste. Similar methods
      may be used for forming the insulator 108 on the first electrode
      106 and for forming the second electrode 104 on the insulator 108.
      Examples of methods for forming the cavity 102 include mechanical
      drilling, optical drilling preferably by a pulsed laser, and
      chemically etching the different layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] After the second electrode 104, insulator 108 and first
      electrode 106 have been assembled and the cavity 102 formed, the
      cavity 102 may then be filled with a specified amount or pressure
      of a selected gas. Light produced by a discharge in the gas is
      emitted from the opening of the cavity 102. Additionally, the
      cavity 102 may be sealed while containing the desired gas at the
      proper pressure by laminating or bonding a plastic sheet, glass,
      quartz or mica (not shown) on to both sides of the microdischarge
      array assembly, thereby sealing the microdischarge device 100
      while still allowing the generated light to pass through the
      sealing material. Thus, an optically transmissive material may be
      used to seal the cavity 102 of the microdischarge device 100.
      Preferably, the sealing material may be flexible in addition to
      being optically transmissive.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Sealing of the microdischarge cavity while containing the
      desired gas at the proper pressure may be performed in a number of
      ways other. One method is to "hard seal" the array of
      microdischarge electrodes and insulator to a quartz window having
      a conducting film (such as ITO) or a fine metal grid on one side.
      The bonding process takes place with the conductor facing the
      electrode and bonding occurs along the entire perimeter of the
      electrode and quartz. When completed, this structure is robust and
      compact, requiring only electrical connections to an appropriate
      power supply. Another approach using flexible optically
      transmissive material is to laminate an array of
      electrode/insulator/electrode (or screen) devices. By laminating a
      plastic sheet on both sides of the microdischarge array assembly,
      light generated within the array will be transmitted by the
      packaging if the laminating sheet material is chosen properly. A
      phosphor/electroluminescent material may also be included on the
      screen before sealing.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] To operate the microdischarge device 100, a voltage is
      applied between the first electrode 106 and second electrode 104,
      which produce a discharge in the gas in the cavity 102. The
      resulting light produces emission spectra that are characteristic
      of the gas or gas mixture selected. This light is subsequently
      emitted from at least one end of the cavity 102.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0045] One example of such a microdischarge device 100 has a 25
      [mu]m thick copper foil as the first electrode 106, a polyimide
      film 5-8 [mu]m thick as the insulator 108, and a 2000 A thick Ni
      film as a second electrode 104. FIG. 2 shows the voltage-current
      (V-I) characteristics for this Ni/polyimide/Cu microdischarge
      device. The polymer film for the insulator 108 was formed by spin
      coating a solution of 20 wt % of poly (trimetallic anhydride
      chloride-alt benzidine) in a 1-methyl-2-pyrolidinone/xylene
      solution on the copper foil. Residual solvent was evaporated by a
      hot plate and a vacuum drying process at &gt;200[deg.] C. The Ni
      second electrode 104 was next evaporated onto the polymer, giving
      a total device thickness of about 30 [mu]m. Microdischarge
      cavities 14 having a diameter of typically 150 [mu]m were then
      produced either by mechanically drilling or using a pulsed
      Ti:Al2O3 laser to bore through the second electrode 104, insulator
      108 and first electrode 106. Once fabricated, the microdischarge
      device 100 was evacuated to about 10&lt;-6 &gt; Torr by a
      turbomolecular pump. The polymer was subsequently vacuum baked to
      minimize possible outgassing by the polymer and then backfilled
      with the desired gas, Ne. By observing the emission spectrum of a
      rare gas produced by the microdischarge device 100, freedom from
      (or the presence of) hydrocarbon impurities was determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The positive differential resistance of tested
      microdischarge devices was 30 k[Omega]-120 k[Omega] depending on
      the gas pressure in the cavity 102 (100 Torr to 700 Torr,
      respectively). These differential resistances are comparable to
      conventional planar silicon microdischarge devices, as shown in
      FIG. 2. However, unlike the conventional planar silicon
      microdischarge devices, which typically work at gas pressures
      considerably less than one atmosphere and require at least 200 V
      to operate, the microdischarge device 100 operates both at gas
      pressures approaching one atmosphere and voltages at or below 120
      V. Furthermore, although the data of FIG. 2 were obtained for a
      polyimide thickness of about 5 [mu]m, the operating voltages vary
      with the thickness of the polyimide layer in a roughly
      proportional manner. For example, tested microdischarge devices
      with polyimide layer thicknesses of about 7 [mu]m and 10 [mu]m
      exhibit operating voltages of about 180 V and 250 V, respectively,
      and, thus, thinner polyimide films (i.e., &lt;5 [mu]m) should
      yield operating voltages well below 100 V.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The device of FIGS. 1 and 2 operates in a manner similar to
      that of conventional metal/SiO2/silicon devices. FIG. 3
      illustrates a comparison of a portion of the ultraviolet emission
      spectrum (320-370 nm) produced from neon gas for the above
      Ni/polyimide/Cu foil device with that of a conventional Ni/SiO2
      (20 [mu]m thick)/silicon microdischarge device. The conventional
      microdischarge device had an overall thickness of 57 [mu]m and a
      cavity diameter of 180 [mu]m, both somewhat greater than the
      thickness (30 [mu]m) and diameter (150 [mu]m) of the
      Ni/polyimide/Cu microdischarge device. The solid dots denote
      emission lines produced by the singly-charged neon ion (i.e.,
      Ne&lt;+&gt; ). Note that the two spectra are virtually identical,
      showing strong emission from more than 20 Ne ion transitions. The
      emission intensity of several of the Ne&lt;+&gt; ion transitions
      in the Ni/polyimide/Cu device is weaker than the same transitions
      in the conventional microdischarge device, owing to the smaller
      depth of the cathode. Nevertheless, the strength of the ion
      emission lines from the metal/polymer device show that the
      electron energy distribution has a component that is "hotter"
      (higher energy) than that for a conventional positive column
      discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The microdischarge devices are also remarkably robust. The
      emission intensity as a function of time was measured for a large
      number of microdischarge devices. FIG. 4 shows lifetime data
      obtained for a single Ni/polyimide/Cu microdischarge device
      obtained over a period of 50 hours. This device had a 150 [mu]m
      diameter cavity and was filled with Ne at a pressure of 300 Torr.
      The V-I characteristics of the microdischarge device remained
      stable over the entire 50 hours. Every ten hours, the Ne gas was
      refreshed due to a decline in intensity caused by the outgassing
      of the polymer and a small "background" leak in the vacuum system.
      As shown in FIG. 4, after each refill of Ne gas, the emission
      intensity of the microdischarge device returned to approximately
      the initial value, indicating that no device degradation had
      occurred. Neither the outgassing nor the background leak is a
      limitation of the device itself and obtaining lifetimes that
      exceed several thousand hours is expected to be quite feasible.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] For example, a 3*3 array of Ni/polyimide/Cu microdischarge
      devices operating in 400 Torr of Ne at 4.5 mA and 165 V
      demonstrated intense emissions that could readily be seen across a
      well-lit room. However, if one wishes to fabricate large arrays or
      a collection of microdischarge devices, ohmic losses become a
      problem. Large arrays often do not ignite uniformly; rather,
      devices at the perimeter of the array ignite preferentially
      because of the non-uniformity in the applied voltage difference
      across different cavities in the array. Large arrays contain at
      least 10 individual devices, preferably at least 20 individual
      devices, and more preferably at least 50 or 100 individual
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] To overcome this problem, another embodiment, shown in FIG.
      5, divides the overall array 200 into sub-arrays 204 containing
      individual devices 202 and delivers power separately to the
      sub-arrays 204. The sub-arrays 204 may be independently excited or
      otherwise excited such that the devices 202 no longer ignite
      preferentially. For example, the sub-arrays 204 may have at most
      one of the two electrodes in common or may be excited in parallel.
      Alternatively, the entire array 200 may have multiple conductive
      leads from the voltage source and provided to selected areas of
      the array 200 or may have continuous strips of the conductive
      leads crossing the array 200 in a grid-like manner. Further, each
      device may be individually excited and ballasted. These
      arrangements are only examples of techniques that may be used to
      provide the desired uniformity to the array 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Such designs minimize ohmic losses in the electrodes as
      arrays increase in size and improve the characteristics and
      reproducibility for igniting the array or collection. In addition,
      these designs decrease the voltage variation appearing across
      individual devices in at least 10 of the devices in the array.
      This decrease is such that when a minimum voltage sufficient to
      cause discharging of the at least 10 of the devices is applied
      then the voltage difference between the first and second
      electrodes at every cavity of the discharge devices has a voltage
      difference of no more than 20% of the average voltage difference.
      The lower the voltage difference between a desired set of devices
      in the array, the better the uniformity in emission. Thus, more
      preferably the voltage difference may be no more than 10%, 5%, 2%,
      or 1% of the average voltage difference of at least 10, 20, 50,
      100, 1000 or 10,000 devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In addition to exciting the sub-arrays independently, using
      a multiple film dielectric allows one to realize much larger
      arrays that are well behaved, for the reasons above. The addition
      of a screen on top of one electrode or replacing one of the
      electrodes with a screen still further improves device and array
      characteristics, as discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Some of the embodiments may be manufactured as single
      microdischarge devices or arrays of devices by mass production
      techniques. The materials used in the microdischarge device of
      these embodiments are thin and inexpensive relative to
      conventional microdischarge devices. Similarly, the material
      characteristics of microdischarge devices of the embodiments are
      thus manufacturable by large-scale processes, unlike arrays of
      Si-based microdischarge devices, which are limited in size,
      typically to 12'' Si wafers. One example of such a process is a
      "roll-to-roll" manufacturing process in which individual rolls of
      the three layers of one embodiment (two laminating layers and the
      microdischarge layer, including anode, cathode, and dielectric)
      are assembled into one roll. This assembly would, of course, take
      place in the presence of the desired gas or gas mixture so that
      the finished laminated devices would have the proper gas in each
      microcavity discharge. Also, immediately prior to laminating the
      devices, the microcavities could be formed by any of several
      processes, as mentioned before, including laser micromachining.
      After large sheets of microdischarge devices are fabricated at low
      cost, these sheets may subsequently be cut into smaller sections
      and then fitted with electrical connections to be applied to any
      number of uses.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As described above, a single microdischarge device or
      arrays of devices having an insulating substrate may also be
      produced by the same manufacturing processes. More specifically,
      in large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing, rolls of metal film
      forming the first and second electrodes may be assembled on Kapton
      (as the insulating substrate) and another polymer as the
      insulator. The cavities may then be machined by imaging laser
      radiation onto the metal/polymer/metal sandwich through a mask.
      Such imaging techniques are well-known in the laser micromachining
      industry. The cavities may also be formed by alternate methods,
      such as mechanically drilling or punching holes.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] To mass-produce the microdischarge devices also may require
      an inexpensive means of sealing the microdischarge device. As
      discussed above, the microdischarge device may be sealed by
      lamination with an optically transmissive material to enclose the
      cavity containing the gas. The process may include sealing the
      microdischarge device or array of microdischarge devices between
      two sheets of optically transmissive material in the presence of
      the desired gas (in much the same way a driver's license is
      laminated).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A conventional plastic laminate may be used to seal the
      device. One problem with this is that the plastic may outgas
      impurities into the gas and limit the lifetime of the laminated
      microdischarge device. However, the lifetime the sealing material
      is not a fundamental limitation on the device lifetime. For
      example, the lifetime of the microdischarge device will increase
      when using sealing materials that outgas less. Similarly,
      depositing a thin transmissive film, such as tantalum oxide or
      glass, onto conventional laminating sheets will impede or
      eliminate the outgassing process and extend the lifetime of the
      microdischarge devices. Another alternative may be a vacuum baking
      procedure to significantly reduce the outgassing of the
      conventional laminate sheets.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 6A, the device
      300 includes a conducting screen electrode (or screen) 310 that is
      in contact with and extends across at least one of the first
      electrode 304 or the second electrode 306 of the microdischarge
      device 20. The screen 310 improves both the lifetime and light
      output of the microdischarge device 300, making it more efficient
      by allowing the device 300 to operate at lower voltages and
      producing greater light output power at the same power. The result
      of this is that the emission intensity of discharge from the end
      of the cavity 302 in which the screen 310 is present is up to, for
      example, an order of magnitude larger than the emission intensity
      when a screen 310 is not present.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The screen 310, as shown in FIG. 6B, preferably has
      openings that are no larger than the diameter of the cavity 302 of
      the microdischarge device 300. Preferably, screens 310 are
      constructed of a metal such as Ni, Au, or Cu, which are available
      commercially as sample holders for Transmission Electron
      Microscopy (TEM) and are chosen such that most of the light
      reaching the screen 310 from the microdischarge passes through the
      screen 310. The thickness of the screen 310 may range from 10 A-10
      mm, and preferably ranges from 1 [mu]m-500 [mu]m including 10 A-10
      [mu]m, 10 A-1 [mu]m, and 100 A-1 [mu]m. Other conductive materials
      may also be used to form the screen 310, such as ITO, which does
      not absorb substantially at a wavelength emitted by the discharge.
      The screen 310 may be mounted onto either (or both) the first
      electrode 304 or second electrode 306. The screen 310 presents a
      more uniform electrostatic potential to the discharge in the
      cavity 302 as the screen 310 covers at least part of the hole in
      the electrodes 304 and 306.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Alternatively, FIG. 6C shows an embodiment of a device 350
      in which the conducting screen 356 replaces the second electrode,
      rather than being disposed on the second electrode. Although FIG.
      6C depicts an embodiment in which the screen 356 replaces the
      second electrode, as above, the screen 356 may replace the first
      electrode 354 or screens may replace both electrodes. An insulator
      358 is disposed between the screen 356 and the other electrode
      354, with the cavity 352 present as above. One feature of a
      microdischarge device 300 having a screen 310 is that the emission
      intensity of light from the end of the cavity 302 in which the
      screen 310 is present is up to an order of magnitude larger than
      the emission intensity emerging from the other end of the cavity
      302 in which the screen 310 is not present. In one example, a
      Ni/polyimide/Cu microdischarge array having a Ni screen with 55
      [mu]m*55 [mu]m square openings and in contact with the second
      electrode exhibited intense emission and was clearly observed
      across a well-lit room.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In addition to light being emitted from the cavity,
      electrons may also be extracted from the cavity of the
      microdischarge device via the screen electrode, thereby forming a
      plasma cathode. This may be used in another embodiment,
      illustrated in FIG. 7, in which a microdischarge device 400
      includes a phosphor or electroluminescent material 412 disposed
      onto the screen 410. Although not shown, the phosphor or
      electroluminescent material 412 may also be disposed onto a
      non-conducting window adjacent to the screen 410 on the opposing
      side of the screen 410 as the second electrode 406. In addition,
      the phosphor or electroluminescent material 412 may be disposed on
      both sides of the device 400.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Thus, in this embodiment, electrons are generated in the
      cavity 402 by the voltage potential between the second electrode
      406 and the first electrode 404. The majority of the electrons are
      then extracted from the cavity 402 through the screen 410 and then
      impinge upon the phosphor or electroluminescent material 412,
      which luminesces. As in the embodiment shown in FIG. 6C, the
      screen 410 may replace one of the electrodes 404 and 406,
      preferably at least the electrode disposed under the phosphor or
      electroluminescent material 412. Furthermore, one variation on
      this embodiment would be to insert a non-conducting layer between
      the screen 410 and the proximate electrode. This would allow one
      to operate the microdischarge continuously but illuminate the
      phosphor 412 only when a voltage pulse is applied between the
      insulator 408 and the screen 410 that would attract the electrons
      towards the screen 410.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] An alternative embodiment, in which the second electrode
      and screen electrode are replaced by a conducting (but optically
      transmissive) electrode 512, is shown in the microdischarge device
      500 in FIG. 8. The conducting electrode 512 is a combination of
      layers that may include a conducting film 508 disposed on a
      supporting surface 510. The conducting film 508 is fabricated from
      at least one material that is both conducting and optically
      transmissive, such as ITO and is disposed over the entire
      insulator 506 including the opening to the cavity 502. The
      conducting film 508 serves as the second electrode but, in
      addition, establishes a uniform potential surface for the
      discharge cavity 502, similar to the screen of previous
      embodiments. The supporting surface 510 may be fabricated from at
      least one optically transmissive material and may be formed from a
      conducting material. In addition, the material forming the
      supporting surface 510 may act as a combination supporting
      surface, window, and material sealing the cavity 502. Examples of
      acceptable materials used to form the supporting surface 510
      include glass, plastics and resin/polymers. Furthermore, window
      510 need not be fully transmissive but, for some applications,
      translucence will suffice. As above, the first electrode 504 may
      also be replaced by a similar conducting electrode 512.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A method for fabricating the conducting electrode 512
      includes forming the insulator 506 on the first electrode 504
      (using one of the methods mentioned above), depositing the
      conducting film 508 onto the supporting surface 510, and then
      sealing the structure by combining these layers. The conducting
      electrode 512, containing the conducting film 508, traverses the
      entire microdischarge device 500 or array of microdischarge
      devices and again presents a more uniform potential surface to the
      discharge cavity 502. An advantage of this embodiment over the
      embodiment containing a screen electrode is that the light output
      of the microdischarge device or array of microdischarge devices is
      not limited by the openness of the screen.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] A number of potential applications of microdischarge
      technology would become accessible if thin, low cost
      microdischarge arrays were available. Custom lighting and
      photodynamic therapy are two such examples of industrial and
      medical applications that would be ideally suited for such a
      technology. Photodynamic therapy, for example, is a medical
      treatment of rapidly growing importance that involves destroying
      harmful cells in the human bloodstream with light. The target
      cells are "tagged" with a chromophore (light absorbing molecular
      ligand) that, after attaching to specific cells in the
      bloodstream, typically absorbs light strongly in the red or
      near-infrared, for example, by chemically attaching a chromophore
      to an antibody specific for the cell. This wavelength range is of
      particular interest because human skin transmits (passes) light in
      this spectral region. When the light enters the bloodstream and is
      absorbed by the chromophore, the cell is destroyed. A thin, low
      cost, flexible and efficient source of red or near-infrared light
      would be ideally suited for this application. A flexible sheet of
      microdischarges, emitting in the red, for example, could be
      wrapped around the arm of a patient with a VELCRO strip in much
      the same way that blood pressure is measured. For a predetermined
      period, such as an hour or two, the patient could read or perform
      other light activity as the phototherapy is carried out. Once
      treatment is completed, the light source could be discarded
      because of its low cost. That is, each patient would be treated
      with a new "arm wrap" source. Such a product will also have
      numerous applications in manufacturing (polymer curing,
      stereolithography), and medicine (germicidal applications,
      phototherapy, cellular diagnostics).<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Another use of multiple microdischarge devices is gas
      chromatography i.e. the determination of the composition of a gas.
      In this application, a gas flows laterally between a planar array
      of microdischarge devices and an opposing planar array of
      detectors. Each detector has an optical axis that coincides with
      the corresponding microdischarge device and has a filter that
      transmits a particular wavelength or set of wavelengths (i.e. a
      bandpass, low-pass or high-pass filter). Only particular
      wavelengths are transmitted by the gas, while others are absorbed.
      Thus, each detector detects light of a particular wavelength
      generated by the microdischarge devices and that passes through
      the gas present. As the gas to be tested enters each
      microdischarge, it is energized (excited) and emits light at
      wavelengths characteristic of the particular gas. Each detector,
      then, would observe a particular wavelength region, enabling the
      composition of the gas flow stream (or the presence of impurities
      in the gas flow stream) to be determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] One method to determine the composition is to have the
      planar array emit light of a broad set of wavelengths and vary the
      filters of the corresponding detectors. Another method to
      determine the composition is to vary the wavelength of the light
      emitted from the microdischarge devices in the planar array,
      perhaps by varying the gas that fills the microdischarge devices,
      and having the same filter for each corresponding detector. In
      either case, data are collected and the composition of the gas
      determined from the transmission/absorption spectra of the gas.
      The microdischarge devices may emit either incoherent light (such
      as the custom lighting arrays above) or coherent light (as
      described by the microlasers described below). Alternately, these
      methods may be combined-that is, various sets of microdischarge
      devices in the array could emit light of the same wavelength, with
      each set emitting light of a different wavelength from another
      set. In this case, various filters may be used to transmit light
      to the detectors. Note that in some applications, such as chemical
      sensors, only a few tens of individual devices may be required,
      while in other applications, such as industrial lighting,
      thousands to millions of individual lighting may be required.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The microdischarge device 600 may also be combined to form
      a stack of individual microdischarge devices 618 and 620, as shown
      in FIG. 9A. The microdischarge device 600 comprises a first
      microdischarge device 618, including a first electrode 604,
      insulator 606, and second electrode 608 similar to the individual
      devices shown in FIG. 1 and a second microdischarge device 620
      comprising another second electrode 616, insulator 614, and first
      electrode 612. An insulating material 610 is disposed between the
      first microdischarge device 618 and the second microdischarge
      device 620. The number of microdischarge devices present in the
      microdischarge device 600 is arbitrary, depending on the desired
      characteristics of the overall device. However, the cavity 602 of
      the microdischarge device 600 is formed by aligning the cavities
      of the individual microdischarge devices 618 and 620 for greater
      efficiency or by machining cavity 602 through layers 604-616 once
      the structure has been assembled.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 9B, one second electrode or
      first electrode for each device and the insulating material
      between the devices may be removed in forming a microdischarge
      device 700. In this case, the first electrode 708 for the first
      microdischarge device 714 may serve as the second electrode for
      the second microdischarge device 716. Thus, the structure of the
      microdischarge device 700 may be: second electrode1 704,
      insulator1 706, first electrode1/second electrode2 708,
      insulators2 710, first electrode2/second electrode3 712, etc . . .
      , with the cavities 702 aligned. Similarly, any of the
      microdischarge devices of the preceding embodiments may be
      stacked. In another embodiment (not shown) the microdischarge
      devices may be essentially back-to-back, i.e. the second electrode
      for the first microdischarge device may serve as the second
      electrode for the next microdischarge device or the first
      electrode for the first microdischarge device may serve as the
      first electrode for the next microdischarge device.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The microdischarge devices 600 and 700 may be fabricated in
      a manner similar to that given above for the individual
      microdischarge devices in the above embodiments, i.e., fabrication
      of the microdischarge device 700 may be relatively simple in an
      embodiment in which the layers are successively stacked: second
      electrode1 704, insulator1 706, first electrode1/second electrode2
      708, insulator2 710, and first electrode2/second electrode3 712.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The cavity 702 may be formed either in each layer
      individually before stacking the layers or after the layers have
      been stacked. The cavity 702 of the microdischarge devices 600 and
      700 may be filled with the selected gas and then sealed. For
      example, the microdischarge device 700 may be positioned in a
      vacuum chamber, the chamber evacuated and then backfilled with the
      selected gas, and the cavity 702 sealed. A microdischarge device
      having a screen electrode or optically transmissive conducting
      film may additionally require mechanical assembly of the layers in
      a vacuum chamber that has been backfilled with the selected gas to
      permit the gas to fill the cavity of each individual
      microdischarge device.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] One application using the microdischarge device 600 and 700
      is a multi-stage structure for the remediation of toxic gases.
      This application entails flowing a gas that is environmentally
      hazardous or toxic through a series of microdischarges in the
      cavity 602 to break down the gas into benign products.
      Alternatively, the products of the gas discharge can be reacted
      with a titration gas (02, N2, etc.) to produce a benign product
      rather than being completely broken down. In this application, the
      flow of the hazardous/toxic gas through the cavity 602 is
      imperative, and thus, the microdischarge device 600 and 700 would
      not be sealed by a laminate. Similarly, the individual
      microdischarge devices 618 and 620 would not be sealed by a
      conducting film disposed between the succeeding dielectric layers
      (although a screen electrode may still be disposed between the
      succeeding microdischarge devices 618 and 620).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The microdischarge device 600 shown in FIG. 9A is also
      ideally suited for realizing a microlaser. Additional components
      (not shown) that are well known in the art, such as a mirror set,
      may be used to realize the microlaser. The stack of individual
      microdischarge devices 618 and 620 are aligned such that the
      discharge axes are coincident. These microlasers can generate
      ultraviolet (N2 rare gas halide excimers), visible, or infrared
      radiation that may be used in materials processing or atmospheric
      diagnostic applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] As mentioned before, while one focus of the present
      invention has been generally toward a flexible microdischarge
      device, some applications may not require flexibility, e.g.,
      custom lighting, gas chromatography, and lasers. Benefits are
      conferred in these applications by the use of a thin insulator
      between the second electrode and first electrode other than
      silicon. The use of a thin insulator reduces the thickness of the
      various devices and additionally decreases the material and
      fabrication costs of the microdischarge device compared with
      conventional microdischarge devices using silicon (for example,
      which must be etched to form the cavity). The lack of necessity of
      flexibility for these applications allows some of the materials
      used in the microdischarge devices described above to include more
      rigid, yet inexpensive materials. For example, in some
      applications the second electrode or first electrode may be
      constructed of amorphous or polycrystalline silicon instead of
      metal. Similarly, the insulator sandwiched between the second
      electrode and first electrode may be an undoped or low doped
      semiconductor. For example, silicon with a doping of 10&lt;15 &gt;
      cm&lt;-3 &gt; or less may be sufficient to form an insulator.
      Additionally, material to seal the cavity or the supporting
      surface for the conducting film that replaces the metal second
      electrode may be glass rather than a plastic or resin. Although Si
      is generally used as the preferred material, any semiconductor
      material, such as group IV (Ge, diamond), III-V (GaAs, InP) and
      II-VI (ZnSe) materials, may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] While the present invention has been described with
      reference to specific embodiments, the description is illustrative
      of the invention and not to be construed as limiting the
      invention. Various modifications and applications may occur to
      those skilled in the art without departing from the true spirit
      and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
