      <p>As Gene Mollinet sits patiently working away in his shop, cars
        rumble by outside spewing exhaust the machine he has developed
        may someday make a thing of the past. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, officials and county planners sit in plush board
        rooms bickering over the size and number of oil rigs they'll
        soon add to the string already snaking down the Santa Barbara
        Channel. Still, Mollinet works, the machine taking shape among
        the Goleta inventor's clutter. He looks up, his Maui-tanned skin
        wrinkled from squinting at the tiny electrical parts and wires
        which make up his machine. His shirt, well, it's a mess. His
        hair, it's a mess too. Unkempt, with little education beyond
        high school --- he's a stereotypical inventor. Mollinet has a
        hard time explaining to someone as poorly versed in electronics
        as I am exactly what he is building or how it works. </p>
      <p>The machine, he says, makes useable electric energy without
        using any fuel. It is as simple as that. It is started with a
        regular car battery, but after the battery is unhooked, the
        "Power Unit" keeps running until he turns it of. It is called
        LEM3, and he plans to put it in a plane and show the world what
        it can do by taking a 5-day spin around the world using no fuel.
      </p>
      <p>A bit far-fetched? Mollinet is dead serious. The invention has
        a patent pending, and LEM3 development corporation was formed in
        1982, and a batch of California capital stock has been sold.
        What’s more, Mollinet says he is not the only one with the
        fuel-free idea. He claims that about 10 other inventors across
        the country are also racing to develop similar use of energy
        created through the magic contained within a magnetic field ---
        the same magic that fascinates every child who has ever picked
        up a magnet and wondered about its invisible attraction when
        held near a refrigerator. </p>
      <p>Mollinet never lost that fascination, which heightened as he
        was flying P51s for the Air Force during the Korean War. He
        pulled apart a plane radio one day, and received a strange shock
        from one of the crystals used to latch onto radio frequencies.
        The crystal, e surmised in all innocence, was either storing
        energy or building its own. Coupled with a magnetic field,
        similar crystal substances will be used by Mollinet to keep the
        plane itself in the air, and without using any fuel. </p>
      <p><b>[N.B.: I was told that Mollinet used a junction of Pb-FeS in
          a magnetic field to produce power after initial excitation by
          a battery. --- R. N. ]</b> </p>
      <p>In addition to the plane unit on which Mollinet is currently
        working, he has already completed a solid state electrical
        generator which powers a car, and a mechanical home generator.
        He bets his bottom dollar on the plane, though. </p>
      <p>The grand plan is to go to Stead Air Force Base in Nevada where
        the corporation has leased a hanger, and spend the month of
        January modifying a Cessna 152 fuselage to house the LEM3. By
        spring, Mollinet says, the plane will be ready for an air flight
        which could revolutionize the entire power production field. </p>
      <p>Mollinet admits all of this seems a bit strange. As every high
        school physics student has learned, the laws of thermodynamics
        say a machine cannot under any circumstances create more energy
        than it uses. So what gives? “It doesn’t deny those laws”, he
        says, “it adds to them”. </p>
      <p>For obvious reasons, Mollinet won’t say a whole lot about what
        it does add to physical laws. What he does say is that it
        something to do with gyroscopic particles which orbit in a
        magnetic field to produce electricity [N.B.: compare Joe
        Newman’s gyroscopic theory. --- R.N.]. In the plane’s power
        unit, the electricity produced will be used to build up pressure
        in a hydraulic generator which turns the propeller. That’s it. </p>
      <p>From under a pile of blueprints and aviation magazines Mollinet
        pulls out a San Francisco Examiner article from November about a
        man with a similar power unit [N.B.: Probably Joe Newman]. The
        man has been turned down by the US Patent Office for a patent on
        a machine similar to Mollinet’s “I’m way ahead of this guy”,
        Mollinet says. “His machine is, well, it’s primitive”, he adds,
        telling the story of how he already secured a patent pending on
        his device two years ago by showing officials just blueprints
        and providing them with an explanation of his theory. “When I
        went in there at first, I myself only had a suspicion that it
        worked”, he said. </p>
      <p>In the newspaper article, a Sperry Univac official is quoted as
        saying that “the future of the human race may be drastically
        uplifted by the large scale development of this invention”.
        Mollinet says he understands the implications of his machine,
        the changes it could bring, and he says that if he has his way,
        the world will also soon be dealing wit those implications. He
        insists his story will not end with an oil company buying out
        his product and shelving it. “This won’t be squashed”, he says.
      </p>
      <p>“I’d personally like to see all the pollution gone. I’d like to
        see those ugly power poles out there gone, and I’d like to see
        the nuclear power plants tore down”, he says. </p>
      <p>Understandably, Mollinet has a hard time getting people to
        accept the fact that he really does have a prototype unit which
        he uses to energize the television he watches. “People think how
        can a little guy in his shop in Goleta do it when all the big
        guys like Santa Barbara Research and Raytheon can’t do it?”, he
        says. “Compared to the immenseness of what we have, the public
        interest in this has been piss-poor”. </p>
      <p>A show displaying Mollinet’s solid state home unit, the car and
        the mechanical generator was held in August at the Earl Warren
        Showgrounds. The show’s lighting and amplification were powered
        by the LEM3 unit. About 125 people showed up. He has received
        offers to buy his company, he said, but is waiting until after
        he makes the air flight --- until he proves undeniably that the
        unit does what he says. </p>
      <p>The plane now sits in the Nevada hangar with its wings detached
        He is going to replace the wings’ fuel tanks with hydraulic
        fluid reservoirs, and with water tanks --- we’ve got to have
        something to drink up there for 5 days”, he says. After that
        comes the installation of the power unit, and a small fan at the
        rear of the plane for power reciprocation. The test flights
        begin at the end of January. At that point he plans to embark on
        the trip already plotted out on a world map hanging on a
        cluttered wall of his workshop. </p>
      <p>It all seems like a fairy tale, a fantasy of sorts, but
        Mollinet is all business as he pulls out the blueprints for the
        plane and the unit and explains everything in electrical jargon;
        he’s dead serious when he hauls out his corporation papers and
        stock certificates explaining how the corporation was formed. </p>
      <p>When he walks across his shop to a little metal box in the
        corner wit the words LEM3 Power Unit printed on it, hooks up the
        battery cables, flips a switch, unhooks the cables and then
        plugs in a television, and the picture flickers immediately to
        life, it’s much easier to swallow. </p>
      <p>At this point all one can do is stand there, and try to imagine
        the ramifications of such a machine and what it could do for us
        all. </p>

      <p>Goleta inventor Gene Mollinet showed his LE M3 power unit to
        the public for the first time last week at the Earl Warren
        Showgrounds. </p>
      <p>Over 150 people attended the event, viewing what Mollinet
        claims is a unit which puts out electrical power without using
        any fuel, and without giving off any exhaust. </p>
      <p>Three versions of the unit were shown, one which powers a car,
        one which is mechanical, and one which is solid state. </p>
      <p>The solid state model, shown above, was used during the show to
        power a television set hooked up to a computer. </p>
