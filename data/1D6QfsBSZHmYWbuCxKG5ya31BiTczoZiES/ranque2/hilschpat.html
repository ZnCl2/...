          <b>DE19612691</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Method is used in mixing a liquid fuel with air, in which a vortex
      tube is employed. The fuel and air are mixed in a turbulent
      centrifugal field, for supply to the combustion chamber. In this
      method, a Hilsch tube is used. This has opposite, hot and cold
      ends, each with restricted cross-sectional openings. The heated
      gaseous mixture is extracted from the hot end. Also claimed is a
      burner, to carry out the procedure. Regions near the air or fuel
      supply may be heated, or the vortex tube itself is heated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is known that the heat transfer in turbulent centrifugal fields
      is particularly intense (F. Schultz-Grunow, journal "Research in
      the field of engineering", born 1951, Volume 17, Issue 3, pages
      65ff).<br>
      <br>
      This effect causes a vortex tube according to Ranque or Hilsch
      that the incoming ambient temperature air is separated into two
      air streams, one of which is much colder (to &lt;230 K), the other
      much warmer (up to&gt; is 470K) than the incoming air (R. Hilsch,
      "Journal for Nature Research ", born in 1946, volume 1, pages
      208ff).<br>
      <br>
      The achievable temperatures depend on a given geometry of the
      ratio of the outgoing hot and cold air quantities.<br>
      <br>
      An overview of recent applications and appropriate versions of the
      vortex tube conveys L.Bloos, Magazine "The refrigeration and air
      conditioning", No.9 / 1991, pages 620, 621st.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that the reaction liquid fuels complete expires,
      if the fuel is vaporized prior to the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      A desired complete vaporization of the fuel prior to the reaction
      is not yet applied, because the power of the burner can be
      regulated thereby insufficiently.<br>
      That is why today the spray or flame gasification is used, but
      with the disadvantage that larger fuel droplets can move through
      the flame without completely evaporate and burn, thereby reducing
      the efficiency and increase the gaseous and solid emissions.<br>
      <br>
      However, to achieve a fine atomization of the fuel, as is
      necessary for the effective and low-carbon conversion, which is
      injected into the flame fuel quantity can not be arbitrarily
      small.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, domestic heating have today usually so services that
      they can not be operated continuously.<br>
      <br>
      The required heat output is adjusted by intermittent operation of
      the burner.<br>
      <br>
      This operating condition but requires on average higher inlet
      temperatures, and thus lead to higher losses than in the
      continuous operation of home heating would be necessary.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, it is known that even less evaporated volatile liquid
      fuels in Zentrifugalströmungsfeld a vortex tube partially and with
      air can be mixed (DE-PS 2 87 835).<br>
      <br>
      Also described in this specification that the vortex tube exiting
      the fuel / air mixture additionally secondary air to be supplied
      for finer atomization of the fuel droplets still present in the
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The specified invention addresses the problem of reducing the
      emissions from the conversion of liquid fuels in a combustor, and
      reduce fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      This problem is solved in that in a vortex tube according to
      Ranque / Hilsch liquid fuel is given.<br>
      <br>
      The Regulati is thereby taken according to its partial pressure of
      the carrier gas.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the partial pressure of the fuel exponentially mi the
      temperature rises, allows even those volatile fuels at the high
      temperatures that can be reached at the hot end of the vortex
      tube, form a combustible mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The turbulent flow field in the vortex tube ensures a good mixture
      of fuel vapor and carrier gas.<br>
      <br>
      If flow control is achieved by appropriate or devices for
      performing the method according to claims 2 and 3 that the fuel
      the vortex tube only gaseous can leave a constant mixture
      composition is achieved as long as liquid fuel is included in the
      vortex tube.<br>
      <br>
      This has several advantages over conventional burners, namely:<br>
      <br>
      The fuel supply (continuous or intermittent) has no influence on
      the mixture formation.<br>
      <br>
      This permits the intermittent operation of the pump for the liquid
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The quantity of fuel that enters the combustion chamber, and thus
      the burner output depends only on the temperature d hot end of the
      vortex tube.<br>
      <br>
      This temperature can be very effectively by varying the ratio of
      the outgoing hot and cold Luftströ set.<br>
      <br>
      This results in the ability to easily adjust the burner output,
      which makes possible (for example, by throttling the cold air
      flow) continuous operation of a heating system.<br>
      <br>
      Even if the mixture cools down as it enters into the combustion
      chamber through the expansion, so that fuel auskondensi are the
      droplets formed significantly smaller and therefore burn more
      completely than is possible with conventional burners.<br>
      <br>
      In order to minimize the additional energy required for the
      compression of the carrier gas at reasonable limits, the
      temperature of the hot end of the vortex tube can be so high that
      the mixture überstoichometrisch enters the combustion chamber
      where 4 secondary air is mixed according to patent claim.<br>
      <br>
      This may, in particular for low volatile fuels, be necessary to
      heat individual portions of the apparatus in accordance with claim
      5 by external heat supply.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the good controllability is not lost.<br>
      <br>
      The intense heat exchange in the turbulent centrifugal ensures for
      defined conditions at the hot end of the vortex tube, no matter
      what the temperature level.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 1 and will be
      described in more detail below.<br>
      <br>
      Compressed carrier gas (usually air) flows out of a pressure
      vessel (2) in the vicinity of the tube wall tangentially into the
      vortex tube (1).<br>
      <br>
      One possible dosing of the carrier gas through a valve in the
      supply line does not appear necessary because the carrier gas flow
      is determined by the state at the inlet to the vortex tube, which
      is usually the critical state is reached.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly high temperature differences between the two ends of
      the vortex tube resulting apparent when the gas inlet is located
      as close as possible to the cold end (1b).<br>
      <br>
      The turbulent flow in vortex tube ensures that near the axis of
      the tube part of the gas to the aperture at the cold end (1b)
      flows, releasing heat.<br>
      <br>
      The temperatures of the warm (1a) and the cold end (1b) of the
      vortex tube, as described above, determined by the ratio of hot to
      cold air flow.<br>
      <br>
      This ratio is in this embodiment determined by throttling of the
      cold air flow, wherein the throttling of the warm air stream is
      also conceivable.<br>
      <br>
      In the distance to the cold end through a small opening (3) is
      pumped in the vortex tube liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The place of this opening should be chosen such that the fuel can
      not come into contact with the cold air flow because this fuel
      with the cold air flow from the pipe would be transported.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the fuel supply should not be too close to the
      hot end of the vortex tube to ensure intensive as possible mass
      and heat transfer between the carrier gas and liquid fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The saturated carrier gas with fuel passing through the aperture
      in the warm end (1a) of the vortex tube in the combustion chamber
      (4), where the fuel is reacted.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, the inlet is in the combustion chamber have a suitable
      flow guidance, as known from gas burners.<br>

      Apparatuses and methods are provided for producing hydrogen (H2)
      and oxygen (O2) from water (H2O). The apparatuses may comprise a
      dissociation chamber for dissociation water to hydrogen ions and
      oxygen ions, a separation apparatus for separating the hydrogen
      ions form the oxygen ions, a device for the de -ionization of
      hydrogen ions and oxygen ions to H2 and O2, and a combustion
      chamber for reacting H2 and O2 to generate H2O in an exothermic
      process. In the dissociation chamber, water may be dissociated
      with the aid of interpenetrating magnetic and/or electromagnetic
      fields. In the separation apparatus, hydrogen ions may be
      separated from oxygen ions with the aid of a Ranque-Hilsch vortex
      and an electrostatic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention relates to dissociating water into hydrogen
      and oxygen, more particularly to dissociating water into hydrogen
      and oxygen with the aid of electromagnetic resonance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] A hydrogen-based energy economy could provide significant
      advantages over the current carbon-based economy. Specifically, a
      hydrogen-based economy allows for reduced production of greenhouse
      gases (such as, e.g., CO2) and reduced reliance on foreign
      resources. The benefits of a hydrogen-based economy may be
      maximized when renewable resources derived from solar, wind, and
      thermal energy (e.g., geothermal energy) are used for hydrogen
      production.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydrogen can be generated from water via the dissociation
      of water via the following endothermic reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2 H2O(I) ^ 2 H2(g) + O2(g)<br>
      <br>
      H2 may be subsequently stored and used as fuel in various
      combustion engines, such as automobiles and electric turbines for
      generating electricity. For instance, H2 and O2 may be reacted to
      form water via the following exothermic reaction:<br>
      <br>
      O2(g) + 2 H2(g) ^ 2 H2O(l)<br>
      <br>
      The energy obtained form this reaction can be used to generate
      steam, which may subsequently be used to drive a turbine to
      generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There are techniques available in the art for facilitating
      the dissociation of water. In electrolysis, for instance, an
      electric current is used to dissociate water into hydrogen and
      oxygen gases. Unfortunately, current electrolysis techniques can
      be energy intensive and inefficient, preventing hydrogen from
      becoming a dominant resource for mainstream energy usage.
      Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved methods for
      dissociating water into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The invention provides an apparatus and method for high
      efficiency dissociation of water into ionized hydrogen (e.g.,
      H&lt;+&gt;, H2&lt;+&gt; ) and oxygen (20&lt;"&gt;, O2&lt;"&gt;).
      The ionized hydrogen and oxygen can be de-ionized to form hydrogen
      (H2) and oxygen (O2). In some embodiments, the hydrogen and oxygen
      can be reacted to reform water. The water can be in a chemically
      and biologically purified form, while deriving energy for
      continuing the purified water production. In other embodiments,
      the hydrogen and oxygen can be combusted to reform water and drive
      energy production in a conventional steam turbine per the
      following equation: 2 H2 + O2 -&gt; 2 H2O.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The apparatus (or device) for dissociating water and
      producing hydrogen and oxygen can be utilized in parallel for
      production of a large quantity of hydrogen (H2). The apparatus can
      be of any size. In an embodiment, the apparatus can be about the
      size of a breadbox. In some embodiments, the apparatus is of an
      appropriate size that can be readily used in vehicles to provide
      energy. In some embodiments of the invention, the energy or water
      production capability of the apparatus can be scaled appropriately
      for the amount of power or water to be produced, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The apparatus can comprise a resonance dissociation chamber
      and a Ranque- Hilsch vortex. The resonance dissociation chamber
      may comprise one or more magnetic fields. In an embodiment, the
      resonance dissociation chamber comprises interpenetrating magnetic
      and/or electromagnetic fields. The Ranque-Hilsch vortex can be
      combined with an electrostatic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In embodiments, high temperature steam can be fed to a
      resonance dissociation chamber that produces ionized hydrogen and
      ionized oxygen by utilizing multiple magnetic and electromagnetic
      fields and a kinetic vortex. The magnetic and/or electromagnetic
      fields can be interpenetrating magnetic and/or electromagnetic
      fields. Ionized species can be subsequently separated using a
      modified Ranque-Hilsch vortex and electrostatic fields. In an
      embodiment, the ionized species can be subsequently de-ionized by
      a modified electron exchange membrane to produce hydrogen (H2) and
      oxygen (O2). Hydrogen and oxygen can be combusted to produce water
      and energy. In an embodiment, water may be recycled to generate
      hydrogen and oxygen via the resonance dissociation chamber. [0010]
      The apparatus can be comprised of both hardware and software.
      Various components may be unique to this invention, making use of
      recent developments in hardware processing speed and methods in
      software design.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In an aspect of the invention, a system for producing
      hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) is provided. The system comprises at
      least one steam production vessel, a dissociation reactor having a
      series of interpenetrating magnetic and/or electromagnetic fields
      downstream from the at least one steam production vessel, and a
      separation chamber for creating a Ranque-Hilsch vortex and an
      electrostatic field, the separation chamber downstream of the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In another aspect of the invention, a system for generating
      electricity is provided. The system comprises at least one steam
      production vessel and a dissociation chamber comprising a series
      of interpenetrating magnetic fields downstream of the at least one

      apparatus configured to create a Ranque-Hilsch vortex and an
      electrostatic field. The system further comprises a de-ionizing
      filter downstream of the separation apparatus and a combustion
      chamber downstream of the de-ionizing filter. [0013] In yet
      another aspect of the invention, a system for purifying water is
      provided. The system comprises one or more steam production
      vessels. The system further comprises a dissociation apparatus
      disposed downstream of the one or more steam production vessels,

      interpenetrating magnetic and/or electromagnetic fields, the
      dissociation apparatus configured to create a Ranque-Hilsch vortex
      and an electrostatic field for separating hydrogen ions and oxygen
      ions. A de-ionizing apparatus (or filter) is disposed downstream
      of the dissociation apparatus, the de -ionizing apparatus
      configured to generate hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) from hydrogen
      ions and oxygen ions from the dissociation apparatus. The system
      further comprises a combustion chamber downstream of the de-
      ionizing apparatus and a condensation chamber downstream of the
      combustion chamber. [0014] In still another aspect of the
      invention, a method for producing hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) is
      provided. The method comprises providing water (H2O) to a
      dissociation reactor (also "dissociation chamber" herein) having a
      series of interpenetrating magnetic and/or electromagnetic fields.
      In an embodiment, the water provided to the dissociation reactor
      is steam. Next, hydrogen ions and oxygen ions are generated in the
      dissociation reactor. The hydrogen ions and oxygen ions are then
      directed to a separation apparatus configured to separate the
      hydrogen ions from the oxygen ions. Next, the hydrogen ions and
      oxygen ions are directed to a de-ionizing apparatus configured to
      generate hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) from the hydrogen ions and
      oxygen ions.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] The invention provides for the rapid and high efficiency
      dissociation of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen ions. The
      hydrogen and oxygen ions can be de -ionized to H2 and O2, thereby
      extracting electricity, burned together to produce heat, and then
      condensed to provide chemically and biologically pure water.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Water is comprised of two hydrogen atoms and a single
      oxygen atom joined by two hydrogen-oxygen covalent bonds. The
      molecular arrangement of the hydrogen atoms about the oxygen atom
      creates a polar molecule (or a molecule having a dipole moment).
      The polar or dipole nature of water allows not only for hydrogen
      bonding to occur, but for a magnetic field to control the
      orientation of a water molecule. The magnetic field may be used to
      impart energy to the water molecule. When placed in a magnetic
      field, a water molecule will align with the field to an extent
      inversely proportional to its own kinetic energy and relative to
      the strength of the magnetic field. The force exerted to align the
      molecule is known as magnetic torquing, and its effect causes the
      molecule to precess about the direction of the magnetic field at a
      frequency relative to the magnetic torque applied and dependent
      upon the molecule's frequency components.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Apparatuses and methods of various embodiments of the
      invention provide for dissociation of water molecules to form
      ionized hydrogen (e.g., H&lt;+&gt;, H2&lt;+&gt;) and ionized
      oxygen (e.g., O&lt;2'&gt;, O2&lt;"&gt;), for the separation of
      ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen, for the de- ionization of the
      ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen to form H2 and O2,
      respectively, and for the production of energy by the conversion
      of hydrogen and oxygen to water. [0022] Various aspects of the
      invention make use of the polar nature of water to dissociate
      water into ionized hydrogen and oxygen using a magnetic field. The
      two ionized species are subsequently separated using an
      electrostatic field in conjunction with a Ranque- Hilsch vortex.
      In certain embodiments, a modified electron exchange membrane
      de-ionizes the separated hydrogen ions and oxygen ions. The
      apparatus for dissociation of water and de- ionization to hydrogen
      and oxygen may be collectively referred to as an inertial-kinetic
      electro-magnetic resonance (IKEMR) reactor. In some embodiments,
      the IKEMR reactor may comprise a separate dissociation chamber (or
      reactor) for dissociating H2O and a separate device or apparatus
      downstream of the dissociation chamber for separating hydrogen
      ions and oxygen ions into separate streams of hydrogen ions and
      oxygen ions. In a preferable embodiment, the IKEMR reactor
      dissociates water to ionized hydrogen and oxygen and also
      separates the ionized species. A modified electron exchange
      membrane may subsequently de-ionize the species to form hydrogen
      gas and oxygen gas. In some embodiments of the invention, the
      hydrogen gas and oxygen gas may be combusted to produce water and
      energy, which may be used to provide energy to the IKEMR reactor.
      Dissociation of Water to Ionized Hydrogen and Ionized Oxygen
      [0023] As shown in Figure 1 , water may be used to produce ionized
      hydrogen and ionized oxygen. Liquid state water may be filtered
      and pumped into an input reservoir for storage. Water from the
      input reservoir may be pumped into a pressure vessel to be heated
      and converted into high pressure steam using a series of pressure
      vessels and heat exchangers. At any time, each of the vessels may
      be in one of four phases (or stages): a "Fill Phase", "Heat
      Phase", "Run Phase", or "Backwash Phase". The phases may be cycled
      through sequentially in each of the vessels, controlled by valves,
      which may be much in the way a four-stroke combustion engine works
      (i.e., in a four-stroke Otto-type engine, the engine goes through
      adiabatic compression, heat addition at constant volume, adiabatic
      expansion, and rejection of heat at constant volume). Water may be
      fed into a vessel during the Fill Phase. In the Fill Phase water
      may be fed unpressurized. While that is happening, water
      previously fed into a second vessel can be heated during its Heat
      Phase. While those are happening, water in a third vessel, which
      has gone through its Fill and Heat Phases, can be boiled to form
      pressurized steam during its Run Phase. The steam can be fed into
      the dissociation process. A fourth vessel, having finished its Run
      Phase, may then enter its Backwash Phase, where residual
      pollutants and contaminants, left by the distillation of the water
      during the Heating and Run Phases, are cleaned out. If brackish or
      sea water is used as the source water, minerals existing in sea
      water can be claimed or removed from the residue. By combusting
      the hydrogen and oxygen product of the dissociation process, high
      temperature water vapor can be formed and can be condensed in the
      heat exchangers to provide heat for the Heat Phase and then either
      outputted as purified water or fed back into a vessel in its Fill
      Phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] With reference to FIG. 1, in some embodiments, high
      pressure and high temperature steam may be fed from a vessel in
      its Run Phase into a dissociation chamber (or dissociation
      apparatus) comprising multiple magnetic and/or electromagnetic
      fields, and further comprising a modified Ranque-Hilsch tube, that
      can collectively use magnetic torquing and vortex kinetics to
      dissociate water into segregated (or separate) streams of ionized
      hydrogen (e.g., H&lt;+&gt;) and ionized oxygen (e.g.,
      O&lt;2"&gt;). In an embodiment, the multiple magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic fields may be interpenetrating magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic fields. The dissociation chamber can also be
      referred to as the IKEMR reactor or the resonance dissociation
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In some embodiments of the invention, the dissociation
      chamber is controlled using high-speed processors and specialized
      software.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Deionization of Species to Hydrogen and Oxygen</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] As shown in FIG. 1, the ionized hydrogen and oxygen species
      can be de-ionized using a charge filter. The charge filter can
      also be referred to as a modified electron exchange membrane. In
      an embodiment, the charge filter may operate like a proton
      exchange membrane (PEM). The charge filter may allow for the
      extraction of electrons from ionized oxygen, resulting in oxygen
      gas (O2). Concurrently, electrons can be donated to ionized
      hydrogen, resulting in hydrogen gas (H2).<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In some embodiments of the invention, the modified electron
      exchange membrane is controlled by specialized software and
      hardware, such as high-speed processors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reaction of Hydrogen and Oxygen</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] FIG. 1 shows a combustion chamber for combustion of
      hydrogen and oxygen to drive the production of electricity by a
      turbine generator. The combustion chamber can be a standard
      apparatus used to burn hydrogen and oxygen and consequently drive
      electricity production by a turbine generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In some embodiments of the invention, the combustion
      chamber is controlled by specialized software and hardware, such
      as high-speed processors.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A portion of the heat produced by combustion of hydrogen
      and oxygen may be used to heat the water that is fed to the IKEMR
      reactor. In other embodiments of the invention, the electricity
      produced by the turbine generator may be used to power the
      electronics of the IKEMR reactor and the hardware used to control
      the IKEMR reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Controller</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] FIG. 1 shows a controller comprised of at least one
      high-speed solid-state processor and specialized software for
      controlling any or all of the following: a) the valve and pressure
      vessel system; b) the dissociation chamber; c) the charge filter;
      and d) the combustion chamber and turbine generator. The
      controller may be configured to control various process
      parameters, such as flow rates, pressures and temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In some embodiments of the invention, the controller may be
      used to tune oscillating magnetic fields to frequencies based on a
      mean velocity of molecules in a vortex and/or a minimum duration
      of molecules in a dynamic field. The controller may adjust the
      periodicity of the molecules to be sufficiently small so as to
      limit charge dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The controller may be used to micro-adjust oscillation
      frequencies used in the dissociation of water to form ionized
      hydrogen and ionized oxygen. The oscillation frequencies may be
      adjusted to maintain peak current loading corresponding to peak
      adsorption of energy by water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The controller may also be used to adjust radio frequency
      generators used in catalyzing the dissociation of water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Additional Components</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0035] With continued reference to FIG. 1, additional components
      of the apparatus may include a backwash reservoir for storage of
      distillation residue, an input reservoir, and a condenser for
      cooling water formed after combustion of hydrogen (H2) and oxygen
      (O2) for the formation of purified hot water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Energy Inputs and Outputs</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] With reference to FIG. 2, an external heat source and
      electricity source may be used to initiate the dissociation and
      deionization of water to hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2).<br>
      <br>
      An external heat source may be used to produce high-pressure steam
      from the input water source. An external electricity source may be
      used to power the resonance dissociation reactor to dissociate
      water to ionized hydrogen (e.g., H&lt;+&gt;) and ionized oxygen
      (e.g., O&lt;2"&gt;). The resonance dissociation reactor can
      produce ionic hydrogen and ionic oxygen at high pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Ionic hydrogen and ionic oxygen can be fed to a modified electron
      exchange membrane for de-ionization.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Energy can be produced by the de-ionization of hydrogen and
      oxygen by a modified electron exchange membrane. Hydrogen and
      oxygen produced during the de-ionization process can be stored for
      later use by, e.g., consumers. Alternatively, the hydrogen and
      oxygen can be combusted to produce heat and electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] With continued reference to FIG. 2, the combustion of
      hydrogen and oxygen may provide energy for steam production. In
      addition, the de -ionization of ionized hydrogen and ionized
      oxygen may provide energy, which may be used to dissociate H2O in
      the IKEMR reactor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IKEMR reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] With reference to FIG. 3, the IKEMR reactor can dissociate
      water to ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen. A magnetic field can
      create dipole-aligned water molecules that can accept energy at
      the hydrogen-oxygen bond resonance frequency or a sub-harmonic
      thereof. An oscillating electromagnetic field can cause resonance
      catastrophe, resulting in the dissociation of water into hydrogen
      ions (e.g., H&lt;+&gt;) and oxygen ions (e.g., O&lt;2"&gt;). An
      electrostatic field and a modified Ranque-Hilsch vortex can be
      used to separate the ionized hydrogen from ionized oxygen with
      minimum post-dissociation collisions. [0040] With reference to
      FIG. 4, the dissociation of water to ionized hydrogen and ionized
      oxygen is shown in greater detail. Ionized hydrogen and ionized
      oxygen can be produced from high pressure steam by utilizing one
      or more of electromagnetic fields, magnetic fields and kinetic
      vortexes. In an embodiment, the magnetic fields and/or
      electromagnetic fields may be interpenetrating magnetic fields
      and/or electromagnetic fields. High-pressure steam may be fed
      transversely to a funnel-type device or apparatus and exposed to a
      magnetic field. High-pressure steam may then progress through the
      funnel in a spiral manner and experience magnetic torquing. Steam
      may exit the funnel through multiple concentric ports at the end
      of the funnel and may be subsequently directed to a plurality of
      specialized channels surrounded by modified static magnets capable
      of imparting a tendency for water molecule alignment, resulting in
      further magnetic torquing. [0041] With continued reference to FIG.
      4, a plurality of magnetically torqued and magnetically aligned
      streams of steam may be directed toward a modified Ranque-Hilsch
      tube in a plurality of offset right angles, thereby creating a
      vortex. While in the modified Ranque-Hilsch tube, an oscillating
      electromagnetic field created by a plurality of electromagnetic
      field generators can impart additional magnetic torquing on the
      streams of the steam that have been magnetically torqued and
      magnetically aligned. A radio frequency (RF) generator may be used
      for the dissociation of water to ionized hydrogen and ionized
      oxygen. The RF generator may couple RF energy to the water
      molecules, thereby facilitating the dissociation OfH2O into
      hydrogen ions and oxygen ions. The radio frequency generator may
      be tuned to a fundamental resonant frequency of molecular water
      (H2O). [0042] A wavefront of magnetically torqued water molecules
      may be created by convergence of the plurality of streams in the
      Ranque-Hilsch tube. The convergence of magnetically torqued water
      molecules support each other and amplify the degree of magnetic
      torque experienced. The magnetic torquing of water molecules
      induces a current in the molecule. The excitation occurs
      repeatedly at a sub-harmonic frequency of the molecular resonance
      that successively builds a charge across each water molecule
      which, eventually, catalyzed by induced, tuned radio frequency
      waves, momentarily exceeds the hydrogen- oxygen bond energy,
      causing a resonance catastrophe where the hydrogen atom releases
      its electron. This leads to a break in the O-H bond , forming
      ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen. The process in the IKEMR
      reactor may be summarized by the following equation.<br>
      <br>
      2 H2O -&gt; 4 H&lt;+&gt; + 2 O&lt;2"&gt;<br>
      <br>
      While H+ AND O&lt;2"&gt; have been shown in the reaction above, it
      will be appreciated that other excited species of hydrogen and
      oxygen may be formed in the IKEMR reactor. For example,
      O2&lt;"&gt; may be formed in the reactor. As another example,
      H2&lt;+&gt; may be formed in the IKEMR reactor. As yet another
      example, hydrogen radicals may be formed in the IKEMR reactor. As
      still another example, oxygen radicals may be formed in the IKEMR
      reactor. Separation of Ionized Hydrogen and Ionized Oxygen<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 4 shows the separation of ionized hydrogen and ionized
      oxygen using a modified Ranque-Hilsch tube. The modified
      Ranque-Hilsch tube, in conjunction with an electrostatic field,
      can achieve separation by causing ionized hydrogen to migrate
      toward the center of the modified Ranque-Hilsch tube and the
      ionized oxygen to migrate toward the walls (or outer periphery) of
      the modified Ranque-Hilsch tube with a minimum of molecular
      collisions. The orientation of the steady state fields can have
      the tendency to constrain the spin of the dipole molecules to a
      surface of the wavefront. Having dimensionally minimized the
      randomness of the molecular motion and spin, at the optimal spin
      rate, due to the orbital motion of the lighter hydrogen atoms
      around the heavier oxygen atoms, upon dissociation there may be
      imparted a centrifugal force that is sufficient to propel the
      hydrogen ions at high speed towards the center of the vortex where
      they collide with each other, absorbing electrons from the
      electrostatic field. The separated hydrogen and oxygen can exit
      the modified Ranque-Hilsch tube through separate channels oriented
      at the center and outer edges of the modified Ranque-Hilsch tube,
      respectively. The migration directions can be a result of
      different densities of the ionized hydrogen as compared to ionized
      oxygen and/or the charge difference between ionized hydrogen and
      ionized oxygen. Resonance Catastrophe<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The covalent bonds of the water molecule, which are
      approximately 110 kcal, have a characteristic resonance frequency
      and therefore have periodic motion. Any system in periodic motion
      can be acted upon by an external force, appropriately tuned to
      that resonance frequency, such that the system will continuously
      absorb energy from the external force to a point that it can no
      longer maintain the integrity of its periodic motion. This can
      result in a resonance catastrophe and effective disintegration (or
      dissociation) of the system. Resonance catastrophe of water can
      produce ionized hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Efficient formation of
      ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen can occur in the absence of
      hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding can reduce the efficiency of
      ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen production. The effect of
      hydrogen bonding can be reduced when water is in a vacuum or in
      gas form. Water can be heated to a gaseous state,
      motion-coordinated and brought in alignment by a combination of a
      specialized device and magnetic and/or electromagnetic fields. In
      various embodiments, the specialized device has a generally
      conical shape. In an embodiment, the specialized device is in the
      shape of a funnel. In an embodiment, the magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic fields may be interpenetrating magnetic and/or
      electromagnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Passing a conductor through a magnetic field can induce a
      current in the conductor. The water molecule has a dipole moment.
      In certain circumstances, water may be a conductor of electricity
      . Passage of rotating water molecules through an oscillating
      magnetic field can induce a current across the water molecules,
      such that a potential electromotive force (EMF) can be generated
      across each molecule, independent of its actual orientation.
      During high velocity motion in a vortex, through the presence of a
      dominant steady state field, interaction between the water
      molecules may be constrained primarily to two dimensions, and may
      serve to distribute the aggregate charge in a continuously
      building wavefront. Due to an interpenetrating steady state field,
      this charge is not translated into further spin, but may be
      absorbed over time in quanta by the electrons of the hydrogen
      bond, energizing them in a way that is free from the energy
      dissipation that is typically caused by the hydrogen bonding of
      liquid water.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] This process, repeated at a high enough rate and tuned to a
      dominant sub- harmonic partial of the primary resonance frequency
      of the hydrogen atoms in the water molecule, can systematically
      build a charge across each molecule. Charge induction, through
      dynamo-type action of spinning molecules (having dipole moments)
      passing through oscillating magnetic fields, can act to raise the
      excitation state of bonding electrons nearest the charge centers
      through their energy levels until the resonance kinetics within
      the molecule temporarily exceed the lowest atomic bond threshold
      (that of the hydrogen atoms), thereby causing release of ionized
      hydrogen atoms in a resonance catastrophe.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] To facilitate this process, a chamber or reactor with
      oscillating fields and a vortex may be constructed and tuned in a
      way to induce a modified Ranque-Hilsch effect. The chamber may
      also include one or more perpendicular (with respect to a
      longitudinal axis of the chamber) steady state fields to constrain
      molecular spin and an electrostatic field oriented to direct the
      positively charged ions to the center of the vortex.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Thus, periodically adding energy of magnetic torquing to
      the molecules by passing them through a series of tuned and
      oscillating magnetic fields at a rate harmonically synchronous
      with a repeated charge induction, after a certain amount of time,
      may cause a threshold of the molecular bond energy holding the
      hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water molecules together to be
      momentarily exceeded, resulting in dissociation of the water
      molecules into ionized hydrogen and ionized oxygen atoms. Example<br>
      <br>
      [0049] An objective of the process is to impart energy to the
      water vapor molecules utilizing their dipole nature as they move
      through a reactor in such a way as to build a charge across the
      water molecules over time. A first alignment phase does not
      necessarily result in the molecules lining up in a North-South
      orientation. The process can continuously torque the molecules in
      the same direction as they spin through a static field.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In a tuned phase, an effective electric charge across each
      water molecule may be induced over a period of time in a number of
      synchronized steps until the aggregated charge can momentarily
      exceed a bond threshold energy between the hydrogen and oxygen
      atoms of a water molecule. This does not necessarily require that
      the molecules be stimulated continuously at a particular resonance
      (or resonant) frequency. A timing of stimuli can correspond to a
      resonant sub-harmonic in such a way that magnetic torquing of the
      water molecules can have an additive electrical effect.
      Oscillating magnetic fields can be tuned to frequencies that take
      into account both the mean velocity (which can be correlated to
      their kinetic energy) of the water molecules in the vortex and
      their minimum duration in each of the dynamic fields, which are
      aligned so as to sequentially build the electric charge across the
      molecules during their transit through the reactor with a
      periodicity small enough to limit charge dissipation. Oscillation
      frequencies can be continuously micro-adjusted to maintain peak
      current loading on field drivers, which can be at their peak when
      charge absorption by the molecules is at its highest, thereby
      minimizing the number of stages required in the reactor. The radio
      frequency (RF) generators that can augment the process can be
      tuned to fundamentals of the molecular resonance.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The electrostatic field can be applied at the leading edge
      of the dissociation (resonance catastrophe) wavefront to assist
      the vortex kinetics to attract lighter, positively charged
      H&lt;+&gt; ions towards the center of the Ranque-Hilsch vortex
      with a minimum of molecular collisions and push the heavier,
      negatively charged oxygen ions (e.g. , O&lt;2"&gt;) to the outer
      walls of the reactor chamber, where they can be forced out of the
      reactor in separate channels.<br>

      Vortex Tube (20) to efficiently and rapidly cycle samples (70)
      (i.e., DNA+Primer+Polymerse) between the denaturation, annealing,

      with a cooling jacket, or by taking out the liquid at a short
      distance from the inlet, where the heating effect on the periphery

      In a gas cooling and drying apparatus using a vortex tube 15 of

      before its expansion is cooled by the cooled partial current in a
      heat exchanger 10, and the cooled partial current amounts to at
      least 70 per cent of the total current. The compressed gas
      supplied through a pipe 5 is first cooled in a precooler 6, the
      separated moisture being removed at 8, and then passes through the
      tubes 11 of the heat exchanger 10 and through a pipe 14 to the
      tangential nozzle 16 of the Ranque vortex tube 15. Cold air from
      the vortex tube passes by a pipe 19 to the heat exchanger and
      issues through a pipe 21. Precipitated liquid is removed by a
      separator 28. The warm air issuing through the valve 25 of the

      The separator divides the medium into a stream of vapour which

      the heat exchanger, and a stream of boiling liquid . In the vortex
      tube the vapour flow is divided into a warm flow and a cold flow

      The method involves blocking an expulsion orifice at an end of a

      stream is expelled outside a chamber (12) while another fraction
      of the air stream is reflected towards another end of the tube.
      The tapered relief valve is preset, so that the fractions of the
      air stream are constant during control operation, and injection
      pressure of the compressed air is controlled, where the compressed
      air is supplied to the tube by an air accumulator (30) i.e.

      This invention uses a vortex tube or Hilsch tube in combination

      density of a gas mixture and the dew point of the gas mixture. The
      thermocouple has a flat planar configuration with one side highly

      which is extracted from the Hilsch tube is used to cool the
      polished thermocouple until frost or dew is formed on the
      thermocouple. This indicates the dew point of the gas surrounding
      the polished surface of the thermocouple. The temperature of the
      thermocouple continues to drop until it indicates the exhaust
      temperature of the cold gas from the Hilsch tube. This output
      temperature is a function of the pressure and temperature of the
      incoming gas and the density of the gas. Thus if the incoming gas

      The present disclosure generally relates to an apparatus for the
      condensation of a liquid suspended in a gas, and more
      specifically, to an apparatus for the condensation of water from
      air with a geometry designed to emphasize adiabatic condensation
      of water using either the Joule-Thompson effect or the
      Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube effect or a combination of the two.
      Several embodiments are disclosed and include the use of a
      Livshits-Teichner generator to extract water and unburned
      hydrocarbons from exhaust of combustion engines, to collect
      potable water from exhaust of combustion engines, to use the
      vortex generation as an improved heat process mechanism, to mix
      gases and liquid fuel efficiently, and an improved
      Livshits-Teichner generator with baffles and external
      condensation.<br>

      FIELD: electricity. SUBSTANCE: method of power generation is based
      on using Ranque-Hilsch and Seebeck effects in compressed gas
      reduction. To increase efficiency of power generation, in
      thermoelectric module hot and cold flows of low pressure gas of
      vortex tube are combined in an ejector, where hot gas is a working
      one, and cold gas is the injected flow. EFFECT: provision of power
      supply to auxiliary needs of autonomously functioning gas
      reduction facilities of manifold gas lines and gas networks of low
      pressure.<br>

          HILSCH-RANQUE VORTEX TUBES</b><br>
        <b> </b><b>US2009241555 </b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      The method involves blocking an expulsion orifice at an end of a
      Hilsch-Ranque vortex tube (24) by a tapered relief valve, so that
      a fraction of injected compressed air forming an incoming hot air
      stream is expelled outside a chamber (12) while another fraction
      of the air stream is reflected towards another end of the tube.
      The tapered relief valve is preset, so that the fractions of the
      air stream are constant during control operation, and injection
      pressure of the compressed air is controlled, where the compressed
      air is supplied to the tube by an air accumulator (30) i.e.
      cylinder.<br>
