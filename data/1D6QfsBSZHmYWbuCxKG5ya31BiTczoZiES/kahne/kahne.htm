      doing 6 different mental operations simultaneously, actually

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An Interview with Harry
              Kahne, Whose Brain can do Six Things at the Same Time</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By Fenn Sherie</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is said that Mohammed and
          Caesar could, upon occasions, perform two distinct mental
          operations --- such as writing a letter and carrying on a
          conversation --- simultaneously. Not having interviewed either
          of them I am unable to confirm this. I can, however, vouch for
          the fact that the present generation has produced a remarkable
          young man who can make his brain do six different things at
          the same time --- involving, according to the psychologists,
          no fewer than 14 separate mental processes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When I first heard of his
          existence I was (as the reader may be at present) a little
          dubious. However, now that I have witnessed his public
          performance, put him through several private tests and chatted
          with him regarding his remarkable talents, I am in a position
          to state the facts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His name is Harry Kahne, his
          age is 28, and his native land is America. He has a charming
          personality, a nasal accent, and above all, a wonderful brain.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">His demonstrations of
          multiple mind concentration have to be seen to be believed,
          but the reader will gather some idea of his remarkable
          abilities from a careful study of the accompanying photographs
          with their descriptive captions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whether he is performing
          before music hall audiences or learned professors of
          psychology, Mr Kahne has the happy knack of keeping his
          audiences amused as well as amazed. Even whilst jotting down
          rows of figures, writing them upside down and backwards, he
          manages to maintain a steady flow of amusing chatter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Will somebody please call
          out a number?" he asks. "You may call out your age if you
          like. Ladies may call out the age of their lady friends."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And whilst he is writing out
          news headlines backwards and doing difficult mathematical
          calculations at the same time, he continues to invite
          questions from members of the audience, to all of which he has
          a ready reply.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Talk to me! Talk to me!" he
          pleads.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"What is the population of
          Manchester?" shouts a voice from the back of the hall.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The population" --- he
          writes two letters and adds a figure --- "of Manchester" ---
          he writes two more figures and another letter --- "is 730,551.
          Anybody else? Talk to me!"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Are you married?" shouts a
          girl in the gallery.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"No", he answers, promptly,
          jotting down a word as he talks; "It’s my work that makes me
          act like this."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And in his final
          demonstration of "word-juggling", clearly explained in the
          photograph on the next page, he maintains the interest by
          hanging upside down and reciting a poem!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"That boy will go mad", said
          a woman sitting behind me in the theater where I first saw Mr
          Kahne perform.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"He is a genius", exclaimed
          a gray-haired gentleman who looked like a medical man."Very
          wonderful, but he won’t live long", he added, shaking his
          head.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But to talk to Mr Kahne is
          to discover that, although he ahs exceptional abilities, he is
          not by any means a freak. If he displays genius, it is not the
          kind that is akin to madness, but rather of the more
          creditable variety, generally spoken of as "an infinite
          capacity for taking pains".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is all a matter of
          development and practice", he told me. "Just as the acrobat or
          juggler trains muscles and nerves that even an athlete
          overlooks, so have I trained brain cells which the average
          mental worker seldom attempts to being into use."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But you must admit that you
          have been endowed with an exceptionally good brain", I said.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Yes, it is a good brain ---
          call it a first class brain, if you like --- yet there are
          thousands of other brains in the world just as good as mine.
          There are thousands of pairs of legs in the world just as good
          as the champion sprinter, but they do not all win races.
          Mental development is very much like physical development ---
          it is mainly a matter of exercise."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But to exercise the brain
          in the way that you do must surely exert a very severe strain
          upon it?" I ventured.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"So does an athlete exert a
          very severe strain upon his muscles when he runs a race",
          replied Mr Kahne, smiling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Agreed", I said, becoming
          argumentative, "but mental strain is surely far more dangerous
          than physical exertion?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well, I suppose you’re
          right there", he replied. "When I first started this sort of
          thing the psychologists and mental specialists declared that I
          had better get myself measured for a padded cell or a coffin.
          At that time I was performing only four feats at once, and I
          think it was the strain of trying to do five that really upset
          me. Anyhow, at the age of 23 all my hair came out. I didn’t
          like that at all. It made me look so ridiculous. But I thought
          it over, and came to the conclusion that the trouble was due
          to nervous strain --- quite a temporary affair, like the
          stiffness an athlete feels when he starts to train a new set
          of muscles --- and I reckoned that if I kept on practicing I
          should soon get into the way of performing feats without any
          serious strain at all. So I stuck to it, and as soon as I
          mastered the five feats my nerves quieted down and my hair
          came back again!"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Do you not mean to infer
          that your present demonstrations are carried out without your
          feeling any strain?" I said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"No sir --- I do not",
          replied Mr Kahne, emphatically. "The strain is still there,
          but the worry has gone. You must bear in mind that, apart from
          the fact that I do six things at once, the words and figures
          are given me by members of the audience, and the questions
          they ask range anywhere between baseball and the Einstein
          theory. So, you see, my performance is practically
          extemporaneous."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You have compared your
          training to that of an athlete", I said. "Does that mean that
          you have to diet yourself in any way --- taking ‘brain food’
          in the form of fish, for example?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Kahne laughed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Oh, no! I just live
          naturally and eat what I like. All the same, I have to keep my
          body fit, or my brain gets tired, and I cannot work well if my
          stomach is overloaded. But here’s an interesting point.
          Strange though it may seem, I can concentrate better hanging
          head downwards than when in an upright position. The rush of
          blood to the head stimulates the brain. Do you know that when
          people lie awake at night, thinking and worrying, unable to
          get to sleep, it is often due to a rush of blood to the head,
          caused by indigestion or something of that sort? If they were
          to prop themselves up with pillows they would probably manage
          to get to sleep without further trouble."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Tell me", I asked "what do
          the psychologists think of your performance?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Oh gosh --- don’t talk to
          me about psychologists! They‘re good fellows and very
          interesting to talk to, but when a bunch of those scientists
          get me under observation it generally means that I have to sit
          up half the night while they argue over me. They tell me that
          the six mental operations I perform simultaneously involve no
          fewer than 14 separate processes of the brain. They tabulate
          these as: Hearing questions, answering questions, reading
          newspaper, transposing what is read, transposing spelling,
          writing with right hand, writing with left hand, writing
          upside down, carrying six different thoughts in mind,
          retaining questions, retaining figures for addition, retaining
          figures for division, proving previous work, and controlling
          physical actions (writing, stooping, walking, etc.)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Then they start in to
          measure my head, put me through all kinds of queer psychiatric
          tests, and usually finish up by asking me how I do it!"</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And you attribute your
          ability entirely to mind training?" I said. "Your powers are
          not inherited?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well, my father certainly
          had a good memory --- he spoke 16 languages --- but he
          displayed no mental abnormality. I certainly did not inherit
          my ability to do six things at once any more than Cinquevalli
          inherited his ability to keep 8 or 9 balls in the air at the
          same time."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When did you first discover
          your ability to direct your mind into several channels of
          thought simultaneously?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"At the age of 14, when I
          was at school. In most lessons, excepting mathematics, I was
          rather backwards --- not because I hadn’t the ability to
          learn, but because I did not pay attention. I was an
          absent-minded youth, a daydreamer --- always letting my mind
          wander, thinking out little mechanical inventions, planning
          new forms of code writing, or evolving plots for short
          stories. One day my teacher fired a sudden question at me, and
          finding that I was not paying attention, hauled me out for
          corporal punishment. It was really the feeling of his cane
          that first turned my thoughts in the direction of multiple
          mind concentration. I did not want to give up my daydreams,
          but on the other hand, I had a distinct aversion to corporal
          punishment. So after a while I got into the habit of letting
          one part of my brain wander into the realms of inventive fancy
          whilst I kept the other alert for an enfilade fire of
          questions from the teacher.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"One of the tricks with
          which I used to amused myself was writing backwards. The first
          words I tackled were ‘Never again’. Why I chose them I don’t
          know --- unless I was thinking of that cane! --- but I
          practiced writing them backwards and upside down at every
          conceivable opportunity. N-I-a-g-a r-e-v ---</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"’Harry Kahne’, the teacher
          would shout suddenly, ‘go straight ahead from where Jimmy
          Wilson left off’. Instantly I would jump to my feet and recite
          my lines of poetry without the slightest hesitation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Later, finding that this
          faculty for writing words backwards whilst keeping my mind
          occupied in quite a different direction became quite natural
          to me, I began to entertain my friends at home with a few
          parlor tricks on similar lines. When I left school I went into
          the jewelry business, but I continued to practice my mental
          gymnastics --- partly for fun, and partly because I felt that
          it kept my brain in good trim.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"One day a vaudeville
          manager happened to see me and asked if I thought I could give
          a public performance. I said I would try --- and that very
          same evening I appeared at his theter as deputy for a
          performer who had failed to put in an appearance. I have been
          in the show business ever since. When I first appeared I did
          four things at once. Now I do six. Maybe, in time, I shall be
          able to do seven or eight."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But surely there is quite
          enough strain in your present demonstration without your
          wanting to add to it?" I exclaimed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Kahne smiled.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Perhaps you’re right", he
          said. :It is very hard work. In the two shows of ten minutes
          duration which I give every evening I calculate that I use up
          as much mental energy as the average brain worker expends in
          an 8-hour day. But I soon recover. I spend all the rest of my
          time in play and relaxation and never allow myself to worry.
          It’s worry that kills --- not mental effort. I attribute my
          clarity of thought not so much to a good memory, but to what I
          call a good ‘forgettery’. In my daily life I erase all
          unpleasant thoughts from my mind. And on the stage my ability
          to forget is an equally important asset. Unless I were able to
          wipe out from my memory the words given me at the first
          performance, I might easily confuse them with those called out
          at the second house. Then where should I be?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I said that I did not know.
          Then I asked Mr Kahne if he could explain the method by which
          he has trained his memory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well, in the first place,
          most people have a wrong idea of the faculty commonly called
          memory. Some regard it as a sort of adhesive jelly upon which
          facts will stick and remain until called for. Others look upon
          it as&nbsp; sort of card index where thoughts are sorted, to
          be retrieved at will by pulling a sort of mental ‘tag’ --- the
          ‘tag’ being what is commonly called ‘the association of
          ideas’. But such methods of memorizing are automatic rather
          than systematic."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Then what is the secret of
          remembering several things at a time?" I asked.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Focus", replied Mr Kahne
          promptly. "If you take a camera with a new roll of film and
          expose it five times at random, you get five blurred images.
          But if you focus the camera carefully upon a given object and
          then make the sixth exposure, you get a distinct image. So it
          is with the brain.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is often said that half
          of us go about with our eyes shut. It would be more correct to
          say ‘with our eyes unfocused’. And the same applies to our
          ears. We see without observing and we hear without listening.
          Most people could, if they tried, train their brains to hold
          five times as many impressions as they do at present. When
          they are forced to focus their senses, they do so with the
          greatest ease. For example, of you carry on a conversation in
          a crowded room there may be several people talking at the same
          time, yet you will have no difficulty in fixing your attention
          upon the words of the one person who is talking to you. That
          is what is generally called concentration."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But that does not explain
          multiple concentration", I said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I am coming to that"
          answered Mr Kahne. "Do you play the piano?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A little startled at the
          apparent irrelevancy of the question --- for even in
          conversation Mr Kahne’s brain works so rapidly that it is
          difficult to keep pace with it --- I stammered out something
          to the effect that I strummed a little for my own amusement.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"And have you ever
          accompanied a vocalist, reading the music from sight?"</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I admitted that I had done
          so.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Do you realize, then, that
          you were doing several things at once? You were reading the
          treble and the bass as well as the words of the lyrics,
          listening to the singer, playing with both hands, and
          occasionaly using your feet on the pedals!"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was no answer to that
          argument. Mr Kahne had made his point.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The trouble with most
          ‘brainy’ people", he went on, "is that they usually develop
          their retentive powers in one direction only. The learned
          professor who knows the names of all the insects in the world
          and cannot remember his own; the schoolmaster who knows the
          dates of the accession of all the Kings and Queens and of
          every important event, yet forgets the date of his wife’s
          birthday, are common examples of what I call ‘one cylinder
          memories’."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But what astonishes me", I
          said, "is not only the ease with which you retain words and
          figures, but the rapidity with which you grasp them in the
          first place."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Again, that is a matter of
          practice. I catch words and sentences just as easily and just
          as firmly as a wicket-keeper catches a ball. When a sentence
          is hurled at me it sticks as soon as ever I receive it.
          Sometimes a dozen or more people will be shouting at once, yet
          I am able to grasp what most of them are calling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But here is a curious fact.
          If somebody calls to me from behind the stage --- in other
          words, from the direction in which my mind is not focused ---
          the words will either make no impression on my brain at all,
          or, if they do, they will throw me entirely out of tune and
          upset my demonstration."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But you are able to
          concentrate upon thoughts as well as upon words and figures?"
          I asked.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Sure. Give me a piece of
          paper and I will show you. Now suggest any subject you like
          and I will write you a sentence upon it."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Strand Magazine", I
          suggested.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Right", replied Mr Kahne,
          and instantly he began to write a string of jumbled letters.
          "You can talk to me whilst I’m doing this if you like", he
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I will leave it to you to
          do the talking", I said. "Suppose you recite something."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Sure. Anything you like."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Kipling’s ‘Gunga Din’", I
          suggested, naming the first popular poem that came to my mind.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instantly Mr Kahne commenced
          to recite, stil writing without a moment’s pause, at the
          steady rate of about one letter per second. He managed somehow
          to make the finish of the poem coincide with the end of the
          sentence he was writing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"You’re a better man than I
          am, Gunga Din", he declaimed, handing me the sheet of paper
          with a flourish. "Now look. First of all, starting from the
          first letter on the left, I want you to read every third
          letter", he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I spelt it out aloud.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"T-h-e S-t-r-a-n-d
          M-a-g-a-z-i-n-"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The letter ‘e’ is upside
          down", said Mr Kahne. "Turn the paper over."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I obeyed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Now start with the capital
          ‘I’ and take every third letter."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I-s T-h-e L-e-a-d-i-n-g"</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Now turn the paper over
          again and you will find, near the end, a letter ‘B’ written
          backwards. Read on from there, backwards --- or, if you
          prefer, hold the paper up to the mirror --- and you will get
          the rest of the sentence."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"B-r-i-t-i-s-h
          M-o-n-t-h-l-y", I read.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mr Kahne had written the
          letters in one long string from left to right, jumbling their
          order, turning some upside down and others backwards, yet he
          had not omitted a single letter or added a superfluous one!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Well", I said, "Gunga Din
          may be a better man than you are in some respects, but
          certainly not in matters of mental gymnastics. Nobody is in
          the same street with you there!"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Oh, shucks!" he replied,
          with picturesque modesty. "You could do the same yourself if
          you tried."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Thanks very much", I
          answered, "but I’d rather not try."</font> </p>

          meaningless scrawl, at the same time reciting any popular poem
          requested. A careful examination of the writing --- taking
          every third letter --- will reveal that he is in the act of
          writing "Indianapolis" correctly (as seen from the reader's

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This Multiple Mentalism
          course is a revised version of the course originated by Harry
          Kahne in the early 1920s. At that time he was billed as The
          Incomparable Mentalist and The Man with the Multiple Mind.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He often demonstrated his
          ability on stage by doing six different mental operations
          simultaneously. His platform performance entailed standing in
          front of a large blackboard with a piece of chalk in each hand
          while conversing with the audience. There was a newspaper on a
          music rack in front of him. He began reading the headlines
          while writing upside down and backwards with one hand and
          mirror language with the other hand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At his left was another
          small blackboard on which appeared the number 28,642,981,673
          --- which was being divided into five unequal parts --- these
          figures he began computing at the bottom of the large
          blackboard. To his right was another small blackboard on which
          appeared seven columns of figures which ran into the millions.
          These were being added and notated as well at the bottom of
          the larger blackboard in front of him.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This was Harry Kahne's
          demonstration of doing six things at one time, i.e., reading,
          transposing, writing backwards and upside down, holding a
          conversation, adding and dividing. These six separate
          processes actually involve fourteen distinct operations, i.e.,
          hearing questions, answering questions, reading a newspaper,
          transposing what is read, transposing spelling, writing with
          right hand, writing with left hand, writing upside down,
          carrying six different thoughts in mind, retaining questions,
          retaining figures for addition, retaining figures for
          division, proving previous work and controlling all other
          physical actions of the body --- such as walking, bowing,
          etc..</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the end of Harry Kahne's
          demonstrations, people often asked him, "Do you really believe
          that nearly everyone can learn to perform the amazing mental
          feats you demonstrate? Is my brain capable of carrying on four
          to six independent functions at one and the same time, as
          yours is? Isn't the ability to master your training confined
          to well educated people?" When answering, Harry Kahne admitted
          he had only an average brain to do things no other man in
          history had done. Education had no bearing on it.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the saddest&nbsp;
          things the people in this complex world of today are
          confronted with --- is the disuse of their brains! We are
          constantly beset and bombard with ever-increasing demands that
          we are ill-equipped or unprepared to handle! Hence, very
          often, stress sets in. Stress can then contribute to
          physiological and psychological disruptions which bring about
          disease and illness. Efficiency is down. Accidents and
          mistakes become more frequent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now this course may not turn
          you into an Einstein or an Edison, but it will help you to
          think with more of what GOD gave you --- Your brain! It is the
          only course of its kind in the world. If you proceed with it
          lesson by lesson without deviating or digressing, you will no
          longer be besieged by situations too hard to cope with! You
          WILL be master over the most difficult situations and the
          answers will show themselves easily. This course is the key to
          <u>clearer</u> thinking.&nbsp; It will elicit that latent
          potential that has always been within you, and you will
          mentally grow strong and vibrant --- full of life and health.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Have you ever watched an
          unusual performer do something that you thought was fantastic?
          Did you ever wonder how he got that way? He certainly wasn't
          born with this talent, but instead he learned to develop such
          a talent by training himself. You are endowed with the same
          basic mental and bodily functions as such a performer. Of two
          people, each possessing the same natural ability and identical
          schooling, one will attain great heights of achievement, while
          the other remains in a status of mediocrity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are many examples in
          history of those who excel and use their brain. Some mechanics
          become Thomas Edisons or Henry Fords, while others are "grease
          monkeys" to the day of their death. This wide discrepancy in
          the fortunes of men is due to the fact that some see and do
          the right thing at the right time --- while others do not.
          But... the one man in a thousand who sees correctly and acts
          with decisiveness at precisely the proper time does not
          blindly HAPPEN to do so. He sees and acts courageously and
          correctly because his mind is trained to react efficiently
          under all circumstances. He has acquired this mental training
          --- this ability to make his brain cells really work ---
          unconsciously. He has not realized that he has been training
          and developing his mind to do so.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After completing this mental
          development course, you will no longer suffer the balm of a
          tired mind, but instead you will be mentally alive and feel at
          ease with yourself. Problems that plagued you before will
          become easy to solve and the correct decisions will always be
          readily available.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Follow the instructions
          conscientiously and you will be amazed at your own ability to
          perform mental feats that you previously had not thought
          possible of yourself. It is then that you will realize the
          boundless potential of your own mind and what it can do for
          you. As you proceed through each lesson, your brain power will
          be increasing in strength. Mentally you will be more equipped
          to handle everyday situations. No matter what your education
          or experience, for the first time in your life, you will be
          truly using your brain power storehouse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, this course in
          mind training can only benefit you in proportion to the time
          and effort with which you devote to it. Don't try to find easy
          methods of doing a certain exercise or lesson for you will
          only be cheating yourself out of the rewards of completing
          that lesson. When an exercise states that you do it from
          memory alone, then don't copy, but do it from memory alone!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Whatever your profession
          this course will help you perform better and more efficiently.
          You will find that the difficult and near impossible success
          can be yours and your hidden dreams can be concrete
          realizations.</font> </p>

          little different from yours. However, such as it was, he
          taught it to work for him. Really work! All its resources were
          instantly available when he wanted or needed them. It had been
          trained to do what he wanted it to do, when he wanted it done.
          His was only an average brain made to perform certain tasks
          for him.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this series of lessons or
          exercises are all the things you need to make your mind work
          for you. You will be surprised to find how simple they are and
          how much actual fun and satisfaction you will get from
          completing the course. Why, it's like a game --&nbsp;&nbsp;
          but with far more value than any game ever possessed!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Follow the instructions
          conscientiously and you will develop all the cells of your
          brain. You will train them to work in unison for you. And when
          they do that, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR MIND DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IT
          TO DO! You can carry on several lines of thought
          simultaneously. The most difficult problems will seem to solve
          themselves. The hardest questions, seen in their proper
          perspective and with all their factors viewed concurrently,
          become easy to answer promptly and correctly. You will not
          become perplexed about little things that now cause you
          setbacks of greater or lesser degrees, because your brain will
          automatically analyze and evaluate them accurately and give
          you the right answers at the right time. Such thinking brings
          SUCCESS!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first lessons are almost
          childishly simple. But as you progress from one to another
          they become more difficult and involved. However, your mind
          will become correspondingly more able to grasp them and, in a
          surprisingly short time, you will be actually amazed by your
          own ability to perform mental feats you had not thought
          possible&nbsp; --- feats of incalculable value to you in the
          business and professional world. You will realize at last that
          there is literally NO LIMIT to the extent to which you will be
          able to make your mind work for you!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With each lesson, you will
          learn how you can apply the principles of mental function you
          acquire to help you in your everyday life. There is no lesson
          that does not have its practical application in achieving
          financial or social success. When you are only half way
          through, you will be unwilling to accept a thousand dollars
          for the ability you already will have acquired. No matter what
          your education, training or experience, you will be using them
          to real advantage for the FIRST time in your life!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Obviously, this course can
          benefit you only in proportion to the time and sincerity with
          which you follow it. Therefore, devote the prescribed time
          effort to every lesson. Do not cheat yourself. Do not copy the
          exercises from the words you put down. Do them from memory ---
          and from memory alone. Do not proceed to any lesson until you
          have thoroughly mastered the one preceding it. To do so
          defeats the purpose of the course --- defeats your own desires
          --- nullifies your efforts. Be fair with yourself throughout!
          Soon you will be achieving mental exercises previously never
          thought possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although the exercises
          necessarily are performed with words and figures the results
          they accomplish in building Brain Power will be reflected in
          your work day by day, no matter what that work may be. You
          will find that problems now difficult or even impossible for
          you to cope with resolve themselves into simple matters before
          you are half way through the course. In short, the Impossible
          becomes Simple!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And now I shall give you
          something startling to think about -- something at once
          alluring and encouraging. There lies dormant within every man
          some thought, idea, plan --- call it what you will --- that
          probably is deeply buried in his subconscious mind, doomed
          never to reach fruition. But if that thought or plan were
          brought into the light, allowed to develop, it would make its
          owner a truly outstanding success --- a man of achievement to
          whom people would point. And I say to you that if you train
          your mind to work for you --- to delve into the unexplored
          resources of your brain and emerge with the treasures hidden
          therein --- spectacular success will be yours! If you are
          honest with yourself in understanding Multiple Mentalism, if
          you are earnest and sincere in your desire to rise far above
          the ordinary, I will show you how to be successful and
          powerful beyond your fondest dreams! Simply follow my
          instructions as given on the following pages --- and you will
          amaze yourself and the world at large!</font> </p>

              size="+1">How the Space Age Degenerates Intelligence</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Alexis Carrel, surgeon,
          scientist, member of the Rockefeller Institute, winner of the
          Noble Prize in 1912 for his success in suturing blood vessels
          and the transplanting of organs, co-discover of the famous
          Carrel-Dakin solution which made gangrene virtually unknown in
          World War I and thus saved tens of thousands of lives, said in
          his book, <i>Man, The Unknown:</i></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Modern civilization seems
          to be incapable of producing people endowed with imagination,
          intelligence and courage. In practically every country there
          is a decrease in the intellectual and moral caliber of those
          who carry the responsibility of public affairs. The education
          dispensed by schools and universities consists chiefly in a
          training of the memory and of the muscles, in certain social
          manners, in a worship of athletics. Are such disciplines
          really suitable for modern men who need, above all other
          things, moral courage and endurance!" Those statements are
          truer now than when Dr. Carrel wrote the book in the early
          1930s. Now our brightest and best students have shown an
          average drop in SAT scores since the early 1970s. This
          controversy abounds in speculative arguments blame television,
          permissiveness and educational teaching methods.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the cause of this mental
          weakness is not difficult to discern. The pioneers who settled
          our country were many-sided men --- we are not. They were at
          once hunters, trappers, explorers, fighters, teamsters, ship
          or canoe builders, horsemen, wheelwrights, carpenters,
          cabinetmakers, well drillers, masons, farmers, blacksmiths,
          traders, cooks -- all these, and more, "specialized" trades
          and abilities combined in single individuals! No wonder they
          were possessed of "mental equilibrium, nervous stability", and
          other attributes mentioned by Dr. Carrel! They were well
          balanced because their talents were well rounded. They had
          nervous stability because they had serene self-confidence
          based on a knowledge of their ability to cope with any problem
          that might arise in their world. They had sound judgment, for
          the most part, because their minds were expanded, embraced
          many branches of lore and learning, were capable in thinking
          on many varied planes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And so with the early
          merchant. He was at once his own architect, store designer,
          buyer, stockkeeper, advertising manager, salesman, bookkeeper,
          and financial wizard. The doctor of only a generation ago was
          an obstetrician, gynecologists, dentist, opthalmologist,
          throat specialist --- in short, a "general practitioner" in
          all branches of surgery and medicine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today, we have more
          intelligent exploration, more intelligent farming, better
          architecture, advertising, accounting, obstetrics, dentistry
          and surgery. But what Man as a whole has gained, man as an
          INDIVIDUAL --- you and your family and your employer and your
          employees --- has <u>lost</u>. You have lost the capacity for
          broad-gauge reasoning. You are incapable, at present, of
          viewing many conflicting factors simultaneously --- weighing
          them side by side at one and the same time --- balancing them,
          one against another, concurrently --- reaching almost
          instantaneously a decision which you know, in the depths of
          your being, is the <u>correct </u>decision and acting upon
          it promptly with the courage that comes with such conviction.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By relieving man of the
          necessity for thinking, except within the exceedingly narrow
          scope of whatever he has chosen as his life work, this Space
          Age has dulled and drugged the greater part of Man's mind. How
          many men in this day of automobiles could even harness a
          horse, to say nothing of caring for it? Why, the majority of
          them do not understand even the automobiles they drive! The
          workers themselves, who help build our cars by inserting and
          securing bolt No. 146, do not understand carburation,
          ignition, or the principles of the transmission and
          differential. We no longer train our minds to carry thoughts
          what we wish to impart to our friends when we next meet them.
          If the thoughts are important, we reach for a phone or send a
          letter. If they are relatively unimportant, we forget them.
          Machines and computers have become Masters, and Minds are
          deteriorating because of ever-decreasing opportunities, and
          need for, their use!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That is why your mind needs
          "limbering up". The very elementary mental gymnastics that I
          will give you at the start may seem useless almost to the
          point of foolishness, but they are like the preliminary
          "warming up" exercises with which athletes indulge before
          beginning a game. They are simple, easy to do and apparently
          without meaning. However, they are but the start. As your mind
          gains flexibility, really "warms" to its task, I shall take
          you farther and farther until you are performing feats that
          will astound your friends --- and which will reflect
          themselves in your increased business ability and earning
          power.</font> </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              I</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although this is the
          simplest of my twelve exercises, it is by far the most
          important, for it is upon this exercise that all subsequent
          instructions are based. Now, too, is the time for you to
          acquire the proper <u>habit</u> of study. "Well begun is half
          done," you know, and this exercise --- comprising three
          separate mental drills --- affords you the opportunity to
          establish your earnestness, punctuality and continuity of
          effort. It is designed to train you to apply yourself to a
          mastery of Multiple Mentalism and to give you a firm
          foundation of thought application upon which the rest of the
          lessons in this course depend.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And right here I want to
          emphasize what will be repeated time and again throughout the
          course --- that you <u>must not</u> copy this exercise, but
          must work from <u>memory alone</u>! In this way, and ONLY in
          this way, will you be able to train your mind to do things for
          you, when and as you want them done! It is work --- but it is
          fun too. It takes time --- but it is worth it! And the results
          will seem nothing less than miraculous!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First: This the English
          alphabet:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A B C D E F G H I J K L M
            N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You were taught to memorize
          that in the first grade. Now, with pencil and paper, BUT
          WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT EVEN ONCE. write the alphabet <u>backwards</u>
          FIFTY TIMES:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N
            M L K J I H G F E D C B A</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first time will be
          difficult and you may make mistakes. But don't look, nor copy,
          nor take too long to "think it out." Write it backwards, at a
          fairly even speed, regardless of how slow that speed may be,
          from MEMORY. This is the first training for your mind. In ten
          or twenty attempts you will be able to write the alphabet
          backwards easily. Do it fifty times and you will have mastered
          it perfectly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Second: I assume that you
          now have mastered the alphabet backwards. If you have not, do
          not stop at the fifty times you have written it, but continue
          writing it from memory until you <u>have</u> mastered it.
          Then transpose in 1-3 2-4 order the letters of the alphabet
          from A to Z, as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A C&nbsp; B D,&nbsp; E
            G&nbsp; F H,&nbsp; I K&nbsp; J L,&nbsp; M O&nbsp; N P, Q S R
            T, U W V X, (Y Z),</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">which are left over from the
          six combinations of four letters each. Do this FIFTY times
          from memory. It will be by no means easy the first few times,
          but you will gain accuracy quickly. However, you will profit
          nothing if you look at the letters of the alphabet in order to
          copy the exercise. Its value lies in the training given you by
          breaking up the sequence of letters in YOUR MIND, without the
          help of your eyes. You can readily understand how this will
          lead to mental agility in grasping and revolving business
          problems in your mind. Therefore, do this exercise AT LEAST
          fifty times, or as many more times as may be necessary for you
          to be able to do it quickly and accurately.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Third: In the same way,
          transpose the letters of the alphabet FIFTY times, in the
          order of 1-26, 2-25, 3-24, 4-23, 5-22, etc.; the first 13
          letters (A to M, inclusive) in their regular order; the last
          13 (Z to N, inclusive) backwards; intermingling the two halves
          of the alphabet thus:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A-Z&nbsp; B-Y&nbsp;
            C-X&nbsp; D-W&nbsp; E-V&nbsp; F-U&nbsp; G-T&nbsp; H-S&nbsp;
            I-R&nbsp; J-Q&nbsp; K-P&nbsp; L-O&nbsp; M-N</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do this also from MEMORY. Do
          not copy or look at the alphabet. And when you are doing this
          exercise, realizing that you are doing <u>two</u> things <u>at


            once</u> in your mind. You are writing the first half of the
          alphabet in its usual sequence, and the last thirteen letters
          in reverse order. You are making your brain do something for
          you that it never did before. It is performing a dual
          operation. When you have done this third part of Exercise I
          fifty times, entirely from memory, you will have demonstrated
          that you <u>can</u> make your mind really <u>work</u> for
          you with a nimbleness heretofore unrealized!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Don't forget that you cheat
          only yourself --- not anyone else --- of you fail to perform
          these mental gymnastics from memory and if you fail to send
          ONE HOUR A DAY on the exercises.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And now, I am going to put
          you on your honor. For your own sake, master this exercise --
          in all its three parts -- before you go on to Chapter II and
          its accompanying exercise. Each chapter and "drill" in this
          course is based on all that goes before it. Your success with
          the second lesson depends on your mastery of the first. Be
          conscientious --- be fair to yourself --- and spend all the
          time you need to do each exercise quickly, accurately and
          easily. The rewards will delight you!</font> </p>

      <p><a name="khow2"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font
              size="+1">How Multiple Mentalism Differs From Psychiatry
              &amp; Psychology</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Simplistically, psychology
          is the study of the normal human mind <u>in the laboratory</u>;
          that is, in an abstracted, ideal state influenced by actual,
          everyday environment. Psychiatry is the study of the mind's
          functioning, or disorders in the functioning, under workaday
          conditions. Multiple Mentalism is a <u>training system</u>
          that enables the average, ordinary mind to cope successfully
          -- and more than successfully -- with the circumstances
          created by modern civilization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Psychology studies the mind,
          but does not treat it. Psychiatry treats the maladjusted mind,
          but does not train the normal brain to use its full powers.
          Multiple Mentalism neither studies nor treats the mind, but
          does <u>train</u> and DEVELOP the average brain so that it
          may function easily at full capacity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Multiple Mentalism makes no
          pretense of encroaching upon the domains of psychology or
          psychiatry -- the study of instincts or psycho-neuroses. It is
          concerned only with taking the mind as it is -- rusty, unused,
          dull and almost to the point of moronism in contrast to what
          it COULD be -- and training it to utilize ALL its component
          parts. It is at once a <u>method</u>, and a <u>process</u>
          -- an wakening and development of parts of the brain that now
          lie almost atrophied, or festering with "complexes" and
          unrecognized inhibitions. It brings these slumbering
          capabilities to the surface, energizes your thinking, broadens
          your grasp of things, deepens your understanding, enables you
          to solve instantly problems that baffle other men, gives you
          the power to follow several lines of thought at one and the
          same time, to reach decisions -- correct decisions -- while
          others fumble, to attain success that will be granted to you!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if the rich rewards
          offered you through Multiple Mentalism seem disproportionate
          to the seeming childishness of the exercises given you to
          master, think again! True, you will not become Chairman of the
          Board in charge of all the DuPont interests because of your
          ability to write the alphabet backwards -- nor will you land
          any big contracts on the strength of your being able to
          transpose the letters of the alphabet. But neither would
          Mohammed Ali expect to enter the ring with a skipping rope and
          beguile the public with the old childhood formula, "Salt,
          pepper, mustard, vinegar"! He spends much of his training time
          in skipping rope -- but only to improve his footwork, his
          co-ordination and his endurance. In other words, the exercises
          I give you are merely silly if viewed as <u>ends in
            themselves</u>, which they decidedly are NOT. Considered in
          their true character, as MEANS to an end, they are most
          effective, the most fruitful, the speediest and most practical
          means of mind training that the world ever has known. And
          actual results will prove that I am <u>understating</u> their
          value, rather than overstating it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With this proper
          understanding of what Multiple Mentalism is, and an
          appreciation of the exercises' value, we are ready to proceed.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><u>Do not attempt this
            exercise until you have mastered the three parts of the

          deals with words, and while you may not at first see that it
          has anything to do with what you learned in Exercise I,
          Exercise II is based on the TRAINING there given you and
          follows it in logical sequence. That is why it is absolutely

          intermingle the letters. Remember, however, that the letters,
          words and figures used in this training are merely the <u>tools</u>
          with which you work on your mental processes -- as useless in
          themselves as a slide rule is to a Sunday driver. They are the
          means -- the end result is a mind of such power and
          adaptability that it will carry you to pinnacles of
          achievement far beyond your present imagination!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For your first drill in
          Exercise II, write from memory as many three-letter words as
          you can; at least thirty of them. Fifty to one hundred would
          be better. There is not much mental work involved in that, is
          there? Here are just a few for samples:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MAN&nbsp; DOG&nbsp;
            CAT&nbsp; THE&nbsp; HAY&nbsp; SEX&nbsp; RUN&nbsp; TOP&nbsp;
            WAS&nbsp; BUT&nbsp; NOW&nbsp; FOR&nbsp; HIP</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">|Now, write your list <u>from



            memory</u>! Do not copy these words, but think up
          three-letter words yourself and write them on a sheet of
          paper. Write them a half dozen times until you have them
          pretty well in mind and can recall them easily. Next, <u>without



            looking</u> at what you have written (throw the paper in the
          waste basket!), write as many of those words as you can
          remember, writing them BACKWARDS <u>from memory</u>, like
          this:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">NAM&nbsp; GOD&nbsp;
            TAC&nbsp; EHT&nbsp; YAH&nbsp; XES&nbsp; NUR&nbsp; POT&nbsp;
            SAW&nbsp; TUB&nbsp; WON&nbsp; ROF PIH</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some of the words you have
          selected will form new and correct words when spelled
          backwards, but disregard these new words thus formed. For the
          purpose of this exercise they mean nothing, but are mere
          coincidences.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The purpose of this drill is
          to train your mind to see things holistically in their
          entirety. For instance, when you think of the word "can", it
          should mean not just the sequence "c-a-n" to you, but should
          appear as a picture in your mind, of three letters, each
          equally important regardless of arrangement. The "a" is as
          important as the "c" or the "n" even though it is in the
          middle of the word. You can see the practical application of
          this is the consideration of commonplace problems of life and
          business!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Repeat this exercise
          twenty-five times, each time removing your previous effort
          from sight and making your new attempt entirely from memory,
          quickly forwards or backwards. And&nbsp; when that word
          pictures itself in your mind, it will appear to you not as a
          static sequence of three letters, but as three separate
          letters which your mind will be able to group into any form at
          will.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"But what good will that do
          me?" you may ask. "What good is it to me to be able to spell
          short words backwards?" This exercise will have taught your
          brain to do something it never could do it do before -- it
          will have broken down another rut in which your mind was
          traveling -- it is a step toward untrammeled, original
          thinking. And it will have developed your brain by just that
          much -- prepared it for further training by the lessons that
          follow in this course.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Furthermore, it will have
          trained your brain to see little things, like little words, in
          their entirety. The small problems of life or business or the
          home are made up of two or three sides, or questions, or
          'angles". No matter how simple, every question has at least
          two sides. The successful man is the one who can see ALL sides
          at once -- the other fellow's as well as his own. And, knowing
          the other man's problem, he is able to take advantage of the
          situation of his own interests -- while the other man, who
          sees only HIS side of the matter and does not grasp the
          problem as a whole, is placed at such disadvantage that he
          usually comes out second best. This exercise is powerful
          indeed in its potentialities!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, these two
          chapters will not make you a success overnight in what you are
          striving for, but they have started your brain on the path to
          clear, concise, <u>concurrent </u>and analytical thinking --
          which is an essential to success in <u>any</u> effort.</font>

              size="+1">Analytical vs. Synthetical Minds</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the conclusion of Chapter
          II, I mentioned analytical thinking. Let me make this clear,
          however: THE DAY OF THE ANALYTICAL MIND IS PAST, at least so
          far as major success is concerned. And to any of you men or
          women who pride yourselves upon having an "analytical mind", I
          issue this warning: <u>You've GOT to go beyond mere analysis
            and on to synthesis, or you will be a galley slave all your
            life, chained to the System or the Machine!</u></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reason it out yourself. In
          the beginning, primitive man was faced with a horde of
          unknown, mysterious and terrifying forces. The sun <u>died</u>
          daily, and was born again next dawn. Thunder threatened dire
          destruction in Stentorian tones. Forest fires, set by
          malignant, unseen demons, drove all before them. Floods
          wrecked the work of years. Dark diseases destroyed whole
          tribes. Everything about our hairy ancestors was confusion.
          Only the power of reasoning -- <u>analytical </u>reasoning
          that could assign the right effect to the right cause --
          sorted things out for him and finally made Earth and its
          element bearable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then came the long period of
          development when men had a fairly complete understanding of
          their environment. They began to break more and more things
          down to their component parts. The jack-of-all-trades began to
          give way to the specialist, the man who analyzed one
          particular facet of a business, or a science, or a profession,
          or a trade. By concentration, he became an expert and won the
          rewards due to his superior analytical ability. That was when
          an "analytical mind" was the passport to success.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is no longer necessary to
          have analytical ability in order to master an isolated part of
          any occupation or study. Medicine has been broken down into a
          score of sub-divisions, from Anatomy to Zoology. Business has
          been sub-divided into dozens of specialties, from Accounting
          to Underwriting. The farmer has become not merely an
          Agriculturist but a specific <u>kind</u> of agriculturist --
          lost in fields other where the mass of mankind finds little
          need for thinking at all and where analytical ability seldom
          distinguishes its possessor from his fellow workers --
          possessors of pre-analyzed knowledge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BUT... although the world
          has an over-abundance of advertising managers, art directors,
          production managers, operating superintendents, tool makers
          and designers, auditors, financiers, buyers, stockkeepers,
          salesmen, market analysts, time and motion men and other
          executives... there is a definite <u>lack</u> of BIGGER men
          -- men who can view these myriad other groups as you can now
          view a three-letter word -- who can see each in its proper
          relationship to the others and to the world at large -- and
          can weld from the heterogeneous mass a mercantile giant like
          Montgomery Ward or Sears Roebuck, or a manufacturing Goliath
          like General Motors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And there you have a glimpse
          of what Multiple Mentalism will do for you -- or, rather,
          enable you to do for yourself. It will enable you not only to
          apply analysis to your yourself -- the technique of tearing
          down and studying the component parts of any situation -- but,
          far more important, will give you the <u>constructive</u>
          ability to assemble the parts into a harmonious whole, a
          smooth-working organization, or plan, or book, or whatever it
          is upon which you are engaged. Seeing and understanding all
          factors <u>simultaneously</u>, you will be able to
          "synthesize" -- build up -- while your merely analytical
          competitor, like the canal boat captain of a vanished era,
          bemoans the passing of the "good old days"!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, Exercise III
          continues the analysis and synthesis drill inaugurated in
          Exercise II and supplements the training you have given your
          mind in this course so far.</font> </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              III</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Exercise II you became
          adept at writing three-letter words backwards from memory. And
          right here I want to emphasize the necessity of spending at
          least ONE HOUR a day on this course. You can devote time to it
          while riding to or from work, while eating lunch, or during
          any of the idle moments with which every man's day is blessed
          (or cursed!). No doubt you gained a fair mastery of Exercise
          II in an hour or so, for it is purposefully so simple that a
          child can do it and enjoy it. But to train the mind to
          accomplish a thing readily and instantly, you must train it by
          repetition until the process becomes <u>automatic</u>. In so
          doing, the right brain is engaged. It is not enough to be
          able, when leaving the second lesson, to write backwards any
          three letter word that comes to your mind, and to do so almost
          as readily as you would write it forwards. That is just a
          start. You must go further before taking up Exercise III.
          Repeat Number II every day for a week. An hour a day. At the
          end of the week you will find that you are doing it
          automatically, almost unconsciously, and absolutely without
          effort.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, but not until then,
          you are ready for Exercise III, in which you are to do this:
          Write, <u>from memory</u>, 25 to 50 <u>four-letter words</u>.
          Put them on a piece of paper and study them carefully. Then
          discard the paper and write them again. Do this several times,
          until you can quickly recall ALL OF THEM. Then write them
          backwards from memory. Here are a few samples:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Forwards: <b>KNOB&nbsp;
            PAIN&nbsp; CASE&nbsp; SILL&nbsp; RING&nbsp; SLIP&nbsp;
            READ&nbsp; SHOE&nbsp; WOOD</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Backwards: <b>BONK&nbsp;
            NIAP&nbsp; ESAC&nbsp; LLIS&nbsp; GNIR&nbsp; PILS&nbsp;
            DAER&nbsp; EOHS&nbsp; DOOW</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although they look queer,
          each is a word with a very definite meaning. The letters are
          in reverse order, it is true -- but, still, each is a word you
          frequently use and should be able to recognize at a glance,
          even though written backwards. Now, repeat this twenty-five
          times -- EACH TIME FROM MEMORY -- recalling the words in your
          mind and not looking at them in writing. Take a clean sheet of
          paper each time you write the group anew. After you have
          perfected yourself in this drill, you will be able to
          recognize the words Pale, Hump, Coon, even when you see them
          in reverse order, thus: Elap, Pmuh, or Nooc.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And what's that to you?
          Well, it means that you have now taken the first step toward
          being able instantly to see all sides of simple problems, no
          matter in what guise they may confront you. And with this as a
          basis, you will build your ability to conquer life's most
          difficult situations. The drills I give you in the exercises
          to come, make greater and greater demands upon your brain --
          develop it constantly to a point far beyond what you would now
          dream possible.</font> </p>

              &amp; Physical Health &amp; Multiple Mentalism</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let me make this clear as
          promptly and emphatically as possible: Multiple Mentalism is
          not in any way, shape or form -- directly or indirectly -- a
          system of mental healing! At least, no more than fishing or
          tennis constitute business training.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, there is a definite
          relationship and interdependence between bodily health and
          mental health. If you are weak, run-down and physically ill,
          your mind cannot attain its fullest efficiency until you have
          built up your body. The converse is equally true -- if your
          mind is worried, stressful and in ill health, your physical
          organs or their functions also suffer and you cannot achieve
          perfect bodily condition until your mental "set" is right.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sounds like vicious circle,
          doesn't it? But in reality it is not. The human body is the
          one thing we know of that literally can "lift itself by its
          own bootstraps." If your physical health is below par and your
          mental health is suffering accordingly, you can make your
          first steps toward recovery either through the mental or the
          physical. If you choose the latter, proper exercise, diet and
          living habits will not only start you along the road to
          physical health but, also, will in marked measure alleviate
          your mental symptoms. Having got so far -- with the physical
          condition somewhat better, proportionately, than the mental --
          you should turn your attention to bettering your state of
          mind. Mental exercise, straighter thinking and better mental
          discipline can then put your mind in better health,
          relatively, than your body -- which can again overtake and
          surpass your physical condition. In other words, you advance
          the health, first of one and then of the other, physical and
          mental, just as you place first one foot and then the other
          forward until you reach your objective.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And that explains why
          Multiple Mentalism -- without actually being a "mind cure" or
          "faith cure" in any sense of the words -- really has helped
          many to better health. This system of mind training gives your
          brain exercise, diversion and discipline -- puts it far ahead
          of your body in strength and energy, because there are limits
          to what the body can do but no limits to the capability of the
          human mind! There is nothing surprising in the fact that
          Multiple Mentalism, by stimulating, energizing and
          strengthening their minds, quickly uprooted the physical
          symptoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as Multiple Mentalism
          facilitates your building up of your body, a thoroughly sound
          body will enable you to reap even more benefit from my
          training -- will make it possible for your brain capacity to
          grow just that much more. And so I urge you again to devote at
          least one hour every day to the Exercises. Practice them at
          every opportunity. Transpose the letters and words you see on
          billboards, and jumble the type in your daily paper -- seize
          every opportunity to make your mind more proficient.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Moreover, you will find
          within the next thirty days that you are so much more
          efficient at your work -- because of these drills I am giving
          you -- that you will be able to spare more time from the
          office for physical exercise and play. You are on your way to
          full enjoyment of abundant health such as you never before
          aspired to! No wonder that you should do full justice to each
          lesson I give you, taking plenty of time to it and mastering
          it fully before taking another step forward and upward!</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              IV</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is your first complex
          exercise. It utilizes all the training you have given your
          mind through Exercises I, II and III. It consists of putting
          words together, exactly as you must put ideas together in life
          in order to obtain the fullest measure of business or
          professional success. Probably it will take you several days
          to become proficient in the mental gymnastics I now introduce
          -- but they will give you a very definite mental ability that
          you do not have at present.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Take 24 of the three-letter
          words you memorized in Exercise II, or any 24 other
          three-letter words that come to mind. Write them a few times
          so that you are thoroughly familiar with them. Then pair any
          two of the 24 that first occur to you, and intermingle their
          letters in sequence. Here is what I mean:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>OIL</b>&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;
          <b>BIT</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; <b>O B I I L T</b></font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>KEY</b>&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp;
          <b>MAP</b>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <b>K M E A Y P</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pair up the 24 words into
          any 12 pairs, writing their letters, as above, in 1-1, 2-2,
          3-3 order. Then start all over with the same or different
          letters. Mix the words in any pairs that occur to you.
          Intermingle their letters in the order given. Do this 20
          MINUTES <u>every day.</u></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the second 20-minute
          period of your hour's exercise, pair a three-letter word with
          a four-letter word and intermingle their letters:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>WERE</b>&nbsp;
          &amp;&nbsp; <b>HAS</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>W H E A

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and, similarly:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>COME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &amp; <b>AIL</b>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <b>C A O I M L E</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do this FOR 20 MINUTES EVERY
          DAY, using a different pair every time you do it, until you
          can take any three-letter word and intermingle its letters
          with those of any four-letter word as rapidly as you could
          spell each word correctly by itself. This drill should
          immediately follow your 20-minute practice in intermingling
          three-letter words.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, for the last 20-minute
          period of your daily drill, do the same exercises as the two
          preceding, EXCEPT: pair and intermingle four-letter words, one
          with another, instead of using three-letter and four-letter
          words, thus:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>LIKE</b>&nbsp;
          &amp;&nbsp; <b>PAIR&nbsp;</b> =&nbsp; <b>L P I A K I E R</b></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and also:</font> </p>

          &amp;&nbsp; <b>LOVE</b>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <b>F L O O A V M E</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You may realize how
          essential I consider it when I repeat a bit of advice given
          you in every exercise so far: NEVER "COPY" THE DRILL. <u>Do
            it from memory</u>! FROM MEMORY ALONE.<b> </b>Use your
          "mind's eye", not your physical eye. In doing this, you
          acquire that same miraculous ability with which the blind
          amaze the world -- the power to recreate, in your own mind,
          everything about you at the moment and anything you have seen
          in the past. Your mind OPENS -- it embraces THE WORLD IN ITS
          ENTIRETY. It is ILLUMINATED -- dark, obscure corners become
          LIGHT. Your mind is <u>awake</u> -- it LIVES. The whole earth
          is WITHIN YOUR MENTAL VISION -- <u>and you are master of it</u>!
          That is the power possessed by the blind, in some measure --
          and which you can not only acquire, too, but to which you can
          ADD the inestimable value of sight. Truly, I exaggerate but
          little when I tell you that practicing these exercises until
          you reach perfection in them will make you nothing less than a
          Super-man -- a being apart from those around you!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, make your mind WORK.
          Don't "coddle" it by copying -- nor "baby" it by taking less
          than an hour's drill every day. Take MORE, if you need it. The
          BIG thing is: to <u>master</u> -- master <u>thoroughly</u>
          -- each and every lesson as you go along. <u>Perfect</u>
          yourself in it before proceeding to the one following. In this
          way, and in this way ONLY, you will get full value from
          Multiple Mentalism, the SOLE course of its kind in the world</font>

              Mentalism</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Exercise IV may have seemed
          difficult at first. But by the time you take up this chapter,
          you will -- if you are fair to yourself -- have mastered
          Exercise IV and will now be able to do the drill easily.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is as good a time as
          any for me to go on record with this statement, substantiated
          by every scientific authority on the workings of the human
          mind: THINKING NEVER HURT ANYBODY! Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of
          America's outstanding philosophers, said: "It probably is
          easier for great men to do great things than it is for little
          men to do little things". So, if you have found it difficult
          to do the little exercises I have thus far given you, your
          brain has not yet really begun to realize its capacity and it
          still stamps you, comparatively, as a "little" man. However,
          to quote another famous figure in history, Thomas Edison once
          said, "Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration".
          Consequently, the effort you devote to these exercises will
          lead you surely and uninterruptedly to GREATNESS OF INTELLECT.
          And greatness of intellect is characterized by greatness in
          other things -- in understanding, in sympathy, in charity and
          in our daily conduct. Many ends well worth striving for!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And if, in the striving, you
          occasionally feel a touch of "brain fatigue", remember this:
          physical exercises that build up your muscles and framework
          are invariably accompanied, at first, by physical stiffness.
          This stiffness is in itself PROOF that the exercises are
          benefiting you -- calling into play parts of your body that
          have been "rusting", unused. So with the mental exercises that
          are given here. If they seem to make your brain stiff and
          somewhat "numb", you may be sure that they are helping you.
          The stiffer they make you feel, in fact, the more you have
          been in need of just this kind of "limbering up", and the more
          good you will get from it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You are now becoming able to
          carry on four or five mental processes <u>simultaneously</u>.
          Your thoughts of <u>self</u> are no longer able to crowd
          other thoughts out of your mind. Expressed in another way,
          Multiple Mentalism has left you still conscious of self, but
          no longer self-conscious! You are four or five times the
          individual you formerly were and you have outgrown your
          childish self-consciousness just as you have outgrown the
          clothes you wore as a child!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The same factors account for
          the disappearance of stuttering and stammering in several
          others who have perfected themselves in these drills. Where
          thought was too rapid for words, consequently crowding the
          consciousness so that no part of the mind was free to direct
          the speech, they stuttered and stammered. With the ability to
          think several things at once, they were free to complete their
          lines of thought while other parts of their brains followed
          along, putting the thoughts into words and seeing that the
          words were properly uttered, clearly and impressively. So,
          too, with those who hem'd and haw'd and er'd while sparring
          for time in which to think. Mental agility -- the ability to
          see and weigh all sides of a question simultaneously -- now
          enables them to speak right out, without impediment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some stutterers and
          stammerers, we are told by psychiatrists, are victims of
          neuroses and complexes all unknown to themselves. Even so,
          when they are relieved of these neuroses, freed from these
          complexes by Multiple Mentalism, is there anything in that
          "cure" to surprise the thinking man? Complexes and neuroses
          hide in dark corners of the mind -- hidden from sight --
          unpleasant experiences or desires that we wish to forget --
          unhappy memories or unworthy desires that our conscious minds
          do not want to face but which melt away instantly when dragged
          out into the light and dissolved by the illumination of Reason
          and Understanding. As you already can see, by its effects on
          your own mind, Multiple Mentalism opens up chamber after
          chamber in your brain -- airs and purifies it -- lets in the
          sunshine of Intelligence to disperse any unwholesome, buried
          memories that may be festering there -- gives you mastery in
          your own mind, over all that it is and all that it contains.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After all the foregoing, you
          might expect Exercise V to be a drill featuring Peter Piper
          and his peck of pickled peppers, or the ragged rascal who ran
          'round the rugged rock! However, it is not. You will find it,
          instead, a continuation of No. IV -- a trifle more complex,
          perhaps -- but even more interesting. If you have been
          faithful in your practicing and have mastered the four
          exercises given you so far, you have reached the point where
          your increased mental abilities are a constant source of
          amazement and pleasure to you!</font> </p>

              V</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Warning: if you have to any
          degree slighted the previous lessons, GO BACK AND MASTER THEM
          NOW, or you will fall by the wayside in your effort to acquire
          a Multiple Mind! Exercise V will absolutely stop 999 out of
          every thousand men who have not approached it by mastering
          Nos. I, II, III and IV. However, if you have been
          conscientious and regular in your practice and can now
          intermingle three-letter and four-letter words with ease and
          speed, these gymnastics will give you a genuine thrill!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">First, write 24 four-letter
          words from memory. It is easy, of course. You have used so
          many of them in the preceding lesson. Now, take any two of
          your four-letter words (select them in your "mind's eye", NOT
          by looking at the list you have written!) and intermingle
          their letters so that you spell one word frontwards; the
          other, backwards. Like this:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>HOLD&nbsp;</b>
          &amp;&nbsp; <b>SOIL</b>&nbsp; =&nbsp; <b>H L O I L O D S</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and</font> </p>

          &amp; <b>PUFF</b>&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> P P I U P F E F</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Naturally, you understand
          that this is to be done entirely from memory -- utilizing the
          blind man's gift of seeing with his mind -- and writing the
          intermingled letters on a clean sheet of paper, without having
          the words themselves before you as a guide. Just select the
          words, reach for a clean sheet of paper and write down S N U O
          R O E L after having selected, for example, the words SURE and
          LOON in your mind. Do not write SURE and LOON, themselves, at
          all -- just their letters, intermingled as explained, and
          NOTHING ELSE. Pair off other four-letter words and write them
          similarly for 30 minutes. Do not overdo yourself by practicing
          more than 30 minutes at present, for you must spend at least a
          week, and perhaps more, on Exercise V. You will have time
          tomorrow and in the days following to become really proficient
          in this and the following drill (also a part of Exercise V).
          It is better, you know, to take six hours in six days, for
          drilling than to take even twelve hours in a single day. You
          learn better, and retain what you learn, which you cannot hope
          to do if you "cram".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After you have practiced the
          above lesson for 30 minutes, go on to words of five . Write
          JSULMLPSAF if you have selected JUMPS and FALLS. Pair off
          five-letter words and write them thus FOR 30 MINUTES --- no
          more, no less, for the <u>first</u> day.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tomorrow and in the days
          following, <u>until you have MASTERED this drill thoroughly,</u>
          spend AT LEAST 30 minutes daily on four-letter words and
          five-letter words. Thirty minutes EACH, that is. Or more. Two
          hours in all if you can find the time&nbsp; --- an hour and a
          half if you cannot manage two hours --- but, at all costs, AT
          LEAST one full hour. And KEEP AT IT, day after day, until you
          can make four-letter and five-letter words "jump through the
          hoop" for you, in accordance with this drill.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How does this fit into your
          daily life and help you in solving business or household
          problems? Well, think it over. Something occurs on your job,
          let us say. Perhaps someone has been advanced over others'
          heads, or someone has been unexpectedly discharged, or a deal
          that you thought was "in the bag" falls through. Why? You may
          be sure that any totally unexpected happening of any
          importance was preceded by an entire series of events --- long
          and short and, perhaps, seemingly unrelated to the action in
          which they culminate. The most recent event in the series is
          probably familiar to you, but you may not see its connection
          with other, partially forgotten events. Now that your mind is
          becoming trained to break down and reconnect words, to take
          ten apparently unrelated letters and see them in their true
          relationship to each other, as two separate and distinct
          words, your mind will become equally able to analyze and
          reconstruct events in your business life --- to understand
          that which is now a puzzle to you.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Better yet: Perhaps a series
          of events is now under way, but has not yet culminated in any
          definite action. With your new-found ability to recognize
          seemingly heterogeneous elements as coherent entities, you
          will in many cases find yourself anticipating forthcoming
          actions and "beating the other fellow to the gun", or
          preparing yourself in advance to handle situations that
          otherwise would prove too much for you.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Need I say that when you can
          do this, and your rivals cannot, you --- and not they --- will
          win out in business competition?</font> </p>

              Professions</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Success in business requires
          certain attributes --- intelligence, observation,
          understanding, constructiveness and memory; whether you are a
          truck driver, an accountant or an attorney. Multiple Mentalism
          is a definite and potent aid in developing these requisites
          and is a truth self-evident to all who have carefully and
          honestly followed my admonitions and exercises thus far.
          Nevertheless, some consideration of this mental training in
          its relation to success in various occupations should prove
          helpful at this point.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Take the matter of
        intelligence, for a start. Intelligence is by no means a matter
        of formal education or schooling. Dictionaries define it as:
        "Mental acuteness, sagacity, understanding." Far different from
        mere learning, isn't it? A mind may be literally stuffed with
        facts but, unless it can <u>use</u> them, its possessor is
        stupid. The plumber, the salesman and the pharmacist all have
        infinitely better chances for advancement if their minds are
        active, are constantly using what knowledge they have as well as
        that which they acquire from day to day. That is but one of
        many&nbsp; reasons for the mental gymnastics I give you.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the preceding paragraph,
          I mentioned the knowledge that we acquire from day to day ---
          but many of us acquire little or no new knowledge in the
          ordinary course of our work. Such unfortunates are the victims
          of lack of observation --- which, in turn, is one of the
          deleterious effects of modern civilization. We see so many
          things, one crowding on the heels of another --- automobiles
          flashing past, traffic lights winking on and off, animated
          window displays frantically trying to catch our attention,
          advertisements screaming to be noticed, radio loudspeakers
          blasting almost incessantly, throngs of people scurrying past
          --- that the undisciplined mind becomes a muddled morass of
          confused impressions, totally devoid of the power to see and
          understand. In other words, unable really to observe
          intelligently --- to retain fresh knowledge that is worthy of
          retention and to reject trivialities that would be only mental
          dead weight. Multiple Mentalism, by enabling you to apprehend
          instantly what is, to the untrained mind, a hopeless jumble,
          gives you that priceless quality of the superior mind:
          Observation. It is an important factor in your success!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A hundred truck drivers may
          drive the same route, hauling the same loads, daily. And yet,
          only one of them may be observant enough to notice that his
          loading platform is too high or too low --- causing a waste of
          effort and time (which is money) in picking up his loads. The
          same driver is apt to notice whether a trailer or a
          self-contained truck is best suited to the character of the
          work. He may notice that most of his time is spent idling in
          traffic and that one larger truck is more desirable than two
          lighter, speedier jobs --- or that the reverse is true and his
          type of hauling could be done more efficiently by replacing
          one large truck with two or three smaller ones. A driver so
          observant is slated to be transportation superintendent or a
          highly productive salesman for some truck agency, or owner of
          his own trucking concern!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Understanding and
          constructiveness are but other phases of analysis and
          synthesis, both of which were discussed in Chapter III, but
          memory is another mental trait developed by the training you
          are here giving yourself.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We all have good memories,
          insofar as memory is defined as the mind's capacity for
          retaining impressions of names, faces, personalities, scenes
          and events. That is a trait common to all Mankind --- every
          brain records indelibly every impression made upon it, whether
          or not its possessor was conscious of the impression at the
          time it was made. But the ability to <u>recall</u> those
          impressions, at will, is not so common.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As an illustration of this
          fact: Psychologists have introduced a subject to someone he
          never met before, given him five or ten minutes with this
          stranger and then after the stranger has left the room,
          requested the subject to write his description. Almost
          invariably, the description is incomplete, inaccurate, and
          most vague. It might well apply to any four of the first six
          men you meet on the street. Even such obvious details as age,
          height, weight, and color are given incorrectly or omitted
          entirely! All of which might seem indicative of lack of
          observation as well as of faulty memory. however, when the
          subject is then hypnotized and questioned concerning the
          appearance of the man he has just met, his description is
          positively startling in its completeness and accuracy! Even
          such details as the initials on intricately intertwined
          monogram rings, the shades of color in multi-hued fabrics and
          the number of pencils or other impediments from a vest pocket
          are clearly given! You see, the facts were <u>there</u> but
          the subject could not <u>recall</u> them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My training, you must agree,
          not only makes you observant and thereby assures your noticing
          every pertinent factor applying to a person, thing or event
          but, also, is developing almost hourly your capacity for <u>recalling</u>
          those factors at will. The same brain "muscles" that pull a
          word into your consciousness, reverse the sequence of its
          letters and interpose them between the letters of a correctly
          spelled word (all of which, as you know, is done in the MIND),
          will enable you to pull into consciousness again the names,
          faces, conversations and characteristics of people you met
          long before. You will be able to recall events long past, as
          well as scenes you thought forgotten. Not by any mnemonic
          tricks of association or Magic Memory Formulae, but by simple
          and natural mastery of your mental processes! Multiple
          Mentalism enables you to make your mind do what you want it to
          do, when you want it done. Regardless of interrupting factors
          that woefully distract undisciplined minds, your brain is your
          faithful ally and servant, always alert to do your bidding ---
          ready instantly with whatever you require of it!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The accountant whose mind
          obeys its master sees and properly interprets the relationship
          between selling cost and sales price, between overhead and
          production figures, between volume and net income. He is on
          the way to becoming treasurer or financial agent! Similarly,
          the attorney who is sharp to seize upon discrepancies in his
          opponent's arguments, who is exact in drawing his own
          parallels with established precedents, who is quick to
          identify contradictions between present and past testimony, is
          well in line for fat retainers and generous fees! And these
          are the talents latent within us all --- machinist, farmer,
          physician and chef --- talents that will blossom and bloom
          through Multiple Mentalism. A rich harvest... yours for the
          reaping!</font> </p>

              VI</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since we have just discussed
          memory, I am --- for a diversion --- going to introduce an
          amusing little parlor trick which will entertain and mystify
          your friends and associates and, t the same time, strengthen
          your memory, or power to recall. Observe this "Magic Square":</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">10&nbsp;&nbsp;
          23&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp; 17</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">21&nbsp;&nbsp; 16&nbsp;&nbsp;
          11&nbsp;&nbsp; 22</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">15&nbsp;&nbsp;
          18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25&nbsp; 12</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">24&nbsp;&nbsp; 13&nbsp;&nbsp;
          14&nbsp;&nbsp; 19</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is distinctive about
          it? If you are observant, you will note that its columns ---
          whether added vertically, horizontally or diagonally --- yield
          the same total, 70. I am going to show you how you can
          challenge your friends to draw such a square, in blank
          (without numbers in it), and name any total they wish you to
          obtain. Then, almost without pause, you will be able to write
          in the correct figures to yield any desired total, no matter
          whether the columns are added up and down, across or
          diagonally!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first step is to draw
          and number a "key" square, thus:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</font>
        <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">15&nbsp;&nbsp;
          4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Look carefully at what you
          have drawn. Note carefully the positions of the "key" numbers,
          1 to 16 inclusive. Fix each numbered square in your mind. Now,
          conceal your diagram and draw a new one, exactly like it, FROM
          MEMORY. Number each square exactly as numbered above --- BUT
          DO NOT LOOK at the above or your own previous drawing. Draw
          and number the squares FIFTY TIMES, numbering the smaller
          squares 1 to 16, in numerical sequence. AFTER you have done
          this, draw the squares in blank, then write in the numbers by
          horizontal columns, thus: (1st line), 1-14-11-8; (2nd line),
          12-7-2-13; 93rd line), 6-9-16-3; (4th &amp; last line),
          15-4-5-10. Repeat this drill until you have mastered it
          completely. Then, starting with a drawing of the unnumbered
          squares, and WITHOUT looking at previous efforts, insert the
          numbers by vertical squares; as (1st column) 1-12-6-15; (2nd
          column) 14-7-9-4; (3rd column) 11-2-16-5; and (4th &amp; last
          column) 8-13-3-10. Do these three drills at least FIFTY TIMES
          each, from memory, or until you are as familiar with the
          arrangement and numbering of the sixteen squares as you are
          with the sequence of letters of the alphabet --- only more so!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, with the "Magic Square"
          well fixed in your mind, you are ready to puzzle your friends.
          Drawing the squares in blank, ask someone to name the total he
          wants you to reach. From whatever figure he names, subtract 30
          and divide the remainder by 4. Obviously, your friend must
          name a number as high as 34, or higher. Assume that the number
          given you is 86. Subtract 30, as explained. You now have 56
          for a remainder. Divide 56 by 4 --- an easy mental
          calculation. This gives you 14. Write 14 into square #1 (the
          1st square in the upper left hand corner), 15 into square #2
          (3rd square in line 2 of the "Magic Square" as you have
          memorized it), 16 into square #3 (4th square in line 3), 17
          into square #4 (2nd square in line 4), 18 into square #5, 19
          into square #6, 20 into square #7, and so on until you have
          written them all in, concluding with the number 29 in square
          #16. You will find that, no matter how you add the numbers you
          have written in, 86 is the total!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          27&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Fine!" you say, "but what
          do you do if, after subtracting 30 in accordance with these
          directions, the remainder is not evenly divided by 4?" Well,
          that doesn't make the trick any harder. Suppose you had been
          given the number 88 instead of 86. You would proceed as above,
          except that when you divided 58 by 4, you get 14 with 2 left
          over. Number your squares exactly as in the example given
          above --- 14 in square #1, 15 in #2, 16 in #3 and so on UNTIL
          you reach square #13. In square #13, instead of writing 26 as
          you did when working for a total of 86, add 2 (the "left-over"
          you had when dividing 88 minus 30 (58) by 4. That is, write in
          28 instead of 26 --- skipping 26 and 27 entirely. Add 2, also,
          to each of the remaining squares to and including #16 ---
          which means following 28 (Square #1) with 29 (square #14), 30
          (square #14) and 31 (square #16). You now have a square
          numbered like your first one, which totaled 86, except for the
          squares 13 to 16 inclusive, where you have subtracted 28 for
          your former 26, 29 for 27, 30 for 28, and 31 for 19 and have
          omitted 26 and 27 entirely. Your rows, columns and diagonals
          will now add to 88, the required sum! When your remainder
          after subtracting 30 from the sum required of you is not
          evenly divisible by 4, the "carryover" must always be 1, 2 or
          3 --- it cannot be anything else, of course. Whichever it is,
          add it to the numbers that would normally appear in squares 13
          to 16 inclusive, had the figure been evenly divisible by 4 ---
          as explained above. A simple trick, but effective!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now that we've had our fun,
          let's get back to the intermingling of the letters of words
          --- taking six-letter words this time, and intermingling their
          letter in multiple. This requires more application and
          concentration than have been demanded of you up till now, so
          you had better make DOUBLY sure that you have mastered the
          first five exercises!</font> </p>

          this:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Take the first letter of the
          first word, follow it with the first letter of the second
          word, and so on, taking the first letter each of the third,
          fourth, fifth and sixth words --- which would give you, had
          you used the same words I used above, the letters <b>PEHPMH</b>.
          Now add, in the same line, the second letter of each of the 6
          words. You now have <b>PEHPMHOXOUEE</b>. Continuing in the
          same line, take all the third letters, then the fourth,
          followed by the fifth and sixth of the of the 6 six-letter
          words. Here is what you get:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">P E H P M H O X O U
            E&nbsp; E&nbsp; W P N Z M A E E&nbsp; E Z O&nbsp; L R R

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The numbers are the keys to
          the words in their original sequence. that is, the six letters
          numbered 1 spell POWERS; those numbered 2 spell EXPERT; the 3s
          spell HONEST, etc.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do this again and again from
          memory, using the same six words you originally select and
          never peeking at what you have written before. Spend at least
          an hour doing it. Tomorrow, select 6 new six-letter words, and
          practice another hour with those words. Spend a minimum of one
          hour every day for a week, taking 6 new words each day.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Believe me, you won't find
          this exercise as easy to master as the ones ahead of it in my
          training! But stay with it! Even if it takes two hours or more
          a day, spend all the time necessary, for as many days as are
          needed to make you really adept at mingling any six common
          words or names in multiple sequence, quickly and correctly. It
          will pay you!</font> </p>

      <p><a name="kproblem"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font
              size="+1">The Problem of Middle-Aged Men in Business</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Men of 40 are prone to
          lament: "The most stupid blunder business men make today is to
          refuse to employ men in their forties, fifties and sixties.
          Why, that is exactly when a man is most valuable to them! He
          has acquired judgment, is rich in experience and, for obvious
          reasons, is far more interested in holding down his job to the
          complete satisfaction of his employer!"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Is this complaint justified?
          We know that employers frown upon the middle-aged applicants
          but are they, as a rule, right in doing so? Let us look at the
          average middle-aged man who seeks a new connection. Not the
          exceptional middle-aged man, but the average. What has age
          given him --- and what have the years taken away?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our middle-aged man has
          gained a wealth of experience --- but in doing so, he usually
          has lost his elasticity of mind. He is no longer willing to
          pioneer. New methods, new paths deter him. He prefers to
          travel by the compass of precedent. And this indicates that he
          has gained in judgment --- but what a loss he has suffered in
          daring! He no longer has the courage to originate, to create
          or to take what are, to a younger man, perfectly sound and
          promising business chances. He is steady as a plow horse is
          steady --- and with as little enthusiasm! And what he has
          acquired in the way of assurance, he has lost in open
          mindedness. He is no longer capable of viewing old problems in
          a new light. The rut has closed in on him. Youthful ambition
          and energy have been replaced by the timidity and inertia of
          age --- and he asks little better than to be left alone, to
          achieve some measure of security for his declining years!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An exaggerated picture? Not
          at all! Look about you. You will see in every office and shop,
          the very man I have described. What a pity!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And that shows you, more
          graphically than almost any other example I could give, why
          Multiple Mentalism is such a boon to all who expect to earn
          their bread by the sweat of their brows. If a man is not too
          firmly caught in the clutches of old Father Time, my exercises
          restore to his mind the lost elasticity of Youth. His brain
          regains its nimbleness and agility. Every day means to him a
          new day and a new start. he is open minded --- no longer
          trammeled by the shackles of precedent. He is willing and
          able, now, to approach old problems from new angles. Thanks to
          his new found ability, which my training has given him, he
          sees in them factors he had not noticed before. And each
          heretofore unseen factor suggests its own solution. His mind,
          constructive now, builds new methods to overcome the obstacle
          or circumvent the difficulty. What wonder that Multiple
          Mentalism restores his courage, his enthusiasm and his
          ambition! And his increased brain power gives new meaning to
          the word "energy". He is able to do with ease things that
          would have exhausted him before he tackled these mental
          gymnastics. Tasks that once fatigued him, he now&nbsp; takes
          in his stride.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such radical changes in a
          man's mind and in his outlook are bound to be reflected in his
          bearing. He walks jauntily, with a new confidence. He
          approaches prospective employers serenely, radiating Power and
          Poise. he is welcomed by executives who would have shut their
          doors to him but a few months before!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now do you see why my most
          enthusiastic "boosters" are men in their forties and early
          fifties? They have good cause for their enthusiasm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And while we are on the
          subject of age, let me say that I do not recommend these
          mental exercises for youths. The youthful mind should be spent
          in gathering knowledge and experience. After its owner has
          acquired a foundation of education and experience, Multiple
          Mentalism should be taken up to develop that mind and to "cash
          in" the experience and knowledge previously gained. Not
          knowledge --- but the most effective <u>use</u> of knowledge
          --- is Power!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roughly speaking, I set 25
          to 50 years as the age limits of those who can profit most by
          my training. Of course, some boys are men at 22; some men have
          not shed the final traces of adolescence at 35; some are old
          at 40; while some are young at 65. So, when I say that men
          from 25 to 50 years of age form the group that Multiple
          Mentalism will benefit most, I am being purely arbitrary. In
          the light of the explanation I have given you, each man must
          make his own decision.</font> </p>
      <center><font face="Times New Roman,Times">_________________________________________________</font></center>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              VII</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even before you saw these
          exercises, your mind was capable of doing more than one thing
          at a time. It was able to direct your hand to make penciled
          notes of telephone conversations --- to control your hands,
          feet, eyes and ears in driving a car while carrying on a
          conversation --- and many other such simple simultaneous acts.
          However, it probably could not do two things simultaneously
          and do them well. Your handwriting or word-choice, or both,
          suffered when you took notes while conversing on other
          subjects. Most automobile accidents are caused by
          inattentiveness --- the driver's inability to do justice to
          his driving while carrying on a conversation or listening to
          the radio. And the effort of trying to do more than one thing
          at a time wears down the average man --- causes nervousness,
          stress, heart afflictions, and other so-called "degenerative"
          ailments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, however, your brain is
          able to do more things at once than you may have realized. Our
          20th President, James A. Garfield, could not only write with
          either hand with equal ease, but he could also write the two
          classical languages, Latin and Greek, at the <u>same time</u>,
          one with his right hand, and the other with his left! Let's
          look at how far YOU have come along the road to mental
          mastery.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chapter I gave you a
          thorough knowledge of the alphabet, backwards, and enabled you
          to break the alphabet into two distinct parts. You have known
          one of these parts since you finished your first grade in
          school, but the other was a new part with the letters in a new
          sequence. And then you mastered the mental trick of carrying
          the first half of the alphabet in its proper sequence, while
          mingling the second half with it, in reverse order. Simple?
          Yes, but it takes two simultaneous mental operations!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chapters II and III further
          increased the ability you gained in Chapter I. You became
          capable of the same mental gymnastics in more complex form ---
          thinking of three-letter and four-letter words in two ways ---
          spelled forward and in reverse.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A military man would say
          that you had consolidated your gains, in Chapter IV, where you
          kept two unrelated words in mind and pictured their letters
          arranged alternately, one set of letters with the other, at
          one and the same time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then came your first hurdle,
          Chapter V. When you had topped it, you were possessed of still
          another accomplishment. Your brain could do <u>three</u>
          things at once: (1) carry two words in mind; (2) carry one of
          them spelled backwards; and (3) combine the letters of both
          into one sequence, spelling one of the words in normal order
          and the other backwards. Chapter VI increased the complexity
          of these same mental tasks.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Exercise VII, you will
          again increase your mental capacity, to which science knows no
          limit. Your mind will do four things concurrently --- not
          merely for the sake of doing four things but so that, when the
          demands of life force it upon you, you will be able to carry
          on four separate lines of thought without undue nervous
          strain. However, the nervous strain to which the untrained
          mind is subjected and the physical contortions in which many
          of us indulge when trying to think beyond our present ability
          to do so, do cause fatigue. Hence, the more you can do with
          your mind, the less effort and the more pleasure (as well as
          profit!) there is in living.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Write 6 six-letter words in
          a vertical column, just as you did in Exercise VI, <u>except</u>:
          Write <u>only</u> the 1st, 2nd and 3rd words forwards. Write
          the other three backwards. To illustrate:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">WONDER</font></b> <br>
        <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">THGIRB&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SUINEG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            (GENIUS)</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, working in your mind
          alone, without reference to any written list, assemble the
          letters of your six words as you did in Exercise VI, but
          putting the letters of words #4, #5 and #6 in backwards. Also,
          instead of taking the words in the order in which you have
          listed them, take word #1, then word #6, then #2, followed by
          #5, and ending with the words numbered 3 and 4.&nbsp; The
          above list would work out this way:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><u>&nbsp;W</u> S <u>H</u>
            E <u>A</u> T O U E R S H N I A U S G D N L T E I E E T A R
            R <u>G</u> H <u>N</u> T <u>B</u></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To help make this clearer, I
          have underscored the initial letters of each of the 6 words
          used, when spelled properly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Stop a moment and realize
          what this gymnastic means. It involves your (1) memorizing 6
          words; (2) carrying three of them, spelled properly, in your
          mind; (3) carrying three of them spelled backward; and (4)
          writing 36 letters in an entirely new and unfamiliar sequence.
          If you find it quite difficult to do this at first, you can
          readily understand why!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I'll tell you a way to cheat
          the difficulty of this exercise. If you write a letter, then
          skip five spaces and write the next that appears in the word
          you are spelling, then jump five more spaces to the next
          letter, etc., you can write the line quite easily --- BUT YOU
          WILL BE CHEATING YOURSELF and you will be setting <u>yourself</u>
          a long way back. So, forget the short cuts and, for your own
          sake, play the game! Keep all 6 words before your mind's eye,
          in the 1-6, 2-5, 3-4 order explained to you, and write the 36
          letters in sequence illustrated above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I have not sprung this bit
          of advice on you so far, because it has not been necessary,
          but I say now: Spend at least an hour a day on this lesson for
          a full week, even if you think you have mastered it long
          before the week is up. More than with any of the others, this
          exercise requires frequent repetition in order to train your
          brain as it should be trained --- to accomplish what has
          seemed the Impossible in your life until now. Remember, we are
          building up your brain to take the hill of $uccess "in high
          gear".</font> </p>

              size="+1">What Creative Imagination is --- And How to
              Develop it</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been said, "That man
          is most original who knows the greatest number of sources from
          which to plagiarize." Again, wasn't it Solomon who said there
          is nothing new under the sun?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To understand clearly what
          "creative imagination" is, consider some of the books,
          pictures, plays or business enterprises that you would call
          examples of creative ability. Take Woolworth, for example.
          There was an outstanding merchant! Made millions of dollars,
          he did. Showed the business world something new, too, if I'm
          not mistaken. Yet, articles sold for 5 cents and 10 cents long
          before Woolworth's day --- and other store operators had price
          limitations before Woolworth came along. However, price
          limitations were definitely set in the so-called "exclusive"
          stores. Snobbishly, because it appealed to their snobbish
          trade, they would not handle merchandise priced <u>below</u>
          certain figures. All that Woolworth did was to reverse that
          process --- just as you reverse the letters in a word, now
          that you have completed more than half my training. See how
          simple his technique, once you look at it?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All that Henry Ford did, to
          start with, was to add one more factor to what other
          automobile makers were doing. They were trying to build cars
          that would <u>run</u>. Their aim, at that time, was no
          higher. They had their eyes only on the production end ---
          overlooking entirely the market and its demands. Ford
          coordinated the two as easily as you mingle the letters of two
          words --- and became one of the richest men in history. He
          aimed to build a car that not only would <u>run</u>, but that
          also would <u>sell</u>. Nothing to it --- <u>after</u> it
          had been done!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are told that there are
          only five or seven plots in all literature. Shakespeare used
          them over and over again --- merely making new combinations of
          old elements. With only 26 letters in our alphabet, we have
          nearly a million English words --- and an English literature
          of prose, poetry and plays that must include countless
          billions of words!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do I make my meaning clear?
          Have I answered the questions raised by the title of this
          chapter? "Creative imagination" is simply the ability to
          combine old elements into new forms. Its development, in
          yourself, involves only the ability to cast aside the
          restrictions of precedent --- to forget entirely what has been
          done before in your field --- to refuse to accept any idea or
          method merely because it is long-established --- and to
          approach any given matter with a fully open mind.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When you see the word GARAGE
          and, at the same moment, see it spelled EGARAG in your mind's
          eye, you are casting off hidebound conventionality. You are
          thinking <u>freely</u>. Your mind is not a slave of things as
          they are. And you can do the same with other problems in your
          life --- see them forwards and backwards at one and the same
          time --- see them in a different guise than that in which they
          appear to most others --- and, so seeing them, solve them in
          what may well be a startling new manner!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There's the whole secret of
          Creative Thinking, explained so simply that, like Woolworth's
          and Ford's accomplishments, it seems almost childish. But
          children, you must bear in mind, are wise with a wisdom that
          surpasses that of age. Their thinking is independent, not
          loaded with the thoughtless habit of years. Theirs are
          inquiring minds --- taking nothing for granted, twisting and
          turning and examining every new fact that comes to them. Do
          likewise --- as Multiple Mentalism makes it possible for you
          to do --- and you will find life's major problems simpler than
          those of childhood! What's more, your Creativeness, your <u>daring</u>
          thinking, will bring rich monetary rewards!</font> </p>

              VIII</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You are about to train your
          mind to see the words of an entire sentence spelled backwards
          --- another step toward perfecting yourself in the ability to
          recognize the relationship between apparently unrelated events
          of elements and build up, anew, fresh creations from old
          material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Think of (don't write!) a
          sentence containing three or four short words. Fix it in your
          mind without touching pencil to paper. Then write the sentence
          backwards --- without having seen it on paper in its correct
          form. The sentence:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>HERE COMES THE BRIDE</b>
          thus becomes <b>EDIRB EHT SEMOC EREH</b>;</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>LOOK AT THE SHIP</b> now
          becomes <b>PIHS EHT TA KOOL.</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I know this seems far easier
          than earlier exercises, but that is because, first, it really
          is not a difficult exercise; and, second, because your mind is
          immeasurably better trained that it was when you undertook,
          say, Exercise IV. You can see words and sentences in their
          entirety, which you couldn't do before.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Practice ever longer
          sentences, with ever longer words. Ones like these:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>NOITCARTSID STAEFED
            NOITARTNECNOC </b>(Concentration defeats distraction)</font>
        <br>

        <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>STSIRUTLUCIRGA STSISSA
            NOITAGIRRI </b>(Irrigation assists agriculturists)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One hour a day on this,
          faithfully, will find you able, after three or four days, to
          write sentences backwards in from only a half to a third more
          time than it takes you to write them in the customary manner.
          To aid your practice, make a game of it. Glance only once at
          billboards, road signs, etc., then look away quickly and spell
          them backwards --- aloud, if possible; silently, if necessary.
          You'll be astounded at the progress you can make by using
          moments normally wasted. Profitable progress, too!</font> <br>

          about everything there is"!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Multiple Mentalism enables
          you to avoid pitfalls. By developing your brain so that it
          becomes really observant, it broadens your knowledge of many
          varied subjects. By giving you the ability to see familiar
          things in brand new settings, it deepens your understanding of
          men, objects and occurrences. By arousing your latent power to
          think of many things simultaneously, it gives your mind
          versatility, poise and a firmer grasp of situations and
          problems. And by putting you in <u>complete</u> control of
          your brain, <u>for the first time in your life</u>, it makes
          it possible for you to remain, at will, oblivious to that in
          your environment which is worthless to you, and to become more

          a prominence, because of your new-found mental capability,
          that will bring your speedy advancement in whatever you

          sight, let's go!</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              IX</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once more, your exercise
          becomes more intricate than those which came before it. And,
          as before, you will find it easy, despite its greater
          intricacy, if you have been honest with yourself in practicing
          the preceding drill (No. VIII)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To begin Exercise IX, think
          of two sentences, each containing three or four short words.
          DON'T WRITE THEM IN THE NORMAL WAY. The very first time you
          touch the paper with your pencil, in this exercise, write you
          two sentences with their letters intermingled, thus:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G S I E R M L A S G L Y I
            A K L E P D S O Y L O L B S</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">which combines GIRLS LIKE
          DOLLS (spelled forward) with BOYS PLAY GAMES (spelled
          backwards)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This may stump you a bit at
          first, but it will soon become easy if you have practiced the
          first eight exercises faithfully. In about three-quarters of
          an hour, of your first hour's drill, you will be writing short
          sentences this way almost without hesitation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tomorrow, take on four-word
          sentences, but keep the thoughts and words very short and
          simple at first. As short and simple as:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">M T E A N E W O O T R S K
            T T N O A L W I O V H E W</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">which is merely MEN WORK TO
          LIVE (spelled forwards) combined with WHO WANTS TO EAT
          (spelled backwards).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Naturally, you cannot space
          the letters according to words --- but, as that would be
          unnecessary for a mind trained as yours now is, it is
          unimportant. You can readily understand what you are doing,
          without that.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Give at least an hour every
          day to this drill. Make your sentences longer and your words
          more difficult as you progress. You will find this one of the
          hardest drills in my training, but I assure you that it is
          also one of the most valuable. For the first time, you are
          making practically all of your brain cells work --- except,
          obviously, those which control your various physical
          activities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In concluding this drill, I
          am going to make a new suggestion. I suggest that you take the
          mental processes involved in this exercise and deliberately
          apply them to some specific problem in your business or your
          home. Do not content yourself with merely calling the problem
          to mind, and hoping that the mental processes will take place
          automatically! Call them into play, consciously and
          deliberately. Turn the problem over and over in your mind.
          Twist it. Look at its various component parts forwards and
          backwards. Fit one into another and see how the new
          relationship affects them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Do this --- and you will
          see, beyond all question or argument, how thoroughly practical
          this training is in fitting you to cope more advantageously
          with everyday affairs! You will find that the most stubborn
          problems do yield easily to this form of solution --- that the
          answer often pops into your head so quickly and easily that
          you are ashamed of not having thought of it long ago!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Multiple Mentalism is a
          $uccess course indeed. I no longer need tell you that. You
          must have realized it, yourself, several chapters back. You
          know now that it actually and literally means, "MORE POWER TO
          YOU"!</font> </p>

For



          this drill, use your daily newspaper. Read and study for a few
          moments a headline in your newspaper (a sentence containing 8
          or 9 words) Now take a pencil and jumble the letters in each
          word as you write the sentence. try not to miss any of the
          letters. Then check back to see if you have made any mistakes.
          Do this, using new headlines each time, until it becomes easy
          for you. Example:</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MORE RAIN NEEDED IN THE

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You need not follow any set
          rule in jumbling the letters in the words. Write them so each

              size="+1">Multiple Mentalism as an Aid in Public Speaking</font></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chapter V tells you how many
          men and women have overcome self-consciousness through
          Multiple Mentalism. Their "multiple minds", acquired by means
          of this training, enables them to be conscious of themselves
          without being self-conscious. This is the first step to
          effective public speaking.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But this course goes even
          further in equipping you to speak well, to large or small
          audiences. Quite aside from the reason given above, our new
          brain development gives you the self-confidence ---
          self-assurance --- the innate knowledge that you can cope with
          the situation when you rise to your feet and begin to talk.
          This has a steadying influence which makes your words
          impressive and convincing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition, you will find
          that you speak more clearly and logically than ever before.
          Your brain is better able to marshall facts and to present
          them in their most reasonable sequence. No longer need you
          utter your arguments in the order in which they presented
          themselves to you when planning your speech, or in which you
          may originally have memorized them. Your training in jumbling
          of letters of words and the words of sentences permits you
          easily to intermingle your arguments in the order that seems
          to you most effective. If other speakers have preceded you,
          and you wish either to rebut what they have said or to
          emphasize arguments that were lacking in strength as they gave
          them, your mind is nimble enough to fit this new material into
          what you had planned to say, and to do it coherently and
          appealingly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Interruptions cannot
          throw&nbsp; you off your stride, thanks to the discipline to
          which you have subjected your brain. If you find it necessary
          to pause, waiting for exactly the right word to come to mind,
          you will not be embarrassed or flustered by your momentary
          hesitation. On the contrary, your calmness and deliberation
          will have a favorable effect on your listeners. They will be
          impressed, consciously or subconsciously, by your cool and
          collected manner. You will find yourself able to sway
          audiences as never before!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This advantage alone,
          disregarding all the other tremendous benefits of Multiple
          Mentalism, may mean thousands of dollars to you. As you
          advance in the business, professional or political world, you
          will meet increasing demands for formal or informal talks.
          Your ability to fulfill these demands so readily can mean the
          favorable vote of an important board of directors; the welding
          together of a political body that will carry you to prominence
          and greater opportunity! If it accomplished nothing else, the
          help that Multiple Mentalism can give you in public speaking
          is absolutely priceless!</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Have you noticed that the
          exercises are getting shorter and easier to explain, but
          increasingly difficult to do? That shows that you are
          approaching the climax and reaching the peak of mental power!
          Exercise X, for example, takes only a few lines to explain but
          sets you a real task in concentration and calls upon
          principles you have mastered earlier in your training.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Take pencil and paper. Write
          a word of seven or more letters correctly while, at the same

          number of letters). In other words: <b>WriteENGRAVE</b>
          slowly, while you <b>spell aloud E-V-E-N-I-N-G</b>. When you
          write E (for "engrave"), say E (for "evening"); when you write
          N, say V; write G and say E; write R and say N; write A and
          say I, write V and say N; and write E as you say G. That gives
          your brain cells a workout!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Practice doing this with
          seven-letter and longer words. Do it fully one hour a day

          intermingled. One sentence concerns a household pet --- the
          other concerns the weather. Both are short and simple,
          containing four short words each. See how long it takes you to
          decipher the two sentences.</font> </p>

              size="+1">How to Develop Intuition --- the "Sparkplug" of
              Intelligence</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We know intuition under
          another name: Inspiration. When we say that a man writes,
          speaks or acts as one inspired, we mean that he has grasped
          intuitively --- which is, instantly --- the right thing to do
          and has done it at the right time. Is this the same as rapid
          reasoning? In its result, yes --- although intuition usually
          brings that result far sooner that reasoning does. But even
          though the results are the same, the process of reasoning is
          different from intuition. More labored and cumbersome.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For example, suppose we have
          a problem consisting of three different elements, which we
          will call A, B, and C. Assume that element A seemingly has no
          relationship whatever with element C, but that it is
          practically identical with element B. Now, assume further that
          close examination shows that element B is substantially the
          same as element C. The reasoning man will work it out thus:
          "If A is the same as B, and B is the same as C, then A and C
          must also be the same." Of course, that is very elementary
          reasoning, but you can see that it involves the mind's
          traveling from&nbsp; to B, thence to C, then back again to B
          and A for comparison and check up and finally, after this
          verification of identity, the mind bridges the gap from A to C
          and the chain of logic is complete.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Contrast this with that of
          the <u>intuitive</u> mind, faced with the same problem.
          Intuition seizes upon and understands A, B and C (<u>all three
            of them</u>) simultaneously. It does not travel from A to B
          to C and back again, but apprehends all three elements at one
          and the same time. You might say that it fuses them into their
          common identity in a flash, just as an oxy-acetylene torch
          fuses tow metals in a single blast. Another way of putting it
          would be to compare reasoning to a slow fuse, while intuition
          more nearly resembles a fulminating cap. Reasoning travels
          slowly along a marked highway while intuition cuts across lots
          and gets there just so much faster.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This differentiation between
          reasoning and intuition makes it clear that Multiple Mentalism
          definitely and effectively develops your intuitive powers.
          Your brain is trained to seize upon many factors at once, to
          compare them simultaneously, and your several trains of
          concurrent thought naturally merge into a complete
          understanding of the problem or situation as a whole --- an
          understanding based on the correct evolution and sequences of
          the various factors involved. In five words: MY TRAINING
          UNFAILINGLY DEVELOPS INTUITION!</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font size="+1">Exercise
              XI</font></font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Write down 3 five-letter
            words</b>. Look at them until they are firmly fixed in your
          mind. Then put the paper where you cannot see it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, on a new sheet of
          paper, <b>write two of the words with their letters
            intermingled, spelling one forwards and the other backwards
            --- </b>and while doing this,<b> spell the third word aloud</b>,
          slowly. Like this:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>While writing CRAORNROYH</b>
          (<b>CARRY</b> and <b>RONOH</b>, which is HONOR written
          backwards), <b>spell aloud M-O-N-E-Y</b>. It's dollars to
          doughnuts you will not do this correctly the first five times
          you try it --- but you now have the brain power to master it
          with but little practice. Give an hour to this drill today,
          using different groups of 5-letter words. Take longer, if you
          need more time to attain speed and accuracy in the drill.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tomorrow, repeat your
          practice of this exercise for at least an hour, but use
          6-letter words instead of words with only five letters. For
          example: <b>Write EYNLEIRSGAYE</b> (<b>ENERGY</b>,
          frontwards, and <b>EASILY</b>, backwards) <b>while saying</b>
          aloud slowly <b>P-O-R-T-E-R</b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the following days of the
          week, take longer and longer words until the drill becomes as
          easy for you while using words like CONGLOMERATION as it was
          with simpler words.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For variation, <b>try using
            words of unequal length</b>, intermingling the letters of a
          6-letter word with those of a 10-letter words, while spelling
          a 12-letter word aloud. Try doing this with the first three
          words that come to mid, regardless of their lengths. Take
          unfamiliar words as well as familiar ones. Spell a word such
          as SUBSTANTIATION aloud while writing DEFIES and WORLDLY with
          their letters intermingled.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let me repeat the suggestion
          I made at the conclusion of Exercise IX. Now that your brain
          cells have been awakened and trained really to work for you,
          make a conscious effort to use in your daily life the
          principles of kinetic thinking you acquired through these
          drills. Put them to practical application. See for yourself
          how the quality and quantity of your work improve. Learn why
          so many speak of Multiple Mentalism as a $uccess Course. See
          how rapidly promotion and profits will follow on the heels of
          this priceless training!</font></p>
