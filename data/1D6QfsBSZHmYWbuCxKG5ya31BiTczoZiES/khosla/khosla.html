      <br>
      New Paltz — When the air conditioner caught fire three years ago,
      Kate Khosla thought it was time to pull the plug — literally — on
      her husband Ron's efforts to invent a better
      compressor-condensor-evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      For anyone who's not a farmer, a compressor-condensor-evaporator
      may not sound like something you'd want to spend much time
      building a better one of. But Ron and Kate Khosla are farmers, and
      it had always bothered them that it could cost $3,000 or more to
      have such a huge and heavy contraption installed to create a
      walk-in cooler room, cool enough to store their harvest in. Their
      organic farm, Huguenot Street Farm, is modest, as are their
      profits.<br>
      <br>
      Khosla's idea was simple: he thought he could build a gizmo that
      would allow an ordinary air conditioner to take a room's
      temperature down as low as 32 degrees. Not all of his prototypes
      blew up, but neither did any of his early models last long enough
      to get the job done.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The toasted air conditioner failed to stop Khosla from plugging
      away for another three years. Last week, you could find Khosla
      juggling about a dozen small boxes at the New Paltz post office,
      sending his patent-pending CoolBot to farmers like himself. With
      next to no publicity or marketing, the CoolBot is becoming a very
      hot item. And it's poised to go more places than the farm. He's
      sold about 80 units at $250 a pop and has placed material orders
      that will allow him to build another 500.<br>
      <br>
      It's all a marvel to Khosla, who calls himself a "reluctant
      capitalist" who never intended to sell his invention. He'd thought
      initially to explain the process to other farmers and let them
      build their own. That idea didn't work out, but the Khoslas don't
      seem too broken up about it.<br>
      <br>
      If enthusiasm could be measured in BTUs, Ron Khosla's would be off
      the charts. Yes, it's been eight years in the making — no
      overnight success, but, he says, once you've invented something
      and it's showing such promise and you start realizing who else in
      the world would love to have a walk-in cooler (caterers, kitchens,
      grocery stores, wineries) and you're already discovering economies
      of scale and making a good thing better, well, all you really want
      to do is invent something else.<br>
      <br>
      And that's the plan at the Khoslas. Whatever money they make from
      the CoolBot is being earmarked for Ron's next project.<br>
      <br>
      And what might that be?<br>
      <br>
      He smiles and rolls his inventor's eyes conspiratorially.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a secret."<br>

      <div align="center"><b>CoolBiot : How It Works</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      “Normal” walk-in cooler compressors sell for $2500 + installation
      which in our area is another $1000, not including electrical. They
      use a “brute-force” approach to cooling: using LOTS of coolant
      (which is bad for the environment), a big motor, lots of surface
      area and multiple fans (which dry out your vegetables and end up
      accounting for up to 60% of the cost of operating electricity.).<br>
      <br>
      Here's the crazy thing: that $2500+ walk-in cooler compressor you
      see on a small 8' x 8' vegetable cooler may only put out 8,500
      BTUs of cooling power! That's less than you get from a $300 window
      air conditioner from Home Depot!<br>
      <br>
      It's not quite that simple, though. Here's the problem with window
      air conditioner units. First, they are electronically limited so
      that you can't go below 60 degrees. With some electrical bravery
      and skill, you could snip, solder and bypass the electrical
      controls so you COULD go lower. It will work better, but still not
      very well, because while BTU's are BTU's (it's a strict measure of
      cooling/heating capacity), your ability to actually ACCESS that
      cooling power drops drastically as you approach only 60° F. This
      is because you don't have the fans and extra surface area built
      into normal walk-in cooler compressor/condenser/evaporator units
      which dissipate the cold without freezing up.<br>
      <br>
      That's where CoolBot comes in! CoolBot uses new (2006 patent
      pending) technology to replace the brute force approach of fans
      and surface area with a micro-controller "brain" that
      intelligently interfaces with your air conditioner - controlling
      and co-ordinating its output so that you can access nearly all
      your cooling power, even as you keep temperatures in your walk-in
      cooler (or any highly insulated room) in the 30's without
      re-wiring and without any freeze-ups.<br>
      <br>
      The CoolBot is NOT just a thermostat. The CoolBot uses multiple
      sensors and a programmed micro-controller to direct your air
      conditioner's compressor to operate in a such a way that you can
      run at whatever temperature you want without ever freezing up. And
      our innovative interface linking the CoolBot controller to your
      air conditioner allows for 2-minute installations without any
      training, cutting, soldering or even taping.<br>
      <br>
      The multiple sensors and micro-controller allows the CoolBot to
      work even during the heat of summer and even when people are
      opening and closing the door all day long and EVEN if they
      accidentally leave the door open! (Obviously CoolBot can't get you
      down to temperature if the door is left open for hours, but it can
      do the best it can without freezing up the fins of the air
      conditioner so that when you DO close the door, you'll be able to
      quickly recover to the right temperature.<br>
      <br>
      CoolBot cannot give you 100% use of the listed BTUs on your air
      conditioner. You need to buy a 10,000 btu a/c unit even when you
      could have gotten away with an 8,000 btu walk-in cooler compressor
      (and we would encourage people to get a 12,000 btu unit. It's not
      necessary, but it's nice to have the extra power). The price of
      even a large a/c unit is still a fraction of the cost of a real
      walk-in cooler compressor.<br>
      <br>
      Most importantly, when it can't access your BTUs of cooling power,
      CoolBot is programmed to shut off the compressor on your A/C unit,
      so you do not pay for electricity to make BTUs that you can't use!
      That saves you money and helps the environment. As long as you
      sized your air conditioner correctly, you'll have no problem
      keeping your room as cold as you want it to be. <br>

            refrigeration conversion unit</b><br>
          <b>US2010269519 </b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A conversion unit for an air conditioning system to cause it to
      act like the cooling unit of a refrigeration system comprises a
      frost detector, an A/C temperature control defeating mechanism and
      a control unit which operate together to force the range of
      operation of the air conditioning unit into the range of operation
      of a refrigeration unit. The conversion unit is particularly
      useful for providing low cost cooling systems for farmers in third
      world countries for keeping their produce fresh and safe, not to
      mention its use by all farmers around the world and by florists or
      others in need or desire of an economical refrigeration
      alternative. The present invention is also usable to provide
      inexpensive cooling to RV's and to refrigerated vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application is a continuation-in-part of application
      Ser. No. 11/724,129 filed on Mar. 14, 2007.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention is generally directed to the
      conversion of conventional air conditioning system units so as to
      operate more capably as part of a complete refrigeration system.
      Thus, as compared to conventional air conditioning units, the
      present invention permits the economical construction of insulated
      volumes which are now capable of being cooled to near freezing
      levels. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a
      separate unit, which is configured with a conventional
      air-conditioning unit in order to convert it to the core of a
      refrigeration system, as opposed to its function as a mere air
      conditioner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] It is well known that air conditioning units are relatively
      inexpensive. They can often be purchased for amounts even as low
      as $30 in some developing countries; domestic prices can be found
      as being as low as around $150. In contrast, refrigeration systems
      that are employed in commercial settings tend to be expensive and
      have relatively high power demands and installation requirements.
      Accordingly, it is seen that there is a need for a mechanism,
      which is capable of converting an inexpensive air-conditioning
      unit so that it operates as the core of a refrigeration system.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] However, it is not well known that air conditioning units
      are typically designed to shut down their compressor operations
      when it gets too cold. For the typical room size air conditioner,
      this temperature is around 64° F. but may be as low as 60° F. For
      example, Frigidaire® has made an air conditioner unit in which a
      temperature sensor is disposed in thermal contact with the coils
      of the device. When the coils become “too” cold, the compressor is
      shut down. One of the reasons that they do this is to control the
      viscosity of the refrigerant since efficiency is adversely
      affected by having the refrigerant pass through an expansion valve
      (orifice) which is too small relative to the fluid's viscosity.
      Later models of the Frigidaire® units eliminate this temperature
      sensor and instead rely solely on the room air temperature sensor
      which is still used to shut the compressor down at a temperature
      of around 60° F.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] It is also noted that not all air conditioning units employ
      a thermistor type of temperature sensor. Again, this temperature
      sensor is for room air and is intended to determine the point at
      which the unit shuts down to avoid further cooling. Some A/C
      units, such as those typified by units installed in recreational
      vehicles, employ a long copper capillary tube as part of an analog
      design. These units typically employ an integral switch assembly
      with a rotatable analog setting knob which controls the lower
      cutoff temperature based on temperatures to which the relatively
      lengthy capillary tube is exposed. Such units are found in
      recreational vehicles (RVs) and in older air conditioners as well
      as in inexpensive air conditioners sold in developing countries.
      The present invention includes an embodiment that is compatible
      with this A/C design as well and allows RV air conditioners to
      operate large truck cooling systems at a cost of around $2,400
      instead of the present cost of around $14,000.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] It is further noted that there is a significant need for
      inexpensive refrigeration systems. In particular, farmers would
      very much like to have an inexpensive method for keeping their
      produce and crops at reduced temperatures were for storage and for
      longer shelf life. Additionally individuals such as florists,
      restaurants, and grocery stores would also benefit from having
      inexpensive refrigeration systems. Furthermore, as desirable as
      these systems are in the United States, they are immeasurably more
      desirable in other parts of the world where refrigeration is at a
      premium but which is nonetheless a necessity because of the
      elevated temperatures of the climates in these regions.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In addition to the fact that refrigeration systems are
      expensive, it is also the case that such systems are very
      demanding in terms of their electrical power requirements. It is
      therefore seen that there is also a need for cooling systems that
      require less electricity than is consumed by conventional cooling
      systems which the current invention in combination with a standard
      window air conditioning unit is capable of doing.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] One of the problems with using a conventional
      air-conditioning unit as part of a refrigeration system is that
      such units are designed with specific controlling features in
      mind, which limit their operations, cycle duration and their
      cooling capabilities. For example, the control units for a
      conventional window air conditioner are set so that the units turn
      off at a relatively high sensed temperature. Nonetheless, for
      purposes of using a conventional air-conditioning unit as the core
      of a refrigeration system, these air conditioners, with their
      conventional control units, are set up so that it is always far
      from the case that humidity is allowed to condense on the fins of
      the unit in the form of ice. In short, in their normal mode of
      operation, conventional air-conditioning systems are designed to
      cut out at a relatively high temperature. It is therefore seen
      that in their off-the-shelf state, these units are not capable of
      operating as refrigeration units. The adapter units of the present
      invention provide a retrofit mechanism which extends the range of
      operation for a conventional air conditioning unit. This is found
      to be particularly advantageous in relatively small and
      inexpensive window units.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] Accordingly, in order to solve these problems, there is
      provided a simple retrofittable conversion unit, which includes a
      frost detector, a control unit and a heater, which is used to
      “fool” the temperature sensor in a conventional air conditioner.
      The present invention comprises a device to adapt an
      air-conditioning unit to a lower temperature of operation. The
      device comprises a sensor for detecting the presence of frost on
      the fins of the air conditioning unit and a heater for disposition
      adjacent to a temperature sensor for the air conditioning unit. A
      control unit deactivates the heater upon the condition that the
      sensor provides an indication that there is frost on the fins.
      There is also provided a method of installation of the present
      device so that it easily works with a conventional, off-the-shelf
      A/C unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In accordance with another embodiment of the present
      invention, there is provided a corresponding method for operating
      an existing air conditioning unit having fins across which air is
      directed to cool it, so as to achieve a lower temperature of
      operation. This method includes the following steps: applying heat
      to a temperature sensor present in the air conditioning unit;
      sensing the presence of frost on the fins the air conditioning
      unit; and controllably adjusting heat applied to the temperature
      sensor to produce continued operation without producing
      significant frost build up on the fins.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
      invention, there is provided a method for the conversion of an
      existing air conditioning unit into a unit capable of operating as
      the core of a refrigeration system which operates at near freezing
      temperatures. In this method a heater in an adapter is thermally
      connected to the temperature sensor of the air conditioner. A
      frost sensor in the adapter unit is disposed adjacent to the fins
      of the air conditioner. The adapter is electrically connected to
      the air conditioner to supply the adapter with power. These steps
      may be performed in any convenient order.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present
      invention, the heater is replaced by a relay which replaces the
      integral knob/capillary-tube switch described above. Instead of
      driving an electric heater, the present invention also encompasses
      the concept of entirely replacing the temperature control of an
      A/C unit with a relay. This is easy to accomplish since the
      integral knob-capillary tube switches are typically provided as a
      single pluggable (and therefore unpluggable) unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In yet another embodiment of the present invention the
      heater is replaced by wiring directly into the air conditioner
      control board in place of and at the point of the air
      conditioner's temperature sensor probe and then providing
      synthesized variable resistance values that mimic colder or warmer
      readings from the original air conditioner's temperature sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention is also characterizable as an
      auxiliary control mechanism for an air conditioning device that
      already has a control mechanism albeit one that precludes its
      operation below a certain temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
      bring the advantages of refrigeration to areas of the country and
      the world where it is most needed and least affordable.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is also an object of the present invention to provide a
      retrofit mechanism which extends the range of operation of
      conventional A/C units.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It is a still further object of the present invention to
      provide a method for easy installation of the present device.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is yet another object of the present invention to
      provide an effective and economical refrigeration system.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It is also an object of the present invention to provide an
      economical device and system for the improved preservation of
      produce together with all of the health and food safety benefits
      that that entails.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] It is a still further object of the present invention to
      provide inexpensive A/C cooling systems for use in refrigerated
      trucks and/or other commercial vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Lastly, but not limited hereto, it is an object of the
      present invention to provide an add-on device for controlling A/C
      units so as to make them usable in conjunction with easily
      implementable insulated or insulatable volumes which can be kept
      at near freezing temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Additional features and advantages are realized through the
      techniques of the present invention. Other embodiments and aspects
      of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered
      a part of the claimed invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The recitation herein of a list of desirable objects which
      are met by various embodiments of the present invention is not
      meant to imply or suggest that any or all of these objects are
      present as essential features, either individually or
      collectively, in the most general embodiment of the present
      invention or in any of its more specific embodiments.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional room or window
      air-conditioning unit 100. The front of such units typically
      include vent openings 102, through which cooled air is supplied to
      a room. Such units also typically include vent openings 104,
      through which room air may be exhausted. In particular fans or
      other air moving devices are operated in reverse mode under
      control of switch 107. Switch 107 is typically provided with the
      control function of supplying air to the room or removing air from
      the room in an exhaust mode. Such a mode of operation is
      conveniently provided so that the fan provided with unit 100 is
      capable of supplying cooler evening air from the outside through
      vents 102 while at the same time, exhausting warmer interior air
      through exhaust vent 104. Switch 107 controls this function.
      Additionally there is also provided temperature control switch
      106, which allows a user to choose a temperature below which the
      unit ceases its cooling function. Once a desired temperature is
      reached, the units compressor function is shut down. However, the
      units fan may continue operation for a predetermined time
      following the determination that he desired room temperature has
      been reached. Conventional unit 100 also includes control switch
      105, which selects the mode of operation. In one mode of
      operation, a user may select to operate only the fan and not the
      units compressor or cooling function. This may be desirable for
      example, in situations in which a simple exchange of room air with
      outside air is desired. Mode control switch 105 also typically
      provides to other modes of operation: hi cool and low cool. The hi
      cool mode of operation is one in which greater electrical current
      is supplied to either or both of the fan motor and or compressor
      motor to select either the degree and or speed of cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Since the structure and operation of the present invention
      is based upon a modification of the conventional system employed
      in off-the-shelf room and window air conditioners, it is
      appropriate to consider the usual refrigeration cycle and the
      controls that are normally imposed thereon. Accordingly, the
      structural block diagram shown in FIG. 2 is provided in order to
      enhance one's understanding of the parameters and controls
      involved. In particular, it is seen that motor 200 drives
      compressor 202, which compresses a refrigerant. This refrigerant
      flows through conduit 203 to expansion valve 204. In expanding
      through this valve, the compressed refrigerant is cooled in
      accordance with well known thermodynamic principles. The cooled
      fluid is passed through conduit 205 to condenser 206. Condenser
      206 includes fins across which fan 208 blows air which is cooled
      via its thermal contact with the fins of condenser 206. In
      condenser 206 refrigerant is warmed by the passage of air across
      its fins and the fins are cooled by being in thermal contact with
      the refrigerant which has been cooled by its passage through
      expansion valve 204. Thus warmed coolant is returned via conduit
      207 to compressor 202 at which point the cycle repeats.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Motor control 210 controls the operation of compressor
      motor 200, and fan motor 201. Under control of selector switch 107
      fan 208 may be operated in reverse to provide an exhaust function.
      More particularly, motor control 210 responds to signals input
      from temperature sensor 209. Motor control 210 also receives input
      signals from switches 105, 106 and 107 shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The present invention provides a retrofit apparatus, which
      is used to better control the conventional refrigeration cycle
      illustrated in FIG. 2. Since the normal temperature range of
      operation for a room or window air conditioner is not so low as to
      cause ice build up on the fins of condenser 206, there is no need
      in such units to provide for frost or ice detection. Since these
      units have not been contemplated for use as the central core of a
      refrigeration system, as opposed to a simple room air cooling
      system, frost or ice detection has not been seen as either a
      desired or necessary function. However, if one wished to use such
      units in any refrigeration function where the temperature range is
      significantly lower, frost or ice accumulation is a problem.
      Accordingly, one of the elements provided in the retrofit
      apparatus of the present invention is frost or ice sensor 400 as
      shown in FIG. 3. This is preferably implemented as temperature
      sensor, however, any convenient means for detecting frost may also
      be employed including electrical conduction and/or optical
      sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Additionally, as noted above, conventional room or window
      air conditioners are not designed to function below certain
      temperatures. Such units are designed essentially for cooling a
      room not for turning it into a refrigeration structure.
      Accordingly, the retrofit apparatus of the present invention also
      includes heater 500, which is disposed in close proximity to
      temperature sensor 209. Control 300 operates to activate heater
      500 so as to effectively fool temperature sensor 209. However, it
      is noted that by choosing to operate at lower temperatures, frost
      or ice detector 400 is employed, whereas before no such sensor was
      needed or desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Accordingly, it is seen that the present invention provides
      a retrofit apparatus having three complements. Heater 500 is
      employed to essentially force the air conditioning unit to operate
      so as to produce lower temperature air. Frost or ice sensor 400 is
      employed to ensure continued operations at the lower desired
      temperature, which is more in the range of a refrigeration system
      than in the range of a room cooling system. Control unit 300
      separately receives a user supplied indication of desired
      temperature. Using heater 500 and sensor 400 control unit 300
      operates to control the conventional room or window
      air-conditioning unit in the manner described above. In preferred
      embodiments of the present invention, heater 500, sensor 400 and
      control unit 300 are provided in a single package, which is easily
      connected into and coupled with a conventional room or window
      air-conditioning unit to provide a refrigeration function.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the various
      components of the adapter of the present invention. In particular
      microcontroller 300 is implementable as PIC Microchip
      microcontroller Model No. 16F916, though many low-end
      microcontroller chips would also be just as satisfactory. This
      chip contains code burnt into an EEPROM for implementing the
      control algorithm and user interface functions described above.
      There is included also included internal heater 510 included on
      the main circuit board to prevent short-circuits due to
      condensation. Internal heater 510 is controlled by controller 300.
      As described above, there is also provided external heater 500
      connected via wires 450. This heater is disposed as described
      elsewhere herein. The heater itself is located on an external
      cable that plugs into the main circuit board. Heater 500 is also
      controlled with controller 300. Also provided is power on
      indicator 426 which is lit when DC power is connected. Two
      temperature sensors 330 and 335, measuring the room temperature
      and the temperature of the air conditioner's fins respectively.
      These sensors are mounted on external cables that plug into the
      main circuit board. Controller 300 communicates with them using a
      serial protocol to read the two temperatures at appropriate times.
      Three input buttons, 410, 415 and 420 are accessible from the
      front panel and are used to change the parameters of the cooling
      algorithm, as well as for diagnostic purposes. Their functions are
      also described in greater detail elsewhere herein. Display 405 is
      made up of two modules, DIS1 and DIS2. The display is provided in
      the present implementation solely as a matter of convenience. The
      relevant aspect of the display is that there are a sufficient
      number of digits to display the temperature or any optional
      diagnostic settings. Controller 300 uses these digits to display
      running status, to provide feedback while the user sets algorithm
      parameters, and to support diagnostic tests. There are also
      preferably two status indicator lights (470 and 480 in FIGS. 4 and
      5). Indicator 470, which is controlled by controller 300, is lit
      when the control algorithm determines that the air conditioner
      should be turned on. Indicator 480, which is also controlled by
      controller 300, is lit by when the control algorithm determines
      that current is required in heater 500 in order to heat it to a
      level that will trigger the air conditioner to turn on.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Attention is now directed to a method by which the present
      invention is added to an existing air conditioning unit. The first
      step in this process is the construction of an insulated volume.
      Materials useful in this process include Styrofoam and SprayFoam
      which can be applied to seal any cracks or gaps in the structure.
      At this stage, one should also consider adding extra insulation.
      If there are windows present in the structure, they should be
      sealed with Styrofoam or any other useful or available insulative
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] If it does not already exist, a conventional
      air-conditioning unit is disposed through an opening in the
      structure wall. The edges of the opening are sealed as well. The
      next step is the removal of the front portion of the
      air-conditioning unit. This front portion is typically plastic.
      It's removal also typically exposes air filters present in the
      unit. These air filters are also preferably removed. It is
      recommended that this front portion not be reinstalled. This
      exposes the fins of the air conditioning unit which produces both
      an advantage and a disadvantage. The disadvantage is that the fins
      can be bumped and bent. The advantage is that the fins can easily
      be cleaned and be bent back into shape as needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The next step in the installation procedure is the location
      and the freeing of the thermocouple sensor that normally comes
      with the air conditioning unit. Note that this freeing operation
      is not an electrical disconnection, but rather a moving of the
      thermocouple away from the fins of the air conditioning unit.
      Typically the thermocouple is disposed on a long and flexible
      wire, which is easily bent away from the fins. If there are any
      plastic ties or other structures holding the thermocouple in
      place, these are preferably removed as well so as to have the
      thermocouple swing free of the fins.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The next step in the installation process is the mounting
      of the device of the present invention on a wall of the structure
      near the air conditioning unit. Here on this device is referred to
      herein as the CoolBot™, The CoolBot™ may be provided with any
      convenient wall fastening means, including screws, adhesives,
      Velcro or even hung on nails. The CoolBot™ is hung on the wall in
      a position sufficiently close to the air conditioning unit that
      wires extending from the CoolBot™ are capable of being connected
      to appropriate points on the air conditioning unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The next step in the installation process is the mating of
      the thermocouple with the warming element of the CoolBot™. This
      coupling is designed to ensure close thermal contact between the
      two elements. In particular, it is possible to join these two
      elements by placing them next to one another and wrapping them
      with aluminum foil. Even a single layer of the aluminum foil is
      adequate; however, multiple layers provide a more secure coupling.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The next step in the installation process is the connection
      of the CoolBot™'s frost sensor to the fins of the air conditioning
      unit. Looking at the fins in a typical air-conditioning unit, one
      sees that there are copper pipes carrying the units refrigerant.
      The frost sensor is disposed, just below one of the lower copper
      pipes, which is typically several inches above the bottom of the
      air conditioning unit. The frost sensor is inserted between two of
      the fins. One may rely upon a friction fit to hold a frost sensor
      in place or more preferably, one may bend some of the adjacent the
      fins together to more ably hold the frost sensor in position. This
      is easily done with one's fingernails or with a screwdriver<br>
      <br>
      [0047] For air-conditioning units, which are Energy Star
      compliant, there is an additional step that is also performed as
      part of the installation procedure. In particular, the frost
      sensor that normally accompanies such units is moved. Note,
      however, that this sensor is not removed only repositioned away
      from the fins so that it does not interfere with the operation of
      the CoolBot™. The CoolBot™ is also provided with an ambient room
      temperature sensor. This sensor should be allowed to hang freely
      in the cooled volume. The present invention thus renders it very
      easy to retrofit a conventional room or window air-conditioning
      unit so as to operate as the core of a refrigeration system. The
      only other thing that needs to be provided is some form of
      insulated airtight structure. Wood and Styrofoam structures, which
      are readily available in rural and third world areas readily
      suffice for carrying out this function.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Attention is now directed to a view of the front panel of
      CoolBot™ device 400. In particular, the front panel includes LED
      (or other technology) display 405 which is used to not only
      display the current temperature, but is also used to set desirable
      temperatures to be achieved at the air conditioner fins. It is
      noted that any convenient display device may be employed and the
      display is not limited to LED devices; LCD displays are
      employable; however, it is noted that in many refrigeration
      environments lighting may be so low that LED displays are a
      significantly preferred choice. Likewise, LED displays are
      preferred in situations where condensation may be a factor. Front
      panel 400 includes the three buttons labeled room, frost, and
      delay (having reference numerals 410, 415, and 420, respectively).
      Pressing the “ROOM” Button lets one pick the desired room
      temperature. In current preferred embodiments, the lowest
      selectable temperature is 32° F. Every time you push the ROOM
      button, the temperature goes up one degree; when it reaches a
      maximum temperature, it then starts over again at 32° F. Pressing
      the “FROST” button allows one to change the frost detection
      settings. The CoolBot™ device is provided with a default
      temperature setting for this value, but if ice forms on the fins,
      pressing the FROST button so that it goes up one or two degrees
      typically stops this from happening. If the room isn't getting
      cold and ice is never forming, then the frost temperature is set
      too high. Pressing the FROST button until it cycles back to the
      starting point should solve this problem. If no frost is ever
      forming then either: (1) one has a new Energy Star compliant unit
      and didn't move its frost sensor; (2) the room is extremely leaky
      and uninsulated; or (3) the room is too big for the given air
      conditioning unit. The solution to these last two problems is
      sealing the room better, adding a second A/C unit or using a
      single larger unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Pressing the DELAY button changes the Delay Mode. This
      button controls the delay between the time that both sensors'
      temperatures are above their respective thresholds and when the
      air conditioner is triggered to operate. The default is ten
      seconds. Increasing the delay allows the room to get warmer before
      triggering the air conditioner. This is sometimes useful for air
      conditioners that have an enforced minimum on-time due to internal
      control circuitry, so that they run for their minimum on-time
      without frost forming before they may be turned off.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The CoolBot™ unit shown in FIG. 4 also includes several
      wires or devices, which need to be connected to the
      air-conditioning unit. In particular, lead 425 is connected to a
      DC power source. While a conventional battery could be employed to
      power the electronic components in control unit 400, the demands
      of heating element 500 which is placed in thermal contact with
      thermocouple 209 means that it is significantly more preferred to
      connect unit 400 to a separate DC power supply. In preferred
      embodiments of the present invention, the DC power supply is from
      a converter, which is coupled into the alternating current power
      supply for the air-conditioning unit. It may also be powered
      separately. Also shown in FIG. 4 is lead 435 which is connected to
      frost sensor 400. Likewise, lead 430 is connected to heater 500.
      These items are considered in the discussion above with respect to
      FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] FIG. 6 illustrates a typical installation of the adapter
      described above in its natural environment. This drawing is not to
      scale, so that all of the features and aspects may better be
      presented. In particular, conventional but modified air
      conditioner 100 is disposed through a back wall of insulated
      structure 600. Air conditioner 100 is depicted as if it had its
      front cover removed. Adapter device 400 is shown connected to air
      conditioner 100 in three ways: (1) via DC electrical connection
      425; (2) via frost sensor 335 (not visible) connected via wire
      435; and (3) via heater 500 connected to temperature sensor 209
      via connection 450. FIG. 6 also illustrates the presence of
      alternating current power outlet 620 into which a power cord from
      air conditioner 100 is inserted (not shown for reasons of
      improving clarity of the view). Also shown in FIG. 6 is room
      temperature sensor 330 connected to unit 400 via connecting cable
      (wire) 430.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Attention is now directed to a description of specific
      control methods employed in the operation of the CoolBot™ device.
      For purposes of efficiency, it is desirable to turn the air
      conditioner unit on and off with as little lag time as possible,
      that is, with the shortest possible delay between when the
      algorithm says “A/C off” and when the A/C stops emitting cold air.
      Turn-on delay is primarily limited by how fast the sensor heater
      warms up; turn-off delay is limited by how fast it cools down. To
      be more precise, turn-on delay is the time it takes for the heater
      to go from its “turned off” temperature past the air conditioner's
      threshold temperature, and turn-off delay is the time it takes for
      the heater to go from its “steady state on” temperature past the
      air conditioner's threshold in the other direction. The turn-on
      delay is smallest when the “turned off” temperature is high (but
      below under the air conditioner's threshold temperature) and when
      the current put through the external heater 500 is largest. The
      turn-off delay is smallest when the “steady state on” temperature
      is low (but greater than the air conditioner threshold
      temperature) and when the room temperature is much cooler than
      that temperature. Accordingly, desirable performance levels are
      achieved if the current supplied to heater 500 is just sufficient
      to keep the temperature just above the air conditioner's threshold
      temperature while it's “on” and to supply slightly less current
      while it's “off.”<br>
      <br>
      [0053] One way to accomplish this control is through the use of a
      PID (position, integral, differential) control. This allows for
      precise control of the heater's temperature, but it also requires
      an additional sensor for feedback, which adds an expense, both for
      parts and for assembly. However, in certain cases where precise
      control over a long period of time is desirable for reasons of
      efficiency, this expense is tolerable.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The following items further describe a control algorithm
      and method for using the CoolBot™ device:<br>
      <br>
      When turning on the heater, keep it completely on (full current
      flow) for an initial length of time, approximately one minute;
      however, this value may be increased or decreased depending on the
      current room temperature.<br>
      Use a relatively low resistance for heater 500, so that it “sees”
      a relatively high current and gets hot fast.<br>
      After the initial turn-on period, use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
      to reduce the average current through the heater, and thus the
      heat dissipated. This stabilizes the heater temperature, rather
      than driving it as hot as it can possibly go. Thus, when the
      heater is turned on, its lower temperature results in faster
      turn-off<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In short, PID control is an option but there is a trade-off
      between cost and performance. Using PWM to reduce steady-state
      temperature makes for faster turn-off and customizing the PWM
      period (100% initially, decreasing later) makes for faster
      turn-on.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The use of PWM as a form of control is also relevant to a
      cooperative control method for supplying power to internal heater
      510 and external heater 500. Internal heater 510 is used to reduce
      condensation on the circuit board. Its use is also beneficial in
      that it contributes to the elimination of a manufacturing step in
      which a conformal coating is applied to the circuit board and its
      components to ameliorate problems associated with condensation
      and/or other environmental contaminants. However, it is noted
      that, if internal heater 510 runs constantly, peak current load
      goes over one ampere in the current design. A DC power supply
      capable of producing more than one ampere often costs
      significantly more than one designed for less than one ampere.
      Accordingly, control in the CoolBot™ device turns internal heater
      510 off whenever external heater 500 is on. Since only one heater
      is on at any given time, the peak load is not the combined load
      but the maximum. It's much easier to keep this under one ampere
      and to thus employ a less expensive power supply.<br>

      [0060] As indicated above, certain air conditioners do not employ
      a thermistor for temperature sensing purposes. Instead such
      vehicles typically employ the above mentioned capillary tube
      temperature probes. Such probes are not easily “fooled” by the use
      of a heater. Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention, the temperature control unit that is supplied
      with the air conditioner is replaced with a relay. For example,
      see relay 800 in FIG. 8 which is the same as FIG. 3 except for the
      replacement of heater 500 by relay 800. This is easily
      accomplished since such analog temperature control units are
      typically provided as plug-in assemblies. Thus, in this
      embodiment, the entire temperature control unit is replaced by a
      relay. This requires no modification of the above described
      CoolBot™ device other than removal of the heater and its
      replacement by a relay and a change in the firmware to provide a
      continuous signal to the relay as opposed to a pulsed signal which
      is preferably supplied in the embodiment using a heater. This
      really is a simple switch which is controlled by the same voltage
      level used to operate the heater. In this manner, the present
      invention is seen to be also applicable to use in recreational
      vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In a still further embodiment of the present invention
      rather than either using a heater, or replacing the heater with a
      relay, the CoolBot device operates to provide the same kind of
      information that is expected by the air conditioner. In
      particular, in certain circumstances the air conditioner is
      controlled by a thermistor which interprets variable electrical
      resistance as indicative of temperature. Thus, in a third
      embodiment of the present invention, the defeating means for
      overriding operation of a temperature sensor used to determine the
      lower limit for air conditioner operation comprises a single line
      which also supplies a variable resistance to mimic lower and
      higher temperatures. See variable resistance temperature signal
      generator 900 in FIG. 9 which is the same as FIG. 3 except for the
      replacement of heater 500 by variable resistance temperature
      signal generator 900. Thus it is seen that the defeating means may
      comprise either a heater, a relay, or variable-resistance
      temperature signal-generator.<br>

      [0062] The present invention is also useful in replacing
      refrigeration systems found in the trucking industry. In
      particular, for a large truck, such a refrigeration system is
      typically seen to cost approximately $14,000. However, as shown in
      FIG. 7, truck 700 is cooled using three conventional air
      conditioners (100a, 100b and 100c). These units replace
      conventional refrigeration unit 701 (shown in phantom form).
      Assuming that a conventional air conditioner costs approximately
      $500 and a CoolBot device costs approximately $300, one sees that
      one can provide the same level of cooling for a total of $2,400.
      The number of CoolBot devices employ it is selected based upon the
      vehicle volume that is to be cooled. This represents a savings per
      vehicle of over $10,000. However, given the size of the largest of
      the refrigerated trucks, particularly in terms of their height, it
      is seen that the advantages of the present invention are often
      best achieved when the devices are deployed within recessed areas
      of the truck ceilings. Such a recessed unit (100c) is shown in
      FIG. 7. For smaller vehicles, disposition in recessed areas is
      typically unnecessary and is typically employed only as called for
      by truck height limitations.<br>
