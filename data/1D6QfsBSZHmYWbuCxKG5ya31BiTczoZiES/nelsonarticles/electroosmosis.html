      Dear President Tomoaki Kobayakawa:<br>
      <br>
      The catastrophe at Fukushima Daiichi in March 2011 struck a mortal
      blow to our planet. The melted fuel rods ("corium") have burned
      down into a hellhole where they are lost.<br>
      <br>
      The potential exists for yet another disaster -- a huge steam
      explosion of groundwater that would vent to the atmosphere, and
      probably cause another earthquake. That would topple the
      precarious fuel rod storage pond, the rods would ignite, and...
      sayonara, suckers!<br>
      <br>
      The problems are aggravated by an underground river that runs
      through it along a Miocene fault line (only recently discovered),
      flowing over the lost corium, forever washing atoms of radioactive
      poison into the Pacific Sewer. That body now is effectively dead
      -- just ask any drunken fisherman or oceanographer.<br>
      <br>
      The Good News: The river is cooling the corium somewhat, thus
      averting hydrothermal explosion(s). <br>
      <br>
      The vaunted "ice wall" that was intended to reduce seepage of
      groundwater into the basement of the reactors has instead
      aggravated the problem -- the area has become a bog into which the
      buildings are sinking.<br>
      <br>
      Inquiring Minds might well ask, "Why not divert the water with
      umpteen wells into a canal/pipe before it reaches the area?"<br>
      <br>
      A Respiring Mind might answer, "Because then the corium will
      explode! It's a Catch-22 conundrum."<br>
      <br>
      Inquiring Minds might persist and wonder aloud, "What else can we
      do?"<br>
      <br>
      The short answer is, "Read this article."<br>
      <br>
      The corporatized minions of Tepco/Yakuza, General Electric, the
      Japanese government, and almost everyone else on earth have no
      answers to offer because they are either ignorant and dumbed down
      or over-educated beyond their capacity to think. They're also
      craven (job security), paralyzed with stupidity, and impotent.<br>
      <br>
      It is no secret, however, that there are several dozen methods to
      neutralize radioactive waste.&nbsp; The subject has been treated
      elsewhere in "Fukushima Mon Amour" by This Writer. That science is
      thoroughly suppressed because nuclear waste is used to produce
      plutonium for weapons.<br>
      <br>
      David Yurth &lt;innovator@davidgyurth.com&gt; explains the
      situation in this email ( 26 March 2018 ) [<a

      ]:<br>
      <blockquote>"...In 2005 our team was threatened with arrest under
        FISA as terrorists unless we stopped developing high level
        nuclear waste remediation technologies. In 2010, after W was
        elected and Chu became Sec’y of DOE, I was invited to make a
        closed-door classified presentation to all 26 department heads
        at DOE ... After a year’s preparation, the briefing was
        summarily cancelled by order of the Sec’y himself ...<br>
        <br>
        "When I was co-moderating the Fukushima Solutions conference
        with Dr. John Apsley at Univ Texas @ Austin in April 2014, we
        released HD satellite images that proved weapons grade plutonium
        pencils were being stored in the cooling pond beneath Daiichi
        #4. In spite of the fact that the Mainichi Shimbun published an
        official response issued by Japan’s Ministry of Nuclear Affairs,
        admitting that our conclusions were totally correct and
        verifying that 376 Kg of Pl-239 pencils were stored at Daiichi
        #4, the only thing that happened was that the nuke contractors
        built a tent over the top of the pond so no one else could take
        photographic images of what was going on down there..."<br>
      </blockquote>
      If This Writer was Emperor of Japan, he would invite the world to
      invade Fukushima and fix it with a Mega Reverse Manhattan Project.
      But nooo... If This Writer was God, it would cover Japan with lava
      and sink the place under the mantle in retribution for such
      damnable institutionalized insanity.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, there are two other technologies that could be used to
      stabilize the soil while the caskets of fuel rods are being
      removed from their extremely perilous situation in the elevated
      storage pond:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lithification</b><br>
      <br>
      The ground around the reactor buildings at Fukushima can be
      stabilized simply by consulting with Robert Sherwin at <a
        href="http://www.bionicsoilsolutions.com">Bionic Soil Solutions</a>
      (Santa Fe, NM). Mud can be transmuted to stone overnight with the
      proprietary formula.<br>
      <br>
      Bionic Soil Solutions is "... a non-toxic, proprietary liquid that
      exponentially accelerates the breakdown of oxygen, silicon, and
      aluminum found naturally in soil to turn it into stone... proven
      to be harder than concrete, water repellent, and nearly
      indestructible."<br>
      <br>
      Here are several related patents for lithification, retrieved from
      the glorious <a

      &nbsp; <br>
      <b>Electroosmosis</b><br>
      <br>
      This well-established technology should be applied to dewater the
      ground around and under the reactors before and after
      lithification.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Japanese patent JPS6452906 (Ground-Silicifying Solidification Work
      Using Electroosmosis Phenomenon) may provide an elegant solution
      combining electric dewatering with lithification:<br>
      <blockquote>"To improve the ground by solidification by a method
        in which sodium silicate solution is injected into a pipe on
        anode side while applying DC voltage between paired perforated
        injection tubes penetrated into the ground, the inside of the
        pipe is washed, and calcium chloride solution is injected...
        sodium silicate solution is injected into the tube 1 from its
        opening 10, the application of the voltage is temporarily
        stopped, and the inside of the tube 1 is washed. Calcium
        chloride solution is then injected into the tube 1 from its
        opening 10 while applying the voltage to the tube again; The
        solutions can thus be uniformly permeated into the ground for
        solidification by utilizing an electroosmosis phenomenon."<br>

      P.S. -- If/when your minions locate the missing corium, you can
      cool it to a manageable level with liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen
      will shock-cool the melt and form nitrides and nitrates, thus
      removing them somewhat from the thermonuclear reaction processes.
      It worked for the Russians at Chernobyl, and it can work again.
      Tragically, however, Tepco seems to have neglected to consult with
      them in this matter.<br>
      <br>
      Tepco has proven to be so utterly inept that it is imperatively
      advisable to consult with experienced professionals such as
      Halliburton, which acquired International Well Control. The latter
      uses liquid nitrogen to douse oilwell fires. The Russians also
      probably would be very glad to help remediate the scene of the
      crime at Fukushima.<br>
