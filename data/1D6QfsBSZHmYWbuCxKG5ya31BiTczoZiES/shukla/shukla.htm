      The drawer of the refrigerator – where most bags of salad,
      blueberries and raspberries go to die. I learned a nifty tip
      recently – putting cilantro in a cup of water makes it last ages.
      Kavita Shukla, a Harvard-graduate-turned-entrepreneur, came up
      with something much more clever.<br>
      <br>
      Sheets of paper infused with a top secret recipe of spices which
      you put in the drawer with the fruit and veggies. Dubbed ‘the
      dryer sheet for produce’ it extends their lifespan two or four
      times. Called FreshPaper, it’s a totally natural and organic way
      of keeping food fresh for longer, which is food for thought
      considering the average U.S. household of four throws out between
      $1,350 and $2,275 worth of groceries every year.<br>
      <br>
      Originally targeting farmers selling raspberries and other soft
      fruit, passersby overheard and wanted in. “It just sort of went
      viral,” says Shukla. Soon Whole Foods got wind of FreshPaper via a
      small write up in the local paper and wanted to schedule a
      meeting. As Shukla’s company, Fenugreen was only selling
      FreshPaper at a handful of co-ops and farmer’s markets around
      Boston at the time, she says “never would have thought of
      approaching them” at that stage.<br>
      <br>
      But Whole Foods loved the product and FreshPaper was in 70 stores
      within six months, scrambling to hand make the first few orders in
      Shukla’s kitchen. Within eight months FreshPaper was in all Whole
      Foods stores as well as shipping to 35 countries. The company’s
      seen 800% year on year growth since then and has recently scaled
      up production at its facility in DC.<br>
      <br>
      Fenugreen donates one pack of FreshPaper for every sold. “We sell
      FreshPaper to make it available to those who need it most, the 1.6
      billion people living without refrigeration in the developing
      world, as well as food banks and food pantries here at home that
      struggle to provide fresh, healthy food to the hungry,” says the
      company. <br>

      FreshPaper by Fenugreen is a simple piece of paper that keeps
      fruits &amp; veggies fresh for 2-4 times longer, organically.<br>
      <br>
      Often described as a "dryer sheet for produce," one small (5" x
      5") FreshPaper sheet can simply be dropped into a fridge drawer,
      fruit bowl, or any other container filled with produce.<br>
      <br>
      FreshPaper is infused with organic spices and has a distinctive
      maple-like scent that signals that the paper is active.<br>
      <br>
      Biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable, this award-winning
      innovation has received international recognition for its
      potential to change how the world keeps its food fresh.<br>
      <br>
      FreshPaper was created by a young inventor who happened upon the
      active ingredients after accidentally drinking some tap water
      while visiting her grandmother in India. Her grandma gave her a
      home remedy - a mixture of spices, which kept her from getting
      sick. <br>
      <br>
      After years of research and development, (starting with a middle
      school science project!), she discovered a new application of her
      grandmother's generations-old home remedy - a remarkably effective
      way to keep food fresh!<br>
      <br>
      Fenugreen was founded in 2010. It all started with handmade
      batches of FreshPaper handed out at the farmer's markets and
      street fairs in Cambridge, MA.<br>
      <br>
      Today, Fenugreen FreshPaper is used by farmers and families across
      the globe, and Fenugreen is establishing initiatives to benefit
      local food banks in the U.S. and small-scale farmers in the
      developing world. <br>

      substances. Specifically, the material is impregnated with an
      extract of Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum).<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a material that is coated
      with or soaked in a suspension of a botanical extract such that
      particles of said natural botanical extract are in contact with,
      embedded on, or embedded within the material. The present
      invention can be used to preserve perishable substances such as
      edible substances or foods by extending their freshness, shelf
      life or suitability for consumption by living organisms. Botanical
      extracts suitable for the present invention include botanical
      extracts that have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral or
      other preventative or curative properties. The botanical extract
      coated material described in the present invention is suitable for
      applications such as the packaging and preservation of perishable
      substances such as fruits and vegetables, meat products, dairy
      products, edible substances, non-edible substances and other
      perishable substances.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Perishable edible substances such as fruits and vegetables
      are subject to spoilage during growth and ripening, while they are
      being transported and when they are placed on the shelves at
      retail outlets such as grocery stores. Thus, from the farming
      process to the retail of many foods, significant losses are often
      incurred by the spoilage of significant proportions of a given
      sample of a food type. This can result in significant losses to
      farmers, distributors and retailers and even result in food
      shortages in regions or countries where food is scarce. Currently
      a number of chemicals, waxes and other synthetic products are used
      to spray, coat or cover perishable foods to prevent or delay the
      onset of spoilage. Washing fruits and vegetables with certain
      chemicals such as antibacterial chemicals or sulfur can slow down
      the spoilage process. Fruits and vegetables are also subject to
      infestation by insects and other natural predators and a number of
      chemicals and synthetic insecticides are currently used to
      preserve fruits and vegetables during the growing stages. For many
      other foods, preservatives are added to the food itself to prevent
      spoilage.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Yet, many of the currently used methods are not suitable
      for all types of foods such as fruits and vegetables and many of
      the currently used preservatives, insecticides and other
      preservation methods are not always effective in preventing
      spoilage for sufficient time periods. Furthermore, chemicals and
      toxins used for preservation can seep into foods such as fruits
      and vegetables and the chemicals and toxins can often not be
      sufficiently removed when such foods are prepared for consumption
      by living organisms. This presents toxicity concerns for
      consumers. The market for organic foods has grown significantly in
      recent years as consumers seek to obtain foods that are free of
      chemicals and other toxins. Therefore, there is a strong need for
      non-toxic, natural agents that are effective in preventing
      spoilage of edible foods and that hold anti-bacterial, anti-fungal
      and insecticidal properties. Perishable substances, as described
      in the present invention, also include non-edible perishable
      substances such as therapeutic botanical substances.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The botanical extract-coated material described in the
      present invention presents many advantages over currently
      available tools and methods for preserving perishable substances.
      In the present invention many different materials can be used in
      combination with a variety of botanical extracts from plants of
      different species. For example, paper or cardboard can be coated
      with an extract from the seeds of fenugreek (trigonella
      foenum-graecum). Fenugreek has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal
      properties and is effective in preventing the growth of pathogens.
      Thus, when foods, such as strawberries, are placed on wrapped in
      the fenugreek-coated paper, their freshness is preserved for a
      longer period of time since pathogens such as bacteria and fungi
      do not grow as easily on their surface. The foods can be placed in
      contact with the material containing the botanical extract in any
      configuration that is suitable for reducing the spoilage of such
      foods. Botanical extracts such as fenugreek can also have
      applications such as preventing the proliferation of pathogens in
      applications such as tissue culturing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The botanical extract coated material described in the
      present invention offers a number of advantages over currently
      available methods because it:<br>
      <br>
      [0007] presents low or no toxicity risks, depending on the type of
      botanical extract used;<br>
      <br>
      [0008] provides a safe, natural alternative for the preservation
      of perishable substances;<br>
      <br>
      [0009] can be easily prepared with botanical extracts such as
      fenugreek extracts;<br>
      <br>
      [0010] can be developed for different types of perishable food
      packaging and holding applications; and,<br>
      <br>
      [0011] can be developed for large-scale production.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Various features of novelty that characterize the present
      invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed
      to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better
      understanding of the invention, its advantages and objects,
      reference is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive
      matter in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is
      illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] The foregoing and still other objects of this invention
      will become apparent, along with various advantages and features
      of novelty residing in the present embodiments, from study of the
      following drawings, in which:<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a material (1), in
      this instance a sheet of paper used to wrap fruit, which is coated
      with particles of a botanical extract (2). The material (1) can
      consist of at least one type of material selected from the group
      comprised of, but not limited to, paper, cardboard, paper
      products, paper derivatives, shredded paper, pulp, wood, cotton,
      tree bark, leaves, grass, plant materials, synthetic paper,
      synthetic sheets, synthetic polymers, plastic, metal, natural wax,
      glass, ceramic, porcelain, synthetic wax, natural foam, synthetic
      foam and combinations thereof. While the material (1) is shown in
      a flat sheet configuration in FIG. 1, it is understood that the
      material (1) can be part of a form selected from the group
      comprised of a box, a container, a holding device, a bottle, a
      jar, a rectangular shape, a circular shape, a sheet shape, a
      spherical shape, a cylindrical shape, a cubical shape, a conical
      shape, a spheroid shape, an irregular shape, a wrapping material,
      a holding material, a padding material, a filling material and
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The botanical extract (2) can consist of any type of
      botanical extract, where a botanical extract is defined as a
      component derived from a part of a species that is a member of the
      plant kingdom. Thus, said botanical extract can be derived from a
      botanical source selected from the group comprised of plants,
      trees, saplings, seeds, seed coverings, barks, stems, leaves,
      flowers, roots, pollen, nuts, gall nuts, sap, tree sap, flower
      sap, flower nectar and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The botanical extract (2) can be obtained from a single
      botanical component, such as the fenugreek (trigonella foenum
      gracum) seed, or it can be obtained from a combination of
      different types of plants or plant species. Thus said botanical
      extract can be comprised of combinations of different types of
      botanical extracts from different types of plants. For example,
      said botanical extract can be selected from the group comprised of
      a fenugreek component selected from the group comprised of
      fenugreek seed, fenugreek seed extract, fenugreek leaf, fenugreek
      stem, fenugreek sapling, fenugreek plant, fenugreek root and
      combinations thereof. For example paper embedded with particles of
      fenugreek (trigonella foenum graecum) can be prepared by different
      methods as described below:<br>
      <br>
      [0019] coating or soaking the paper in an aqueous suspension of
      fenugreek seed powder whole fenugreek seeds or a combinations
      thereof;<br>
      <br>
      [0020] coating or soaking of the paper in an organic solvent
      suspension of fenugreek seed powder whole fenugreek seeds or
      combinations thereof;<br>
      <br>
      [0021] adding fenugreek seed powder to the paper during the
      manufacturing process; and<br>
      <br>
      [0022] adding fenugreek seed powder or an organic or aqueous
      extract of fenugreek powder or seeds to the paper pulp during the
      paper manufacturing process.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The botanical extract (2), as described in the present
      invention, holds properties that enhance the preservation of
      edible substances such as fruits and vegetables. Thus, said
      botanical extract has at least one property selected from the
      group comprised of anti-bacterial properties, anti-fungal
      properties, anti-viral properties, bacterial proliferation
      inhibition properties, viral proliferation inhibition properties,
      fungal proliferation inhibition properties, insect-repelling and
      insecticidal properties. While the term botanical extract is used
      in the present invention, it is understood that an extract means
      any derivative of a botanical product, where said derivative is
      selected from the group comprised of derivatives of purified
      botanical products, derivatives of unpurified botanical products,
      derivatives of processed botanical products, derivatives of
      unprocessed botanical products and combinations thereof. Also,
      said botanical extract (2) can be obtained by a means selected
      from the group comprised of aqueous solution extraction,
      non-aqueous solution extraction, organic solvent extraction,
      non-organic solvent extraction, pH variation based extraction,
      chromatography separation, crude extraction refined extraction and
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 2 shows an edible substance (3), in this instance a
      strawberry, which has been placed on a material with particles of
      a botanical extract embedded on. it. In the present invention the
      term perishable substances means any substances liable to decay or
      deterioration; and, the terms edible substance, perishable food
      and foods are used interchangeably to indicate any edible item
      that is suitable for ingestion, absorption or consumption by a
      living organism. Thus, said perishable substance (3) can be
      selected from the group comprised of, but not limited to, food,
      edible substances, non-edible substances, therapeutic substances,
      fruits, vegetables, grain products, meat products, eggs, dairy
      products, perishable products and combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The means of preserving the edible substance (3), as
      described in the present invention, can be any means selected from
      the group comprised of extending the freshness of said perishable
      substances; extending the shelf life of said perishable
      substances; preventing insect infestation of said perishable
      substances; ameliorating insect infestation of said perishable
      substances; preventing bacterial infection of said perishable
      substances; ameliorating bacterial infection of said perishable
      substances; preventing fungal infection of said perishable
      substances; ameliorating fungal infection of said perishable
      substances; preventing viral infection of said perishable
      substances; ameliorating viral infection of said perishable
      substances and combinations thereof. The broader usefulness of the
      invention may be illustrated by the following example.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preserving Fruit By the Use of Fenugreek Coated Paper</b><br>
      <br>
      [0026] A fenugreek extract was prepared by grinding 10 g of
      fenugreek seeds and soaking the resulting powder in 100 mL water.
      A soft sheet of paper was soaked in the resulting solution for 2
      hours and the sheet was then dried overnight. One strawberry was
      wrapped in the fenugreek treated paper and kept in an incubator at
      25[deg.] C. for 120 hours. A different strawberry was wrapped in
      soft paper soaked in distilled water and dried overnight. This
      sample was also placed in an incubator at 25[deg.] C. for 120
      hours. Observations every 12 hours showed that the strawberry
      wrapped in the water soaked paper showed significant signs of
      spoilage after 24 hours while the strawberry soaked in the
      fenugreek coated paper showed no signs of spoilage until after 120
      hours or a longer period of time. Signs of spoilage included
      growth of bacteria and fungi on the surface of the fruit and loss
      of natural, fresh color of the fruits.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] While a specific embodiment of the invention has been shown
      and described in detail to illustrate the application of the
      principles of the invention, it will be understood that the
      invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such
      principles and various modifications, alternate constructions, and
      equivalents will occur to those skilled in the art given the
      benefit of this disclosure. Thus, the invention is not limited to
      the specific embodiment described herein, but is defined by the
      appended claims.<br>
