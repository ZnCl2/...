      &nbsp;<br>
      Born March 24, 1897(1897-03-24)<br>
      Dobrzanica, Galicia<br>
      Died November 3, 1957 (aged 60)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wilhelm Reich</span> (March 24,
      1897 – November 3, 1957) was an Austrian-American psychiatrist and
      psychoanalyst, known as one of the most radical figures in the
      history of psychiatry.[1] He was the author of several notable
      textbooks, including <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mass
        Psychology of Fascism and Character Analysis</span>, both
      published in 1933.<br>
      <br>
      Reich worked with Sigmund Freud in the 1920s and was a respected
      analyst for much of his life, focusing on character structure
      rather than on individual neurotic symptoms.[2] He tried to
      reconcile Marxism and psychoanalysis, arguing that neurosis is
      rooted in the physical, sexual, economic, and social conditions of
      the patient, and promoted adolescent sexuality, open relationships
      outside marriage, the availability of contraceptives, abortion,
      and divorce, and the importance for women of economic
      independence. His work influenced a generation of intellectuals,
      including Saul Bellow, William Burroughs, Paul Edwards, Norman
      Mailer, and A. S. Neill, and shaped innovations such as Fritz
      Perls's Gestalt therapy, Alexander Lowen's bioenergetic analysis,
      and Arthur Janov's primal therapy.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Later in life, he became a controversial figure who was both
      adored and condemned. He began to violate some of the key taboos
      of psychoanalysis, using touch during sessions, and treating
      patients in their underwear to improve their "orgastic potency."
      He said he had discovered a primordial cosmic energy, which he
      said others called God, and which he called "orgone." He built
      "orgone energy accumulators" that his patients sat inside to
      harness the reputed health benefits, leading to newspaper stories
      about "sex boxes" that cured cancer.[4]<br>
      <br>
      Reich was living in Germany when Hitler came to power in January
      1933. On March 2, the Nazi newspaper Völkischer Beobachter
      published an attack on one of Reich's pamphlets, The Sexual
      Struggle of Youth.[5] He left immediately for Vienna, then
      Scandinavia, moving to the United States in 1939. In 1947,
      following a series of articles about orgone in The New Republic
      and Harper's,[6] the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained
      an injunction against the interstate sale of orgone accumulators.
      Charged with contempt for violating it, Reich conducted his own
      defense, which involved sending the judge all his books to read
      and arguing that a court was no place to decide matters of
      science. He was sentenced to two years in prison, and in August
      1956, several tons of his publications were burned by the FDA,[7]
      arguably one of the worst examples of censorship in U.S.
      history.[2] He died in jail of heart failure just over a year
      later, days before he was due to apply for parole.[8]...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vegetotherapy and the orgasm</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Reich's home in Drammensveien near Olaf Kyrres plass at Frogner,
      Oslo. A blue plaque reads: "The physician and psychoanalyst
      WILHELM REICH (1897-1957) lived and worked here 1935–39. Developed
      character analysis and the body-oriented therapy."<br>
      <br>
      Reich stayed in Norway for five years, working under the auspices
      of Professor Schjelderup of the Psychological Institute at the
      University of Oslo.<br>
      <br>
      He first presented the principles of his vegetotherapy in a paper
      called "Psychic contact and vegetative current" in August 1934 at
      the 13th International Congress of Psychoanalysis at Lucerne,
      Switzerland, and went on to develop the technique between 1935 and
      1940. Vegetotherapy involves the patient physically simulating the
      effects of certain emotions, in the hope of triggering them. Reich
      argued that the ability to feel sexual love depended on a physical
      ability to make love with what he called "orgastic potency." He
      tried to measure the male orgasm, noting that four distinct phases
      occurred physiologically: first, the psychosexual build-up or
      tension; second, the tumescence of the penis, with an accompanying
      charge, which Reich measured electrically; third, an electrical
      discharge at the moment of orgasm; and fourth, the relaxation of
      the penis. He believed the force that he measured was a distinct
      type of energy present in all life forms.[25]<br>
      <br>
      He was a prolific writer for psychoanalytic journals in Europe.
      Originally, psychoanalysis was focused on the treatment of
      neurotic symptoms. Reich's Character Analysis was a major step in
      the development of what today would be called ego psychology. In
      Reich's view, a person's entire character, not only individual
      symptoms, could be looked at and treated as a neurotic phenomenon.
      The book also introduced Reich's theory of body armoring. He
      argued that unreleased psychosexual energy could produce actual
      physical blocks within muscles and organs, and that these act as a
      "body armor" preventing the release of the energy. An orgasm was
      one way to break through the armor. These ideas developed into a
      general theory of the importance of a healthy sex life to overall
      well-being, a theory compatible with Freud's views.<br>
      <br>
      His idea was that the orgasm was not simply a device to aid
      recreation, but was the body's emotional energy regulator. The
      better the orgasm, the more energy was released, meaning that less
      was available to create neurotic states. Reich called the ability
      to release sufficient energy during orgasm "orgastic potency,"
      something that very few individuals could achieve, he argued,
      because of society's sexual oppression. A man or woman without
      orgastic potency was in a constant state of tension, developing a
      body armor to keep it in. The outer rigidity and inner anxiety is
      the state of neurosis, leading to hate, sadism, greed, and at a
      political level, fascism and antisemitism.[24]<br>
      <br>
      He agreed with Freud that sexual development was the origin of
      mental illness. They both believed that most psychological states
      were dictated by unconscious processes; that infant sexuality
      develops early but is repressed, and that this has important
      consequences for mental health. At that time a Marxist (see
      Freudo-Marxism), Reich argued that the source of sexual repression
      was bourgeois morality and the socio-economic structures that
      produced it. As sexual repression was the cause of the neuroses,
      the best cure would be to have an active, guilt-free sex life. He
      argued that such a liberation could come about only through a
      morality not imposed by a repressive economic structure.[26] In
      1928, he joined the Austrian Communist Party and founded the
      Socialist Association for Sexual Counseling and Research, which
      organized counseling centers for workers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The bion experiments</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      From 1934-39, Reich conducted experiments looking at vegetative
      energy in the body, especially the Galvanic skin response, which
      became research into the origins of life. These he called the
      "Bion Experiments."<br>
      <br>
      He examined protozoa, single-celled creatures with nuclei. He grew
      cultured vesicles using grass, sand, iron, and animal tissue,
      boiling them, and adding potassium and gelatin. Having heated the
      materials to incandescence with a heat-torch, he noted bright,
      glowing, blue vesicles, which, he said, could be cultured, and
      which gave off an observable radiant energy. He named the vesicles
      "bions" and believed they were a rudimentary form of life, halfway
      between life and non-life. When he poured the cooled mixture onto
      growth media, bacteria were born, he said, dismissing the idea
      that the bacteria were already present in the air or on other
      materials.[27]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">T-bacilli</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In 1936, Reich wrote that "[s]ince everything is antithetically
      arranged, there must be two different types of single-celled
      organisms: (a) life-destroying organisms or organisms that form
      through organic decay, (b) life-promoting organisms that form from
      inorganic material that comes to life."[28] This idea of
      spontaneous generation led him to believe he had found the cause
      of cancer. He called the life-destroying organisms "T-bacilli,"
      with the T standing for Tod, German for death. He described in The
      Cancer Biopathy how he had found them in a culture of rotting
      cancerous tissue obtained from a local hospital. He wrote that
      T-bacilli were formed from the disintegration of protein; they
      were 0.2 to 0.5 micrometer in length, shaped like lancets, and
      when injected into mice, they caused inflammation and cancer. He
      concluded that, when orgone energy diminishes in cells through
      aging or injury, the cells undergo "bionous degeneration," or
      death. At some point, the deadly T-bacilli start to form in the
      cells. Death from cancer, he believed, was caused by an
      overwhelming growth of the T-bacilli.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposition to his ideas</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Scientists in Oslo reacted strongly to his work on bions, deriding
      it as nonsense. Tidens Tegn, a leading liberal newspaper, launched
      a campaign against him in 1937, supported by scientists and other
      newspapers.[24] Between September 1937 and the fall of 1938, over
      100 articles denouncing him appeared in the main Oslo
      newspapers.[33]<br>
      <br>
      In 1937, Leiv Kreyberg, the country's top cancer specialist, was
      allowed to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under the
      microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his
      culture medium was indeed sterile, but that the bacteria were
      ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures
      to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof
      as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of
      basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused
      Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under
      magnification. Thus, Sharaf writes, an opportunity for scientific
      exchange degenerated into name-calling.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Reich sent a sample of the bacteria to another Norwegian
      biologist, Professor Thjötta of the Oslo Bacteriological
      Institute, who also said they resulted from air infection.
      Kreyberg and Thjötta had their views published in Aftenposten on
      April 19 and 21, 1938, Krayberg referring to him as "Mr. Reich,"
      alleging that Reich knew less about bacteria and anatomy than a
      first-year medical student. When Reich requested a detailed
      control study, Kreyberg responded that his work did not merit
      it.[27]<br>
      <br>
      Reich's The Bion Experiments on the Origin of Life was published
      in 1938, leading to attacks by the scientific and lay press that
      he was a "Jew pornographer," who was daring to meddle with the
      origins of life. Alan Cantwell writes that Reich's detractors
      focused on one paragraph in which Reich wrote that his research
      had "proved particularly fruitful for an understanding of cancer,"
      which led to the claim that he was promoting a quack cancer
      cure.[25]<br>
      <br>
      By February 1938, his visa had expired. Several Norwegian
      scientists argued against an extension, Kreyberg saying, "If it is
      a question of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then I will
      fight that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner,
      that would be the best." The writer Sigurd Hoel wondered when it
      had become a crime to perform amateurish biological experiments.
      "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a
      microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" Reich received
      influential support from overseas, first from Bronislaw
      Malinowski, who wrote to the Norwegian press in March 1938 that
      Reich's sociological work was a "distinct and valuable
      contribution to science," and from A.S. Neill, founder of
      Summerhill in England, a progressive school known throughout the
      world. Neill also wrote to the Norwegian press, arguing that "the
      campaign against Reich seems largely ignorant and uncivilized,
      more like fascism than democracy ..." Norway was proud of its
      intellectual tolerance, so the "Reich affair" put the government
      on the spot. A compromise was therefore found. Reich was given his
      visa, but a royal decree was issued stipulating that anyone
      wanting to practice psychoanalysis needed a licence, and it was
      widely understood that Reich would not be given one.[33]<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the affair, Reich had issued just one public statement,
      when he asked for a commission to replicate his bion experiments.
      Sharaf writes that the scientific opposition to his work affected
      his personality and relationships. He was angered and humiliated
      by the notoriety he had inadvertently achieved. His
      self-confidence undermined, he felt like a marked man, hunted and
      tormented, no longer comfortable in public, and seething with
      bitterness against the researchers who had denounced him.[34]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orgonomy</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Freud had argued that there was a sexual energy called libido,
      which he initially described as "something which is capable of
      increase, decrease, displacement and discharge, and which extends
      itself over the memory traces of an idea like an electric charge
      over the surface of the body," but by 1925 he had rejected the
      idea that it was a physical energy.[20] Reich took the idea
      further, arguing that he had discovered a primordial cosmic
      energy. He called it "orgone," and the study of it "orgonomy."<br>
      <br>
      Orgone is blue in color, he wrote, omnipresent, can be seen with
      the naked eye, and is responsible for such things as weather, the
      color of the sky, gravity, the formation of galaxies, and the
      biological expressions of emotion and sexuality. He argued that
      St. Elmo's Fire is a manifestation of it, as is the blue color of
      sexually excited frogs. Red corpuscles, plant chlorophyll, gonadal
      cells, protozoa, and cancer cells are all charged with orgone, he
      said.[24]<br>
      <br>
      He argued that humankind had previously split its knowledge of
      orgone in two: "ether" for its mechanistic, physical aspects, and
      God for the spiritual, the subjective.[45] He wrote that,
      "God-Father is the basic cosmic energy from which all being stems,
      and which streams through (the) body as through anything else in
      existence."[46]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orgone accumulators</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In 1940, he built boxes called "orgone accumulators" to
      concentrate atmospheric orgone. Some of the boxes were for lab
      animals, and some were large enough for a human being to sit
      inside. Composed of alternating layers of ferrous metals and
      organic insulators with a high dielectric constant, the
      accumulators had the appearance of a large, hollow capacitor.
      Based on experiments with them, he argued that orgone energy was a
      negatively-entropic force in nature responsible for concentrating
      and organizing matter. The construction of the boxes caught the
      attention of the press, leading to wild rumors that they were "sex
      boxes" that caused uncontrollable erections.[25]<br>
      <br>
      According to Reich's theory, illness was primarily caused by
      depletion or blockages of the orgone energy within the body. He
      conducted clinical tests of the orgone accumulator on people
      suffering from a variety of illnesses. The patient would sit
      within the accumulator and absorb the "concentrated orgone
      energy." He built smaller, more portable accumulator-blankets of
      the same layered construction for application to parts of the
      body. The effects observed were said to boost the immune system,
      even to the point of destroying certain types of tumors, though
      Reich was hesitant to claim this constituted a cure. The orgone
      accumulator was also tested on mice with cancer, and on
      plant-growth, the results convincing Reich that the benefits of
      orgone therapy could not be attributed to a placebo
      effect.[citation needed] He had, he believed, developed a grand
      unified theory of physical and mental health, a claim regarded by
      the psychoanalytic community as quackery.[47]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experiment XX</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In December 1944, Reich began the 20th (Roman numeral XX) in his
      series of bion experiments.[48] He filtered all the earth out of
      an earth bion preparation so that all that remained was clear
      yellow water, then buried the test tube outdoors in the frozen
      ground. When he retrieved it three weeks later and examined it
      under a microscope, he saw pulsating plasmatic flakes. Since the
      yellow water had not contained visible particulates before it had
      been frozen, Reich concluded that free orgone energy had condensed
      out to form the lifelike flakes. This experiment formed the basis
      for Reich's later theory that all matter in the universe had
      derived from orgone energy via cosmic superimposition.[49]<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cloudbusters</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Reich with one of his cloudbusters, which he said could manipulate
      streams of orgone to produce rain.<br>
      <br>
      Reich posited a conjugate, life-annulling energy in opposition to
      orgone, which he dubbed Deadly Orgone or DOR. He wrote that
      accumulations of DOR played a role in desertification, and he
      designed a "cloudbuster" with which he said he could manipulate
      streams of orgone energy in the atmosphere to induce rain by
      forcing clouds to form and disperse. It was a set of hollow metal
      pipes and cables inserted into water, which Reich argued created a
      stronger orgone energy field than was in the atmosphere, the water
      drawing the atmospheric orgone through the pipes.[20]<br>
      <br>
      Reich conducted dozens of experiments with the
      cloudbuster[citation needed], calling the research "Cosmic Orgone
      Engineering." In 1953, a drought threatened Maine's blueberry
      crop, and several farmers offered to pay Reich if he could make it
      rain. The weather bureau had reportedly forecast no rain for
      several days when Reich began the experiment on at 10 a.m. on July
      6, 1953. The Bangor Daily News reported on July 24:<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Reich and three assistants set up their "rain-making" device
      off the shore of Grand Lake, near the Bangor hydro-electric dam
      ... The device, a set of hollow tubes, suspended over a small
      cylinder, connected by a cable, conducted a "drawing" operation
      for about an hour and ten minutes ...<br>
      <br>
      According to a reliable source in Ellsworth the following
      climactic changes took place in that city on the night of July 6
      and the early morning of July 7: "Rain began to fall shortly after
      ten o'clock Monday evening, first as a drizzle and then by
      midnight as a gentle, steady rain. Rain continued throughout the
      night, and a rainfall of 0.24 inches was recorded in Ellsworth the
      following morning."<br>
      <br>
      A puzzled witness to the "rain-making" process said: "The queerest
      looking clouds you ever saw began to form soon after they got the
      thing rolling." And later the same witness said the scientists
      were able to change the course of the wind by manipulation of the
      device.[50]<br>

      The blueberry crop survived, the farmers declared themselves
      satisfied, and Reich received his fee.[20]<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orgone experiment with Einstein</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Reich discussed orgone accumulators with Albert Einstein in 1941.<br>
      <br>
      On December 30, 1940, Reich wrote to Albert Einstein saying he had
      a scientific discovery he wanted to discuss, and on January 13,
      1941 went to visit Einstein in Princeton. They talked for five
      hours, and Einstein agreed to test an orgone accumulator, which
      Reich had constructed out of a Faraday cage made of galvanized
      steel and insulated by wood and paper on the outside.[51] Einstein
      agreed that if, as Reich suggested, an object's temperature could
      be raised without an apparent heating source, it would be a
      "bombshell" in physics.[52]<br>
      <br>
      Reich supplied Einstein with a small accumulator during their
      second meeting, and Einstein performed the experiment in his
      basement, which involved taking the temperature atop, inside, and
      near the device. He also stripped the device down to its Faraday
      cage to compare temperatures. In his attempt to replicate Reich's
      findings, Einstein observed a rise in temperature,[53] which Reich
      argued was caused by the orgone energy that had accumulated inside
      the Faraday cage.[54] However, one of Einstein's assistants
      pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on
      the ceiling.[55] Following that remark, Einstein modified the
      experiment and, as a result, concluded that the effect was simply
      due to the temperature gradient inside the room.[56] He wrote back
      to Reich, describing his experiments and expressing the hope that
      Reich would develop a more skeptical approach.[57]<br>
      <br>
      Reich responded with a 25-page letter to Einstein, expressing
      concern that "convection from the ceiling" would join "air germs"
      and "Brownian movement" to explain away new findings.[54] The
      correspondence between Reich and Einstein was published by Reich's
      press as The Einstein Affair in 1953, possibly without Einstein's
      permission....[58]<br>

      his further comments one easily concludes that she died three days

      attempt, with ingestion of Lysol (the afore mentioned household
      cleaner) had ocurred in January 1910, the same evening Leon Reich
      came to know about the adultery (Reich, idem, p. 31).<br>

      In the 1930's and 1940's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich was able to detect and
      measure the existence of etheric energy (life energy, chi, etc.),
      which he called orgone, using a modified geiger counter.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Reich determined that stacking alternating layers of
      fiberglass (an organic substance) and steel wool (an inorganic
      substance) would actually attract and collect orgone/etheric
      energy of both the life-beneficial positive form (which Reich
      called "OR" or "POR") and harmful negative etheric energy ("deadly
      orgone" or "DOR").<br>
      <br>
      Orgone Accumulator Diagram He constructed large boxes called
      orgone accumulators or "oracs" using this simple layering
      principle and was able to successfully heal his patients of
      various ailments, including various forms of cancer, by having
      them sit inside the box for periods of time.<br>
      <br>
      In 1986, scientists at the University of Marburg, Germany
      published the results of a blind study1 which showed that
      30-minute orgone accumulator treatments caused consistent,
      positive psycho-physiological effects not seen with the
      all-fiberglass box used for a control, stating "the results
      received in our investigation furnish evidence for the assumption
      that the physical properties of the orgone accumulator and its
      psychophysiological efficacy on human organisms, postulated by
      Reich and his associates, factually exist."<br>
      <br>
      Reich's work was continued in earnest in the 1960's by more
      open-minded Russian scientists such as Dr. Nikolai Kozyrev
      (1908-1983), who also scientifically proved that such unseen
      energies indeed exist all around us, and who's Reich-inspired work
      led to the unfortunate development of practical Soviet military
      defense applications which utilized principles of so-called
      "torsion fields" (e.g., etheric energy). Kozyrev's work, which
      indeed confirms both Reich's research and our empirical
      experiences with orgonite, was classified until the fall of the
      Soviet Union in 1991.<br>
      <br>
      Following in their footsteps, thousands of Ph.D.-level researchers
      from both sides of the Iron Curtain spanning multiple generations
      have continued Kozyrev and Reich's pioneering work, slowly forcing
      mainstream Western science to finally, "officially recognize" the
      concept of a universal, unseen energy medium they call "dark
      matter," "vacuum flux" or "zero-point energy," depending on who
      you ask. It is commonly understood among orgonite enthusiasts that
      these are all essentially describing the same thing, which Reich
      called "orgone".<br>

      directly to the earliest rain engineering pioneering of Dr.
      Wilhelm Reich. All current ERE technology is descended from Dr.
      Reich's pioneering. <br>
      <br>
      Cloudbuster operator here is the late biologist, Robert
      McCullough. He was Dr. Reich's personal assistant in weather
      engineering, and a longtime friend and technical associate of
      Trevor J Constable. This cloudbuster, Magnum 144, used a
      spiral-wound, 12 feet long 12 inch diameter single tube, and was
      water-powered. Scene is the Banning Bench, adjacent to the Mojave
      Desert in Southern California.<br>

      Rotating geometric components and correct orientation of the
      assembly, were the key operating principles of the "Flying H"
      weather engineering unit seen here in 1986. Art is to ENTRAIN the
      etheric flows via the "H" device, for regional weather
      engineering. This unit, with four other bases in July 1986,
      produced the wettest Los Angeles July in 100 years. Government fax
      maps and satellite picturesshowed anomalous diversion of moisture
      from the Gulf of California, over 200 miles to the northwest into
      Los Angeles, which is statistically rainless in July. TJC
      pre-filed the operation with NOAA in Rockville, Maryland, with an
      engineering drawing showing what was intended. It happened.<br>

      <br>
      Over a developmental period exceeding 30 years, etheric rain
      engineering has been utilized in numerous successful operations.
      Beginning with ponderous, fixed-base operations employing arrays
      of up to 150 water-grounded tubes, this art and science has
      continuously evolved. Advances have been both technical and
      theoretical. By the year 2002, the huge, static, water-grounded
      arrays have been replaced by a single, hollow tube of sensitive
      construction. These tubes are carried aboard helicopters or light
      aircraft, and do not employ chemicals, electric power, or
      electromagnetic radiation in any form. From inception until today,
      action has depended on tapping the latent, native power of the
      etheric continuum.<br>
      <br>
      Effective airborne etheric translators were designed in 1994,
      initiating a revolutionary advance in etheric rain engineering.
      "Bull" translators are under four feet long, with small
      cross-section and light weight. Skilled pilots reported no change
      in flight characteristics from wing strut installations, but the
      ability of these powerful translators to evoke violent weather
      very rapidly in tropical locales, necessitated in-flight
      deactivation of the translators. Safety required no less. Modified
      devices were moved INSIDE the aircraft cabin, and a simple
      procedure permitted in-flight deactivation.<br>
      Airborne tests in Hawaii and Malaysia, proved that mobile rain
      engineering techniques developed in 14 years of high seas rain
      engineering experiments are far more effective in the airborne
      mode. The higher velocity of aircraft, the longer horizon from the
      air, and infinite heading control, produced visible weather
      reactions and rainfall with unprecedented rapidity. Targeting of
      the rainfall drop area also became feasible. 1998 Malaysian
      experience confirmed this.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">NO CHEMICALS, ELECTRIC POWER
        OR&nbsp; ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION IN ANY FORM ARE UTILIZED.
        THESE NATURAL TECHNIQUES ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY PURE.</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Etheric rain engineering now has a powerful new dimension. Vast
      droughted territories in equatoria may now be accessed by aircraft
      equipped for etheric rain engineering. Existing clouds are not
      required. These techniques generate their own clouds, from zero if
      need be. New technical resources exist to deal with tropical
      droughts in the here-now, together with the unique operating
      acumen and experience to apply these resources effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout 1997-98, practical research continued with etheric rain
      engineering in the airborne mode. Successful airborne tests in
      Malaysia in October of 1997 proved that techniques pioneered in
      Hawaii were even more effective in equatoria. Rapid engineering of
      rainy weather, sometimes violent, made in-flight deactivation of
      the quarter-wave Bull units absolutely essential. These
      translators were originally designed for attachment to wing
      struts. Successful test flights in Malaysia and Hawaii proved the
      feasibility of moving the translators INSIDE a light aircraft, the
      etheric P-Gun functioned flawlessly, as though no aircraft were
      present. A rain engineering pilot flying solo can now deactivate
      the P-Gun in the event of heavy weather, enhancing safety.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;">.....<img src="pgun2.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      A helicopter fitted with a P-Gun is the ultimate rain engineering
      modality, as proven in Malaysia in April and May of 1998. Nothing
      in the history of etheric rain engineering development can compare
      with a helicopter for RESULTS. A helicopter permits infinite
      adjustment of speed from the hover to more than 100 knots.
      Experience has proved that the greatest effects in etheric rain
      engineering usually develop at around 50-60 knots. Helicopters are
      also unmatched observation platfroms. Their ability to set down
      almost anywhere is ideal protection against violent weather.
      Combined operation of a helicopter and a light aircraft, both
      equipped with P-Guns, allows thousands of droughted equatorial
      acres to be readily accessed and rained, almost like crop-dusting
      with water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION PINCER II</span>, July
      1986. An engineering drawing was filed in advance of this project
      with the U.S. Federal authorities (NOAA), detailing the procedure
      that would engineer rain into Los Angeles in July 1986. Los
      Angeles is 'STATISTICALLY RAINLESS' in July. Etheric rain
      engineering was being pitted against a century of weather records.
      PINCER II demonstrated the anomalous diversion - 240 miles out of
      its normal path into Arizona - of rain that made July 86 the
      wettest July in 100 years. The attendant, anomalous thunder and
      lightning storm left 300,000 Los Angeles residents without
      electric power. Entire operation was documented by US government
      radar fax maps and storm video.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION CLINCHER</span> - Smog
      Dispersal, May-November 1990. Federally-filed in advance with
      NOAA, Clincher had as its announced target, a twenty percent
      SEASONAL REDUCTION of smog. This was to be across-the-board, for
      the huge four-county Air Quality Management District, the largest,
      filthiest smog region in America. This six month operation
      utilized 14 etheric vortex generators that had been technically
      developed aboard SS “Maui”. No chemicals, no electromagnetic
      radiation. Smog took the worst knock, in every category, since
      smog began. Reductions of over 60 percent in some of the worst
      areas. Zero smog in several. Overall seasonal smog reduction: 24
      PERCENT. Comprehensively documented with AQMD statistical
      releases.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION TANGO</span>,
      Singapore, July 1988. Dry season rain engineering. TANGO, like
      CLINCHER against Los Angeles smog, was sponsored and financed by a
      young Singapore entrepreneur, Mr. George K.C.Wuu - now the&nbsp;
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Etheric Rain Engineering
      Pte. Ltd. TANGO utilized a 46-foot Hatteras cabin cruiser
      offshore, coordinated with an Apache etheric vortex generator at
      Loyang, on Singapore Island. TANGO raised 30,000 square kilometers
      of rain over Singapore, Malaysia and northern Indonesia. TANGO was
      documented with Singapore government radar maps and mobile video.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to TANGO during this Singapore visit, Mr. Wuu and Mr.
      Constable carried out operational experiments with a speedboat and
      a rotating “Termite” device. These operations were extremely
      enlightening as to the special etheric properties of tropical
      weather.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION PIONEER</span> -
      Melaka, Malaysia, 1991 Dry Season. Fixed base operations, with
      ancillary gun car operations on regional roads. PIONEER brought in
      38 measurable rains in 57 dry season days, for a total of 327 mm.
      This is 75 percent of an entire year's normal Melaka rainfall.
      Melaka is the driest state in mainland Malaysia. Government radar
      nevertheless documents unerringly that Melaka was FREQUENTLY THE
      ONLY STATE IN MALAYSIA GETTING RAIN during the entire period of
      PIONEER.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION RED BARON</span>,
      Hawaii, 1994-96. - This was the initiating, pioneer series of
      airborne etheric rain engineering operations. Rain was
      successfully engineered from the air, using specially-designed
      “Bull” translators, right from the first flight made for this
      purpose. Conclusively established the power and efficiency of
      airborne rain engineering, as superior to any previous modality.
      Methods developed in 14 years of maritime mobile work aboard the
      SS “Maui” proved much more effective from an aircraft. Documented
      by video and via third party media reports. Incorporated in
      special demonstration video for government ministers and senior
      officials. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION SEGAMAT</span>,
      Malaysia, October 1997. AEREO -Airborne Etheric Rain Engineering
      Operations - proves effective in a series of exploratory
      operations in rural Malaysia. These rain flights exploited the
      advantages of isolated airstrips without traffic control. The
      program culminated in Segamat, in central Malaysia, where a
      lengthy dry spell had droughted the region. The Segamat Country
      Club had its own airstrip. On 14 October 1997, two short,
      successive rain engineering flights were scheduled, right off the
      runway directly to the east. Each flight was to be for no more
      than 20 minutes at minimum safe speed. The second flight had to be
      curtailed to 9 minutes because of imminent heavy weather. Eight
      hours of rain into droughted Segamat ensued, which extended some
      60 km to the north and west. Documented with radar fax maps, video
      and photography. (See the 16-exposure photo recording of this
      operation at the head of this section)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">OPERATION K.L</span>., Malaysia,
      April 1998. The Kuala Lumpur region was in a four and a half
      months period of drought. Water rationing was in force. 28 hours
      after Mr. Constable set foot in Malaysia and made an immediate
      AEREO flight, the region was deluged. In the subsequent week, a
      helicopter was used for the first time in AEREO. Slower,
      controlled flights in the 40-60mph speed range, proved
      super-effective. Coordination of fixed-wing and helo AEREO flights
      successfully pioneered,. revealing a rich potential. Nocturnal
      rains were also engineered into Kuala Lumpur by means of a
      fixed-base P-gun installation on the hotel roof. These rains were
      accompanied by massive thunder and lightning, on the scale of a
      bombing attack. Entrenched drought in Kuala Lumpur was countered
      by natural means, without chemicals or radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">People's Republic of China</span>.
      September 1999. Sponsored by a HongKong charitable foundation.
      Supervised by Mr. Chen Feng, President and CEO of Hainan Airlines,
      this was a demonstration operation. A single, 20 minute helicopter
      flight to the east, equipped with a single P-gun, produces rain
      over Hainan Island, contra-forecast and as promised, within 12
      hours. Extensive rain resulted in the cancellation of the second
      demonstration flight, scheduled for the following day. It was
      still raining from the first pass. This was the first airborne
      etheric rain engineering operation ever conducted in the People's
      Republic of China. Documented and presented in a brochure by PRC
      meteorologists and Hainan Airlines technicians.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Problem of Operator Character
        Structure</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      ...Cloudbusting requires more of the people who engage in it than
      the mere "desire" to "get involved", or to "make rain", or the
      mere mechanical ability to assemble a few pipes and wave them
      about in the air. For safe and effective operations to occur, the
      operator must firstly have a high degree of personal health, and
      secondly to know exactly what they are doing, and why. They must
      have a good working knowledge of the cloudbusting techniques and
      methods which have been worked out over the last 35 years. They
      must be educated in basic climatology and atmospheric dynamics.
      Additionally, and most importantly, the cloudbuster operator must
      not possess any significant degree of biophysical, emotional
      armoring. They must be emotionally fluid, with a capacity for full
      bioenergetic contact with the natural environment. They must
      possess the capability of perceptively understanding the unspoken
      language of the living, which is energetically expressed in the
      atmosphere and landscape.<br>
      <br>
      It must always be kept in mind that the cloudbuster is a tool by
      which the atmosphere is restored to a state of self-regulated
      functioning. It is not a "weather modification" apparatus, like
      cloudseeding, where the atmosphere is forced to do this or that,
      or is "pushed about" to do something it normally would not do.
      Anyone wishing to work with a cloudbuster must therefore have an
      intuitive, gut-level grasp of the concept of atmospheric
      self-regulation. For this, they must be self-regulated people,
      free from significant biophysical emotional armoring. They must,
      as much as is possible, be what Reich called unarmored, genital
      characters, that is, individuals who have maintained, or regained
      through therapy, the capacity for making full contact with their
      deeper emotions, and who are orgastically potent as defined by
      Reich. They must not be openly or secretly cruel, sadistic, or
      domineering towards the opposite sex, nor be timid or fearful.
      This question of how the individual relates to the opposite sex
      is, aside from other characterological considerations, a give-away
      as to their deeper emotional self, and a clear predictor of the
      attitude and behavior towards the natural environment...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Negative Biophysical Effects on
        Cloudbuster Operators</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      There are other reasons to insist upon good training and therapy
      for cloudbuster operators. The biophysical effects of the
      cloudbuster upon the operator's own organism can potentially be
      mildly sickening (headaches, nausea, sinusitus, etc.) or even
      life-threatening. This real danger has often been dismissed by
      various armored persons who were incapable of feeling the movement
      of the life energy within their own body, and who could not feel
      or see it move in the atmosphere. As a result, many people have
      been made sick. However, accidents can also occur even when the
      cloudbuster operator is skilled, and precautions are taken. For
      the reasons given here, cloudbuster operators must learn about the
      mechanisms governing atmospheric charge, and also techniques for
      dissipating an overcharge within their own organism, and for
      protecting themselves. For example:<br>
      <br>
      1) Several of Reich's assistants were immobilized and greatly
      sickened by the field effects surrounding his laboratory during
      the oranur experiment. Later on, similar reactions occurred in the
      surroundings of operating cloudbusters, particularly during desert
      and drought operations.<br>
      <br>
      2) A man using a cloudbuster in a California desert touched the
      pipes with his bare hands. He was paralyzed on one side of his
      body, and never completely recovered.<br>
      <br>
      3) A cloudbuster operator developed a walnut-sized tumor one day
      after handling a cloudbuster during a drought. The tumor was
      eventually eliminated through orgonomic first-aid, involving
      therapy, use of the accumulator, dor-buster, and detoxification
      techniques.<br>
      <br>
      4) A medical doctor in Germany used a medical dor-buster on his
      patients for many years. The apparatus resembles a minature
      cloudbuster, and functions similarly. He developed a paralysis in
      the arm he used to work the apparatus, which later spread to his
      shoulder and the side of his face, after which he died.<br>
      <br>
      5) A man who used a manually operated cloudbuster for many years
      in droughty situations became quite ill, in spite of many
      precautions. He eventually developed scleroderma and cancer, which
      killed him.<br>
      <br>
      6) A man with a history of high blood pressure and a stroke had
      another debilitating stroke a few days after working as an
      informal helper on a cloudbuster operation, where his exposure was
      limited to no more than 15 minutes per day over three days. All
      the usual precautions had been taken.<br>
      <br>
      7) Other cloudbuster operators have been made very ill from
      standing too close to the instrument. The biological effects of
      overcharge, and of what Reich called dor-sickness, have included
      high fever, muscle cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. Severe skin
      rashes, hives, and "flu" symptoms have also been observed. Reich
      noted, the effects of the toxic field around the cloudbuster tends
      to hit a person at their weakest spot, causing old health problems
      to flare-up.<br>

      Definition of a contrail:&nbsp; A contrail occurs when a plane
      travels at a high altitude (about 30,000 ft. or more) and
      compresses the air into a water vapor or ice crystals through jet
      engines or the wing tips pushing through the air. This trail
      disappears after anywhere from a few seconds to 15 minutes, as the
      water vapor evaporates.<br>
      <br>
      Definition of a chemtrail: The term "chemtrail" is a relatively
      new word, which appeared in the last few years along with the
      appearance of chemtrails.&nbsp;&nbsp; A chemtrail is very
      different from a contrail. At first a chemtrail might look a bit
      like a contrail. However, instead of disappearing like a contrail
      does, a chemtrail just keeps spreading out and forming a hazy
      cloud bank. These trails traverse the whole sky and stay for up to
      around five or even eight hours. They have been known to turn what
      was originally a clear blue sky into a grey haze. (Note: As of Nov
      2001 there are already several dozen cloudbusters in seven
      countries, so if you see chemtrails that don't last anywhere near
      this long, there may already be a cloudbuster in the area).<br>
      <br>
      It is believed chemtrails are composed at least in part by an oil
      based substance of unknown content that is actually being sprayed
      from jets on populated areas. It has also been found that some
      chemtrails contain red blood cells, aluminum, mycoplasma, viruses
      and other unknown biological components. There are many reports of
      increased diseases, especially respiratory ailments, in areas
      where there are chemtrails.<br>
      <br>
      Chemtrails are often seen to be sprayed by white planes with no
      markings. Sometimes you will see these planes give off no contrail
      at all, and immediately after the same kind of plane in the same
      area will start to leave a thick chemtrail. At other times,
      distinct short gaps in chemtrails have been photographed, as
      though the plane ran out of chemicals and then had to start
      spraying with a new supply.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">History of the Cloudbuster</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The Wilhelm Reich cloudbuster (CB) was well known for its ability
      to create rain. But a problem existed with its continued use, in
      that the deadly orgone energy that it absorbed could in fact hurt
      the operator if it was not correctly "drained off". This "draining
      off" of deadly orgone energy was accomplished by 1. Connecting the
      cloudbuster to a body of running water (difficult) or 2.
      Connecting the cloudbuster output to an orgone accumulator.
      However, the orgone accumulator would soon become saturated with
      the deadly orgone energy which in turn caused more problems for
      the operator. So the cloudbuster, as good a technology as it is,
      has lain dormant for many years.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Cloudbuster Re-Invented</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      By utilizing the research of Wilhelm Reich, we have created a
      cheap, portable and easy to build device that consistently
      destroys Chemtrails and heals the atmosphere. The&nbsp;
      “chembuster” is the answer to these ongoing attacks. Unlike the
      original cloudbuster, the CB changes the deadly orgone energy to
      good orgone energy and does NOT become saturated or dangerous to
      the operator.&nbsp; You can build one for about $150.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      A properly constructed CB unit should be able to greatly reduce
      the effects of chemtrails for about 45 miles in all directions (90
      mile diameter) from the unit.&nbsp; If used with Slim Spurling’s
      environmental tools, and a few extra crystals, the diameter can be
      increased to about 120 miles in all directions.<br>
      <br>
      With this device a mere few hundred concerned citizens can SHUT
      DOWN the multi-billion dollar chemtrail program. The chembuster
      cannot do any damage. It can only help and heal. Its up to you to
      join the fight to save America.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chembuster Construction Details</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      BUCKET: Base: 9" in dia., 9" deep. I use two-gallon plastic
      buckets from the Home Depot paint department, but two-gallon food
      buckets, available from restaurants, or two-gallon spackle buckets
      from drywall contractors are fine.&nbsp; Leave the buckets on, as
      the handles make it easier to move the finished cloudbuster.<br>
      <br>
      COPPER PIPES: Six standard Type M, 1" copper pipes, 6' long, open
      at one end, the capped ends submerged to within an inch or so of
      the bottom of the bucket before casting. For portability and
      shipping, you can use 12” sections of pipe in the base, adding
      five-foot lengths by putting couplers between the 12” and
      five-foot pieces. You won’t need&nbsp; to buy as much copper pipe
      this way, too.<br>
      <br>
      CRYSTALS: I glued a double-terminated (two pointed ends) quartz
      crystal, about 2" long, into a .75” section of garden hose, (or
      use electrical tape) then, glue to the inside of each of the six
      copper end caps, pointing in the same direction as the pipe will
      be after the cap is glued on. I use 'Goop' glue. Tape, or solder
      around the cap where it joins the pipe to prevent resin from
      leaking into the cap during casting.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note) Another
      option is to add one citrine gemstone to each pipe before adding
      the crystal, this smoothes the CB’s energy and helps to transmute
      negative energies.&nbsp; However, citrine does not seem to make
      the CB any more effective at eliminating chemtrails.<br>
      <br>
      METAL PARTICLES: Get some metal particles from a machine shop,
      recycling yard or a place where they saw a lot of aluminum (sign
      shops and aluminum fabrication shops are good places to look). I
      use aluminum for weight considerations, but ANY metal will do.
      Very fine particles (such as filings from a key-making machine)
      aren’t quite as good as ones that will easily go through a ½”
      screen are okay. There really is a wide margin of suitability! .<br>
      <br>
      PLYWOOD: Template 1 - 3/4” exterior plywood is used to make the
      base for the copper endcaps/pipes. I arrange the six pipes evenly
      around a 2 1/2” radius circle, which makes the pipes 2 1/2” apart
      on centers. A flat, 1 1/4” auger bit drills a suitable hole for
      each end cap.<br>
      <br>
      Template 2 - Make another piece to fit inside the rim of the
      bucket.&nbsp; Remember to cut a section away so you can fit your
      fingers under it to remove it from the bucket. This piece is not
      part of the finished CB, just used to get the spacing for the
      pipes right during construction. Cut the holes in this with a 1
      1/8” flat bit so that it will fit well over the six pipes. This
      piece will hold the pipes in position while the second batch of
      resin hardens.<br>
      <br>
      Template 3 - I make a circular plywood spacer for the top ends of
      the pipes, 4” radius with 1 1/8” holes on the same 2 1/2” radius
      circles for the pipe ends. This keeps the pipes parallel with each
      other and fairly rigid.<br>
      <br>
      Widest circle is 9 1/8”<br>
      <br>
      RESIN: I use polyester resin (used to build fiberglass boats) but
      epoxy also works, as does envirotech resin from www.eti-usa.com
      (this sets up very quickly, so you need to be proficient with it).
      (If you are going to construct many of these units, try to
      purchase your resin in 5 gallon buckets over the internet,
      possibly from a surfboard or boat manufacturing supply company.
      Home depot gets $24 per gallon for resin )<br>
      <br>
      On a level surface, pour an inch or so of catalyzed resin into the
      bottom of the bucket and stir in metal particles until the surface
      is uniform and flat.&nbsp;&nbsp; CAUTION:&nbsp; Resin fumes are
      flammable; use in a warm, but well ventilated area.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio that seems to work is approx. one part resin to one part
      metal particles.<br>
      Put the base Template 1 onto that before it hardens, so that it
      just touches the surface and doesn't sink in much. Pour a half
      gallon of catalyzed resin into the bucket after the six pipes are
      set into the holes in the base template. Use the dowel to stir in
      handfuls of metal particles in the same ratio as before. Note that
      the wood Template 1 should not be pushed down to the bottom of the
      bucket with the resin squishing over the top.<br>
      <br>
      Carefully move the Template 2 down on to the six pipes until it is
      snugly within the rim of the bucket. Put the top Template 3 onto
      the top of the pipes and move them until the pipes are parallel.
      After the resin has hardened, remove the second template and set
      it aside. This is only used during construction, as I mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      You can finish off putting the resin/metal mixture in now in two
      stages if you want, up to within a half inch of the rim of the
      bucket. Now it’s finished (wait until it hardens before you move
      it.&nbsp; You will actually use about one gallon of metal shavings
      and 1 ½ gal. Of resin.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      A MONEY SAVING SUGGESTION, ALSO FOR BETTER PORTABILITY:<br>
      <br>
      Cut six pipes, 12" long, and put the crystals/endcaps on them for
      the base. Buy six coupler joints which allow a pipe to come into
      them from both directions and stop at the middle. This allows you
      to make the rest of the pipe assembly from three pipes, 10' long,
      cut in half. The finished product leaves you with only one piece
      of pipe, four feet long leftover.<br>
      <br>
      When positioning the 12" pipes for pouring the second layer of
      mix, temporarily tape the top ends of the 12" pipes so no metal
      particles are dropped in them by mistake.<br>
      <br>
      After the mix is made, take off the tape and push the rim plywood
      piece down onto the pipes so that it fits into the rim of the
      bucket.<br>
      <br>
      Put the spacers (soldered if desired), then the 5' pipes onto the
      12" base pipes, then put the third (top) plywood piece onto the 5’
      copper pipes.<br>
      <br>
      The pipes will look skewed, most likely, so just twist the top
      plywood piece around until the pipes line up parallel. As you do
      that, the rim plywood piece will move around. You need to do this
      expeditiously, though not in a hurry, so that the resin doesn't
      harden before you're done.<br>
      <br>
      We experimented with 5' extensions to the pipes to increase the
      range. It had a strong effect on the moon and on the upper
      atmosphere of the planet for hundreds of miles. We also apparently
      shut down the weather warfare facility under Homestead Air Force
      Base by leaving the extended cloudbuster pointing at the dead
      orgone field above it for a week.<br>
      <br>
      We found that we don't need to point it in any particular
      direction in order to clear the atmosphere of bad orgone, and the
      longer it's left standing, the nicer it feels for a longer
      distance from the cloudbuster (many miles). We just stand it on
      its bottom, pointing straight up. We did once eliminate a belt of
      smog which was just off the coast by aiming at it for a few
      minutes, so direction can be a factor.<br>
      <br>
      Cloudbusters destroy chemtrails consistently. It may take a few
      days for your cloudbuster to activate the environment enough to do
      this, but after that point the spew will disappear within seconds
      of leaving the UN jets and dissipated trails that drift within
      range of the cloudbuster will also disperse, but more slowly. The
      ones that are made up of solids take longer to dissipate, but
      we’ve found that these only make up about 10% or so of the spewing
      episodes.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Reich’s cloudbusters were extremely dangerous when in
      operation since he had no orgone generator attached to them. Bad
      orgone does carry a charge which can quickly drain one’s life
      force away when it’s concentrated in one spot. It's similar to a
      strong positively charges static electrical field. When cloudcover
      is unproductive or unbalanced (too much lightning, for instance,
      or too much rain) the cloudbuster busts it up.<br>
      <br>
      It also may help stop drought. Overall, it just balances the
      weather, I think it sort of mediates between the ground and the
      atmosphere somehow. The one in Namibia, Africa finally brought
      heavy rain to the desert there. It happened 9/5/01, and continued
      for several days. Gert, the fellow who made the cloudbuster and
      reported the occurrence, told me that this had simply never
      happened in the Namib desert before to the best of anyone's
      knowledge. It's arguably the driest region on the planet.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      WARNING: If you touch the pipes when they’re drawing in strong
      unbalanced or dead orgone and don’t put your hand on the base
      after that, you may experience headaches, even into the next day,
      as a friend of ours did recently.<br>
      <br>
      Mind you that our efforts, though somewhat pioneering, should be
      seen mainly as a springboard for further developments rather than
      the last word.<br>
      <br>
      SUGGESTION: If you want even more rain, try putting water on top
      of the material in the bucket and/or hosing down the whole
      apparatus daily.&nbsp; In freezing climates, cover the top of the
      six pipes so water can’t freeze and shatter the crystals.&nbsp;
      The CB appears to effect chemtrails equally well whether it’s
      placed indoors or out.&nbsp; Up to seven crystals can be placed in
      each pipe to improve performance. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Water is
      passed through a filter containing zeolite, metals and oyster
      shell, and regenerated by accelerating flow of water into a
      shell-shaped space whilst at the same time introducing air which
      has been conditioned with orgone radiation, in order to create a
      vortex. A device for recycling water uses a combination of
      filtration and regeneration techniques. Filtration is performed
      using a filter containing zeolite, metals (particularly copper and
      silver) and oyster shell. Regeneration is carried out by
      accelerating an incoming flow of water into a shell-shaped space
      and at the same time introducing conditioned air, in order to
      produce a vortex. Air is conditioned using orgone radiation. The
      vortex can be subjected to additional forces such as vibration.<br>

      On January 28, 1954, Wilhelm Reich "happened accidentally to
      observe two bright yellow-orange lights moving in front of a
      mountain range toward a lake." The encounter was the opening salvo
      of a "war" with UFOs that would occupy the final phases of Reich's
      troubled medical and scientific career.<br>
      <br>
      At the time, Reich, a trained psychoanalyst who had once belonged
      to Sigmund Freud's inner Vienna circle, was already facing what he
      called "emotional and physical misery" caused by his more
      terrestrial battle with the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration
      over the use of "orgone," a controversial form of ambient "life
      energy" he claimed to have discovered.<br>
      <br>
      Reich found an inexhaustible range of uses for his discovery,
      touting orgone as everything from the secret of antigravity to a
      tool for weather control, especially rainmaking. Most importantly,
      he found that he could use orgone to "interfere" with UFOs.<br>
      <br>
      But to the FDA, orgone simply did not exist, rendering Reich's
      orgone-based therapies prosecutable under quackery statutes. Even
      today, four decades after the controversy, Reichian therapists
      claim to be able to manipulate the energy for a wide variety of
      healing effects, including the cure for cancer, without resorting
      to drugs, radiation or chemicals. Instead, Reichians work to build
      up a current of orgone within the patient's vicinity in order to
      strengthen and heal the underlying life force itself.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, Reich's legal fight with the FDA ended with his
      death in prison after defying a federal injunction against the use
      of orgone for medical purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the official status of his medical theories, Reich
      expected a response when he wrote to the U.S. Air Force about his
      UFO sighting. He reasoned that "the U.S. Air Force is the natural
      organization in the Western world responsible" for dealing with
      such phenomena because "it operates in the atmosphere and watches
      the frontier upward toward outer space." When the military didn't
      deal with his report to his satisfaction, Reich took matters into
      his own hands.<br>
      <br>
      In his letter to the Air Force, reproduced in his last book,
      Contact With Space, Reich described his sighting as "a brightly
      shining light" moving from west to east through the forest outside
      Rangeley, Maine. A second, similar phenomenon soon joined the
      first, both moving steadily in front of Spotted Mountain. He
      concluded that the objects were not stars due to their course and
      the mountain intervening between their apparent motion and the
      sky, but the possibility that they were military vehicles or other
      objects of a terrestrial type did not seem to occur to him.<br>
      <br>
      At around the same time, Reich's secretary, Ilse Ollendorff, also
      reported seeing "a similar, but brighter and bigger, because
      closer, object." Like the aerial phenomena observed by Reich,
      Ollendorff's sighting hovered in front of a mountain, but then
      "was seen rising once vertically upward, settling down again and
      then disappearing."<br>
      <br>
      The Air Force, for its part, was either unaware of Reich's running
      battle with the FDA, or was intrigued enough by his encounter to
      overlook the controversy. Lt. Steven J. Hebert, stationed at the
      Presque Isle Air Force Base, wrote back telling Reich that the
      "subject officer notified this organization to take whatever
      action necessary, since this unit is interested in investigating
      unidentified aerial phenomena."<br>
      <br>
      Hebert enclosed a copy of Technical Information Sheet Form A, the
      Air Force's UFO reporting questionnaire, for Reich and Ollendorff
      to fill out and return. As Contact With Space ruefully notes,
      Reich received the letter only five days before the FDA obtained
      the injunction forbidding the distribution of orgone equipment as
      medical devices.<br>
      <br>
      Reich returned the questionnaire along with a copy of a short
      essay, "Survey on Ea," providing background on other unusual
      occurrences around the Orgonon research facility, including the
      revelation that friends had told Reich "of saucers having been
      seen over Orgonon in 1951." However, he had taken little personal
      interest in the reports until 1953, when his discovery of Keyhoe's
      book made him wonder whether UFOs – or, in his terminology,
      "Enigma Alpha" or "Ea" – might be propelled by orgone.<br>
      <br>
      The Air Force did not reply, perhaps put off by the impenetrable
      nature of the "basic orgonometric equations" included as an
      appendix to "Survey on Ea." In the book, Reich includes a rather
      coyly self-important note saying "not all can be revealed" about
      his relationship with the Air Force, but there is no evidence in
      Contact With Space that Reich was in communication with the
      military until October, a full six months later.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, during that time, Reich writes that he busied himself
      with appealing the FDA injunction and preparing a research trip to
      Arizona, where he hoped to investigate the role played by orgone
      reactions in the formation of deserts.<br>
      <br>
      In looking toward space to explain his sighting, Reich showed
      himself to be anything but an uncontaminated witness. Like most
      U.S. citizens in the 1950s, exposed to years of speculation that
      flying saucers were not native to the Earth, Reich already
      believed that unknown aerial phenomena were, in his words, most
      likely "contacts with visitors from outer space."<br>
      <br>
      Reich was familiar with Donald Keyhoe's groundbreaking 1953 book
      Flying Saucers from Outer Space, leaving him predisposed to look
      for extraterrestrial explanations for the unknown lights weaving
      across the sky near his Maine research facility. Moreover, the
      fact that he had seen 'War of the Worlds' only three weeks before
      reporting his sighting was also likely a contributing factor – as
      Reich called the film "a rather realistic approach to the
      planetary emergency," it evidently made quite an impression.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the cultural climate of the 1950s not only
      predisposed Reich to look beyond the Earth, but to look for
      evidence that his UFOs were engaged in "warlike" behavior.<br>
      <br>
      The threat of war was in the air, both in Reich's embattled
      personal life and in the broader political framework. The Keyhoe
      book popularized several apparently hostile encounters between Air
      Force pilots and unidentified aerial phenomena, while no less a
      personage than General Douglas MacArthur would warn only a year
      after Reich's sighting that "all countries on Earth will have to
      unite to ... make a common front against attack by people on other
      planets."<br>
      <br>
      With that in mind, the Austrian refugee, who had fled to the
      United States from the Nazis, considered it not only a scientific
      but a patriotic duty to alert Air Force Intelligence to the
      encounter at once.<br>
      <br>
      This policy of full disclosure was typical to Reich, who had taken
      care to keep the White House informed about developments in orgone
      research since 1951. While his critics point to this as another
      symptom of what long-time skeptic Martin Gardner called Reich's
      "paranoid egoism," Reich himself seems to have considered the
      matter a "major responsibility" and seems to have downplayed the
      potential uses of his encounter as a self-promotional vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      In May, however, Reich made an accidental discovery that a few Air
      Force officers, including General Harold Watson, chief of
      intelligence at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, would find very
      interesting.<br>
      <br>
      As Reich was scanning the sky with a "cloudbuster," a device he
      had designed to draw orgone out of the sky in order to induce
      rain, he saw a star "fade out" in the presence of three other
      witnesses. He pointed the cloudbuster pipes at a second blinking
      light, which also faded in brightness. Meanwhile, the first star
      reasserted itself once the cloudbuster was pointed away from it.<br>
      <br>
      Reich repeated the experiment three more times in quick
      succession, reporting identical effects each time. As it was
      scientifically impossible that his device could have interacted
      with actual stars – even in orthodox Reichian literature, the
      cloudbuster's range was measured in kilometers, not lightyears –
      he concluded that his device had interfered with two UFOs.<br>
      <br>
      Having concluded that his cloudbuster could also function as a
      "spacegun," Wilhelm Reich began to outfit his Arizona expedition
      as though preparing for a war with outer space.<br>
      <br>
      In October 1954, Wilhelm Reich was under siege. Not only had the
      Food and Drug Administration stripped him of his livelihood, but
      almost daily UFO sightings were leaving his friends and family
      exhausted and frightened.<br>
      <br>
      "There is no doubt that I am at war" with the UFOs, Reich wrote
      hours after four bright pulsating lights hovered for hours over
      Orgonon, his research facility in rural Maine. "What seemed only a
      possibility one year ago is certainty now."<br>
      <br>
      The UFOs had been menacing Orgonon since Reich began experiments
      with super-charging his "cloudbuster" weather-control device with
      small amounts of radioactive material. Reich had learned in May
      that the cloudbuster not only apparently pulled rain out of
      clouds, but also drained energy from lights in the sky, making it,
      in his words, a "spacegun" effective against UFOs.<br>
      <br>
      Like the cloudbuster, the Austrian psychiatrist turned "natural
      scientist" was convinced, UFOs operated on orgone, an ambient
      energy source that interacts with life and organic matter. Reich's
      claims to the contrary, the FDA had determined that orgone did not
      exist, and so had obtained an injunction against any medical
      treatment purporting to effect cures through orgone manipulation.<br>
      <br>
      However, Reich stayed devoted to the reality of his discovery. He
      trained the "spacegun" on two aerial objects as they hovered
      ominously over Orgonon, causing both to retreat. One "disappeared
      after weakening, waning and blinking, leading Reich to conclude
      triumphantly that "tonight, for the first time in the history of
      man, the war waged for ages by living beings from outer space upon
      this Earth . . . was reciprocated."<br>
      <br>
      As above, so below. On that same day, Reich informed the
      authorities in Portland that he would resume his orgone-oriented
      publishing efforts. This defiance would lead to his death in
      prison less than three years later.<br>
      <br>
      Reich, convinced that the aliens were waging their "war" against
      Earth by poisoning its orgone, creating deserts, decided to test
      his spacegun in the drought-wracked wastes north of Tucson, AZ.
      According to his final book, Contact With Space, it had not rained
      in Tucson for 5 years, making the desert a perfect proving ground
      for both the cloudbuster's rainmaking and UFO-weakening abilities.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in order to share his findings with the Air Force,
      Reich sent his assistant William Moise ahead to Wright-Patterson
      Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. As Reich bitterly noted, Orgonon
      "had received no direct help from the Air Force, financial or
      otherwise," but he remained eager to keep the military posted on
      the extraterrestrial-combat uses of orgone.<br>
      <br>
      Moise, however, got a guarded reception at Wright-Patterson.
      General Harold Watson, chief of Air Force Intelligence, had
      initially seemed eager to speak with Moise about Reich's claim to
      have "disabled" two UFOs, even insisting that Moise could arrive
      late in the day and the two men could "continue the conference
      after supper."<br>
      <br>
      Travelling cross-country, Moise was concerned that accidental
      factors could get in the way of the meeting and confirmed his
      appointment with Watson twice. Still, by the time he got to
      Dayton, Watson was unavailable due to "unexpected important
      business."<br>
      <br>
      Instead, a "Dr. W. H. Byers" and Harry Haberer greeted Moise at
      the base. Moise hated Byers on first sight, calling him "a man
      with a flabby handshake and eyes that don't look at you." As
      Watson had expressed concern that a group from the CIA would be
      visiting that week, it is a tantalizing possibility that Byers was
      a member of that delegation. Haberer, meanwhile, is known to UFO
      research as "a crack Air Force public relations man."<br>
      <br>
      Moise refused to talk to the two men and instead waited until the
      next day, when he briefed the base's deputy commander, who
      reportedly became "excited" by the revelation of a weapon against
      UFOs. Haberer and Byers were apparently less impressed, but took
      notes.<br>
      <br>
      According to Reich, the Air Force continued its tacit interest in
      his work, sending numerous jets to fly by his cloudbusting
      experiments but making no overt gestures because the spacegun was
      "hot because it wasn't official, and the reason it wasn't official
      was because it was so hot."<br>
      <br>
      When his group arrived in Tucson from heavily-wooded Maine on
      October 19, they were shocked by the Arizona desert, which was
      apparently much more severe than it is today. "We were impressed
      by the bare ground, giving a general impression of whiteness,
      hardness," Reich wrote. "The river beds had all been dry for about
      50 years . . . no prairie grass was to be seen anywhere."<br>
      <br>
      Over the next few weeks, the party – composed of Reich, his
      daughter Eva and son Peter, Moise and another assistant – suffered
      almost immediately from dehydration, exhaustion and general
      discomfort, all of which they attributed to poisonous "deadly
      orgone radiation." However, harassment from UFOs was sporadic but
      persistent, leading Reich to theorize that the "thirsty" aerial
      phenomena were actively fighting his rainmaking efforts.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers fought back throughout November, apparently
      encouraging a rich growth of winter prairie grass but no rain.
      Transportation difficulties had forced Reich to leave his supply
      of radioactive material behind at Orgonon, leaving the
      cloudbusters at a sharp disadvantage against the UFOs. Without the
      radioactive charge, Reich's team could only annoy the lights in
      the sky but not hinder their inscrutable activity in any real
      sense.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the UFOs kept making the researchers miserable. One of
      Reich's assistants suffered a "breakdown" while training his
      cloudbuster on the sky, forcing him to return to his family for a
      month of recuperation. In his absence, Reich speculated that the
      man had drawn too much poisonous orgone from a lurking alien
      object.<br>
      By December 7, Reich decided it was time to strengthen his hand by
      sending for his radioactive hole card, two radium needles charged
      with orgone. After a plane trip marked by misadventure and bad
      weather, the needles arrived a week later.<br>
      <br>
      Once Reich had his radium, he was ready to retake the offensive
      against the UFOs and the desert simultaneously.<br>
      "On December 14, about 16:30 hours, a full-scale interplanetary
      battle came off," he wrote. "A battle which would have appeared
      incredible as well as incomprehensible to anyone who knew nothing
      about the (UFO) problems or who adhered to the illusion" that
      neither UFOs nor orgone existed.<br>
      <br>
      First, the Orgonon team had to shake off "a special kind of deadly
      orgone attack" that left them "in very bad shape . . . sick . . .
      dulled, somehow out of balance." A "tremendous black cloud,
      looking like smoke from a huge fire" grew over Tucson, eventually
      taking on an angry reddish-purple coloration and triggering
      readings of 100,000 counts per minute on Reich's geiger counter.
      All of the researchers "suffered from nausea, quivering, pain in
      the upper abdomen and discoloration of movements," while "about a
      dozen Air Force planes of various kinds" flew over the team's
      camp.<br>
      <br>
      Matters of orgone, beneficial or poisonous, aside, Reich's
      description of the event is reminiscent of a nuclear bomb test: a
      strong military presence, radiation, smoke, queasiness. However,
      it is unlikely that the government would set off a bomb apparently
      targeted directly on Tucson, a thriving regional center of
      commerce.<br>
      <br>
      Reich brought his radium needles into contact with the
      cloudbusters and started firing away at the cloud to dissipate its
      power. The operation took about 20 minutes, at which time the
      cloud had broken up and the geiger count returned to normal.<br>
      <br>
      It rained three weeks later. In the meantime, Reich's journal is
      filled with dozens of UFO sightings – "red-white-blue pulsations,"
      "yellow pulsations," "silvery disks," "green-yellow steady" – on
      which to train his spacegun sights. Most "grew fainter," were
      "extinguished" or "blinked out." The grass covering the desert
      grew to a height of "several inches to a foot deep," encouraging
      local ranchers to drive cattle into the region in herds.<br>
      <br>
      After a brief side trip to Jacumba, CA, the team headed home to
      Maine at the end of April, 1955. "Our job in Arizona was done,"
      Reich said.<br>
      <br>
      He was dead 18 months later, and all available copies of his books
      were burned by court order. Only a few copies survived, forcing
      his scattered disciples to rely on private printings of his works
      – including Contact in Space – for direction.<br>

      <br>
      For more than twenty-five years I have studied and researched the
      work and legacy of Dr. Wilhelm Reich. While most who are familiar
      with his work tend to utilize his discoveries in the fields of
      either mental or physical health, I have chosen to study the
      applications of Reich's discoveries in the area of physics, or
      what Reich termed as: "Orgone Bio-Physics".<br>
      <br>
      Whether you call it Orgone Energy, as Reich did, or Aether, Odic
      Force, Chi (Ki), etc., the fact remains that this primordial life
      energy does exist. It can be and has been measured, captured,
      manipulated, concentrated, and redirected by Reich as well as many
      others over the years.<br>
      <br>
      With the invention of the Cloudbuster, Reich had a tool that would
      enable him to massage a stagnant, what he termed "DORish"
      atmosphere (DOR = Destructive ORgone), into a vibrant, healthy
      atmosphere by reinstating the normal rain cycle in areas that were
      suffering from drought conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The question that constantly plagued me was, HOW? How did this
      very simple device induce an energetic flow without some sort of
      complex mechanism?<br>
      <br>
      I must admit that, for a while, my research seemed to have hit a
      deadend. I needed a new, more unconventional approach to help me
      find the missing pieces of the puzzle. In the early 1980's, with
      the advent of Vanguard Sciences and then KeelyNet, I began finding
      several of those missing pieces as what some would call
      "synchronicity" came into play.<br>
      <br>
      My exposure to the works of Keely, Tesla, Rife, and many others
      helped me to look at my questions from other points of view. While
      it should not come as a complete surprise, this will not be an
      article detailing all of the construction or operating techniques
      for Reich's Cloudbuster. Some detail is necessary in order to lay
      the foundation for my theory, through which, I feel that I can
      finally answer the "How" question with some clarity.<br>
      <br>
      After receiving independent confirmation of what I had long
      suspected, I feel that it is time to put forward my theory that
      Dr. Wilhelm Reich's Cloudbuster is an acoustic device operating
      within a range of frequencies well below human hearing, operating
      in the Infrasonic or ELF (Extra Low Frequency) range.<br>
      <br>
      In the numerous writings of Reich, there are many indicators
      pointing to this possibility, beginning with the observations that
      lead to the development of the Cloudbuster. Due to a DOR (Deadly
      Orgone Energy) emergency at Orgonon (Reich's research facility at
      Rangeley, Maine) in March of 1952, which quickly worsened in
      April, Reich was forced to recall some nearly forgotten
      observations which enabled him to disperse the oppressive DOR
      concentrations that were smothering his facility and the
      surrounding area.<br>
      <br>
      Reich writes:<br>
      <br>
      "Far back in 1940, when the atmospheric OR energy had been seen
      for the first time at Mooselookmeguntic Lake in the Rangeley
      region through long metal pipes, casual pointing of some pipes at
      the surface of the lake seemed to affect the movement of the
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      This appeared quite incredible at that early period of OR
      research; the matter was abandoned and soon forgotten. However,
      the incredible effect of the metal pipes upon the energy motion
      such as waves, seemed to have lingered on in my mind over all
      these dozen years" - (1)<br>
      <br>
      The length of pipe picks up a specific acoustic wavelength or
      frequency, determined by the overall length and inside diameter of
      the pipe, and then by filtering out other frequencies, boosts or
      amplifies the pressure of the acoustic wave emanating from the
      opposite end of the pipe. Reich continues:<br>
      <br>
      "When the suffering from the DOR became unbearable at Orgonon late
      in April, a few metal pipes, 9 to 12 feet long and 1 1/2 inch in
      diameter, were directed toward the black DOR concentrations
      overhead, and connected through BX cables to a deep well." - (2)<br>
      <br>
      This is a key bit of information as it provides us with the
      ability to calculate the Base frequencies that Reich used to
      develop and operate his Cloudbuster. Let's say he started with
      four pipes:<br>
      <br>
      9 ft X 1 1/4 in. I.D. (1 1/2 in. O.D.) = ___?___ Hz<br>
      <br>
      10 ft X 1 1/4 in. I.D. (1 1/2 in. O.D.) = ___?___ Hz<br>
      <br>
      11 ft X 1 1/4 in. I.D. (1 1/2 in. O.D.) = ___?___ Hz<br>
      <br>
      12 ft X 1 1/4 in. I.D. (1 1/2 in. O.D.) = ___?___ Hz<br>
      <br>
      By using the formulas that are used in calculating the sounds
      generated by the individual pipes of a pipe organ, it is possible
      to calculate the corresponding frequency for each length of pipe
      that Reich used in his initial experiment.<br>
      <br>
      This also provides the basis for the calculation of the
      frequencies and harmonics involved in the operation of a
      full-blown Cloudbuster as developed by Reich in the fall of 1952.
      Again, Reich continues:<br>
      <br>
      "The effect was instantaneous: The black DOR-clouds began to
      shrink. And when the pipes were pointed against the OR energy
      flow, i.e., toward the west, a breeze west to east would set in
      after a few minutes "DRAW," as we came to call this operation;
      fresh blue-gray OR energy moved in where the nauseating DOR-clouds
      had been a short while before.<br>
      <br>
      Soon we learned that rain clouds, too, could be influenced,
      increased and diminished as well as moved, by operating these
      pipes in certain well-defined ways." - (3)<br>
      <br>
      The existing photos that I have seen show that the tubes were
      staggered in length when extended for an OROP (ORgone OPeration
      utilizinng a Cloudbuster).<br>
      <br>
      This leads me to the conclusion that the Cloudbuster is a tunable
      acoustic antenna.<br>
      <br>
      Tunable to achieve the desired results, taking into account the
      specific characteristics of the atmosphere at a given location,
      also taking into consideration the dynamics of the atmosphere as
      it interacts with the surrounding terrain. (see Appendix A)<br>
      <br>
      You may be asking yourself, what has caused me to draw these
      conclusions from Reich's writings as sited above?<br>
      <br>
      Well, my initial suspicions were caused by the recollection of a
      simple science project that I undertook as a teen in the 1960's.
      Using the plans that I had found in an issue of either "Popular
      Mechanics" or "Popular Science" magazine, I built a very simple
      (by today's standards) parabolic microphone.<br>
      <br>
      As I recall, this scratch-built parabolic microphone was made from
      several varying lengths of copper tubing, a small metal salad
      bowl, a small (crystal?) microphone like those used for the small
      reel to reel type portable tape recorders, and a 6" piece of
      wooden broom handle.<br>
      <br>
      The copper tubing was cut in lengths ranging from approximately
      18" to 2' 6" in length. Each specific length corresponded to a
      specific frequency. The microphone was mounted with some stiff
      wire approximately 1" below the lip of the metal bowl (at the
      focal point of the reflected sound) and the piece of broom handle
      was attached to the outside of the bowl with a screw to serve as a
      handle.<br>
      <br>
      With the numerous pieces of tubing bundled together, one end of
      the bundle having all ends of the tubing flush or even, the even
      end was then covered with the bowl and the bowl fastened into
      place. (see appendix A)<br>
      <br>
      Here as you can see by my rough illustration, the parabolic
      microphone that I built was very simple. The crystal microphone
      that I used in it's construction was relatively insensitive when
      compared to the miniaturized, omni-directional microphones we have
      available today. But, due to the frequency limitations established
      by the specific lengths of the tubing used, effectively filtering
      out the background noise, and the focusing effect of the metal
      bowl, the microphone was good for a range of 200+ yards.<br>
      <br>
      Now, as to the independent confirmation that I mentioned earlier,
      this came in the form of a national news story that I was
      compelled to follow-up on. It seems that in 1995, Professor Al
      Bedard of N.O.A.A.'s Environmental Research Lab discovered that
      tornadoes have an acoustic signature.<br>
      <br>
      A signature that can consist of several separate frequencies as
      well as their related harmonics, all in the sub-audible range
      below 20 Hz. There is a direct link to the size and intensity of a
      tornado and the sounds it emits.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been discovered that that a powerful tornado may
      contain within it, as many as six smaller tornadoes. Professor
      Bedard and his associates are working on a system to detect
      tornadoes that would provide up to 30 minutes warning to all those
      who find themselves in a tornado's path.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Bedard is no stranger to the inner workings of
      tornadoes. He created "TOTO" (the "TOtable Tornado Observatory"),
      in 1982 to study live tornadoes. TOTO is able to measure the
      temperature, velocity, atmospheric pressure, and electricity of a
      tornado. The device called "Dorothy" in the movie "Twister" bears
      a striking resemblance to Bedard's TOTO.<br>
      <br>
      In the movie, the fictional Dorothy releases hundreds of little
      sensor-filled spheres, whereas Bedard's instrument package - TOTO,
      stays on the ground.<br>
      <br>
      I believe that Bedard's discovery of an acoustic signature for any
      given tornado, combined with a Cloudbuster functioning as a
      tunable acoustic antenna, ties directly into Reich's second rule
      of his "Rules to Follow in Cloud Engineering" where Reich states:<br>
      <br>
      "Never play around with rain making or cloudbusting. The OR
      envelope which you tackle while "drawing" energy from the
      atmosphere is an energetic continuum of high power. You may cause
      twisters.".....(4)<br>
      <br>
      Even as I write this I have to ponder: WHY?!<br>
      <br>
      There is no physical mechanism to induce an energetic flow other
      than acoustic. What aspect of a Cloudbuster allows it to attract
      and concentrate OR (ORgone energy) more than say, a body of water,
      given that water attracts and holds OR?<br>
      <br>
      Again, I must say acoustics - tunable acoustics.<br>
      <br>
      For a moment, let us look at Trevor Constable's "Weather Guns".
      Constable developed these devices after years of experimentation
      with Reich's Cloudbuster design. Constable's "Weather Guns" do not
      require grounding in water as Reich's Cloudbuster does, but it is
      required that they be in motion and in pairs to operate optimally
      (Please do not confuse his "Weather Guns" with his "Spiders").<br>
      <br>
      Constable's Weather Guns must be paired to achieve the desired
      harmonic to create the desired effect.<br>
      <br>
      Individually, a single Weather Gun produces only 1/2 the
      wavelength (or 1/2 an Octave) and must be paired to produce the
      full wavelength (or full Octave) that a single tube from a Reich
      Cloudbuster can produce. (Again, see Appendix A)<br>
      <br>
      It should also be noted that while both appear to be acoustic
      devices, both function in different ways. Constable's Weather Guns
      operate somewhat like a snowplow moving down a road. They
      concentrate the atmosphere's OR and moisture into a rolling
      waveform moving along ahead of the moving devices until it reaches
      a sufficient concentration to precipitate out of the atmosphere in
      the form of rain.<br>
      <br>
      Then the concentration process will begin again, if the devices
      remain in motion. Constable's video (available through Borderland
      Sciences Research Foundation ) showing his ocean-going Weather Gun
      demonstration through time-lapse photography, is a good example of
      this principle as he causes it to rain over and over again ahead
      of his moving vessel.<br>
      <br>
      While Constable's Weather Guns create a "Push" effect in the
      atmosphere, Reich's Cloudbuster creates an energetic "Draw" (or
      Pull) in the atmosphere. Reich's CB (CB = Cloudbuster ) draws the
      beneficial OR frequencies down to ground level, whereas
      Constable's WGs (WG = Weather Gun) seem to operate on the energies
      of the atmosphere at an elevation of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet and
      above.<br>
      <br>
      The Earth's atmosphere is as stratified as the ground beneath your
      feet, so the affects of certain frequencies manifesting at certain
      elevations of the atmosphere is not unusual. The ability of
      Reich's CB to draw this energy to ground, I believe, is a primary
      factor in the successful remedy of drought conditions and
      long-term desert abatement.<br>
