      <font size="+1">... The Orgone Energy motor. I will mention in
        brief, some references from Dr. Reich's work in relation to a
        method of utilising Orgone energy to power a motor. The full
        details were published in 1948 and 1949, and the reader may
        refer to these for full details. </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">For his radioactivity work, Reich used a Geiger
        Muller counter. As a result of many experiments, he noticed
        reading anomalies with some of his experiments. Basically, he
        noticed increased reading with the counter dependent on Orgone
        concentrations. This eventuated in Reich eliminating the normal
        Geiger Muller tube and replacing it with his own specially made
        tubes. He named these Vacor tubes. These tubes were evacuated to
        .5 of a micron, which is below the level that normal ionisation
        would occur. As a result of charging these Vacor tubes with
        Orgone energy, he discovered that they would produce a high
        pulse rate on the GM counter. This led Reich to further
        experimentation, resulting in the modification of the standard
        counter circuit in such a way that a small motor could be made
        to rotate directly from the Orgone energy. This motor was a
        small AC type made by Western Electric, with a type number of
        KS-9154. It would run when Reich connected an antenna and/or
        earth to the modified GM counter. It would also rotate whilst
        under the influence of a field emanating from a living creature.
      </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">The rotation of the motor was quite unusual as it
        could reverse direction spontaneously without significantly
        slowing down and speeding up again as if the motor had no
        inertia. The rotational speed also varied unexpectedly and could
        be made to run faster or slower, depending on the person that
        had his hand near it. Reich explained the above idiosyncrasies
        by referring to a force he called the "Y factor". He refused to
        divulge what the Y factor was, and mankind will have to wait
        till 2007, when his sealed archives will be opened. As already
        mentioned, I am very confident that the Y factor simply stands
        for YOU, meaning that the individual's Orgone field interacts
        with the experiment. This has occurred over and over with
        experimenters interacting with the Joe cell. For the more
        dubious reader, I will quote directly from some of the comments
        of witnesses that were present when Reich was demonstrating the
        Orgone motor:</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Myron Sharaf. "...it involved the use of an
        accumulator attached to a motor; concentrated Orgone energy was
        triggered by a small amount of electricity, an amount
        insufficient to rotate the motor without the accumulator... When
        powered by the combination of Orgonotic and electrical energy,
        it ran smoothly and quietly; but the speed varied depending upon
        the weather...more rapidly on dry, clear days, more slowly when
        the humidity was high." </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Elsworth Baker. "Reich first used vacor tubes in
        series attached to a small accumulator and connected to a
        transformer to build up an electric charge to excite the Orgone
        energy. He used four or five vacor tubes. All were connected to
        a 25 Volt electric motor... Reich took away one vacor tube after
        another until all were taken away, and still the motor ran. The
        important ingredient was the so-called Y factor which Reich did
        not divulge... On Orgone energy, the motor was practically
        noiseless and ran smoother and faster. At times, it would change
        direction. In damp weather, it would not run." </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">Lois Wyvell. "The one I saw was about the size of
        a large orange... It was hooked up to a special Orgone
        accumulator with the Y factor that Reich did not divulge as he
        felt mankind was not ready to use such a potentially boundless
        power rationally... But the motor ran on atmospheric orgone
        energy fed to it through the accumulator and also from the human
        energy field... It ran erratically, as no motor with a
        mechanical energy source does. It slowed down and speeded up
        without any interference. Also, if one curved his hands over the
        motor, it picked up speed, and with one's hand over it, it
        speeded up and slowed down... It reversed itself every once in a
        while without slowing down, even without a jolt." </font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1">As you can see, there is a large and undeniable
        link between the atmosphere, living organisms and the Orgone
        motor. In a movie sequence that Reich made, there is a
        demonstration of the motor not turning until Reich placed his
        hand in the vicinity of the motor. The motor then ran until
        Reich removed his hand. So if we are not dealing with a living
        force, I would challenge the reader to offer me a logical,
        scientific reason to the contrary. Please, don't bother replying
        with references to tricks with mirrors, RF transmitters or any
        other circus act type explanation. Again, let me state that the
        above is a very, very small sample of the vast amount of
        recorded data in our historical archives...</font><br>

            workshop:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Orgone Motor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As a group, we spent considerable time reading through hundreds of
      pages of experimental research leading up to the day when the
      orgone motor began working. We also studied the voluminous
      documentation of experiments with the working motor. Participants
      were asked not to take notes only while we looked through the
      handful of pages containing diagrams relevant to the specific
      set-up of the motor. But it was the general consensus that the
      actual set-up of the motor was still not self-evident. Which does
      not preclude the possibility of a future, more rigorous and
      focused study of these materials yielding further answers and
      practical experimental research.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Y Factor</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      We looked through literally hundreds of pages of equations and
      observed many recurring symbols, values, calculations, and
      functions. While the letter Y does appear, it does not appear as
      frequently as other letters and symbols. And there was little in
      these materials to link the letter Y specifically with the orgone
      motor. Again, a more rigorous, focused study of specific materials
      might yield further results.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Orgonometric Equations</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      By the final hours of the workshop on Wednesday, the effect of
      viewing so many pages of equations was numbing. Which was part of
      the point of the workshop: to impress upon everyone the staggering
      amount of archival content.<br>
      <br>
      Reich was obviously looking to express Copernican theories,
      functions, and equations in orgonometric or functional terms. It
      also became clear that his concept of “The Swing” pertained to
      planets orbiting a sun which itself was moving in a spiral motion.
      And because there were a handful of pages where Reich lists the
      meaning of symbols and values in his equations, these lists might
      well function as a preliminary “Rosetta Stone” with which to
      revisit some of these materials for more rigorous scrutiny.<br>
