      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Washington DC engineer and
          a Phoenix mechanic have proved that even in the Age of
          Corporate Patents, there’s still room for the independent
          inventor working out of a garage and driven by dreams. Now
          their idea for a simple device that raises a car’s gas mileage
          while cutting pollution appears ready to leave the garage and
          make its debut in American cars. In widespread use it could
          slash by almost 50 percent the amount of oil imported into the
          US.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After dozens of false
          starts, engineer Sherwood Webster and mechanic Richard Heise
          created a valve that sits beneath an auto carburetor and,
          according to a Congressional Service Report, does all the
          following: cuts fuel consumption by 20%, increases engine
          torque by 13 to 40 %, cuts carbon monoxide emissions by almost
          50% and hydrocarbon emissions by up to 23%, and drops required
          octane ratings by 10 to 15 points.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Octane is a measure of a
          fuel’s capacity to resist engine knock; higher octane fuel
          requires additives and more crude oil per gallon than
          lower-octane fuel. The octane reduction in the Webster-Heise
          valve would translate into a 600,000 barrel-per-day savings if
          it were applied to every American car; the valve’s gas-mileage
          improvement could save an additional 1.3 barrels per day. The
          savings could go up to almost half the 4.2 million barrels of
          imported oil this country consumes daily.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Webster and Heise achieved
          these results by solving one of automotive design’s oldest
          problems: how to fully and evenly vaporize gasoline.
          Carburetors mix air and gas to form a vapor that feeds the
          pistons. Inconsistencies in the density and chemical
          composition of gasoline create heavy drops that the carburetor
          can’t break up. These drops burn poorly, leave deposits that
          cause engine knock, increase wear on components, and lower
          efficiency.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Webster-Heise valve
          sucks the gas-air mix from the carburetor, bounces it off a
          concave shield, and squeezes it through a sandwich of
          stainless-steel screens. The curved plate speeds up the
          mixture so that it hits the screens with enormous force. The
          arrangement of holes in the screens breaks even the heaviest
          drops into an invisible mist. The mix that results is almost
          totally uniform and perfectly blended.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The heart of the valve is
          the screen sandwich. Other valves with screens have failed,
          but this one succeeds because the sandwich creates a vibration
          pattern that pulverizes drops. Webster and Heise discovered
          their breakthrough in 1977 entirely by accident. Their 39
          attempts to create a single-screen filter had all flopped.
          Then one day while washing off their stainless-steel screens
          with a hose in Heise’s garage, they happened to hold two
          screens next to each other. To their astonishment the water
          spray vanished. It emerged from the second screen in a mist so
          fine, it was invisible. Two years of testing this effect
          resulted in the prototype valve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When we built the
          prototype”+, Webster recalls, "we didn’t even understand why
          it worked. All we knew was that it did".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It’s an inspiration", says
          Harvey Palmer, a chemical-engineering professor and
          distillation expert at the University of Rochester. "Two
          individuals with a solid guess. All the research money at GM
          and Ford just can’t buy that".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps the most incredible
          feature of the valve is that it is expected to cost car
          manufacturers less than $100 to install. Chrysler, seeing the
          potential for a low-cost anti-pollution device to replace
          expensive catalytic converters, has licensed the valve and
          could begin using it in cars by the middle of the decade.
          Other American carmakers may follow, with government prodding.</font>

                Valve May Increase Auto Fuel Economy"</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the request of two
          influential congressmen and the vice president’s office, the
          Transportation Department has decided to test a new valve that
          its developers say boosts auto fuel economy and power while
          drastically cutting emissions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even though early private
          tests were quite promising, the valve’s developers have had
          little luck persuading the industry to exploit it. But they
          have quietly attracted many highly placed investors over the
          last two years, including former President Ford and his former
          White House counsel, John Marsh; Senator John Warner (R-VA),
          and former Senator Carl Curtis (R-NE)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Partly because of these
          connections, the valve also grabbed the attention of some
          influential non-investors, including Rep. Edward Madigan
          (R-IL) and James Broyhill (R-NC) -- both involved with
          environmental and transportation issues -- and Vice President
          George Bush Sr. Bush’s office became interested because of
          pending decisions on whether to further limit lead in
          gasoline.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the two Arizona
          men who developed the intake valve -- Sherwood Websters and
          Richard Heise of Scottsdale -- it would allow use of 75-octane
          gas, eliminating the need for lead and other additives. The
          lowest available octane now is 87. The valve also would
          eliminate the need for any pollution-control devices, the
          developers claim.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preliminary private tests
          have been promising, according to an unpublished report from
          the Congressional Research Service. The new tests will be
          conducted with the cooperation of Chrysler Corp., which will
          provide technical aid and equipment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the developers describe
          it, the valve utilizes two bonded wire mesh screens to
          thoroughly vaporize gasoline entering the cylinder,
          eliminating gas droplets that produce hot and cold spots in a
          cylinder. If it proves feasible, therefore, the valve would
          eliminate the need for higher octane gas, lead and other
          additives used to fight this problem.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to preliminary
          test results, the developers say, use of the valve increases
          fuel economy by 6 percent to 20 percent and boosts power by 13
          percent to 40 percent, while reducing emissions of nitrogen
          oxide and carbon monoxide.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By Tom Valentine</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Small devices designed to
          vaporize fuel and provide American cars and trucks with better
          mileage and less exhaust pollution have been claimed, and
          denied, for the past 40 years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, previous failures
          do not preclude a success, and the Webster-Heise Valve,
          invented by Sherwood Webster and Richard Heise of Phoenix, AZ
          has proven to be a success, despite blatant attempts at
          suppression by the "petrocrats" of big oil and big government.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a report by the
          Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Webster-Heise valve
          is a "potentially significant device" for improving fuel
          economy, reducing emissions, increasing power, lowering carbon
          buildup, and eliminating cold-starting problems with pure
          methanol as the fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Don’t try to buy one for
          your car, however. The business end of this potentially
          tremendous business is bogged down, which is par for the
          course when anything that seriously affects the auto/oil
          monopoly is concerned.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">David Lindahl, analyst for
          energy policy for the CRS, authored a 145-page report
          favorable to the Webster-Heise valve in September of 1982. In
          that report Lindahl wrote:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"[The valve] probably would
          not require substantial changes in the existing equipment or
          production techniques. Its impact outside the industry,
          however, could be considered ‘epochal’ in terms of eliminating
          the need for gasoline additives, reducing crud oil imports and
          improving air quality".</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Simple and Cheap ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The device is a stainless
          steel cylinder with a double screen sandwiched inside. The
          fuel/air flow is automatically regulated by engine demand. The
          simple, inexpensive valve sits below the carburetor in the
          intake manifold and "employs recently discovered principles of
          turbulence and differential vaporization to force methanol or
          gasoline to change state from a liquid to a vapor at
          relatively low temperatures", according to co-inventor
          Webster.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lindahl told the Spotlight
          his office encouraged both government and business to look
          upon the device favorably, and both GTE, Inc. and the Bank of
          America (Boa) extended options to the inventors, who are
          protected under the patent laws.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Webster, who is no stranger
          to suppression by the bureaucratic processes inherent in both
          big government and big business, told the spotlight recently
          that both options have now expired with nothing fruitful
          coming to pass.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">GTE and the BoA carried out
          joint testing of the valve on a methanol-fueled Chevrolet
          Citation from the Boa fleet. The tests were carried out in a
          Denver laboratory under the approval of the EPA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The emissions reductions and
          fuel economy results were impressive with methanol literally
          attaining the same mileage ratings as gasoline for the same
          vehicle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is unusual since
          methanol is known to have less than half the BTU (heat/energy)
          value of gasoline.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">GTE Gets Interested ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to "Alcohol Week"
          (1 August 1983), GTE became interested in manufacturing the
          new valve since the company already makes auto components
          (early fuel evaporator now installed beneath the carburetor)
          and the Webster-Heise valve makes theirs obsolete.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We are still in touch with
          GTE", Webster said, "but the option expired in December 1983
          after nine months. I understand that the engineers working
          with us attempted to get management to exercise the option,
          but couldn’t seem to get upper-level management attention".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventors discovered the
          precise screening proportions to ‘vaporize’ the fuel/air
          mixture quite by accident during their research in the late
          1970s.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lindahl’s report explained:
          "After two months of screen testing, it was apparent to both
          Webster and Heise that a single screen would not work, as
          earlier inventors had already shown. Single screen vaporizing
          devices have not proven consistently effective, despite
          promotional claims. In the process of changing from one size
          screen to another, however, Heise (an outstanding, veteran
          garage mechanic) accidentally held both screens together and
          noticed to his astonishment, and that of everyone else
          present, that a totally unexpected phenomenon was occurring.
          The water was no longer falling in large drops on the impact
          side of the double-screen combination, but the entire flow was
          passing through the screens in a virtually invisible mist.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Only when a watch crystal
          was placed in the flow downstream did small droplets reform
          and become visible".</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A Breakthrough ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This was a major
          breakthrough in automotive fuel conditioning. By early 1980
          the Webster-Heise corporation had raised capital and
          thoroughly tested and patented the invention. Both inventors
          have worked exclusively on the development of the valve since
          1978.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lindahls’ report cites the
          extensive tests performed on the device, including tests by
          Ethyl, Inc., and a demonstration to 15 major US auto and oil
          companies in August 1980.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">John Marsh Jr (now secretary
          of the Army) was the Webster-Heise corporate counsel at the
          time and he offered to license the valve to any US corporation
          , and to provided a 5-year moratorium on its use in foreign
          cars imported to the US.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio)
          officials wrote of the valve as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The data from these
          previous tests do indicate the potential for reduction in
          octane, improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and possibly
          improved drivability. Together these benefits, if realized,
          could represent significant value. Therefore, we are now
          exploring ways to further evaluate the valve".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sohio urged Ford Motor
          Company to test the device and tests were undertaken at Ford’s
          Dearborn laboratory beginning in January 1981. Initial tests
          indicated significant gains but Ford expressed concerns that
          the gains might be due to other factors -- primarily that the
          baseline engine (without the valve) had been contaminated with
          carbon deposits during the baseline tests.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Every car on the road today
          is contaminated by carbon deposits, so vaporization would
          definitely help. This fact was not determined by Ford.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Second Test ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A second test was an
          extremely demanding wide-open throttle test, and again the
          valve performed effectively, but heat problems in the system
          indicated the prototype being tested was too small for the
          unit. Webster and Heise offered to enlarge the valve to
          accommodate these test conditions, but Ford declined.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Later Ford informed Webster
          that " It is Ford’s opinion that the Webster-Heise device is
          not the most appropriate means of eliminating the necessity
          for carburetor heat".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The company added that, "the
          Webster-Heise device is not of interest to Ford at this time".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Daunted, but not defeated,
          Webster-Heise purchased a 1982 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme in
          order to test their device on a modern, electronically
          controlled system. Even with the restrictions imposed on their
          valve by the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) equipment
          demanded by EPA restrictions, the test vehicle showed
          significant gains with the valve installed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instead of reacting with
          delight and favor upon the announcement of a better, less
          costly means for cutting pollution and saving fuel, the
          minions of big auto/oil/government surged forward to stamp out
          the ingenuity of the two inventors.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Senate Report ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1976 the Senate Commerce
          Committee authored a detailed, 300-page report on the infamous
          LaForce brothers’ engine claims. In that report the committee
          concluded that the EPA had rigged the tests to fail the
          LaForce potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be noted that
          Webster-Heise had, indeed, been tested under EPA auspices with
          GTE and BoA back in August of 1980. The memo was written in
          December of 1980.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Interestingly, the ‘joint
          leadership’ of the House of Representatives, especially Thomas
          (Tip) O’Neill, have joined the issue by filing a "friend of
          the court" brief on behalf of Sun Oil, arguing that the
          communication was "privileged".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Meanwhile, automobiles
          continue to be produced, sold and driven with every manner of
          expensive, regulated equipment involved in an effort to save
          fuel and reduce emissions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A better idea has been
          presented, but our Establishment is beating a path to the
          inventors’ door --- not with accolades, but with brickbats and
          incompetence.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Are US auto makers and
          gasoline companies really interested in improving auto exhaust
          emissions and the environment? Are auto makers and major oil
          companies really interested in conserving diminishing
          petroleum supplies so that currently owned cars and those made
          in the next few years can be driven through their expected
          mechanical life spans? Are domestic auto makers really
          interested in competing with Japanese and European producers
          for their share of the US and world markets?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The answer to all three
          questions is "not very interested" if conservation, the
          environment, and competition interfere with the paths
          Detroit’s auto moguls and the country’s oil industry have
          chosen.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a car owner, your own
          answers are probably different"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is a classic story
          about an invention which auto makers and gasoline companies
          prefer to keep off the market. Unlike such tales in the past
          about miraculous carburetors that give a hundred miles to the
          gallon and exotic engines that run on water only -- this is
          real. It’s happening now and it’s all in a report buried in
          the archives of the US Library of Congress and detailed in a
          technical report by the Congressional Research Service.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The federal report, dated
          Sept. 7, 1982, deals with the Webster-Heise valve, a device
          for vaporizing gasoline covered by US patents and patents
          granted in 9 other countries.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventors are Sherwood
          F. Webster, an engineer of Scottsdale, and Richard L. Heise, a
          Phoenix area master mechanic who offered to give US
          manufacturers exclusive rights to produce and use their system
          for 5 years before licensing it for sale abroad.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The valve fits beneath an
          auto carburetor and it vaporizes gasoline; resulting in more
          complete combustion of fuel, increased mileage, remarkable
          reduced emissions far below EPA requirements and eliminates
          the need for fuel with costly additives.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was tested by Ethyl
          Corporation, producers of tetraethyl lead and other gasoline
          additives at Ethyl’s laboratory near Detroit in early 1980.
          the findings by Ethyl were borne out when Environmental
          Testing Corporation near Denver, an EPA- recognized certified
          testing laboratory, conducted comprehensive tests in August
          1980 and found the valve boosts gas mileage, cuts emissions
          and travel costs and operates normally on 75-octane fuel!</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The following October,
          representatives of major automotive and oil companies attended
          another series of tests at the Denver area lab where a new
          series of EPA tests was run and caused the same conclusions.
          Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) was so impressed, it induced Ford
          Motor Co. to join in a joint test project. Ford agreed -- on
          the proviso that Sohio not participate and that no disclosure
          of results be made while testing was under way. In January
          1981, Ford engineers did tests at Dearborn with impressive
          results, but Ford -- heavily into fuel injection engines and
          diesel engines -- exercised its options to drop testing and
          notified the inventors, "[T]he Webster-Heise valve is not of
          interest to Ford at this time".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The report, prepared for the
          US Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said General
          Motors and Chrysler were also interested in the invention. In
          October 1980, R.M. Hokanson, Chrysler’s agent at the Denver
          tests, notified his company, "I think this device has merit
          for our company and recommend that we investigate the
          possibility of testing this device on our products as soon as
          possible".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chrysler, in conjunction
          with the US Dept. of Transportation, was involved in tests
          earlier this year -- and for whatever reasons -- these tests
          emerged quite differently from earlier EPA test procedures.
          These results may be explained in the report which points out
          that the auto industry does not care to jeopardize its
          investments in fuel injection and diesel engines and major oil
          companies would find that independent refiners would gain a
          competitive position of all cars could use the same low-octane
          gasoline.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Webster-Heise valve has
          undergone enough certified testing to demonstrate its
          engineering, environmental and economic values -- but
          competition, reduced emissions and lowered costs to customers
          aren’t in style anymore...</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Representatives of General
          Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Sohio, Chevron, Cities Service,
          Marathon Oil, Texaco, Amoco, Gulf Oil, Arco, Gulf Science and
          Technology, Phillips Petroleum, Henningson, Durham and
          Richardson, the Pace Co., and the Swedish Embassy don’t travel
          to Denver to watch a test -- if they don’t have good reason
          the believe its worth watching.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So they gathered at Aurora
          CO, near Denver, on October 14 and 15, 1980, to observe
          results of an EPA standard highway test at the laboratories of
          Environmental testing Corporation to see what a Webster-Heise
          valve could do for a 1979 Chevrolet Monte Carlo -- compared to
          the vehicle without the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The auto company people were
          impressed. The oil company people were also impressed because
          -- among other things -- the tests showed the car getting
          better mileage on 75-octane fuel than it does on 97-octane
          gas. It also showed it producing far less pollution on
          75-octane fuel than it did on the ore costly 97-octane
          gasoline.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Sohio knew that earlier that
          year the Ethyl Corporation had performed similar testing at
          its own labs with favorable results. Sohio asked Ford to test
          it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inventors, Sherwood
          Webster and his partner, Richard Heise offered to sell rights
          to install the device on US cars exclusively for 5 years --
          thus barring foreign car makers in Japan and Europe from using
          it. This incentive offered the domestic manufacturers a great
          marketing edge over their competitors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ford did some testing at
          Ford’s Dearborn labs and Ford backed off. Chrysler and the US
          Dept of Transportation got together for testing early this
          year, and Chrysler backed off -- despite a comprehensive
          series of standard EPA evaluations which showed that Webster
          and Heise’s invention was a hot prospect to solve their need
          for a competitive edge over Japanese and European car makers.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The nitty-gritty is that the
          Webster-Heise invention eliminates the need for expensive (and
          profitable) fuel injection systems and diesel engines. It is
          seen as a threat to major oil refiners who use expensive
          additives to boost octane ratings -- something most
          independents can’t keep up with.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The automotive establishment
          doesn’t want competition and it wants to protect its
          investment in profitable "make-do technology" to solve its
          problems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But the Bank of America
          heard about the invention and looked into it because of its
          interest in alcohol-fueled cars as a means of supplying
          gasoline -- when petroleum supplies run short before the end
          of this century.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Celanese Corporation --
          one of the world’s largest methanol producers -- heard about
          the banking firm’s lab tests and has plans to set up methanol
          fuel distribution and General Telephone and Electronics became
          licensee for the patents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">GTE and BoA participated in
          comprehensive testing of the valve on a bank-owned Chevrolet
          Citation operated on methanol. They discovered valve use in a
          standard compression motor also boosts methanol mileage to the
          point where it virtually equals gasoline mpg.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since 1980, the bank has
          operated its own methanol-powered fleet and is yearly
          expanding the ratio of alcohol-powered cars to gasoline --
          with substantial savings in operation-per-mile. This venture
          was originally undertaken to protect the bank’s ability to d
          business during future gasoline shortages since it depends on
          some 2500 vehicles to conduct its daily business. The bank
          currently operates several hundred alcohol cars.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Testing at the same Denver
          area lab under EPA requirements showed a bank-owned car with a
          valve gave performance that far exceeded levels for the same
          car without the invention shunned by gasoline companies and
          Detroit car-makers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This leads to the conclusion
          that if Ford and Chrysler ‘s testing was accurate -- it
          establishes beyond question the efficacy of methanol fuels.
          Or, if the Ford and Chrysler tests were not (and EPA standard
          tests were right) it proves that expensive fuels injection
          systems, diesel engine and high octane gasolines are not
          needed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a report to members of
          the Senate Environment and Public works Committee, the
          Congressional Research Service confirms findings about the
          Webster-Heise valve to date.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But, while there’s
          apparently no way the invention will find its way to factory
          level marketing in American-made gasoline cars -- with
          Celanese setting up a distribution and GTE as licensee for
          alcohol and gasoline car applications and foreign car makers
          hungry to by rights to use it -- it seems there’s no way US
          auto and oil companies can block the innovation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">American auto firms may have
          missed the chance to get a beat on their foreign competition
          -- but they don’t mind -- because you’re the one who’ll pay
          for that -- as well as the major oil companies’ reluctance to
          face competition from independent refiners.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Nine out of ten times,
          energy-related researchers and inventors have had their work
          ignored altogether, ripped off or otherwise exploited, and
          that’s what we’ll be talking about tonight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: I must say, first off,
          that I am not a technical person. I don’t have any degrees in
          chemistry or engineering, like the research people in the car
          companies in Detroit or like the research people in the big

          taught by the energy Establishment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: I guess you’re right. So
          everything I’m going to say tonight is provable. It can be
          documented. It’s not my imagination. It’s the origination of
          people over the years who have made this story.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Could you tell us about
          the Thermocharger? What is it?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG:&nbsp; The Thermocharger
          is a cylindrical device that changes a liquid into a vapor
          without the application of high heat. It has generally been
          known as the Webster-Heise valve, named after the inventors.
          Its number in the US Patent Office, for those who want to look
          at the records, is 4,187,820.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, in simplistic form,
          when you put a teakettle on the stove, you change water to
          steam by boiling it -- the high application of energy, whether
          it be gas stove or electric.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Thermocharger takes the
          air-fuel mixture that comes down through a carburetor and
          changes it to a vapor mechanically in a cold state. Of course,
          heat rises and cold falls.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the vaporized state it
          wafts through the intake manifold and drops into the
          cylinders. In the automobile engines of today, it bangs around
          in that intake manifold and all of the sophisticated
          innovations introduced into the manifold. It does not totally
          destroy the droplets of the fuel. This is the one thing that
          does not end being totally combusted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is really no way of
          knowing what goes on inside that manifold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: There is no way to know
          what goes on in the engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: High heat that is
          produced in a combustion engine prevents any true visual
          observation. Researchers have not been able to get inside the
          operational manifold. We assume that there are certain things
          going on in there, through the effect of the Thermocharger.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We allege -- and I’ll be
          using the term allege quite a bit -- that the Thermocharger
          totally combusts the air-fuel charge in the cold vaporous
          state.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The problem in exhaust
          pollution is that the air-fuel charge is not totally
          combusted, but by the time it gets into the exhaust manifold
          and through what [in my view] is the totally unnecessary
          catalytic converter, it comes out the tailpipe as bad
          pollution from the exhaust, made up of hydrocarbons, carbon
          monoxide, and a little bit of carbon dioxide. This is auto
          exhaust.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: In short, the
          Thermocharger mechanically vaporizes the gas so that it burns
          and combusts thoroughly, and you are able to get every
          possible value out of that fuel. Will a Thermocharger work on
          any car, however?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is one of the most
          difficult phases of research. Because of all the electronic
          controls that are on cars these days, particularly in the
          pollution control area, every engine must be treated
          individually.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Thermocharger program of
          research and development has been able to work on 4-, 6- and
          8-cylinder GM products. Lord knows how many individual engines
          are in automobiles all over the world. Each of these engines
          would have to be researched and treated differently.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Then the Thermocharger
          is not just one device that could be attached to any engine?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: The Thermocharger is one
          device, but because of the electronic systems of the new
          engines there has to be an associated item to go with it to
          make it work optimally.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Does that mean, tehn,
          that we have to go back to the old Model T to get some real
          efficiency?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: What people are
          interested in is performance. They want to jam the accelerator
          down. Very importantly, people want extended mileage from
          their fuel dollar, and the Thermocharger presents that in al
          of the three engines researched and on the road that so far
          have been programmed with an electronic chip and a
          programmable readout. I hate to get into technical details
          here, but it is important.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: That’s right, because it
          demonstrates to people that this isn’t just some backyard
          invention. The Thermocharger has been tested with very modern
          equipment on very modern cars.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: The Thermocharger is
          always operated on GM products. That’s an interesting part of
          the story. It has been tested with Chrysler and Ford, but as
          far as road operation is concerned, it has been on GM
          products.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is on 9 cars
          experimentally owned by the corn growers’ association in
          Idaho, Nebraska, Iowa, North and South Dakota and Missouri.
          There are also two cars in Washington DC.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These cars run magnificently
          on ethanol.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Ethanol is not methanol.
          Ethanol is alcohol that can be made by grain. It’s booze --
          corn liquor if you will.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: That’s right. Ethanol is
          mixed with unleaded gasoline at 87 octane, and this is called
          85.15.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: You mentioned that one
          of these ethanol cars is in Washington. Is it driven by
          somebody with some clout?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Yes, the car is driven
          by C. Boyden Grey, the president’s chief counsel. Mr. Bush
          himself has driven Thermocharged cars in the past, beginning
          in 1985.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I’ve driven this same car
          myself. It’s a 4-door Buick with a 4-cylinder engine that
          operates on both 85.15 ethanol and 87 unleaded gasoline.
          There’s a little switch in the ashtray that switches it back
          from the ethanol tank to the unleaded tank. The valve will
          mechanically vaporize any combustible fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: So the powers that be
          know about this. GM knows about it, of course.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: We have negotiated with
          GM over the past 12 years. Our last meeting was January 14 at
          the GM technical center in Warren MI. Nothing came of it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Every time you get to
          the high level in a corporation, new inventions don’t get
          anywhere, it seems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: The most interesting
          thing that came out of our meeting was that GM’s engineers and
          thermodynamic experts said that it didn’t work, in essence.
          They said that it was "thermodynamically impossible".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We heard this also from
          Chrysler.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The car industry has been
          searching for vaporization and trying to get complete
          combustion. They know the pollution problem. They know the
          power problem.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pollution control devices on
          an engine just make a wimp out of the engine. If there were
          not all those pollution control devices on an engine, the
          engine would just about break your neck when you put your foot
          on the accelerator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: There’s a lot of money
          in the pollution control device business.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Yes. We were told years
          ago by Detroit (sort of in concert) that it was, as I said,
          "thermodynamically impossible". This gets back into this
          business of "changing the laws of physics".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Physics says that you cannot
          change liquid into a gas without heat. Our program is to
          change a liquid into a gas without heat.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is done and on the road
          in their products. That is what is impossible for us to
          understand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: Years ago the late
          Sherwood Webster (a friend of mine whom you knew well) said
          that the Thermocharger vaporized so well that you couldn’t see
          the vapor coming out the end of the device even when cold
          water was hitting it. Also the spray coming out the other end
          was so fine he couldn’t see it until he checked the cover of
          his watch, which was wet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: There was a great deal
          of accuracy there. The engineers don’t believe it, however. It
          does work, though. It’s an idea whose time has come.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: There is a reason for
          the Thermocharger being used with alcohol rather than
          gasoline. Could you discuss that?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Methanol is used in the
          racing cars at Indianapolis. Its octane rating is tremendous.
          It is terribly volatile in its 100 percent state. When it
          catches fire there are no flames.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now the car that the
          president’s counsel, C. Boyden Grey owns in Washington is a
          pure methanol Thermocharged 1981 Citation which is garaged at
          the moment. Methanol is a fossil fuel derivative and is the
          darling of the petroleum industry as an "alternative fuel".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ethanol is not the darling
          of the petroleum industry because it comes from a source that
          the petroleum industry has nothing to do with: corn, a
          renewable resource, and so many other sources.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Methanol, in the long run,
          will not be the fuel of the future for the auto business. Mr
          Bush has described, publicly, ethanol as the fuel of the
          future, He did that in June of 1989 in Lincoln NE.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The documentation shows that
          Bush and Grey have been proponents of alternative fuel for a
          long, long time. His national energy strategy states that
          ethanol should be available as a fuel of choice at service
          stations across the land. I don’t imagine that this goes over
          too well with the petroleum industry.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: What’s keeping the
          Thermocharger from being produced?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Previously it was te
          economics of the times. When the Thermocharger was first
          proved viable in the fall of 1980 at the Environmental Testing
          Corp. (ETC) lab in Aurora CO, it was demonstrated to operate
          on gasoline at 75 octane, a very low octane. Octane is the
          quality in gasoline that keeps the engine from falling out of
          the car. In other words, if you get too low on octane, you get
          pinging and knocking -- even in the idle state.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When there is an octane
          rating on a fuel pump and you see a rating in the 70s or 80s,
          that is, in my opinion, a con game because each point of
          octane rating is worth 3.5 cents at the pump.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, the petroleum industry,
          in 1980, was increasing octane content to increase profits.
          The Sun Oil and Shell were promoting 93.4 octane, saying it
          was better for the engine. They wanted people to buy a higher
          octane gasoline. Generally today to have a choice between 87
          to 89 and 92.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If you extrapolate backward
          and go to 1980 when the Thermocharged 6-cylinder car (without
          any pollution devices on it) operated beautifully on 75
          octane, and then go forward and see that there is a 42 cent
          spread between 75 octane and 87 octane and multiply that by 10
          years, and multiply that number by between 100 and 130 million
          automobiles, I think it would make a computer die. That’s a
          lot of cash out of the pockets of Americans.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In gasoline use, the
          Thermocharger will operate excellently at 75. The problem is
          that there is no 75 octane that is available. However, in
          1980, the Phillips Petroleum Co in Bartlesville OK made 75
          octane out of iso-octane and heptane. It was rated 75 octane
          by the EPA. This was for the test on the Thermocharger in
          1980.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: I first heard about the
          Thermocharger in the 1970s.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Well, the Thermocharger
          was "stumbled across" after the first inventors spent many,
          many years really trying to understand what they had come up
          with.Edison’s light bulb came on after 2000 tries. The Wright
          Brothers played around with the glider until they put an
          engine on it, and people had told them they couldn’t do that.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Thermocharger, if it had
          been put into production by a major company, would have saved
          the American driving public billions of dollars on 87, 89 and
          92 octane.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: What’s more, think of
          all the pollution that would have been eliminated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: That’s right.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: What about the oxides?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: Nitrous oxides are the
          primary cause of smog and really don’t need to be there. It
          could be eliminated. The Thermocharger lowers the rates of
          nitrous oxides considerably.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: I have known several
          people who when told about what I consider "suppressed
          inventions" like the Thermocharger, they respond that if any
          big car company could get a leg up on the others, they would
          do it and take advantage of such an invention. Yet, the big
          boys do collude to suppress such inventions. Why is this the
          case?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: The big companies claim
          that they have an "open door" policy. Take Chrysler for
          example. When we went to Chrysler to test the Thermocharger,
          it was an entirely different matter. It was an awful mess.
          When we went to Ford after the ETC tests at Aurora, certain
          engineers rejected us. The same thing at GM.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, when we went to the
          EPA’s certified labs in California and in Texas and Colorado
          and paid for the testing, supervising, adjusting, etc., we did
          not fail.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: So even the nbig car
          companies know that these tests work?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: There are certain
          executives both active and retires at GM who know exactly what
          the Thermocharger does, and a few of them know why it works.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: What about Lee Iococca
          of Chrysler? Does he know about the Thermocharger?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: We are of the opinion
          Iacocca was never really informed about the Thermocharger,
          even though he was chief executive of Chrysler at the time of
          the 1980 tests at ETC.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of his engineering
          executives was present at the test and shortly thereafter
          wrote a report almost demanding that the Thermocharger be
          tested by Chrysler. The report was placed on an "immediate"
          basis, but Chrysler didn’t get around to testing the&nbsp;
          Thermocharger until 1983. We don’t know why it took that long.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At that time the National
          Highway Transportation Safety Administration joined with
          Chrysler to test the Thermocharger: and in their conclusion,
          it just didn’t work out. The test was conducted at Southwest
          Laboratories in San Antonio TX. Fortunately the strange
          goings-on were all videotaped.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In September of last year we
          sent Iacocca a very detailed letter (which he evidently
          studied), and he turned the letter over to his vice president
          in charge of "outside suggestions".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is a revelation.
          Chrysler has its own in-house department which wards off
          outside inventors. A vice-president of Chrysler has a
          full-time job doing this. He responded, saying that Chrysler
          was definitely, in no uncertain terms, not interested in the
          Thermocharger.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: I’ve been told that one
          of the big companies would like to take the Thermocharger when
          the patent runs out.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: That’s what is alleged.
          Patents, you seem run for 17 years. The Thermocharger has 6
          more years to go on its premier patent. When that patent runs
          out, the patented device becomes free game for anybody.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now the American public has
          never heard of the Thermocharger, and that’s a little bit
          deliberate on the part of the automakers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The co-inventors are also
          slightly responsible here. They didn’t realize, in truth, what
          a tremendous thing they had. As a consequence, they weren’t
          really able to communicate with these people in the big car
          companies. They weren’t able to get across to them on a
          technical level what the Thermocharger is and what it does.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: What about the
          government’s role in suppressing the Thermocharger?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: There is the additional
          difficulty of testing in terms of EPA demands. The Ann Arbor
          MI lab of the EPA is the EPA’s primary experimental location
          (quite close to the big carmakers).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here’s a part of a letter I
          received from Bill Reilly, the EPA administrator:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"While the federal
          government does not formally approve laboratories for emission
          and fuel economy testing of motor vehicles, independent
          laboratories are unofficially recognized by the EPA as having
          this capability. Their equipment is identical or equivalent to
          that at Ann Arbor and used by the EPA in every case of new
          vehicle certification.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Thus, there is no EPA lab
          certified phrasing for the rest of the US as to labs which are
          independent and privately owned and operated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The federal EPA certifies
          manufacturers’ new vehicles at Ann Arbor only. The federal EPA
          does not certify used vehicles modified with after-market,
          retrofitted devices offered for certification for those not
          associated with an automobile manufacturer".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TV: In other words, our own
          government will not give an invention its own test. That’s
          amazing. That’s typical bureaucracy. They are only for the
          automobile industry.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">JG: When there’s enough
          public demand, there will be a great future for the
          Thermocharger.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An air-fuel mixture in the
          proper ratio is delivered by a carburetor to a variable
          atomizing valve which is positioned inside of the intake
          manifold by projecting through the main inlet opening on the
          customary carburetor base mounting face of the intake
          manifold. The atomizing valve is normally biased by an
          eccentric spring means to a nearly closed position but opens
          automatically to any required position in response to engine
          demand. The valve embodies an interior relatively stationary
          imperforate barrier sleeve and an exterior relatively movable
          screen assembly mounted telescopically on the barrier sleeve.
          The screen assembly consists of an interior comparatively
          coarse mesh screen surrounded by a fine mesh screen and an
          exterior rigid cage for the screens. The two concentric
          screens are in firm contact around their entire
          circumferences. A bearing intervened with the barrier sleeve
          and the rigid cage establishes a necessary jump space between
          the interior screen and the bore of the barrier sleeve so that
          the incoming fuel charge after turning will impinge with some
          force on the interior screen. Complete atomization of the
          engine fuel charge is obtained with many attendant advantages
          and wetting of the intake manifold with raw fuel droplets is
          completely avoided. The incoming fuel charge is aimed at the
          intake ports of the engine, is a cool charge, and travels with
          velocity.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BACKGROUND OF THE
            INVENTION</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The current worldwide energy
          crisis and the drive to clean up the environment, particularly
          the atmosphere, has created an urgent need for internal
          combustion engines having greatly increased fuel efficiency
          and much cleaner exhaust emissions. Responsive to this need,
          the automotive industry worldwide has taken action on a panic
          basis, and as a result of this action some improvements in
          both above categories have been realized, but only with a
          considerable sacrifice in engine performance, as is well known
          to any driver of a present day automobile. Engine starting is
          difficult and engine performance prior to complete warm-up is
          extremely poor. Such poor performance is in part due to costly
          anti-pollution equipment now required on all automotive
          vehicles and to other design changes which have been made in
          haste in an effort to meet the pressing requirement of fuel
          economy and reduced air pollution. In fact, some of the recent
          efforts of the automotive industry have proven to be
          self-defeating and it is believed that hasty efforts to find
          solutions to problems may have taken the industry along some
          improper paths which are now very difficult to deviate from
          without great economic loss.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One particular area of
          development which has been somewhat neglected is that relating
          to the delivery of the fuel charge to the combustion chambers
          of piston engines in the most beneficial manner in terms of
          fuel economy, cleaner emissions and better overall engine
          performance. Computerized fuel injection systems have been
          devised, but such systems are extremely costly and are
          economically feasible only on the most expensive vehicles.
          Furthermore, while fuel injection possesses a number of known
          advantages over engines which utilize carburetors, there are
          also known disadvantages incident to fuel injection.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Carburetors are very
          satisfactory in establishing a proper ratio of air and fuel in
          an engine fuel charge but are quite poor in properly mixing
          and atomizing the fuel. As a result, in carburetor fed engines
          much raw gasoline in the form of droplets enters the intake
          manifold and actually wets the manifold and is not atomized or
          mixed with air for proper combustion and is ultimately
          exhausted into the atmosphere as a harmful pollutant without
          utilization of its contained energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is the principal
          objective of this invention to deal successfully and as
          completely as possible with all of the above defects of the
          prior art in a very simplified and comparatively economical
          manner. By means of the invention, a very significant
          improvement in fuel economy can be achieved, as much as 25%,
          with a comparable lessening of atmospheric pollutants in the
          engine exhaust. At the same time, greatly improved engine
          performance in all stages of operation is achieved, including
          cold starting, idling, low speed and high speed response, and
          most notably improved performance in the critical warm-up
          period which is highly unsatisfactory in present-day
          automobiles. With the invention, the most beneficial
          characteristics of carburetion and fuel injection are
          retained, while the most unsatisfactory characteristics of
          both systems are avoided.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The prior art contains some
          teachings pertaining to the utilization of screens to
          accomplish the atomization of fuel which is being inducted
          into the combustion chambers of engines. Apparently, the
          potential benefits which can be derived from screen
          atomization have been misunderstood and/or overlooked in the
          prior art, with the result that this method of atomization has
          not been adequately investigated or advanced in the art and
          some early efforts which proved unsuccessful have apparently
          been abandoned.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To comply with the
          requirements of 37 C.F.R. 1.56 relative to disclosure of known
          prior art teachings, the following U.S. Pat. Nos. are made of
          record herein: 1,173,157 2,701,557 4,058,102 4,088,104

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An engine demand responsive
          variable atomizing valve is carried by a supporting module
          which is mounted between the base of a conventional down draft
          carburetor and the top carburetor mounting pad of an engine
          intake manifold. The atomizing valve is cylindrical and
          projects through the main fuel charge inlet bore of the
          manifold which normally registers with a bore in the
          carburetor base containing the main throttle valve. The
          atomizing valve assembly of the invention is thus positioned
          inside of the manifold centrally in relation to the manifold
          branches which deliver the fuel charge to the engine
          cylinders. The incoming fuel charge in passing through the
          atomizing valve is aimed at the combustion chamber intake
          ports.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The atomizing valve includes
          an interior relatively stationary cylindrical imperforate
          barrier sleeve, curtain or fuel charge blocking element, and
          an exterior axially reciprocal atomizing screen assembly
          telescopically engaging over the barrier sleeve. The barrier
          sleeve is anchored to the supporting module intervened with
          the carburetor base and manifold mounting pad. The screen
          assembly consists of an interior relatively coarse mesh screen
          surrounded by an exterior fine mesh screen, the two screens
          having their cylindrical walls in intimate contact entirely
          around the circumference of the screen assembly. A rigid cage
          for the atomizing screens is provided and this cage contains
          slotted areas and intervening bars to expose a plurality of
          areas through which the incoming fuel mixture is atomized. A
          bearing or bushing in the bore of the rigid cage slidably
          engages the exterior of the barrier sleeve and establishes a
          necessary fuel charge radial jump space between the bore of
          the sleeve and the surface of the interior screen. The fuel
          charge can gain momentum and velocity in this space before
          striking the screens.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The screen assembly is
          spring-biased toward a retracted position on the barrier
          sleeve which corresponds to engine idle. The screen assembly
          of the atomizing valve extends or opens automatically against
          spring tension in response to fuel charge velocity, which
          results from the demand of the engine cylinders for fuel. The
          automatic incremental adjustability of the atomizing valve
          responsive to engine demand is infinite. A spring-biasing
          linkage connected with the reciprocal screen assembly is of
          the overdead-center type so that the spring may offer greater
          resistance to valve opening at certain times, such as during
          engine idle and initial acceleration, than at other times, as
          during high speed cruise when spring resistance is
          automatically reduced. A vacuum assisted linkage is also
          provided to assure complete or nearly complete closing of the
          atomizing valve during deceleration when manifold vacuum is at
          the maximum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Paramount among the many
          advantages derived from the invention are the following:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Complete atomization of
          the fuel charge at all times during engine operation with a
          resulting delivery of a completely uniform charge to every
          engine cylinder.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) A constant high velocity
          fuel charge aimed at the engine combustion chambers under all
          conditions of engine demand for fuel, including idle, low
          speed and high speed engine operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Increased volumetric
          efficiency resulting in greater power and increased mileage
          and consistently smoother engine operation without stalling,
          due to maintaining ambient air temperature adjacent to the
          atomizing valve in the intake manifold instead of an elevated
          temperature in the range of 200.degree. F. to 600.degree. F.
          which is standard in present-day automotive engines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Equal distribution of
          fuel charge to all cylinders as a result of complete
          atomization, higher velocity and circular configuration of
          atomizing valve in intake manifold, and the complete absence
          of liquid fuel droplets in the manifold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) Higher velocity of
          ambient temperature air-fuel mixture as it enters the intake
          manifold, as a result of harnessing a previously overlooked
          inherently present energy source which is the increased
          velocity of fluids passing through restricted passages. No
          outside energy input is required for this benefit, merely the
          utilization of a naturally present source of energy. This
          results in greater fuel economy, more power and reduced
          pollution.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additional benefits flowing
          from the invention include reduction of the cold start problem
          and engine stalling because, with the invention, it is
          impossible for the operator to pump raw gas into the intake
          manifold. Dieseling,also called engine run-on, is
          substantially eliminated by use of an ambient temperature fuel
          charge and complete atomization of the charge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Present-day use of a heated
          charge in the intake manifold contributes to dieseling and
          engine knock. Because of the invention, the engine can operate
          efficiently on fuel having a significantly lower octane
          rating. Another very important benefit derived from lower
          temperature of the fuel charge is the reduction or elimination
          of lethal nitric oxide (NO.sub.x) in the exhaust emission. The
          exhaust will contain more carbon dioxide and water than under
          standard practice. Carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned
          hydrocarbons are also substantially reduced in the exhaust
          emissions.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the drawings in
          detail wherein like numerals designate like parts throughout
          the same, and referring first to FIG. 1, an engine 20, such as
          a conventional six cylinder automotive engine, has an intake
          manifold 21 for supplying a suitable air-fuel mixture to the
          engine cylinders in three pairs through center and opposite
          end manifold outlet branches 22 and 23. While a six cylinder
          in-line engine has been illustrated, it should be stated that
          the invention is applicable to all engine types. The customary
          air cleaner 24 and down draft carburetor 25 are shown in FIG.
          1 and a mounting module or element 26 forming part of the
          invention is placed between the carburetor base and a top
          machined pad 27 on the manifold 21 on which the carburetor is
          usually mounted. An automatic variable atomizing valve carried
          by the mounting element 26 is also shown at 28 in FIG. 1.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the other
          drawing figures, the automatic atomizing valve 28, which is
          the main subject matter of the invention, comprises a
          stationary cylinder sleeve 29 which is fixedly secured in a
          bore 30 of the element 26 so as to be coaxial with the throat
          of the carburetor 25 and perpendicular to the longitudinal
          axis of the manifold 21. The sleeve 29 is an imperforate
          sleeve and projects well into the interior of the intake
          manifold below the top mounting pad 27 thereof. The sleeve 29
          has a dual purpose in the invention in that it serves as a
          guide for a surrounding axially movable screen assembly 31 of
          the atomizing valve 28 and as a curtain or barrier element
          which regulates the degree of exposure of screen in the
          assembly 31 and therefore the degree of opening of the valve
          during engine operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The axially moving screen
          assembly 31 comprises an outer cylindrical cup-like rigid cage
          32 having a closed bottom wall 41 and a plurality of
          circumferentially equidistantly spaced longitudinal slots 34
          intervened by parallel longitudinal bars 35 which prevent the
          screen elements inside of the cage 32 from being drawn by
          suction into the intake manifold. Within the rigid cage 32 is
          a pair of concentric cylindrical equal length screens 36 and
          37, with the outermost screen 36 lying firmly against the
          interiors of the bars 35. The two screens extend axially from
          the bottom wall 41 to a point above the tops of the slots 34
          so that the two screens completely cover the slots 34. As best
          shown in FIG. 7, the top end portions of the two screens are
          suitable anchored to an upper sleeve bearing 39 of the cage
          32, which bearing will be further discussed. The total area of
          screen exposed through the several slots 34 is at least equal
          to the area of a main inlet opening 38 in the top of intake
          manifold 21, within which the atomizing valve is located.
          Preferably, the total area of screen exposed through the slots
          34 is greater than the area of the opening 38.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The exterior screen 36 is a
          stainless steel fine mesh screen in the range of 100-250 mesh
          and preferably 120 mesh. The exterior screen 36 has its
          cylindrical wall in tight contact with the several bars 35 of
          rigid cage 32. The interior screen 37 is of a coarser mesh in
          the range of 30-60 mesh and preferably is a 45 mesh stainless
          steel screen. The cylindrical wall of the interior screen is
          packed tightly against the exterior screen 36 with no spacing
          between the two screens. It has been found by experimentation
          that any other screen arrangement will not accomplish the
          desired function of complete atomization of the fuel mixture.
          If the coarser screen is arranged outermost in the assembly,
          the desired result is not produced nor is it produced if there
          is a space between the two screens or if a single screen only
          is employed in the cage 32, or if three or more concentric
          screens are employed. The described arrangement of the two
          screens 36 and 37 is quite critical in achieving the desired
          complete atomization of the fuel charge, and the complete
          elimination of raw liquid fuel droplets within the intake
          manifold 21. It should be noted that the desired results
          cannot be achieved by placing a screen or plural screens
          across the manifold opening 38 and it is essential that the
          movable screen assembly extend inside of the manifold 21 and
          be capable, because of its cylindrical shape, of aiming the
          atomized charge in all directions so that all of the engine
          cylinders can be equally supplied with the atomized charge
          through the manifold branches 22 and 23.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At its top, extending above
          the two screens 36 and 37, the rigid cage 32 has the
          previously-noted comparatively short sleeve bearing 39 fixed
          in its bore to guide the screen assembly smoothly on the fixed
          sleeve 29 and for maintaining a necessary radial spacing on
          the screens from the fixed sleeve 29 at all times. In the
          operation of the invention, this radial "jump space" for the
          fuel charge between the sleeve 29 and screens is necessary and
          critical, and if not maintained, complete atomization of the
          fuel charge will not be obtained. When the fuel charge exits
          the lower end of sleeve 29 and turns ninety degrees to the
          axis of sleeve 29 to pass radially in all directions through
          the exposed areas of screens 37 and 36, the charge will gain
          velocity and momentum across the jump space before impinging
          on the screens for atomization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For further guidance of the
          screen assembly 31 during its movement and to prevent the fuel
          charge from reversing flow and passing upwardly between the
          exterior of fixed sleeve 29 and the screens, a second sleeve
          bearing 40 is fixed on the exterior of sleeve 29 at or
          slightly above its lower end in axially opposed relation to
          the upper sleeve bearing 39. The bearing 40 is in sliding
          contact with the interior stainless steel screen 37.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the bottoms of the screen
          exposure slots 44, relatively minute engine idle notches 34'
          are formed through the rigid cage 32 to allow proper idling as
          when the screen assembly is in the relative retracted position
          indicated by the phantom line A in FIG. 7. This line A in FIG.
          7 denotes the position of the bottom end of fixed sleeve 29
          relative to the screen assembly when the screen assembly is at
          the engine idle position. The line A also denotes that the
          idle notches 34 will still be exposed or open and not blocked
          by the fixed sleeve 29 in the idle position. In a second
          relative position of the lower end of sleeve 29 to the movable
          screen assembly indicated by the phantom line B in FIG. 7, the
          sleeve 29 will cover the main slots 34 and idle notches 34'
          thus nearly completely blocking the fuel charge through the
          sleeve 29 from entering the intake manifold. This condition of
          the atomizing valve is also separately shown in FIG. 9 which
          is the condition indicated by the line B in FIG. 7. This
          condition, which will be further discussed, exists only during
          engine deceleration which induces maximum vacuum in the
          manifold 21. The cutting off of the fuel charge during
          deceleration prevents wasting fuel which is not needed for
          burning or for producing power at this time and also
          eliminates raw fuel exhaust emissions which are present in
          great quantities during deceleration under present day
          standard practice.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 7 also illustrates
          above the engine idle line A that the axially movable screen
          assembly 31 is automatically extended from the fixed sleeve 29
          responsive to engine demand to whatever relative position is
          required to satisfy the demand for completely atomized fuel in
          the engine. The automatic adjustability or movement of the
          screen assembly is infinitely variable in the invention and
          constitutes one of the main features of the invention. When
          the accelerating engine demands or calls for more fuel, the
          resulting increase in velocity of the incoming fuel charge
          progressively opens or extends the screen assembly 31 to meet
          the demand by exposing progressively greater areas of screen
          through the slots 34 which are progressively uncovered by the
          fixed sleeve 29. In all conditions, the two screens effect
          complete fuel charge atomization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be stated
          that, when the fuel charge traveling downwardly from the fixed
          sleeve 29 impinges on the arched bottom wall 41 of the cage,
          such bottom wall will tend to deflect the charge radially in
          all directions through the atomizing screens and the charge
          will turn in its travel 90 degrees from the axis of the sleeve
          29 so as to be aimed in the atomized state at the combustion
          chambers. While desirable, the arching of the bottom wall 41
          is not essential to satisfactory operation of the invention.
          As previously noted, the atomizing valve 28 is spring-biased
          to the engine idle position A where only the idle notches 34
          are open to the incoming charge. This spring-biasing means
          shown at 42 in the drawings forms a very important part of the
          invention. It not only enables the atomizing valve 28 to
          automatically open gradually inside of the manifold 21 as
          engine demand increases, but the biasing means is constructed
          to offer more resistance to valve opening during engine idle
          or at slow speeds than later on at higher speeds where engine
          demand increases. Under those conditions, the spring-biasing
          means offers less resistance to opening of the atomizing valve
          because of its unique geometry, to be described. The desired
          results and greatest engine efficiency could never be achieved
          with a constant tension spring-biasing means acting on the
          movable element of the atomizing valve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The variable tension valve
          biasing means 42 for the valve 28 comprises a retractile
          spring 43 near one side of the element 26 having one end
          connected to a crank arm 44 through a link 45 pivoted at 46 to
          the crank arm. The crank arm 44 is pivoted between its ends to
          the element 26 through a rocker shaft 47. The crank arm 44 is
          biased toward engagement with an adjustable screw stop 48 on
          the element 26, as best shown in FIG. 2. The other end of
          spring 43 is secured to a threaded spring tension adjusting
          means 49.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rocker shaft 47 to which
          the crank arm 44 is firmly attached extends across the
          mounting module or element 26, FIGS. 4, 6 and 8, and is
          suitably journaled therein by bearing means 50. The rocker
          shaft 47 intersects the bore 30, FIG. 8, and its axis is
          offset substantially from the center axis of the bore 30 which
          bore is coaxial with the axis of the atomizing valve 28. The
          axis of rocker shaft 47 extends chord-wise of the bore 30,
          FIG. 8. A driving fork 51 is attached to the rocker shaft 47
          rigidly to turn therewith, and is disposed bodily in the bore
          30 above the fixed sleeve 29. The fork 51 straddles a
          connecting rod 52 and is pivoted thereto at 53 substantially
          above the valve 28. The connecting rod 52 extends to a
          location near and above the bottom wall 41 of the cage 32 and
          is pivoted to a central upstanding anchor 54 by means of a
          wrist pin 55, the anchor 54 being disposed centrally on the
          cage bottom wall 41. The driving fork 51, FIG. 4, swings
          through an arc and is centered on rocker shaft 47 and during
          such movement connecting rod 52 can pivot about the axis of
          the wrist pin 55 as shown in phantom lines in FIG. 4 so that
          the mechansim will not bind. A feature of the invention is
          that the connecting rod 52 forms the ultimate support for the
          cage 32 and screens. This is a simple and convenient
          arrangement. When the engine is shut off, the parts are
          adjusted so that the cage or screen assembly 31 will assume
          approximately the idle position A, FIG. 7.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to FIG. 4, the
          over-dead-center relationship of the driving fork pin 53 to
          the axis of rocker shaft 47 can be noted. By virtue of this
          geometry, the biasing spring 43, through its linkage, offers
          greatest resistance to downward extension of the screen
          assembly 31 at idle speed and at relatively slow engine speed
          above idle. The resistance of the biasing means 42 gradually
          lessens in response to greater engine demand for fuel as
          engine speed increases and this lessening of spring resistance
          occurs as the driving fork 51 approaches dead-center
          relationship with the axis of rocker shaft 14 or beyond
          dead-center. Therefore, at the higher engine speeds where the
          demands for fuel is the greatest, and vacuum in the manifold
          21 is decreased, the resistance offered by the spring-biasing
          means 42 will be less than at comparatively low speeds above
          idle or during idling. The described arrangement is critical
          for proper operation of the atomizing valve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further feature of the
          invention shown in FIG. 3 comes into play only during rapid
          engine deceleration to save fuel and to prevent polluting the
          atmosphere through the exhaust system. During deceleration,
          intake manifold vacuum peaks, and unless the supply of fuel is
          completely or very nearly shut off, great quantities of fuel
          will be sucked into the intake manifold and cylinders and
          wasted through the exhaust system and into the atmosphere in a
          largely unburned state, because the engine is not working
          during deceleration and no appreciable burning of fuel is
          taking place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To assure nearly complete
          closure of the valve screen assembly 31 to the position B,
          FIGS. 7 and 9, during deceleration, a vacuum booster 56 having
          a direct connection through a fitting 57 and associated hose
          with vacuum in the manifold 21 responds to such high vacuum by
          shifting a link 58 in one linear direction until a projecting
          lug 59 on an extension link 60 engages a crank arm 61 on the
          adjacent end of rocker shaft 47 or the end remote from the
          crank arm 44 of the spring-biasing means 42. The force of this
          engagement of the crank arm 61 through the vacuum booster 56
          is sufficient to retract the screen assembly 31 to
          substantially closed position B, thus preventing the atomizing
          valve from opening during engine deceleration with the stated
          advantages. In actual manufactured form, the vacuum booster 56
          and associated linkage may be eliminated and an equivalent
          means in the form of a servo-piston can be placed inside of
          the module 26 to provide the same function. Likewise, the
          mechanical configuration of biasing means 42 may be changed in
          production without altering the mode of operation.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary of Operation ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Assuming that the engine 20
          is idling, the following conditions will prevail. Carburetor
          25 will supply a charge containing a proper ratio of air and
          fuel into the bore 30 and thence to the fixed sleeve 29 of the
          atomizing valve. The fuel itself possesses lubricating
          properties and detergents and this aids in making the valve
          operate freely as well as keeping it clean and unclogged.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">During idling, the valve
          cage 32 is at position A, FIG. 7, with only small areas of the
          screens exposed at the notches 34', the main slots 34 being
          completely covered by the sleeve 29. A sufficient volume of
          the fuel charge to maintain idling will be completely atomized
          through the two screens 37 and 36 at the notches 34' and in
          flowing outwardly through these small notches the charge will
          attain a high velocity in all radial directions around the
          circumference of the cylindrical valve 28 within the manifold
          21. Atomization will be just as complete as at higher engine
          speeds where there is greater opening of the valve 28 and
          correspondingly greater screen areas uncovered or exosed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fuel charge delivered to
          the manifold 21 in completely atomized form through the valve
          28 is an ambient temperature charge using ambient air instead
          of a heated charge in accordance with present-day automotive
          practice under which the intake manifold is actually heated.
          In the invention, the fuel charge is 200.degree.
          F.-400.degree. F. cooler than under standard practice, thereby
          greatly increasing volumetric efficiency in accordance with
          one of the prime objectives of the invention. In this regard,
          the invention departs radically from the most recent prior art
          practices and a great deal of the success of the invention
          lies in the use of an ambient air temperature fuel charge in
          combination with the other enumerated main features.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The previously-described
          radial spacing afforded by bearings 39 and 40 causes the
          incoming fuel charge, after turning 90.degree. from the axis
          of sleeve 29, to pass radially in all directions across the
          described jump space between the bore of the sleeve 29 and the
          screen 37 before striking the screens. In negotiating this
          radial jump space, the charge acquires the necessary velocity
          and momentum for complete atomization by the two screens at
          all engine speeds. Thus, a cool, dense and completely atomized
          charge which is uniform and has high velocity is delivered to
          the engine combustion chambers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The resulting reduced time
          of combustion in the combustion chambers further reduces
          temperature and greatly impedes the formation of highly toxic
          nitric oxide (NO.sub.x) which is formed only under very high
          temperatures. The absence of NO.sub.x is evidenced in engines
          equipped with the invention by the absence of a telltale white
          ash on the exhaust pipe. This is an important benefit achieved
          by the invention additional to its economy and performance
          benefits. The more complete combustion of the charge by means
          of the invention also substantially reduces carbon monoxide
          and unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust emission. The more
          nearly complete combustion of fuel forms an exhaust containing
          greater amounts of carbon dioxide and water, which is
          desirable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be stated that the
          described radial jump space between the screen 37 and the bore
          of sleeve 29 is in the dimensional range of 1/16 to 1/4 inch,
          and preferably 1/8 inch. This feature combined with the
          variable tension spring-biasing means 42 and the arrangement
          of the two screens 36 and 37 in tight contact is the heart of
          the invention and critical to the important improved economy
          and engine performance achieved with the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A final important feature or
          benefit of the invention is its harnessing and utilization of
          an inherently available energy source which heretofore has
          been overlooked in the art. This utilized source is the
          kinetic energy present in the air-fuel mixture stream entering
          the intake manifold from the carburetor. The invention
          utilizes the velocity of this always available stream to
          operate the movable screen assembly 31 of the atomizing valve
          against the spring-biasing means and no outside source of
          energy is required for this.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The many advantages of the
          invention should now be apparent to those skilled in the art
          without further explanation herein.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is to be understood that
          the form of the invention herewith shown and described is to
          be taken as a preferred example of the same, and that various
          changes in the shape, size and arrangement of parts may be
          resorted to, without departing from the spirit of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A fuel atomizing valve and
          cooperative engine intake manifold are disclosed wherein the
          air volumetric capacity of the atomizing valve is infinitely
          varied automatically as a function of engine demand and
          without external controls. Intake manifold size and volumetric
          capacity are likewise varied automatically according to engine
          demand to assure delivery to all engine cylinders a cool dense
          homogeneous charge with superatomization of the fuel in a near
          molecular state.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description:&nbsp;
            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above prior patent
          application discloses a fuel atomizing valve for engines which
          are supplied with fuel and air through a carburetor whose
          primary function is to establish and maintain a proper
          air-fuel mixture ratio. In the prior application, the variable
          atomizing valve is supported on a mounting module arranged
          between the base of the carburetor and the customary
          carburetor mounting pad of the intake manifold. The valve
          projects through the main inlet opening of the manifold and
          into the manifold passage leading to the cylinders of the
          engine. The valve consists of a stationary sleeve surrounded
          by a coaxial telescoping relatively movable atomizing screen
          assembly which includes a rigid screen cage which holds and
          confines a pair of closely interfitting coaxial cylindrical
          screens, the interior one of which is of relatively coarse
          mesh, the outer screen being of much finer mesh construction.
          Guide bearing means provided between the screen assembly and
          the fixed sleeve establish an essential radial jump space
          across which the inducted air-fuel mixture is accelerated at
          the outlet end of the fixed sleeve in response to
          engine-created suction before impinging upon the atomizing
          screens. The movable screen assembly is yieldingly biased
          toward a nearly closed slow idle position relative to the
          fixed sleeve but extends itself automaticaly against the
          biasing means in response to engine demand to provide an
          infinitely variable atomized fuel delivery device directly
          into the intake manifold for all conditions of engine
          operation and demand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the atomizing valve
          according to the prior application operates with good
          efficiency to atomize fuel to a degree heretofore unattainable
          in the prior art and to deliver a homogeneous mixture of air
          and fuel into the intake manifold on demand, nevertheless,
          certain variables inherently present in piston engines exceeds
          the capability of the atomizing valve to respond completely to
          these variables particularly in terms of instantly deliverying
          the required volume of air under all conditions and in
          assuring the necessary intimate comingling and mixing of the
          air with fuel immediately prior to delivering the atomized
          charge into the manifold passage leading to the cylinders.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the above, it is
          the object of this invention to substantially improve the
          variable atomizing valve of the above patent application so
          that it can satisfy automatically and immediately in response
          to engine demand all of the varying requirements for a
          superatomized homogeneous cool and dense fuel charge at each
          cylinder of an engine in the necessary volume for optimum
          engine operation at all speeds and under all power
          requirements encountered in normal operation. In essence, the
          present invention reacts automatically to engine demand
          without external control to deliver to the several cylinders
          the optimum fuel charge for greatest efficiency under all
          conditions encountered from slow idle through high speed high
          load operation. At any given engine demand situation, the fuel
          charge will contain the optimum volume of air and the always
          essential homogeneous mixture of air and fuel making up the
          combustible charge. Furthermore, the improved value and
          manifold arrangement will insure high velocity delivery of the
          charge through the manifold passage without the possibility of
          separation of the atomized fuel from the air during such
          delivery plus equality of charge volume, density and
          combustible quality at each cylinder under all conditions. The
          improved atomizing valve requires no additional moving
          components. As stated, it can respond to engine demand and
          alter its air volumetric capacity or air flow through
          effective size without external control. In accomplishing
          this, all of the desirable features of the atomizing valve
          according to the prior patent application are retained,
          including simplicity of construction, reliability and
          comparative low cost of manufacturing. The invention is
          entirely compatible with either carburetion fuel systems or
          fuel injection systems of the class in which raw fuel is
          directly injected into the center of the intake manifold
          upstream from the engine cylinders. The invention is also
          completely compatible with various piston engine
          configurations including four and six cylinder in-line engines
          which the automobile industry is turning to in the present-day
          energy crisis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The heart of the improvement
          in the variable atomizing valve is the provision of a second
          exterior fixed sleeve in concentric surrounding relationship
          to the inner fixed sleeve. The movable screen assembly
          surrounds and telescopes over the exterior fixed sleeve and
          responds to engine demand generally in the manner set forth in
          the prior application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A very important benefit
          derived from the use of the second exterior fixed sleeve is a
          substantial increase in the radial jump space for air and fuel
          as the latter change direction at the outlet ends of the fixed
          sleeves and begin to enter the main manifold passage after
          impinging upon and passing through the atomizing screens. This
          jump space in the improved valve is the full distance between
          the periphery of the interior fixed sleeve and the annular
          screen structure through which the accelerating fuel charge
          must pass to become superatomized. Because of the larger jump
          space, the velocity of the mixture impinging on the screen is
          supersonic, and this results in atomization of the fuel into
          particles of near molecular size with the atomized particles
          remaining at all times mixed with air in a homogeneous manner.
          In this important way, the results achieved with the invention
          are dramatically different from the prior art fuel delivery
          systems where unatomized fuel droplets are entrained in air
          entering conventional intake manifolds in a mixture of varying
          and changing density and continuity. As is well known, light
          vaporous fuel molecules ignite and burn readily in the engine
          whereas heavy molecules may fail to ignite or to burn
          completely, resulting in great losses of power, increased
          hydrocarbon pollutants in exhaust emissions and excessive
          carbon buildup, among many other known disadvantages.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In addition to the feature
          of increased jump space above discussed, the improved
          atomizing valve having the two concentrically spaced fixed
          sleeves insures complete and thorough intermixing of fuel and
          air into a nearly perfect homogeneous charge prior to its
          superatomization and in the critical zone between the
          carburetor or suitable injection means and points of entry
          into the manifold passage following passage of the mixture
          through the screens. In this connection, all of the supplied
          fuel under all engine demand conditions must enter and pass
          through the relatively confined passage provided by the
          interior sleeve, whereas air only under certain increased
          conditions of demand enters and passes through the annular
          space between the two fixed sleeves. Because of this unique
          arrangement there will always be proper thorough mixing of
          fuel and air within the bore of the inner fixed sleeve
          regardless of varying engine demand for a greater or lesser
          volume of the fuel charge. Under low demand conditions, all
          required air and fuel for optimum engine operation may be
          delivered through the interior fixed sleeve. As demand
          increases, some air and increasing volumes of air only are
          delivered through the annular space between the two fixed
          sleeves to satisfy engine requirements but without disturbing
          the mixing capability of the valve within the inner sleeve.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another feature of the
          improved atomizing valve is the provision thereon of a fine
          conical screen across the top of the annular air only passage
          between the two fixed sleeves to divert or funnel all air into
          the interior sleeve passage for confined intermixing with fuel
          at low engine demand, such as idling. At such times, manifold
          suction is insufficient to force air through the conical
          screen and into the annular space between the two sleeves.
          However, as demand increases and suction in the manifold
          increases accordingly, additional air and air only will begin
          to be drawn through the conical screen to automatically
          increase the volumetric capacity of the valve, as air and fuel
          continue to pass without interruption through the interior
          sleeve. The necessary increase or decrease in fuel to meet
          changing conditions of demand is satisfied by state-of-the-art
          liquid fuel controls which, per se, are not a part of this
          invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a second major aspect of
          the invention, the intake manifold of the engine is
          restructured to coact with the improved valve in a unique
          manner to satisfy engine demand most efficiently. Toward this
          end, the intake manifold has a divider plate between its top
          and bottom walls, preferably spaced from the top wall about
          one-third of the total distance between the two walls. The
          divider plate extends completely between the manifold side
          walls and is continuous from the main central inlet of the
          manifold receiving the valve to the individual cylinder fuel
          inlet ports. The divider plate defines two separated manifold
          passages, one of which is somewhat narrower than the other.
          Under low engine demand conditions, atomized fuel and air may
          be delivered by the valve into only the narrower passage with
          the wider passage completely blocked off. As demand increases,
          the second manifold passage gradually comes into play and is
          progressively uncovered. At maximum engine demand, both
          passages are active and receive the atomized charge from the
          valve. The arrangement insures that the atomized charge passes
          through the manifold at sufficient velocity and charge density
          and in a homogeneous state to enable optimum engine operation
          at all times.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring to the drawings in
          detail wherein like numerals designate like parts, there is
          shown in FIG. 1 a typical six cylinder in-line piston engine
          20 equipped with an intake manifold 21 in accordance with the
          present invention. As best shown in FIG. 5, the six cylinders
          of the engine receive the fuel charge through a center
          manifold branch 22 and two end branches 23, the cylinders, not
          shown, being indicated by the consecutive numerals 1 through
          6, and the ending cylinder firing order being indicated
          schematically by the non-consecutive numerals 1-5, 3-6 and 2-4
          on the manifold branches.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The engine 20 further
          includes a customary air cleaner 24 and carburetor 25 of any
          conventional type. A mounting block or module 26 for the
          automatic atomizing valve according to the invention is placed
          between the carburetor base and the usual machined carburetor
          mounting pad 27 on the intake manifold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The improved automatic
          variable atomizing valve forming an important element of the
          invention is indicated by the numeral 28 in its entirety. This
          valve is shown in FIG. 3 of the drawings associated with fuel
          injection means 29 of the type employed to deliver liquid fuel
          to the main central inlet of an intake manifold according to
          one embodiment of the invention. The valve 28 is depicted in
          FIG. 7 in relationship to the base of the carburetor 25 shown
          in FIG. 1 in accordance with a second embodiment of the
          invention. The valve 28 per se may be substantially identical
          in either application or embodiment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The valve comprises a fixed
          exterior cylindrical sleeve 29' held within a bore 30 of the
          mounting block 26, as shown. An interior fixed sleeve 31 of
          lesser diameter than the sleeve 29' is also held within the
          bore 30 of mounting block 26 in spaced concentric relationship
          to the outer sleeve 29'. The upper end of sleeve 29' extends
          above the upper end of sleeve 31 and the top of the annular
          space 32 between the two fixed sleeves is covered by a
          downwardly tapering fine mesh conical screen 33 which, during
          low demand periods of engine operation, such as idling, blocks
          combustion air at the top of the annular passage 32 and
          deflects or funnels the air into the smaller interior sleeve
          31 along with the fuel from the injection means 29 or
          carburetor. Such fuel, as distinguished from air, is always
          directed into the inner fixed sleeve 31 and never into the
          passage 32 between the two sleeves 29' and 31, which is an air
          only passage receiving air in varying amounts as engine demand
          for air increases. At these times, increasing manifold suction
          will overcome the resistance offered by the screen 33, and the
          necessary additional air for optimum engine operation will be
          drawn through the screen 33 and passage 32 while fuel and air
          continue to be drawn through the interior sleeve 31.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The relatively confined
          passage provided by the smaller sleeve 31 insures at all times
          a very intimate comingling and mixing of air and fuel in the
          valve so that a homogeneous dense charge will always be
          delivered through the manifold to the engine cylinders, as
          previously discussed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The lower ends of the two
          fixed sleeves terminate in alignment, as shown in FIG. 3, and
          the two sleeves project somewhat below the top wall of the
          manifold 21, as shown. The entire valve 28 is received within
          a main inlet opening 34 of the manifold at right angles to the
          main manifold passage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The atomizing valve 28
          further comprises an axially movable screen assembly 35
          substantially in accordance with the construction of the
          screen assembly in the above-referenced patent application.
          This assembly includes an exterior longitudinally slotted
          essentially rigid screen cage 36 and two contained coaxial
          cylindrical atomizing screens 37 and 38 in contacting
          relationship. The two interfitting screens are of equal length
          axially. The interior screen 37 is of relatively coarser mesh
          than the exterior screen 38, as set forth in the prior patent
          application. The screen assembly 35 is telescopically mounted
          on the exterior sleeve 29' for restrained axial movement
          relative thereto in response to varying conditions of engine
          means, as previously discussed. Guide bearings 39 and 40 for
          the movable screen assembly are also provided, as described in
          the prior application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The screen assembly cage 36
          further includes a preferably flat bottom wall or closure 41
          at the bottom ends of the two screens 37 and 38. Below the
          wall 41, the screen assembly further includes a cylindrical
          wall or skirt 42 extending entirely across the main manifold
          passage and beyond the far side of inlet opening 34 and into
          the bore of a cylindrical cup-like extension or well 43 formed
          on the bottom of the manifold 21 coaxially with the inlet 34.
          The well 43 preferably has a bearing surface 44 for the
          movable skirt 42 to guide it smoothly. As shown in FIG. 3,
          under conditions of minimal engine demand and hence minimal
          manifold vacuum, the screen assembly 35 including the attached
          skirt 44 are elevated in relation to the fixed sleeves 29' and
          31. Such a condition would prevail at engine idle speeds. Only
          a very small annular area of the screens 37 and 38 are exposed
          at such time between the closure wall 41 and the lower ends of
          the fixed sleeves.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with the
          illustrated embodiments of the invention, the movable screen
          assembly 35 is yieldingly biased upwardly toward the
          illustrated idle position by a suitable compression spring 45
          bearing on the wall 41 and the bottom wall 46 of the manifold
          well 43. When engine demand increases and vacuum in the
          manifold becomes stronger, the resulting downward fluid
          pressure on the wall 41 overcomes the resistance of spring 45
          to suitably lower the screen assembly in relation to the
          sleeves 29' and 31 to satisfy engine demand by uncovering
          greater areas of the atomizing screens, as in the prior
          application structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second main improvement
          feature of the invention discussed previously comprises
          providing in the intake manifold 21 a divider partition or
          plate 47 extending continuously from the main inlet 34 of the
          manifold through the manifold passage in the several branches
          22 and 23 to the fuel charge inlet ports of the engine
          cylinders, not shown in the drawings but conventionally
          arranged in relation to the intake manifold branches. The
          divider plate 47 is continuous between the opposite side walls
          of the manifold and is parallel to the manifold top and bottom
          walls, and preferably about one-third of the distance down
          between the top and bottom walls so as to define two isolated
          manifold passages 48 and 49 throughout the entire manifold
          system. The upper passage 48, being considerably narrower in
          cross section than the lower larger passage 49, is suitable
          for delivering smaller fuel charge volumes to the cylinders at
          the necessary high velocity. As demand increases causing the
          screen assembly 35 to move downwardly, the skirt 42 will pass
          below the divider plate 47 and gradually uncover the passage
          49 while an ever increasing area of the atomizing screens is
          exposed below the fixed sleeves 29' and 31. As this takes
          place, the active total cross sectional area of the maniofld
          increases as does the volume of the inducted fuel charge, due
          to additional air being drawn through the annular space 32, as
          previously described. As a net result of this, greater and
          greater volumes of the air-fuel mixture are delivered to the
          atomizing screens into both passages 48 and 49 of the manifold
          with the full velocity of the charge being maintained at all
          times. The operation of the total delivery system including
          the atomizing valve and the divided manifold insures that the
          homogeneous dense and cool fuel charge mixture will never
          separate inside of the manifold before reaching the engine
          cylinders and thus all of the main drawbacks of the prior art
          delivery systems are overcome by the invention. Under
          conditions of maximum engine demand for fuel and air, the
          skirt 42 will descend sufficiently to entirely uncover both
          manifold passages 48 and 49 and the atomizing screen assembly
          will be spanning the full cross section of the manifold and a
          superatomized homogeneous fuel charge at full velocity without
          separation and with no wetting of the manifold walls will be
          equally delivered to all cylinders.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again, it should be stated
          and emphasized that the operation of the system does not
          require an external control, such as a microprocessor, and the
          engine itself delivers the necessary signal to the valve
          causing it to respond automatically with precisely the
          necessary gradient to satisfy the engine without diminishing
          operating efficiency at any demand condition. The atomizing
          valve is fully and automatically coordinated with the variable
          manifold passage through coaction of its skirt 42 with the
          divider wall 47 or plate, as described. In some instances, the
          plate 47 could be movably installed in the manifold 21 and
          yieldingly biased upwardly by spring means, not shown. In such
          cases, the divider plate 47 would gradually descend to
          increase or widen the manifold passage cross section
          responsive to engine demans for more fuel and air.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should also be emphasized
          that a very important benefit is realized from the widened
          jump space created between the bottom of interior sleeve 31
          and the wall defined by the two atomizing screens. The mixture
          will actually impact on the screens at supersonic speed due to
          being accelerated across the jump space. Superatomization to a
          near molecular particle state will result. At low engine
          demand or speed conditions, the velocity of the smaller volume
          atomized charge required to satisfy the demand will be
          increased by the smaller cross section of the upper passage 48
          in the manifold. Full manifold suction is now diverted to the
          upper passage 48 due to the blockage of the lower passage 49
          by skirt 42.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In conventional manifold
          systems, because of the large passage required to accommodate
          engine demand for maximum power, speed, acceleration or load,
          the system cannot react properly to diminish speed or demand
          and this causes undesirable separation of fuel from air in the
          charge. This separation is due to decreased velocity of the
          charge because the cross section of the manifold passage
          cannot change as with the present invention. The resulting
          manifold wetting due to fuel separation in the prior art
          destroys the correct balance of the air to fuel ratio.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Among the many important
          advantages achieved by the invention are the following:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1. Significantly increased
          mileage in automotive applications, as the result of a better
          atomized cold charge which increases the volumetric efficiency
          of the engine and promotes more complete combustion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. Pollutants in the engine
          exhaust are greatly reduced due to more complete and efficient
          combustion in every cylinder.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. Engine performance is
          markedly improved including the absence of missing, difficult
          starting particularly when the engine is cold, and the
          elimination of dieseling or engine run-on. Improved
          performance is the result of superatomization of a cold
          air-fuel charge, homogeneous mixing under all conditions, and
          automatic response of the system to engine demand without
          waste of fuel by charge separation in the manifold, and
          consequently with no cylinder starvation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4. In effect, the system
          increases the octane rating of a given fuel without chemical
          additives or lead. The improved valve creates an ideal uniform
          air-fuel mixture which causes air molecules to be intervened
          with fuel molecules in the atomized manifold charge. The
          intervening air acts in a manner similar to chemical additives
          or tetraethyl lead in retarding burning of the charge.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">5. A lower grade of crude
          oil can be successfully utilized for making engine fuel with
          significant savings at the refinery on a comparative basis
          with prior art fuel delivery arrangements which necessitate a
          more expensive higher grade crude.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">6. An engine utilizing this
          invention will idle smoothly at a much lower rpm than the
          usual 600-700 rpm at idle where state-of-the-art fuel delivery
          means are employed. A major reason for the greatly improved
          idle condition is the utilization of the varying cross section
          manifold, with about two-thirds of the manifold covered by the
          screen assembly skirt at idle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the improved variable
          atomizing valve has been disclosed in a free-floating
          arrangement within the manifold entrance, under the influence
          of a biasing spring, it should be understood that in some
          instances the movable screen assembly of the valve can be
          coupled with a control linkage for positive operation in
          various ways not shown in this application.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is to be understood that
          the forms of the invention herewith shown and described are to
          be taken as preferred examples of the same, and that various
          changes in the shape, size and arrangement of parts may be
          resorted to, without deparating from the spirit of the

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>An air-fuel mixture is delivered at a certain predetermined
        velocity through a pressure-regulated gate to a dual screen
        atomizer consisting of a first comparatively coarse mesh screen
        in contact with a finer mesh screen close to the throat of the

        the small micron range and a homogeneous charge is created in an
        enlarged plenum downstream from the dual screen atomizer.
        Pressure in the downstream plenum is reduced in comparison to
        the pressure existing in the fuel mixture delivery passage

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,820 and the above-referenced patent
        application disclose intake manifold fuel atomizing sleeve
        valves for piston engines whose use results in many benefits
        including increased fuel economy or mileage, reduced air
        pollution, much smoother engine operation over a wide RPM range,
        and others. </p>
      <p>The object of the present invention is to provide a pressure
        regulated air-fuel charge atomization device for a wide range of
        combustion systems including domestic and industrial heating
        apparatus, gas turbine engines and power plants and the like. </p>
      <p>In accomplishing these aims, a fuel atomization means is
        provided which will operate efficiently with a wide range of
        liquid fuels including industrial and home heating oils,
        kerosenes, gasolines and alcohols. </p>
      <p>The system employs an air-fuel charge which can be delivered to
        the pressure-regulated atomization means by any upstream mixing
        and metering device in accordance with the prior art. For
        example, a carburetor may be employed or various fuel injection
        means to deliver liquid fuel into an air stream may be employed.
        The fuel mixture is metered through a variable gate at a
        predetermined velocity, the throat of the gate being
        automatically adjusted to maintain this velocity by a regulator
        which senses upstream and downstream fuel charge pressures. The
        upstream pressure is always greater than the downstream
        pressure, because of a blocking effect of the atomization means.
        The downstream plenum for the homogeneous super-atomized charge
        is enlarged in comparison to the upstream fuel charge delivery
        passage ahead of the gate. </p>
      <p>The atomization means forming the heart of the invention
        consists of two screens in surface contact with each other
        immediately adjacent to the rear or downstream side of the
        adjustable gate and completely spanning the gate throat in all
        adjusted sizes of the latter. The homogeneous charge in the
        downstream enlarged plenum contains uniform size fuel particles
        in the small micron range, and due to the low pressure in the
        plenum and reduced velocity of the charge therein, any tendency
        for agglomeration of the charge resulting in surface wetting is
        substantially eliminated. The plenum downstream from the dual
        screen atomizer may be a manifold or other chamber means leading
        to any type of combustion device or forming a part of a
        combustion space where burning of the atomized fuel charge
        occurs, as in a jet engine. </p>
      <p>Other features and advantages of the invention will become
        apparent during the coarse of the following detailed
        description. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like numerals
        designate like parts, the numeral 10 designates an air-fuel
        charge delivery chamber or passage, such as the delivery throat
        of a carburetor or an air delivery conduit of a predetermined
        cross sectional size and shape. The passage 10 may be equipped
        with an adjustable throttling device 11, such as a butterfly
        valve. A suitable liquid fuel delivery tube 12 may be utilized
        to inject a fuel, such as oil or kerosene, into the passage 10
        downstream from the throttling device 11. A plurality of the
        tubes 12 can be utilized around the perimeter of the passage 10
        and other types of liquid fuel delivery means communicating with
        the passage 10 can be utilized. In all cases, the passage 10
        will deliver a mixed charge consisting of air and liquid fuel
        droplets downstream toward the atomization mechanism forming the
        main subject matter of the invention. </p>
      <p>A pressure-regulated automatically adjustable gate consisting
        of a movable gate component 13 and an opposing fixed component
        14 is arranged across the axis of the fuel charge delivery
        passage 10 at the downstream end of the latter. The gate
        components 13 and 14 define a variable width throat 15 through
        which the mixed charge flows at a predetermined velocity toward
        a dual atomizing screen assembly 16 forming the heart of the
        invention. This screen assembly consists of two separate screen
        elements 17 and 18 arranged in face-to-face contacting
        relationship over their full areas. The upstream screen 17 is of
        comparatively coarser mesh in the range of 20-90 mesh whereas
        the second downstream screen 18 of finer mesh is in the range of
        100-300 mesh. The two screens may be formed of stainless steel
        or other suitable material. The dual screen assembly is located
        closely adjacent to the downstream side of the adjustable gate,
        as shown. </p>
      <p>The two screen elements 17 and 18 are suitably joined at their
        peripheries and the screen assembly 16 is attached as at 19 to
        the wall or walls 20 of a downstream atomized fuel charge plenum
        20' or chamber of considerably larger cross sectional size than
        the upstream delivery passage 10. </p>
      <p>In passing through the dual atomizing screen assembly 16, the
        air-fuel mixture entering the plenum 20' is rendered uniform and
        homogeneous and the atomized liquid fuel particles are uniform
        in size and reduced in size to a small micron range. Probably a
        fuel droplet particle size of substantially less than 20 microns
        is obtained. </p>
      <p>The pressure in the delivery passage 10 is higher than the
        pressure within the larger plenum 20' because of the retarding
        or blocking effect of the adjustable gate and the atomizing
        screen assembly on the charge traveling downstream through the
        gate and screen assembly. This pressure differential is
        constantly sensed by a pressure regulator means 21 having a
        sensing tube 22 in communication with the plenum 20' and another
        sensing tube 23 in communication with the passage 10. </p>
      <p>The sensing tube 22 leads to parallel branches 24 and 25 in
        communication, respectively, with a chamber 26 below an elastic
        diaphragm 27 and a cylinder chamber 28 containing a
        servo-plunger 29. The servo-plunger 29 has two opposite end
        piston heads 30 within the cylinder chamber 28 and reduced end
        terminals 31 which are attached to the elastic diaphragm 27 and
        another diaphragm 32 at the far end of the plunger. </p>
      <p>A chamber 33 behind the diaphragm 32 communicates through the
        tube 23 with the delivery passage 10. The movable gate component
        13 is connected through a guided stem 34 with a diaphragm 35
        behind which is a chamber 36 in communication through a tube 37
        with the cylinder chamber 28 between the two piston heads 30.
        The diaphragm 36 is opposed by a calibrated spring 38 whose
        tension may be regulated by an adjuster 39. A similar spring 40
        opposes the diaphragm 27 and has its tension regulated by an
        adjuster 41 so that the pressure regulator 21 can be properly
        adjusted or calibrated. </p>
      <p>In the operation of the system, the regulator constantly senses
        the pressure differential between the delivery passage 10 and
        plenum 20' and automatically adjusts the throat 15 of the gate
        to maintain a predetermined velocity of the fuel charge through
        the throat. This assures that the fuel charge will impinge on
        the dual atomizing screen assembly with the correct velocity and
        energy to enable the two screens to effect the described
        super-atomization of the charge within the plenum 20'. </p>
      <p>The movement or velocity of the atomized charge in the plenum
        20' is greatly reduced compared to the upstream velocity and the
        pressure on the charge in the plenum 20' is reduced.
        Consequently, there is little or no tendency for agglomeration
        of the atomized fuel particles and the atomized charge will
        reach whatever ignition means the combustion system utilizes in
        the proper state for ideal ignition and burning in a most
        complete and efficient manner. </p>
      <p>As stated, the device can be used to supply an atomized fuel
        charge to a variety of combustion devices. Also, the invention
        may utilize a variety of liquid fuels ranging from heating oils
        through kerosenes and lighter components including gasolines and
        alcohols. </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the form of the invention herewith
        shown and described is to be taken as a preferred example of the
        same, and that various changes in the shape, size and
        arrangement of parts may be resorted to, without departing from
        the spirit of the invention or scope of the subjoined claims. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>Air or any other gas in a moving stream possessing kinetic
        energy is impinged on a foraminous barrier having a multitude of
        dissimilar adjacent nozzle orifices. Such impingement converts
        the kinetic energy of the stream to internal energy within the
        gas; and compression through the nozzle orifices of the
        foraminous barrier also increases the internal energy and
        reduces the pressure of the air or other gas (Bernoulli's
        principle), and greatly increases the downstream intensity of
        turbulence in the flowing air or gas. This treatment conditions
        the air, after its expansion in a processing chamber, to effect
        mixing with and rapid vaporization of liquid substances at low
        temperatures without the addition of external sensible heat, or
        with less external sensible heat, thus effecting savings of
        energy in many industrial, commercial and consumer applications.
        Typically, the foraminous barrier consists of two screens having
        appropriate characteristics pressed together in firm contact
        with their interstices randomly arranged. The foraminous barrier
        can be installed on diverse new and existing equipment. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The general objective of the present invention is to improve
        the operational efficiency of, and thus save energy in, many
        industrial, commercial and consumer energy conversion systems
        which require the introduction of air or other gases in
        comingling relationship with materials, including liquids,
        semi-liquids and other flowables. The invention is applicable to
        both combustion and non-combustion energy consuming processes of
        a highly diverse nature. </p>
      <p>In its essence, the present invention involves a thermodynamic
        treatment of air or any other gas in a manner whereby the air or
        gas has dramatically improved ability to initiate and rapidly
        complete vaporization of liquids at comparatively low
        temperatures (approximately 130.degree. F. for gasoline),
        without the addition of external sensible heat: and also has
        markedly increased ability to promote mixing with other
        materials due to increased scale of turbulence. Palmer, The
        Hydrodynamic Stability of Rapidly Evaporating Liquids at Reduced
        Pressure, Vol. 75, Part 3, JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS, 487-511,
        1976, and Bennett and Myers, Momentum, Heat, and Mass Transfer,
        2nd Ed., 1974, at 147-151 and 548-550. </p>
      <p>The above treatment of air or other gas is very simply obtained
        by causing a flowing stream of air or gas possessing kinetic
        energy to impinge on a foraminous barrier and pass through a
        matrix of dissimilar adjacent nozzle orifices in the barrier to
        a utilization space beyond the barrier where diverse material
        processing in energy consuming systems takes place. </p>
      <p>Upon impingement at the foraminous barrier, the kinetic energy
        of the stream is converted to internal energy within the air or
        gas. After being compressed through the nozzle matrix provided
        within the barrier, which further increases its internal energy,
        the pressure of the flowing stream is markedly reduced
        (Bernoulli's principle). The adiabatic expansion of the air or
        gas upon leaving the nozzle orifices increases its ability to
        transfer its unusually high internal energy to another
        comingling medium in the processing chamber which aids in
        initiating and completing low temperature vaporization
        (differential vaporization). Pierce, Microscopic Thermodynamics,
        1968, at pages 46-50, 284-285 and 303; Palmer and Maheshri,

        1734-1736, 1969; and Collins, Flow of Fluids Through Porous
        Materials, 1961, at pages 246-248. Simultaneously, the intensity
        of turbulence of air or gas exiting the nozzle matrix of the
        foraminous barrier is drastically increased, without reducing
        the scale of turbulence, which promotes unusually rapid
        vaporization, drying or oxidization of another medium in the
        processing space downstream from the barrier, namely, a liquid,
        semi-liquid, paste or other flowable; and also enables thorough
        mixing with such medium, Palmer (supra); Bennett and Myers
        (supra); and Pope and Goin, High-Speed Wind Tunnel Testing,
        99-102, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York; and Miyashita et
        al., Flow Behavior and Augmentation of the Mass Transfer Rate in
        a Rectangular Duct with a Turbulence Promoter, Vol. 21, No. 4,
        INTERNATIONAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, 646-651, October, 1981. </p>
      <p>Typically, the foraminous barrier employed in the thermodynamic
        treatment of air or gas consists of two screen sections, one
        relatively coarse and one relatively fine, in a mesh number
        ratio of approximately 0.375:1. The coarser screen section is
        placed upstream relative to the air or gas flow path and the
        finer screen section is placed downstream. The two screen
        sections are pressed together into firm contact with their
        interstices and apertures randomly arranged. In situations where
        it is not desired to promote mixing of the treated air or gas
        with another medium, the interstices of the two screen sections
        are arranged symmetrically with the screen apertures in
        registration. In this case, the mesh number ratio is
        approximately 0.5:1 to enable proper aperture registration. The
        mesh number ratio of 0.375:1 where mixing is desired is chosen
        to assure that the apertures of the two screen sections cannot
        register when the screen sections are pressed together randomly.
      </p>
      <p>The utilization of two screen sections only in the mesh number
        ratio specified to promote mixing and rapid, low temperature
        vaporization, drying or oxidization is critical in the invention
        and a significant departure from this arrangement will destroy
        substantially the utility of the foraminous barrier. For
        example, a single screen of any mesh number will not function
        properly because, when intensity of turbulence increases as mesh
        number increases, scale of turbulence decreases inversely. Scale
        of turbulence is the factor which promotes mixing, whereas
        intensity of turbulence promotes rapid vaporization. Therefore,
        when both of these factors are essential to a given process, the
        dual screen arrangement specified above must be used, Bennett
        and Myers (supra), and Pruppacher and Rasmussen, A Wind Tunnel
        Investigation of the Rate of Evaporation, JOURNAL OF THE
        ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, 1257-1258, July, 1979. </p>
      <p>The two screen sections which form the foraminous barrier are
        advantageously formed of stainless steel, but in some cases, can
        be formed from other materials including other metals and
        synthetics. The screen sections or the strands from which they
        are woven may be coated with a catalyst in order to promote the
        desired chemical effect. In still other cases, the foraminous
        barrier can consist of two porous membranes of natural or
        synthetic materials or can be formed by a pair of contacting
        perforated plates having, respectively, matrixes of relatively
        coarse and relatively fine square apertures corresponding to the
        required mesh number ratio stated above, approximately 0.375:1.
      </p>
      <p>It should be stated that significant benefits for the
        environment are derived from the invention. This is due to the
        fact that processes carried out at relatively low temperatures
        produces significantly less pollutants, such as nitrous oxide,
        compared to processes carried out at higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>Examples of other gases, in addition to air, which might be
        treated in accordance with the invention are carbon dioxide,
        oxygen and nitrogen. </p>
      <p>As suggested previously, thermodynamically conditioned air or
        gas in accordance with the invention lends itself to a wide
        variety of uses. One of the most widespread applications of the
        invention is the spray drying process, where it is believed the
        invention will constitute a major advance in the art. The scope
        of application of spray drying and hence the diverse application
        of the invention is well defined by Masters, Spray Drying, 2nd
        Ed., 1976, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. This publication,
        and U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,617, describe essentially a one step
        suspended particle process wherein the feed is a solution,
        suspension or paste. The resulting dried product conforms to
        powders, granules or agglomerates. The above-referenced spray
        drying publication and patent both describe introducing external
        sensible heat into air before the latter is blown into the
        drying process chamber. A substantial reduction of such external
        heat, if not complete elimination of it in some cases, with
        resultant conservation of energy, is achieved by placing the
        foraminous barrier in accordance with this invention across the
        flow path of air or other gas entering the chamber, very
        slightly upstream from the orifice of the feed nozzle. </p>
      <p>The unusually high internal energy of the entering nozzled air,
        its low pressure, and its high intensity of turbulence developed
        by passing through the foraminous barrier, combine to effect
        rapid complete vaporization of the liquid content of the feed,
        thorough and rapid mixing of the nozzled air with feed
        particles, or more rapid drying with substantially less energy
        expended. To achieve these multiple benefits, the temperature of
        the incoming air or gas need only be 5.degree.-25.degree. F.
        above the dew point temperature of the particular liquid feed. </p>
      <p>Another important application of the invention lies potentially
        in water desalinization by using the foraminous barrier to
        upgrade flash vaporization to differential vaporization in one
        or more stages of the system, Howe, Fundamentals of Water
        Desalination, 1974, pages 67-72 and 149-154. </p>
      <p>Another important application of the invention lies in the
        field of sewage treatment where the foraminous barrier of the
        invention can be placed across incoming air streams of such
        systems. </p>
      <p>Other practical applications of the present invention include
        fluidized bed heat exchangers of the types shown in U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 4,307,773, 4,272,895 and 4,226,830; material treatment
        systems of the type shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,109,394; food
        roasting systems as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,964,175: and
        fluid bed driers for foods and other products, U.S. Pat. No.
        3,849,900. Other examples of practical uses of the invention are
        mentioned hereinafter. Such uses are almost without limit, and
        it should be understood that the principle of the invention is
        applicable to any system where it is required or desirable to
        achieve rapid low temperature vaporization, together with
        thorough and continuous mixing of a product or product component
        with air or other gas, without the necessity of applying great
        amounts of external sensible heat to the air or gas or to the
        product being processed. </p>
      <p>Other features and advantages of the invention will become
        apparent during the course of the following detailed

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings in detail wherein like numerals
        designate like parts, attention is directed first to FIGS. 1-5
        showing screen components which form a foraminous barrier
        comprising the essence of the invention. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 1, a preferably stainless steel screen section 20 of
        any required size and shape has a mesh number for many important
        applications in the range of 30-60 (holes per inch). It should
        be understood that the mesh numbers specified herein may vary
        depending upon particular applications of the invention. For
        example, small scale applications, including medical,
        pharmaceutical and biological, may require mesh numbers above
        the typical ranges specified while large industrial
        applications, such as blast furnaces and fluidized bed
        gasification reactors, may require mesh numbers below the ranges
        stated above. The screen section 20 is the coarser of two screen
        sections employed to produce a foraminous barrier in this
        invention. </p>
      <p>A companion screen section 21, FIG. 2, preferably formed of
        stainless steel, has a mesh number in the range of 90-240. This
        screen section is the finer of the two making up the foraminous
        barrier, and is always placed at the downstream face of the
        barrier, in relation to a stream of air or gas impinging on the
        barrier. </p>
      <p>The two described screen sections 20 and 21 are usually
        installed flat for most uses but can be installed vertically,
        horizontally or at any intermediate angle across an air or gas
        stream. In some cases, however, the screens forming the barrier
        may be cylindrical or in other bent forms to meet the needs of a
        particular situation. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3a shows the two screen sections 20 and 21 assembled in
        face-to-face firm contact with their apertures 22 and 23 and
        interstices randomly arranged on three axes to form in the
        barrier and through it a multitude of dissimilar adjacent nozzle
        orifices. For the typical mesh numbers specified above, suitable
        for many industrial and commercial applications, the preferred
        ratio of the mesh number of screen 20 to the mesh number of
        screen 21 is approximately 0.375:1. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3b shows the screen sections 20 and 21 pressed together
        with their apertures and interstices randomly disposed or offset
        on two orthogonal axes only, without rotation on the third axis.
        The arrangement in FIG. 3a is preferable in some commercial
        applications. While all screen apertures are shown square, in
        some cases the apertures of the finer screen 21 could be oblong
        along one axis only without disturbing the desired mode of
        operation. However, the mesh number of the finer screen must be
        as specified herein along at least one orthogonal axis. Also,
        the coarser screen 20 must always form the upstream face of the
        foraminous barrier. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows the two screen sections 20 and 21 pressed together
        firmly and randomly with the coarser screen 20 on the upstream
        side of the barrier and the finer screen 21 in the downstream
        side relative to the air or gas flow path. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows a variant of the invention where the screen
        sections 20 and 21 are pressed together symmetrically with their
        apertures 22 and 23 in coaxial registration, rather than
        randomly disposed. When this situation prevails, the ratio of
        the mesh number of screen 20 to the mesh number of screen 21 is
        approximately 0.5:1. This mesh number ratio enables screen
        aperture registration as shown in FIG. 5, wherein the previously
        stated mesh number ratio of 0.375:1 precludes complete aperture
        registration in the random aperture situation shown in FIG. 3a.
        The arrangement of the screen sections shown in FIGS. 3a and 3b
        is necessary when vaporization and mixing are desired, while the
        arrangement in FIG. 5 is employed when it is desired to achieve
        vaporization, drying or oxidization without promoting mixing of
        air or gas with a product. Except for the reduced mixing, the
        barrier structure in FIG. 5 possesses the same advantages as the
        structures of FIGS. 3a and 3b, as regards converting kinetic
        energy to internal energy and producing low temperature
        vaporization. However, the arrangement in FIG. 5 reduces the
        scale of turbulence and therefore does not create as much mixing
        in a processing space as the mixing obtained with the randomly
        assembled dual screens shown in FIGS. 3a and 3b. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 illustrates one of the most widespread commercial
        applications of the invention, namely, spray drying. Spray
        drying is essentially a one step continuous suspended particle
        drying process which finds application in a wide variety of
        industries, as described in Masters (supra). </p>
      <p>In FIG. 6, a spray drying system includes a drying chamber 24
        receiving at one end thereof an atomized product spray delivered
        by a nozzle means 25. Substantially dew point temperature air in
        a flowing stream possessing kinetic energy is separately
        delivered to the chamber 24 through a manifold 26 coaxial with
        and surrounding feed nozzle means 25. A foraminous barrier 27
        consisting of the two screen sections 20 and 21 as described in
        connection with FIG. 3 is placed very slightly upstream from the
        outlet of the orifice in nozzle means 25, so as to treat air or
        gas entering the drying chamber 24 from the manifold 26 without
        similarly treating the atomized feed delivered by the nozzle
        means 25. </p>
      <p>The unusually high internal energy of the air discharged from
        the foraminous barrier 27, its reduced pressure, and its
        increased intensity of turbulence, combine to greatly enhance
        the one step spray drying process and allow a substantial
        savings in energy compared to prior art practice where the air
        temperature is externally increased to well above 200.degree.
        F., Masters, Spray Drying (supra) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,617. </p>
      <p>In a generally similar manner, the foraminous barrier according
        to the invention, in whatever size and shape is required, can be
        installed at strategic locations in a great variety of
        industrial, commercial and consumer equipment, to improve the
        operational efficiency of the same, and reduce considerably the
        consumption of external energy to increase temperature. Notable
