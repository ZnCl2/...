      I'm always amazed at the ability of the "Gizars" to spot
      intriguing information, especially if it concerns technologies
      that don't normally "show up on the radar" of the lamestream
      corporate controlled media, nor, for that matter, on the radar of
      the alternative research field. But L.G.R. spotted this one, and
      passed it along.<br>
      <br>
      And it's a doozie...<br>
      <br>
      Oh, did we mention, it's capable of a little solar manipulation as
      well?:<br>
      <br>
      ...as well as counteracting the effects of solar-induced Coronal
      Mass Ejections... (Paragraph 0012)<br>
      <br>
      Presumably it will do all this by generating electromagnetic
      fields, which, to accomplish all these feats, would have to be
      extraordinarily strong, but not to worry, because the "the design
      of energy generation machinery with power output levels much
      higher than those currently achievable by conventional means, is
      made possible with this invention."(Paragraph (0012)<br>
      <br>
      At this point, the patent goes on to outline how it's going to do
      all of this, and lo and behold, it does so by spinning a plasma,
      utilizing shells in a sphere of peizoelectric ceramics doped with
      radioactive materials. Of course, I'm over-simplifying, but the
      end result of all of this is that this creates the Mossbauer
      Effect of vibrationally stimulated and cohered releases of gamma
      rays. All of <b>this, according to paragraph 30, will generate
        field strengths per square meter of (get this)
        10,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo to
        100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 watts. That's ten
        septillion to one hundred octillion watts.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Per square meter.</b><br>
      <br>
      I dunno about you, but this seems to me to be quite a lot of
      deflection. Maybe even enough to "grab and throw"; it's a handy
      thing to have around to "snag" an asteroid, mine it, and then
      throw it away. And you could make it do double duty: when you're
      done mining it, you could throw it at someone you don't like...<br>
      <br>
      See you on the flip side...<br>

      I'm curious what any physicists here have to say.<br>
      <br>
      I'm guessing that this superconductor concept hasn't actually been
      reduced to a prototype. Unfortunately, per the USPTO, "[a]n

      &nbsp;Given that government-created documents are put in the

      </b><b>STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0001] The invention described herein may be manufactured and
      used by or for the Government of the United States of America for
      governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or
      therefor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] To date there are more than 100,000 potentially dangerous
      asteroids (Near Earth Objects) which cross the earth's orbit, with
      only 11,000 having been cataloged and currently tracked. Earth
      will be impacted again and again; it is only a matter of time and
      circumstance. Therefore, there is a need for an effective method
      to deflect or destroy these potentially dangerous asteroids.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Currently, several methods of asteroid deflection have been
      suggested. They include an electrostatic tractor, which utilizes
      two continuous voltage sources (20 kV each) placed on both a
      spacecraft and the asteroid itself (one source to each), and would
      use the produced electrostatic fields to either slowly attract or
      repel the asteroid, and a gravity tractor which would park a
      spacecraft close enough to the asteroid so that the gravitational
      attraction would in time affect its trajectory. Other methods
      suggested include possibly utilizing the earth's magnetic field
      (electrodynamic tethers) with an electrostatic tractor for further
      deflection capability, or shooting white paint pellets at the
      asteroid making it pale enough to couple with the solar radiation
      in a high reflectivity/photonic momentum ‘push’ mode. The kinetic
      method of deflection has also been suggested. This deflection
      method would propel a sizeable craft into a tangential trajectory
      to the asteroid, impacting it with a 10 km/s relative velocity
      (thus adding to its angular momentum and creating a deflecting
      spin). Thermonuclear warheads may also be used to destroy the
      incoming asteroid, which may, however, result in fragmentation and
      thermonuclear pollution.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The techniques described above would only affect “small”
      asteroids, on the average diameter levels of approximately 100
      meters. Also, these deflection methods would need a great deal of
      time to affect the desired outcomes (10 to 20 years have been
      suggested), with the exception of the kinetic method, which has
      issues in accuracy of targeting and subsequent impact
      effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] There are four known fundamental forces which control
      matter and therefore control energy, namely strong nuclear force,
      weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force, and gravitational
      force. In this hierarchy of forces, the electromagnetic force is
      perfectly positioned to be able to manipulate the other three. A
      stationary electric charge gives rise to an electric
      (electrostatic) field, while a moving charge generates both an
      electric and a magnetic field (hence the electromagnetic field).
      Additionally, an accelerating charge induces electromagnetic
      radiation in the form of transverse waves, namely light.
      Mathematically, as well as physically, electromagnetic field
      intensity can be represented as the product of electric field
      strength and magnetic field strength. Electromagnetic fields act
      as carriers for both energy and momentum, thus interacting with
      physical entities at the most fundamental level (in this manner
      addressing the feasibility of countering the Earth-bound Asteroid
      Threat).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Artificially generated high energy electromagnetic fields
      interact strongly with the Vacuum Energy Field (an aggregate state
      composed of the superposition of all quantum fields' fluctuations
      permeating the fabric of Spacetime), thereby giving rise to
      Emergent Physical Phenomena (in other words revolutionary
      physics), such as Force and Matter Fields Unification. According
      to Quantum Field Theory, this strong interaction between the
      fields is based on the mechanism of transfer of vibrational energy
      between the fields, further inducing local fluctuations in
      adjacent quantum fields which permeate Spacetime (these fields may
      or may not be electromagnetic in nature).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Everything that surrounds us, ourselves included, can be
      described as macroscopic collections of fluctuations, vibrations,
      and/or oscillations in quantum mechanical fields. Therefore, under
      certain conditions (such as the coupling of hyper-frequency axial
      spin with hyper-frequency vibrations of electrically charged
      systems) the rules and special effects of quantum field behavior
      also apply to macroscopic physical entities. Along this line of
      thought, lightning can be explained as a Macroscopic Quantum
      Phenomenon which arises due to millions of ice particle collisions
      within storm clouds (thus giving rise to a sizeable electric
      charge), which generate electromagnetic fields locally interacting
      with the Vacuum Energy Field. Thus, the physics of lightning can
      be explained by extremely strong interactions between classical
      electromagnetic fields (storm clouds exhibiting 100 MV voltages
      and rapid air currents) and the quantum fields'
      superposition-induced Vacuum Energy Field.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Moreover, simultaneous coupling of hyper-frequency
      gyrational (axial rotation) and hyper-frequency vibrational
      electrodynamics (as used in the inventive concept herein
      disclosed) is conducive to a possible physical breakthrough (Force
      and Matter Fields Unification is feasible with the concept at
      hand) in the utilization of the Quantum Vacuum Plasma (part of the
      Vacuum Energy Field) as an energy source (or sink), an induced
      physical phenomenon, for which the technology readiness level has
      been considerably advanced by a team of research engineers from
      NASA JSC. Their research involves the use of high Radio
      frequency/Microwave driven resonant cavity Q-thruster technology
      within the context of Quantum Vacuum Plasma physics.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] The preferred embodiments of the present invention are
      illustrated by way of example below and in FIGS. 1-4. The high
      energy electromagnetic field generator 10 includes a shell 100, an
      electrostatic generator 200, a nuclear pebble bed reactor 300 (a
      power plant), a thermoelectric generator 400, and an electric
      motor 500. The shell 100 has embedded polycrystalline
      ferroelectric ceramic material which is polarized such that the
      ceramic material exhibits strong Piezoelectric Effect properties
      thus inducing high frequency vibrations. It is important to
      decouple the shell's Piezoelectric vibrational frequency from any
      natural resonant frequency of the system's structural framework,
      which may cause diminution of structural integrity and possibly
      lead to destruction of the system. The electrostatic generator 200
      is for charging up the shell 100 and is disposed within the shell
      100. The nuclear fission pebble bed reactor 300 is to generate
      thermal power, and is disposed within the shell 100. The
      thermoelectric generator 400 is to convert the thermal power
      generated by the nuclear fission pebble bed reactor 300 to
      electrical energy. The electric motor 500 is powered by the
      electrical energy generated by the thermoelectric generator 400,
      and supplies input voltage such that the shell 100 spins at high
      angular speeds, vibrates at high frequencies, and generates an
      electromagnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the description of the present invention, the invention
      will be discussed in a space, sea, or terrestrial environment;
      however, this invention can be utilized for any type of
      application that requires use of electromagnetic field generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The shell 100 may be spherical, hemispherical, or a disc.
      The spherical shell 100, shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, may be used when
      utilizing the apparatus in space (space based system). The
      hemispherical shell 105, shown in FIG. 3, may be utilized at sea
      (sea based system), while the disc shell 110, shown in FIG. 4, may
      be utilized on land (terrestrial system). As shown in FIGS. 1 and
      2, in the space based system, the nuclear pebble bed reactor 300,
      the thermoelectric generator 400, and the electric motor 500 have
      an annular configuration.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Extremely high electromagnetic field intensity (rate of
      energy flow per unit area) values of 10&lt;24 &gt;Watts/m&lt;2
      &gt;(and higher) can be generated with the inventive concept at
      hand. Furthermore, using a specially engineered geometrical
      configuration (a sharp end protrusion 125 out of the shell) in
      conjunction with the terrestrial (land) or sea based systems, by
      coupling the Piezoelectric Effect with the Mossbauer Effect (the
      recoilless emission of gamma rays due to high frequency
      oscillations/vibrations of the shell), it is possible to generate
      a Cyclonic Plasma shield, which would greatly amplify the produced
      electromagnetic field intensity (hence the shielding effects).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The shell 100, 105, 110 may further include embedded
      radioactive elements, such that high frequency vibrations generate
      high energy gamma rays. The shell 100, 105, 110 may be fabricated
      from epoxy-ceramic composite embedded within an aluminum matrix.
      Embedded within the shell 100, 105, 110 are crystal modules that
      are made from polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramic material. In
      the preferred embodiment, the ceramic material is lead zirconate
      titanate (PZT) which has been polarized. In operation, voltage
      from the electric motor 500 is applied to the PZT crystal modules,
      which generates mechanical vibrations of the shell, further
      inducing an output voltage at the natural resonant frequency of
      the crystal modules. For optimal results, the inside of the shell
      is pressurized to about 20 bar with dry and purified sulfur
      hexafluoride or mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] As shown in FIG. 1, in the spherical shell embodiment or
      space based configuration of the invention, all the elements of
      the electromagnetic field generator 10 may be housed or disposed
      within the shell 100. As a result, the elements of the
      electromagnetic field generator 10 with a spherical shell 100 do
      not exhibit or are affected by the electrostatic field which is
      built up on the shell surface due to the high voltage electrical
      charging. Therefore, the entire electromagnetic energy flux
      density is directed outward of the shell 100, for maximum EM
      linear momentum density-driven deflection of an object, such as,
      but without limitation, an earth bound asteroid or any type of
      incoming object or projectile.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the spherical shell embodiment
      may also include a support structure 101 to mount all the elements
      within the spherical sphere 100. The support structure 101 may be
      coupled using low friction bearings 102 so that the support
      structure 101 along with all the elements within the spherical
      sphere 100 can rotate within the spherical sphere 100. The
      electric motor 500 imparts mechanical power via its drive shaft to
      a cruciform strut framework 103, which is directly attached to the
      inside of the spherical shell 100. Since the spherical shell 100
      exhibits a high electrical charge, in the preferred embodiment,
      the strut framework 103 is made out of non-electrically conducting
      material which possesses high yield strength, such as a tightly
      packed network of grapheme and carbon nanotubes or carbon
      reinforced graphite epoxy composite. However, any type of material
      that is practicable can be utilized. Additive manufacturing
      techniques may be used for fabricating this structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In another embodiment of the invention, the
      ceramic-aluminum composite material of the spherical shell 100 may
      be doped with radioactive elements, such as, but without
      limitation, Cobalt-57, Iron-57, or any other radioactive metal
      element that is practicable. High frequency vibrations of the
      shell will consequently induce the Mossbauer Effect, namely the
      recoilless emission of gamma rays. This embodiment may also be
      used with the hemispherical shell 105 and the disc shell 110.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The spherical shell embodiment or space based configuration
      of the invention may also include an auxiliary propulsion unit
      (not shown) for guiding the apparatus to the region of perceived
      threat. The auxiliary propulsion unit may be chemical, nuclear
      based, or any type of propulsion unit practicable. The auxiliary
      propulsion unit may be housed or enclosed in a Faraday-type cage.
      Since there is no counter-torque mechanism provided for the
      spinning shell, the apparatus will experience a curvilinear
      translation (displacement due to conservation of angular momentum)
      similar to a spinning top. The auxiliary propulsion unit can take
      advantage of this motion in executing maneuvers. In another
      embodiment (not shown), it is also possible to eliminate the
      system's displacement from a fixed point in space, by having the
      spherical shell 100 be two counter-rotating hemispherical shells.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, in the preferred embodiments as
      described earlier, both the hemispherical shell 105 and the disc
      shell 110 may have a sharp point protrusion or spike 125 extending
      from the shell 105, 110. In operation, in the immediate area of
      the protrusion or spike 125, the air is subjected to a great deal
      of electrostatic stress, which then ionizes the air. The
      electromagnetic fields that are generated by the apparatus 10 then
      accelerate the ionized air, thus inducing corona (electric, ionic)
      winds, which are further augmented by the entrainment of neutral
      air around the ionized region. The ionized air and neutral air are
      mixed, and the mixed air starts to rotate resulting in a cyclonic
      plasma, which creates an additional shield for the shell 105, 110.
      For the land and sea based systems the nuclear power plant may be
      replaced with a gas turbine engine. However, in all the
      embodiments of the current invention, any type of power plant
      practicable can be utilized.<br>

      [0028] The preferred electrostatic generator(s) 200 is a Pelletron
      type, and may be a modified Van de Graaff generator. In a
      Pelletron generator, the charging belt is replaced with a chain
      made of metal pellets or plates connected by insulating links,
      whereby the metal plates are charged using the effect of influence
      in an electrical field.<br>

      [0029] Quantum Vacuum Plasma (QVP) is the electric glue of our
      plasma Universe. The Casimir Effect, the Lamb Shift, and
      Spontaneous Emission, are specific confirmations of the existence
      of QVP. It is important to note that in region(s) where the
      apparatus-generated electromagnetic fields are strongest, the
      interactions with the QVP are more potent, therefore, the higher
      the induced energy density of the QVP particles which spring into
      existence (the Dirac Sea of electrons and positrons). These QVP
      particles form an additional defensive layer around the system,
      thus augmenting the shielding effects (even though they are
      short-lived, these “virtual” particles have a real effect). In
      operation, the high energy electromagnetic fields, created by the
      system, interact strongly with the Vacuum Energy Field (the
      aggregate state of all quantum fields' fluctuations
      superposition), and locally disrupt Spacetime. Contributions to
      the Vacuum Energy Density are made by the Quantum Vacuum-Zero
      Point Fluctuations, the Quantum Chromo-Dynamics gluon and quark
      condensates, and the newly discovered Higgs Field (exhibiting
      massive 126 GeV particles), among other yet undiscovered fields
      (arising from Super-Symmetry).<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The primary physical equation which describes the maximum
      intensity achieved by the system is described by the magnitude of
      the Poynting vector, and in relativistic form (derived using
      relativistic electrodynamics/electromagnetic field theory) can be
      written as<br>
      <br>
      Smax=fG?&lt;2&gt;(s&lt;2&gt;/e0)[Rr?+Rvv+vR]&nbsp; (Equation 1)<br>
      <br>
      where fG is the geometric shape factor (equal to 2/3 for spherical
      shell, 1/6 for hemispherical shell and 1 for disc), ? is the
      relativistic ‘stretch’ factor ‘gamma,’ s is the surface charge
      density, (total charge divided by surface area), e0 is the
      electrical permittivity of free space, Rr is the radius of
      rotation, ? is the angular frequency of rotation in rads/s, Rv is
      the vibration (harmonic oscillation) amplitude, v is the angular
      frequency of vibration in Hertz, and the term vR is the
      curvilinear translation speed (acquired via a propulsive unit
      attached to the system, or by the system itself if not equipped
      with a counter-torque mechanism, similar to the curvilinear motion
      of a spinning top). Therefore, for example, and without
      limitation, if we consider only rotation, given a spherical shell
      configuration, with s=50,000 Coulombs/m&lt;2&gt;, a spherical
      shell (spinning/axially rotating) radius of 2 m and an angular
      speed of 30,000 RPM, we can generate an electromagnetic (EM) field
      intensity (Smax=rate of energy flow per unit area) value of
      10&lt;24 &gt;Watts/m&lt;2 &gt;(this value does not account for any
      QVP interactions which would amplify it). Furthermore, if we
      simultaneously couple the high frequency of rotation with high
      vibration (abrupt pulsations/harmonic oscillations) frequencies in
      the range of 10&lt;9 &gt;to 10&lt;18 &gt;Hertz (and above) we can
      obtain Smax intensity values in the range 10&lt;24 &gt;to 10&lt;28
      &gt;Watts/m&lt;2 &gt;(and beyond). These extremely high
      electromagnetic field intensity values emphasize the novelty of
      this concept, especially suited for deflection of Earth-bound
      asteroids.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] For the case of an accelerating angular frequency of
      vibration (amax=Rvv&lt;2&gt;), neglecting rotation and curvilinear
      translation, Equation 1 becomes (note the intrinsic significance
      of angular vibration acceleration):<br>
      <br>
      Smax=fG?&lt;2&gt;(s&lt;2&gt;/e0)[(Rvv&lt;2&gt;)top]&nbsp;
      (Equation 2)<br>
      <br>
      where top is the operational time for which the charged electrical
      system is accelerating. Strong local interaction with the high
      energetics of the Quantum Vacuum fields' fluctuations
      superposition (macroscopic Vacuum Energy state) is possible in a
      laboratory environment, by application of high frequency gyration
      and/or high frequency vibration of minimally charged objects (of
      unit order), in an acceleration mode. In this manner, a high
      degree of Vacuum Energy polarization can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Force and Matter Fields Unification is feasible with the
      invention at hand, due to the extremely strong interactions
      (electromagnetic in nature) between ordinary matter and the
      Quantum Vacuum Plasma/Vacuum Energy Field (interactions which
      exhibit extremely high energies on Planck length scales in the
      immediate proximity of the shell surface). These interactions are
      induced by the simultaneous coupling of hyper-frequency of axial
      rotation (spin) and hyper-frequency of vibration (harmonic
      oscillations/pulsations) of electrically charged systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Up to this point in time, the method of choice to protect
      Earth from an impact or air-burst meteor event is a kinetic
      impactor. In the case of Apophis (a potentially dangerous known
      asteroid), consider its mass (MA) on the order of 10&lt;10 &gt;kg,
      while the mass of the envisioned spacecraft (MKI) which acts as
      kinetic impactor is on the order of 10&lt;3 &gt;kg. From
      conservation of linear momentum we can write:<br>
      <br>
      (MA+MKI)?v=k(MKI)(uKI)&nbsp; (Equation 3)<br>
      <br>
      where ?v is the deflection speed of the asteroid once the impactor
      spacecraft collides with it, while uKI is the relative speed of
      the kinetic impactor with respect to the asteroid; and k is the
      impact coefficient (which is taken as 1, namely 100% impact
      effectiveness is considered). Using the nominal value for uKI of
      10 km/s, the deflection speed is calculated as 0.001 m/s. In case
      of the high energy EM field-generating system, the right hand side
      of Equation 3 becomes [(Smax/c&lt;2&gt;)VolS], where c is the
      speed of light in free space, therefore, using an Smax value of
      10&lt;24 &gt;W/m&lt;2 &gt;(readily achievable, as previously
      shown) and a system volume (VolS) of 10&lt;3 &gt;m&lt;3&gt;, the
      deflection speed becomes 1 m/s, a three orders of magnitude
      improvement.<br>

      [0034] The method for generating a ultrahigh intensity
      electromagnetic field includes charging a shell with embedded
      polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramic material such that the
      material has strong Piezoelectric Effect properties thus inducing
      high frequency vibrations, generating thermal power, converting
      the thermal power to electrical energy, and spinning the charged
      shell via the electrical energy such that an electromagnetic field
      is generated.<br>

      A high-frequency gravitational wave generator including a
      gas-filled shell with an outer shell surface, microwave emitters,
      sound generators, and acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled
      cavities. The outer shell surface is electrically charged and
      vibrated by the microwave emitters to generate a first
      electromagnetic field. The acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled
      cavities each have a cavity surface that can be electrically
      charged and vibrated by acoustic energy from the sound generators
      such that a second electromagnetic field is generated. The two
      acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled cavities are able to
      counter spin relative to each other to provide stability, and
      propagating gravitational field fluctuations are generated when
