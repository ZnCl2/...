      <p><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>By publishing this very simple circuit, I would like to give
        the amateurs, the occasion to prove that the electric extraction
        of power of the vacuum exists indeed. The goal of my letter is
        to make known my work and to help to develop quantum generators
        for the use of people and industries. I decided to make public a
        first circuit, and the amateurs will be able to try out it. “ </p>
      <p>My name is Jean Z. Szili. All my life, I worked in scientific
        research. For seven years, I have been retired. </p>
      <p>I lived thirteen years in France. Five years in Lyon and eight
        years in Paris. In Paris, I worked at the University of Orsay in
        Plasma physics. I was born in Hungary. I emigrated in Canada
        (Quebec) in 1969 and I found work with the Institute of Search
        for Hydro Quebec in the field of scientific research. I remained
        twenty-eight years until my retirement there. </p>
      <p>One day, at the restaurant of the institute, I had sat with a
        table opposite two engineers and their guest, specialists in the
        transformers. I listened to the conversation, and the engineers
        said to their guest, that they could calculate the parameters of
        the transformers with an accuracy of 0.1%, but which they always
        find 2% excess electric output. This surplus of electric output
        remains unexplainable while taking account of ohmic losses etc </p>
      <p>I left the restaurant by thinking that these 2% of power in
        excess could come from an unknown source. </p>
      <p>A few years later, I took note of the theory of the Zero Point
        Energy (ZPE). I supposed that it should be possible to extract
        part of this phenomenal energy. Since my retirement, I work
        intensely to find circuits electronic which could extract from
        the ZPE. Quickly, I left side the work of laboratory for
        computer simulation, in order to accelerate my work. I tested
        thousands of circuits before finding one and then several of
        these "over-unity" circuits. </p>
      <p><b>Working method</b> </p>
      <p>When an unknown field is explored, one must use the empirical
        groping. Gradually, one learns how to know this new unknown
        world of science and to use this new knowledge to find circuits
        increasingly powerful. </p>
      <p>Currently, I know rather well how to extract the ZPE. The power
        of my circuits goes from a few milliwatts to more than one
        hundred kilowatts. These circuits must be fed to function, but
        at the exit of the circuits, the profits of power (COP = energy
        of exit/input) can be very high. The profit or COP can be 2, 10,
        100, 1000 and even more. </p>
      <p>In these simulations, I always used electronic components
        existing in the trade. That can facilitate the realization of
        these circuits at the laboratory. This work however remains to
        be made. </p>
      <p>First of all, this circuit was developed on a simulation
        program on computer. What makes it possible to carry out
        simulation, it is the Jiles-Atherton Model of electromagnetism.
        This model was designed to respect experimental reality and not
        the law of conservation of energy. I cannot give of guarantee
        with regard to the correct operation of this circuit, but until
        proof of the opposite, let us make confidence with simulation.
        This program is used everywhere throughout the world in the
        electronic and physical laboratories. It is very close to
        experimental reality even if in 99.999% of the cases out of 100
        energy is preserved. “ </p>
      <p><b>The Mechanism of extraction</b> </p>
      <p>“There are special conditions so that there is extraction of
        energy of the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. </p>
      <p>The mechanism of extraction, in my opinion, is based on
        ferromagnetic resonance. The free electrons exchange energy with
        virtual electrons of the vacuum. Normally this exchange is
        perfectly symmetrical. Result: No the extraction of energy. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the electrons are fermions, and in quantum mechanics,
        two electrons cannot be in the same state. </p>
      <p>It results a very broad dispersion from it from the
        ferromagnetic frequency of resonance, which one could call
        semi-collective. This resonance is between a few hundred MHz and
        some GHz. Nevertheless, the circuits function at a frequency
        lower than one MHz. On the other hand the circuit must be built
        like a functioning circuit at least with 25 MHz. It is necessary
        to avoid the loops, to use component adequate etc </p>
      <p>In these circuits, it is necessary to use special methods to
        make the energy exchange asymmetrical. In this case only, there
        will be an extraction of energy. </p>
      <p>By publishing this first circuit, my goal is to stimulate
        research ZPE. Especially I think of the amateurs. </p>
      <p>A news concerning my research: I think of having found a law
        physical, connecting the electrical current in a reel (as used
        in the circuit sent) and the inductance of the reel. This
        relation running and inductance seem fundamental in the
        extraction of the electric output. This relation is reciprocal.
        A current fluctuation varies inductance and a variation of
        inductance varies the current. </p>
      <p>When the electrical current increases, that made decrease
        inductance, and a reduction in inductance makes amplify the
        current… and so on. It is the effect of avalanche. This
        reduction in inductance has a certain limit determined by the
        electronic circuit. Once the stop of the avalanche, the process
        is reversed. Inductance increases and that made decrease the
        current… and so on. This return takes less time, because there
        is no extraction of electric output of the vacuum during this
        return. Normally, because of the electric losses, the avalanche
        does not start again without stimulation (ex: a pulse exceeding
        a certain value). </p>
      <p>The physical formula of this relation is as follows: </p>
      <p>I (L1) = (K1/L (L1)) - K2 or I (L1) is the current one
        circulating in the reel and L (L1) is the inductance of the
        reel. </p>
      <p>K1 and K2 are two constants (invariable) depend on the circuit
        components. </p>
      <p>By the adjustment of the constants K1 and K2, the curves of the
        current and inductance are practically identical. </p>
      <p>For other circuits, the formula could change, but what is
        important, it is that the relation running and the reverse of
        inductance should remain valid. “ </p>

      <p>“This circuit is quite simple seemingly, but to succeed in
        making it function, it should be taken Draconian precautions. It
        is true, that it functions at a relatively low frequency of 20
        kilocycles. On the other hand, the signal of the generator of
        impulse must be a signal square, positive, with a boarding time
        of 10 nanoseconds of 0 volts to + 5 volts. </p>
      <p>The simulation indicates very clearly, which if the boarding
        time of the square signal is slower than 10 nanoseconds, the
        extraction very quickly decreases and is cancelled completely
        between 50 and 100 nanoseconds. </p>
      <p>Simulation also shows that a stray capacity, at the point of
        connection of the transistor (M1), inductance (L1) and the
        resistance of exit (R1) of a value of 100 picofarads towards the
        mass, completely destroyed the extraction (this capacity of 100
        picofarads perhaps capacity of a probe of oscilloscope). </p>
      <p>Parasitic inductances can also prevent the extraction, if it
        exceeds 10 microHenries. </p>
      <p>For the assembly of the circuit, it is necessary to minimize
        the loops, as if the circuit operates at 25 MHz </p>
      <p>In fact the element of extraction is the toroidal ferrite of
        inductance (L1). “ </p>
      <p><b>Diagram and measurements</b> </p>
      <p>“Not need for an oscilloscope to prove it on unit: it is enough
        to measure 2 currents ex: between the ground and R2 resistance,
        and between the ground and R1 resistance” </p>
      <p><b>Further information at March 10, 2005</b> </p>

      <p>The number of turns: 40 </p>
      <p>The diameter of the wire: 0.3 mm or more. </p>
      <p>The core is of form annular and square section (5 mm X 7 mm).
        Dia ext.: 20 mm.; Diam.&nbsp; int: 10 mm; Épaisseur: 7 mm. </p>
      <p>The sectional surface specified by ferroxcube is 0.336 cm
        square. (AREA = 0.336) </p>
      <p>The course of the magnetic field is 4.36 cm (PATH =
        4.36).&nbsp; Effective circumference for the magnetic field. </p>
      <p>The annular form ensures, that the magnetic field is closed
        again. Very important (GAP = 0). </p>
      <p>The magnetic permeability of ferrite 3E5 is 8000. </p>
      <p>The electrical current in the reel must be 15 to 20 my minimum
        to be close to magnetic saturation. </p>
      <p>It is the nonlinearity which makes it possible to extract from
        the free energy. </p>
      <p>Very important: The circuit must be built like a circuit of 25
        MHz. (ferromagnetic resonance is between 20 MHz and 10 GHz) </p>
      <p>Transistor DNMOS FET must be IRF510. </p>
      <p>Other ferrites have few chances to function. </p>
      <p>(FERROXCUBE TX20/10/7 with magnetic permeability of 3E5) was
        announced like difficult to find, certain suppliers the proposer
        in France by 1500 parts, even to 1 euro one, that done a little
        too many expenditure for a small assembly. </p>
