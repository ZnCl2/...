      <p>I've been working with, and researching, chlorine dioxide for
        two years. I've made my own batches of nearly 100%, using a
        different formula. There are more than eight formulas to make
        chlorine dioxide. I have the Genesis II Church member card. I'm
        not anti-MMS.<br>
        <br>
        Jim Humble is a great humanitarian, and must have been a good
        NASA engineer. However, his chemistry is bad, which he has said
        in his book. And his understanding of body biochemistry is
        completely wrong. My main purpose, for this paper, is to correct
        his mistakes.<br>
        <br>
        The medical establishment's attack, against MMS, is based on a
        simplistic, uninformed, negative, buzz word slander. Clorox
        bleach is not labeled with the skull poison symbol. Like many
        products, it has warnings. And the warnings are exaggerated, as
        usual. For instance, it warns of burns to the skin. Hah, I've
        had bleach on my hands many times. It feels slimy, but doesn't
        cause a burn. They also use the word "industrial" bleach.
        "Industrial" makes it sound bad. Supermarket packaged foods are
        made in a factory. It's an industry. There's nothing bad about
        being industrial. Sodium chlorite and chlorine dioxide are in
        the general category of "bleach". That's good if you want to
        disinfect. And chlorine dioxide is used, for instance in
        municipal water supplies, because it is the safest one. As I
        will cover later, bleach oxidizers can do damage. So
        concentrations must be low.<br>
        <br>
        I'm experienced enough to be aware of the inner works of some
        groups, especially ones like the FDA. The whole attack, on MMS,
        may possibly be traced to one man, Mr. Mizer in the US Dept. of
        Justice, since everyone is repeating his slander, about bleach.
        There's a cadre of such people who hate Christianity, and so
        can't stand medical people using the words "cure" or "miracle".
        For sure, the attack is uninformed, and so it is illegitimate.<br>
        <br>
        To begin correcting Jim's mistaken ideas about chemistry.
        Chlorine dioxide is not an ion. It does not have a charge. It is
        a molecule. Molecules do not have a charge. Chlorine dioxide is
        unusual, in that it doesn't dissolve, ionize, in water. Body
        cells are a complex structure of many molecules. They do not
        have a charge. So chlorine dioxide is not repelled by body
        cells, and it is not attracted to only bad bacteria. Bacteria
        are cells, and so do not have a charge. The Gram Stain is not a
        positive or negative charge. The positive and negative means yes
        or no for the bacteria becoming stained with a dye. Chlorine
        dioxide is a free radical, meaning it has an unfilled electron
        space. This is how it oxidizes. When reacting with organic
        molecules, chlorine dioxide usually functions as a highly
        selective oxidant due to its unique, one-electron transfer
        mechanism where it is reduced back to the chlorite ion. When
        oxidizing some inorganics, like ferric oxide, it can accept a
        total of five electrons, which would break it down to a chloride
        ion, as in salt, and two oxygen ions. Jim's claim that electron
        shells hold atoms together, and that the nucleus would fly apart
        if the electrons are drawn away, is false. It takes a
        high-powered atom smasher to do that.<br>
        <br>
        Chlorine dioxide is said to work differently on different
        pathogens. Bacteria, fungi, parasite and tumor cells are
        vulnerable to oxidants because of these components; thiols,
        polyamines, purines, amino acids with thiols, phenols, and
        amines [Dr. Thomas Hesselink's paper about malaria]. The method
        of chlorine dioxide bacterial kill, at low ppm concentration,
        seems to occur by the disruption of protein synthesis and enzyme
        inactivation. This is similar to the non-toxic mechanism of some
        common antibiotics. It does not blow a hole in cell walls. It
        acts on good as well as bad bacteria, so probiotics should be
        taken after treatment is finished. Oxidation of RNA and DNA do
        not appear to take place, or are at least unimportant in the
        process. The site of action lies in the soluble fraction of the
        cell and there appears to be no damage to internal structural
        components such as ribosomes. At high ppm, the method of rapid
        bacterial and viral kill appears to be the softening and
        destroying of the cell wall, or viral capsid.<br>
        <br>
        Chlorine dioxide can definitely hurt body tissue, as well as
        pathogens. It kills algae, parasite organisms, and some insect
        eggs or larvae, such as mosquitoes. If the concentration is high
        enough, it can kill zebra mussels and some fish, such as trout
        (the lethal LC50 for rainbow trout is 290 ppm for 96 hours).
        Since I believed Jim's harmlessness claim, at first, I took
        massive doses of pure chlorine dioxide, and inhaled full breaths
        of it. Once, my lungs hurt for three days afterwards. And
        massive doses caused my ears to ring, probably damaging
        sensitive inner ear nerve hairs. So doses should be kept small,
        and luckily chlorine dioxide works with the lowest doses,
        compared to other disinfectants. There are many institutional
        papers assessing the toxicity of chlorine dioxide, sodium
        chlorite and chlorate. The main problem area is red blood cells.
        With prolonged, higher dose (up to 1000 ppm for chlorine
        dioxide, and 100 ppm for chlorite and chlorate) daily use in
        rat's drinking water, for 1-2 months, some hemoglobin can be
        oxidized to methemoglobin which doesn't carry oxygen. Also, red
        blood cell count can decrease. Chlorate (ClO3-), which can
        rupture RBCs, is the worst with serious RBC loss after nine
        months. There is a claim that some chlorate can be produced in
        MMS reactions, such as with pH less than 3, and some chemical
        studies claim chlorine dioxide can change into some chlorate in
        water. Red blood cells have glutathione to protect them from
        oxidation, but cell levels can be decreased with prolonged
        treatment. Other studies show no methemoglobin at these dose
        levels. There is a reference stating that there's an enzyme that
        reduces methemoglobin back to normal hemoglobin. One study with
        low dose, single dose, pure chlorine dioxide using people,
        showed no problems at 0.34 mg/kg of body weight. In these
        studies, the doses of sodium chlorite and chlorate were only
        1/10th of the amount of chlorine dioxide, evidently for safety
        reasons, meaning they considered chlorine dioxide much safer.
        Different studies have found the following safe levels of
        chlorine dioxide in all of the drinking water, per day: 15 mg/kg
        in mice for 1 month; 9 mg/kg in green monkeys for 1-2 months; 2
        mg/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 months. At higher doses there
        could be some nasal irritation from chlorine dioxide gas
        evaporating at the drinking tube. Effect on newborn rat pups:
        decreased pup development, decreased thyroid hormone levels
        (thyroid hormones T3 and T4 are phenols), and decreased brain
        cell count, were found at 14 mg/kg of body weight per day in
        drinking water for the mother rats during gestation and
        lactation. Dosing below 14 mg/kg had no observed effect, such as
        in a 3 mg/kg test. I don't think anyone should take maintenance
        doses for years, especially with so much sodium chlorite in the
        MMS mix. And doses should be in mg/kg or /pound of body weight,
        not in drops. Also, Jim is wrong about MMS lasting only one hour
        in the body. Rat studies show that 100% chlorine dioxide, not
        the MMS mix, reaches peak blood level in 2 hours, with half
        absorbed in 3.5 hours. The leftover sodium chlorite, in the MMS
        mix, reaches peak blood level in 8 hours. 21% of it is still in
        the blood after 72 hours. So dosing every hour is not a good
        idea. Studies use one dose per day. There probably hasn't been
        much research about the effect of chlorite and chlorine dioxide
        on prescription drugs in the body, but oxidizers are one thing
        used by illegal drug users to nullify drugs in their urine test.
        So they probably can affect some prescription drugs in the body.
        For myself, I would only take low dose pure chlorine dioxide,
        such as chlorine dioxide solution (CDS), or the new MMS1 tablets
        in a glass of water [do not swallow the tablet]. Precautions
        must be employed in people with
        glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency disease, as they
        are especially sensitive to oxidants of all kinds.<br>
        <br>
        As chlorine dioxide is a free radical, antioxidants will quench
        it back into a chlorite ion. This happens with many
        antioxidants; Vit. E, Vit. A, CoQ10, flavonoids, Beta-carotene,
        Lycopene, Lutein, etc., not only vitamin C. So no antioxidant
        supplements, or natural juices or foods should be consumed with
        chlorine dioxide. Lemon, or lime juice, has vitamin C and other
        antioxidants, so are not good to mix with chlorine dioxide.<br>
        <br>
        Jim believes that MMS gets completely changed into chlorine
        dioxide, in the stomach, if you swallow it. This is no more true
        than what happens when activating MMS in a glass beaker. There
        is only a small continuous basal secretion of gastric acid, on
        an empty stomach, of usually less than 10 mEq/hour. It takes
        food to stimulate the secretion of gastric fluid, and then the
        HCl is only 0.5 to 1% of it. And acidifying sodium chlorite does
        not produce chlorine dioxide as the first step. It produces
        chlorous acid, HClO2. [HCl + NaClO2 = HClO2 + NaCl] HClO2 is
        unstable, and breaks down into chlorine dioxide and hydrochloric
        acid. [5 HClO2 decomposes to 4 ClO2 + HCl + 2 H2O] Furthermore,
        at a pH in the range of 2.3 - 3.2, only about 30% chlorous acid
        is produced from the acidification. That leaves about 70%
        leftover sodium chlorite. Citric acid is a weak acid, and only
        produces about 10% chlorine dioxide. And citric acid can have
        the taste problem. Luckily, the leftover sodium chlorite is also
        a disinfectant, although it is much harsher than chlorine
        dioxide, and not as selective. With exact concentrations and
        conditions, HCl can produce nearly 100% chlorine dioxide. Also,
        the acidification of 1.3M sodium chlorite with 10% acetic acid
        yielded almost entirely chlorine dioxide as the major product of
        the disproportionation. Acidified Sodium Chlorite is used by
        many food processing companies, and the short-lived chlorous
        acid is also a disinfectant.<br>
        <br>
        Sodium chlorite is a different animal. I have brushed my teeth
        with less than one ounce of 80% sodium chlorite solution.
        Afterwards, one corner of my lips hurt, and my gums were red and
        sore, with a small amount of bleeding when brushed. This took
        several days to heal. A single dose of 105 mg/kg weight will
        kill half of rats tested. That's called the LD50, lethal dose.
        For a 150 lb person, that's a little over 7 grams. In another
        test, with cats, a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg caused as much as
        32% methemoglobin. That's losing about 1/3 of your blood oxygen
        supply. This loss does reverse back into normal hemoglobin over
        time. A 90 day study on rats found a No Adverse Effect Level at
        1 mg/kg. Another 13 week study found very serious consequences
        at the highest doses; death, increased spleen and adrenal
        weights, ulceration, chronic inflammation and edema in the
        stomach. In a 90 day study, red blood cell glutathione levels,
        in a high dose group, were 40% below those of controls. MMS with
        citric acid has about 90% sodium chlorite leftover. So it's
        safer to use only chlorine dioxide alone.<br>
        <br>
        Under some circumstances, calcium hypochlorite, MMS2, solutions
        can decompose to form some chlorate. In water it reacts to form
        hypochlorous acid and calcium hydroxide. This is the same
        chemistry as Clorox, sodium hypochlorite. The hydroxide part is
        caustic. It eats into body tissue. It's well known that these
        pool chemicals can irritate the eyes, if you swim a long time.
        He notes that hypochlorous acid is formed in the body. Yes.
        However it is formed inside white blood cells when they find an
        invading micro-organism, and only then. So it works only on the
        invader. Normal mammalian body cells, as well as bacteria, do
        not have a catalytically active detoxifying mechanism for it. So
        the hypochlorous acid can destroy body tissue as well as
        invaders. And ingesting it puts it in your bloodstream and body.
        Also, it's not as effective as chlorine dioxide. So it offers
        nothing new. No one should ingest MMS2, calcium hypochlorite, in
        any way. Swallowing a capsule containing solid calcium
        hypochlorite must surely "burn" the stomach. Also, calcium
        hypochlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid, stomach acid, to
        produce chlorine gas. Chlorine gas is the worst of all types of
        chlorine compounds.<br>
        <br>
        Here's a quote from one of Jim's books: "Actually my friend next
        door in the Nevada desert, Bill Boynton, came over one day and
        said that calcium hypochlorite killed germs in swimming pools
        and it might just be another MMS. He suggested that we try
        taking small amounts and see what happens. I figured if he was
        game to do it, I was too. We made up some gel capsules with
        calcium hypochlorite in them and started taking them and when
        they didn't kill us, we had some friends take them. ... I
        decided to use the gel caps and started sending it out to people
        in the gel cap form. It's something a doctor could never do. He
        has the Hippocratic Oath and AMA and FDA looking over his
        shoulder. But I am an inventor and never took that oath." p.112.<br>
        <br>
        Stabilized Oxygen, as sodium chlorite, is known by some people
        as a biocide for killing parasites. And at first, this is what
        Jim used, alone, to cure malaria. It's not clear who started
        selling Stabilized Oxygen, or why the mistaken name was used. It
        goes back far enough that the ingredient was not listed, leading
        to confusion. In 1929, Dr. Moisés de Guevarra was selling a dry
        powder named "stabilized oxygen". In 1971, Dr. La Mar was the
        first to use a solution with "stabilized oxygen" to increase
        blood oxygen level. Evidently, it's unknown if either of these
        was sodium chlorite. E.D. Goodloe, 1971, sold "aerobic
        stabilized oxygen", produced in a 2-month-long production
        process in 14 stages. The oxygen is in association with sodium
        chloride, not sodium chlorite. Sodium chlorite could be used
        alone, as long as doses are below the vomiting threshold. Making
        up a new name, for Stabilized Oxygen (sodium chlorite), is what
        commercial companies do to sell a product. And changing the
        wording, of MMS, only causes confusion. Health newsletters
        simply use the names of the chemicals.<br>
        <br>
        Getting sick, with Jim's method, is not a herxheimer reaction.
        The herxheimer reaction (Jarrisch and Herxheimer) is a phenomena
        originally observed in the treatment of syphilis. In general
        terms, it is described as a temporary increase of symptoms when
        antibiotics are administered. This effect happens with only a
        few diseases. Similar reactions have been found to occur in two
        kinds of borreliosis (Lyme disease and relapsing fever),
        brucellosis, Q fever, and trypanosomiasis. Herxheimer can occur
        within days to weeks after the onset of antibiotic therapy. The
        most common effects include: increased joint or muscle pain,
        headaches, chills, fever (usually low-grade), drop in blood
        pressure, hives and rash. Lyme is the main one, now, to have
        this problem. The extremely large doses of pure chlorine
        dioxide, that I took, caused no nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. In
        fact I felt high until the next morning. I've also swallowed a
        half eye-dropper of the 80% liquid sodium chlorite alone in
        water. It caused a vomit stomach spasm reaction within 30
        minutes. Chlorous acid is evidently the one that causes liquid
        diarrhea. I got that with my first use of MMS with lime juice.
        The vomiting and diarrhea are the body's attempt to get rid of
        what you ingested. They are not a die-off or Herxheimer effect.<br>
        <br>
        We owe Jim for making this subject public, and his other work.
        But I discovered, from being on the Genesis II Church Forum,
        that everyone was extremely closed minded about saying anything
        that disagreed with Jim. They even ban people who disagree with
        anything, even a chemist. So I have to conclude that Jim's
        history, with NASA or otherwise, has made him somewhat arrogant.
        I don't like to criticize people, but he's created an atmosphere
        that he is perfect, and knows more. That's the kind of problem
        in cults. Chlorine dioxide, and acidified sodium chlorite, are
        not new. There's been plenty of official health research, and
        patents, long before Jim found that "stabilized oxygen" (sodium
        chlorite) kills the malaria parasite. And some of his protocols
        may have too much sodium chlorite per day. He's so
        unprofessional that he doesn't give dosages per pound of weight
        of the patient. Obviously Jim has done no stomach sample tests,
        or blood tests to prove his claims. Chlorine dioxide has been
        said, by a chemist society, to be the best anti-pathogen. But do
        your own research.<br>
        <br>
        I'm not trying to scare you away from MMS. As long as you stay
        within the No Adverse Effect Levels, it's usable. If I had a
        deadly disease, I would use it even at somewhat damaging levels.
        For recommended dose levels of the sodium chlorite part, see Dr.
        Hesselink's table below. One benefit of these chlorine oxidants
        is that, in low doses, they can stimulate white blood cells to
        produce cytokines which stimulate other white blood cells,
        activating the immune system.<br>
        <br>
        There's a great Patent, from 1990's work, with very exacting
        biochemical research. The test studies showed that sodium
        chlorite alone is successful at treating autoimmune diseases,
        which may include diabetes-1, Parkinson, MS, hepatitis, etc.
        [Use of a chemically-stabilized chlorite solution for inhibiting
        an antigen-specific immune response]<br>
        &nbsp; <br>
        <b>Lab Tests with Chlorine Dioxide</b><br>
        <br>
        Disinfection examples include bacteria, yeast, fungi, mold,
        algae, spores, protozoans, cryptosporidia, actinomycetes, cysts,
        giardia and larval eggs (mosquito, tse tse fly), insect eggs and
        larvae (agricultural pests, fruit fly, floricultural and
        horticultural insects), problematic veligers (zebra mussels,
        quagga mussels), fish and shellfish diseases (VHS, KHS, ISA) and
        many others.<br>
        <br>
        Unlike chlorine, ClO2 has the ability to kill water-borne
        viruses such as legionella, cholera, dengue, hepatitis and
        typhoid. ClO2 also kills airborne viruses when misted into air.
        Airborne viruses include anthrax, influenza, SARS, smallpox,
        chickenpox and avian flu. ClO2 kills all known bacteria,
        including coliform, salmonella, E-coli, listeria and
        cinobacteria. ClO2 eliminates microbial slime (biofilm).<br>

        Methods of using a stabilized chlorite solution to inhibit
        antigen-specific immune responses are disclosed. The stabilized
        chlorite solution, when administered to a mammal in need
        thereof, can prevent the presentation of antigens by antigen
        presenting cells. The stabilized chlorite solution therefore is
        useful in treating, inter alia, auto-immune diseases, treating
        diseases caused by an inappropriate immune response, treating
        lymphoproliferative disease and in inhibiting rejection in
        transplant patients.<br>

        <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0002] The present invention relates to the use of a stabilized
        chlorite solution to inhibit antigen-specific immune responses.
        The stabilized chlorite solution inhibits antigen-specific
        immune responses by impeding antigen presentation by antigen
        presenting cells. The stabilized chlorite solution therefore is
        useful in treating diseases caused by or associated with
        unwanted or inappropriate antigen-specific immune responses
        including, for example, auto-immune diseases, hepatitis B and C,
        chronic hepatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
        systemic lupus erythemotosus and in preventing rejection in
        organ transplant and graft patients (graft versus host disease).
        The stabilized chlorite solution also is useful in treating
        lymphoma, specifically, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0003] A feature common to an immune response is the recognition
        of an antigen (either foreign or self, but perceived as
        foreign), and subsequent processing by the immune system.
        Typically, antigen is enzymatically degraded in the cytoplasm,
        endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosomes of cells, (usually
        macrophages, dendritic cells and other antigen presenting cells
        (APCs)), or in serum. The degraded antigen is presented on the
        surface of the APC by MHC class I or II molecules. This
        presentation of the antigenic epitope by the MHC molecule, and
        subsequent binding to the T cell receptor (TCR) of a T cell is
        known as antigen presentation. See, for example: Rodgers et al.,
        CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE (RICH): “Antigens
        and antigen presentation,” Chpt. 7, pp 114-131, Mosby, St.
        Louis, Mo. (1996); Roitt, ESSENTIAL IMMUNOLOGY, Blackwell
        Science, Oxford, England (1997).<br>
        <br>
        [0004] T cells circulating in the body recognize and bind to an
        antigenic epitope (antigen) presented by the MHC (Class I or II)
        molecule through the TCRs on the surface of the T cell.
        Successful binding of the TCR to the presented antigenic epitope
        results in a cascade of events. For example, when T cells
        encounter antigen bound to MHC molecules on the surface of an
        APC, they can undergo profound phenotypic changes characterized
        by changes in gene expression, effector functions, secretion of
        lymphokines, and, under appropriate circumstances, cell
        proliferation. Inappropriate immune responses occur in a similar
        manner, however, and can lead to undesirable T cell
        proliferation, unwanted lymphokine secretion, and a state of
        autoimmunity.<br>
        <br>
        [0005] In the course of a normal immune response the TCR must
        first be capable of recognizing and binding to the antigen
        presented. It is believed, however, that more than a simple
        binding of antigen is needed to bring about the cascade of
        events described above. Thus, it is thought that a ligand
        present on the APC must react with a costimulatory receptor on
        the T cell to bring about lymphocyte activation. Specifically,
        the B7 molecule on the surface of the APC interacts with its
        counterreceptor on the T cell, CD28, a molecule which forms a
        part of the TCR. Siegel, et al., CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, PRINCIPLES
        AND PRACTICE (RICH): “Signal Transduction and T lymphocyte
        activation,” Chpt. 12, pp 192-216, Mosby, St. Louis, Mo. (1996).
        See also Roitt, supra at pp. 169-170.<br>
        <br>
        [0006] One of the strongest immune responses is termed an
        allogeneic response, which involves the immune system reacting
        against non-self MHC alloantigens. This type of reactivity is
        observed, for example, in rejection of non-self grafts, such as
        transplanted organs, and clearly is undesirable in such
        situations. Reported mechanisms of immunosuppression that act by
        interfering with allorecognition (i.e., by depletion of graft
        antigen, inhibition of APC function, blockade of surface
        receptor/co-receptor molecules, etc.) are ineffective for
        preventing or reducing the severity of an allogeneic response,
        however, because of their toxic side effects and their
        short-term activity. RICH supra., at “Concepts and challenges in
        solid organ transplantation,” Chpt. 104, pp. 1593-1607. In
        addition, there are no reported treatment regimens that are
        effective in blocking the B7/CD28 co-stimulatory interaction.<br>
        <br>
        [0007] The immune system of most mammals is capable of
        recognizing and responding to self and foreign antigens in an
        appropriate manner. The phenomenon where the immune system does
        not respond to self-antigens is termed immunological tolerance.
        Triplett, J. Immunol. 86: 505-510, (1962). Tolerance to self
        antigens sometimes breaks down, however, causing autoimmunity,
        where T or B cells (or both), as well as various cytokines of a
        mammal, react against and destroy the antigens in the mammal's
        own tissues. In addition, mammals frequently show inappropriate
        immune responses to foreign antigens, causing an overstimulation
        or overactivation of the immune system that results in damage to
        normal, healthy tissue.<br>
        <br>
        [0008] These autoimmune responses and inappropriate immune
        responses are responsible for a number of systemic immune
        diseases, including myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus
        erythematosus, serum disease, type I diabetes, rheumatoid
        arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever,
        Sjörgen syndrome, systemic sclerosis, spondylarthropathies, Lyme
        disease, sarcoidosis, autoimmune hemolysis, autoimmune
        hepatitis, autoimmune neutropenia, autoimmune polyglandular
        disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, multiple sclerosis,
        inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn's disease, chronic
        fatigue syndrome, and the like.<br>
        <br>
        [0009] An important factor in autoimmune diseases is the
        presence of T cells directed against self tissue or antigens.
        When an antigen (or self-antigen) is presented by an APC, the T
        cells that possess these anti-self receptors bind to the
        presented antigenic epitope, and begin to differentiate and
        proliferate to eventually destroy the antigen (or self-antigen).
        Davis, Anna. Rev. Biochem., 59:475 (1990). Several mechanisms
        have been proposed to prevent anti-self T cells from
        differentiating. One mechanism is clonal anergy, which is the
        functional inactivation of a T cell. Schwartz in Rich, supra,
        “Mechanisms of Autoimmunity,” Chpt. 69, pp 1053-61. The anergic
        T cell is unable to express IL-2, a cytokine necessary for
        T-cell proliferation. Accordingly, the T-cell cannot proliferate
        and is unable to cause symptoms of autoimmune disease.<br>
        <br>
        [0010] Conventional methods of combatting autoimmune responses
        down-regulate the immune response by preventing or inhibiting T
        cell proliferation after antigen presentation. These methods
        attempt to inhibit formation and expansion of cytotoxic T cells
        after antigen presentation and release of cytokines (IL-1, IL-2,
        TNF, etc.). For example, cyclosporin A is known to prevent
        proliferation of T cells after antigen presentation by blocking
        production of IL-2. Methods of modulating the immune response
        that attempt to interfere with the production of stimulated T
        cells after antigen presentation characteristically require
        administration of a large quantity of therapeutic agent, which
        can cause undesirable toxic side effects.<br>
        <br>
        [0011] Moreover, while expansion of anti-self T cells are
        necessary for some autoimmune diseases, their presence alone is
        not sufficient to cause all autoimmune responses. Schwartz,
        supra., at 1055. For example, polyclonal B cell activation is a
        common feature of systemic lupus erythematosus. Klinman, et al.,
        J. Exp. Med., 165:1755 (1987). In addition, the presence of
        autoantibodies is not uncommon in organ-specific autoimmune
        diseases. Bernard et al., Diabetes, 41:40 (1992). Thus,
        preventing anti-self T cell proliferation alone may be
        ineffective in treating many autoimmune diseases.<br>
        <br>
        [0012] There are instances other than autoimmune diseases where
        an immune response is not needed, or where it is desirable to
        suppress to some extent the immune response. Allergic responses
        to antigens and excessive inflammation are examples where the
        immune system has initiated an inappropriate immune response.
        Chronic viral infection with a hepatitis virus, such as
        hepatitis B or C is an example where excessive immunologic
        reactive inflammation causes end stage liver dysfunction and
        diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatoma. Rejection of
        transplanted organs and grafted tissue is another example. In
        addition, the transplanted organ or graft can sometimes elicit a
        graft vs. host response where the cells of the graft or organ
        mediate an immune response against healthy host cells.<br>
        <br>
        [0013] In the case of organ transplants and tissue grafting, it
        is not advantageous to initiate an immune response to the
        foreign antigens of the transplanted or grafted organ. In these
        cases, the immune system must develop an immunological tolerance
        to the foreign antigens. In a similar manner, the immune system
        of the transplanted organ or graft also must develop a tolerance
        to host antigens. In the field of organ transplantation and
        grafting, the recipient's cellular immune response to the
        foreign graft can be depressed with cytotoxic agents that affect
        the lymphoid and other parts of the hematopoietic system. Graft
        acceptance is limited, however, by the tolerance of the
        recipient to these cytotoxic chemicals, many of which are
        similar to anticancer (antiproliferative) agents. Likewise, when
        using cytotoxic antimicrobial agents, particularly antiviral
        drugs, or when using cytotoxic drugs for autoimmune disease
        therapy, e.g., in treatment of systemic lupus erythematosis, one
        serious limitation is the toxic effects to the bone marrow and
        the hematopoietic cells of the body. A further limitation is the
        inability of the cytotoxic agents to induce an immunological
        tolerance to the foreign antigens.<br>
        <br>
        [0014] Toxic side effects to normal tissues and cells also can
        limit the efficacy of most forms of nonsurgical cancer therapy,
        such as external irradiation and chemotherapy, because of the
        limited specificity of these treatment modalities for cancer
        cells. This limitation is also of importance when anti-cancer
        antibodies are used for targeting toxic agents, such as
        isotopes, drugs, and toxins, to cancer sites, because, as,
        systemic agents, the antibodies also circulate to sensitive
        cellular compartments such as the bone marrow. In acute
        radiation injury, there is destruction of lymphoid and
        hematopoietic compartments which is a major factor in the
        development of septicemia and subsequent death.<br>
        <br>
        [0015] Many different approaches have been undertaken to protect
        an organism from the side effects of radiation or toxic
        chemicals. One approach is to replace bone marrow cells after
        toxicity has developed. Another is to inject a chemical blocker
        which competes for the site of action of the toxic drug.<br>
        <br>
        [0016] Neta et al. (J. Immunol. 136:2483-2485, 1986) showed that
        pre-treatment with recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) protects
        mice in a dose-dependent manner from the lethal effects of
        external beam irradiation, when the IL-1 was given 20 hr before
        irradiation. Other studies have shown the use of other cytokines
        in ameliorating the toxic side effects of radiation therapy and
        chemotherapy. Preventing secretion of cytokines and/or
        inhibiting antigen presentation in antigen presenting cells
        (macrophages, dendritic cells, etc.), however, has not been
        reported as useful (or not useful) in ameliorating these side
        effects.<br>
        <br>
        [0017] Conventional immunosuppression also is ineffective in
        treating organ transplant and graft rejection. First, most
        immunosuppressive agents, such as antiproliferative and
        corticosteroids, display a low immunosuppressive efficacy.
        Second, excessive amounts of immunosuppressive agents, such as
        the monoclonal antibody OKT3, may produce toxic effects on T and
        B cells, leading to emergence of occult viral infections in, or
        neoplastic diseases of, lymphoid cells., Third, toxic effects on
        organs not belonging to the immune system result from
        administration of large doses of immunosuppressive agents such
        as cyclosporine.<br>
        <br>
        [0018] Antigen presentation on APCs also has the effect of
        stimulating T helper cells to “help” B cells undergo
        proliferation and subsequent differentiation. After each
        division, B cells that bind antigen with higher affinity are
        allowed to divide again; those B cells whose immunoglobulin
        remain unmodified or have a lower affinity are allowed to die. B
        cells therefore initially proliferate, and then differentiate
        into plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulin as noted by the Ig
        subclasses. Typically, B cells secrete IgM first, followed by
        IgG, IgA and IgE. If B-cells continue to proliferate, but fail
        to differentiate, they could give rise to a lymphoproliferative
        disease, such as lymphoma. Gause, in Rich, supra, Ch. 113, pp
        1745-1767.<br>
        <br>
        [0019] Non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma (non-HIV) is one of the
        most common lymphomas in the United States. Approximately 40,000
        new cases of lymphocytic lymphomas are diagnosed annually, with
        an estimated mortality of 19,000. Ries, et al., Cancer
        Statistics Review 1973-1988, National Institutes of Health Publ
        91-2789, Washington, D.C., 1991, National Cancer Institute.
        Follicular lymphoma progresses relatively slowly over time and
        requires little therapy, except when it causes the patient
        discomfort or develops a life-threatening complication. Although
        falling in the low grade category of lymphoma, follicular
        lymphoma can not be cured given current therapeutic
        considerations, and is ultimately universally fatal.<br>
        <br>
        [0020] In 1981, the first treatment of a patient with
        anti-idiotypic antibody made from the patient's own B cell
        lymphoma was undertaken. Miller et al., N. Engl. J. Med.,
        306:517 (1982). More than 10 years ago, researchers used
        monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies for treatment of follicular
        lymphoma. This research found that lymphomas responded to
        anti-idiotype therapy in direct relationship to the proportion
        of T cells that co-existed within the lymphoma. These findings
        suggested that the malignant B cells somehow interacted with T
        cells and that the anti-idiotypic antibodies somehow changed
        either the growth conditions of the lymphoma cells or the T cell
        immune response against the B cells. Anti-idiotypic therapy has
        not been adopted, however, because, since the anti-idiotypic
        antibodies are made from, the patient's own B cells (which have
        the inherent capacity to modify their structure), the B cell
        tumors also have the ability to somatically mutate their antigen
        binding site (i.e., idiotype) thus making them impervious to
        anti-idiotypic therapy. Gause, supra at Chpt. 113, pp
        1745-1767).<br>
        <br>
        [0021] More recently, dendritic cells incubated with lymphoma
        idiotypic-type (tumor-specific immunoglobulin) have been used to
        immunize patients against their own follicular lymphoma. Here,
        blood dendritic cells were removed from patients, incubated with
        their own tumor-specific antibody, and injected back into the
        patient. A substantial number of patients responded by shrinkage
        of their tumors after injection thereby indicating that the
        dendritic cells induced a T cell response against the malignant
        B cells. These observations suggest that follicular lymphoma may
        be amenable to immunologic manipulation.<br>
        <br>
        [0022] One of the pathogenic lesions within the follicular
        lymphoma process involves macrophage antigen processing and/or
        presentation. Despite the numerous treatment regimens for
        follicular lymphoma, and despite the recent advancements in
        cancer biotherapy trials, there have been no significant
        improvements in the management of lymphomas. Id., at 1763.
        Moreover, it has heretofore been unknown to treat lymphoma by
        regulating antigen presentation in APC.<br>
        <br>
        [0023] Inhibiting an inappropriate immune response and
        inhibiting and/or preventing antigen presentation, while
        advantageous in ameliorating autoimmune disorders, allergic
        responses, transplant rejections, etc., has the disadvantage of
        reducing the immune system's ability to fight off infections.
        Thus, known therapies for immunosuppression often are carried
        out in connection with administration of agents that stimulate
        phagocytic activity of phagocytic cells like macrophages,
        monocytes and polymorphomononuclear cells (PMNs) to fight off
        other infections. There are no known therapies capable of
        inhibiting an antigen-specific immune response, while at the
        same time stimulating phagocytic activity.<br>
        <br>
        [0024] It has recently been postulated that an important
        component in the body's ability to control the duration and
        severity of the inflammatory response that accompanies
        macrophage activation during an immune response is the presence
        of macrophages that are “alternatively activated.” Stein et al.,
        (J. Exp. Med. 176:287 (1992)). Unlike “classical” macrophage
        activation, which is induced by interferon-?, TNF-a, IL-12, or
        bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the alternative pathway is induced
        by IL-4, IL-10, or IL-13, and is characterized by expression of
        the AMAC-1 gene, producing MIP-4 protein (macrophage
        inflammatory protein-4) and reduced secretion of proinflammatory
        cytokines. See Kodelja et al., J. Immunol. 160:1411 (1998);
        Schebesch et al., Immunology 92:478 (1997). Alternatively
        activated macrophages have been shown to actively inhibit
        mitogen-mediated lymphocyte proliferation. As such, the
        alternative pathway of macrophage activation is thought to act
        as an important modulator of the proinflammatory macrophage
        response. Indeed, it has been postulated that alternatively
        activated macrophages might play a key role in reducing
        inflammation in allergic and autoimmune diseases.<br>

        [0025] Aqueous solutions of a chemically stabilized chlorite
        solution that are capable of intravenous administration are
        known. Other chlorine-containing solutions also are known to
        have reported medicinal uses. For example, U.S. Pat. No.
        5,019,402 discloses a solution containing chlorine dioxide or a
        chlorine dioxide-liberating mixture of a chlorite, a weakly
        acidic buffer and a heat-activated saccharide which can be used
        for the sterilization ex vivo of stored blood components.
        Notably, however, the method is unsuitable for use with blood
        products containing red blood corpuscles, i.e., of leukocytes,
        blood platelets, coagulation factors and globulins. In whole
        blood, a corresponding disinfecting action does not occur,
        presumably because the red blood corpuscles are attacked more
        quickly by the chlorine dioxide than the targeted
        micro-organisms.<br>

        No. 4,296,103, describe chemically-stabilized chlorite matrices
        that are suitable for external or oral therapeutic use. Besides
        various bacterial infections, the external treatment of virus
        infections, such as herpes simplex and herpes zoster, may be
        possible in this manner. However, these documents do not report
        the use of these chlorite matrices for intravenous
        administration for inhibiting an antigen-specific immune
        response.<br>
        <br>
        [0027] European Patent EP 0 200 157 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,725,437
        further describe solutions of a chemically-stabilized chlorite
        solution for intravenous and perioperative administration. The
        agent has proved to be effective in the treatment of Candida
        albicans infections. From EP 0 200 157, it is known to use such
        stabilized chlorite matrices for intravenous and/or local
        administration in cases of infectious conditions brought about
        by parasites, fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or mycoplasts. The
        action is thought to occur via phagocyte stimulation which is
        achieved by a single effective administration of the chlorite
        complex shortly after the infection. Down-regulation of an
        immune response and inhibition of antigen-specific immune
        responses are not described in these publications; rather, the
        postulated principle of action via phagocyte stimulation would
        lead to the opposite prediction.<br>
        <br>
        [0028] It is apparent, therefore, that new methods of modifying
        the immune response are greatly to be desired. In particular, it
        is highly desirable to identify new methods of treating diseases
        associated with inappropriate antigen presentation, such as
        autoimmune disease, transplant rejection, and systemic lupus
        erythemotosus, and of treating diseases having symptoms of
        chronic inflammation due to inappropriate macrophage activation,
        such as hepatitis B and C, chronic hepatitis, and chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease. It also is apparent that methods
        of treating lymphoproliferative diseases by preventing antigen
        presentation are desirable.<br>
        <br>
        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0029] There exists a need to develop a method of inhibiting an

        </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0048] The present invention provides methods of inhibiting
        antigen presentation in patients suffering from clinical
        conditions associated with inappropriate or excessive antigen
        presentation. The methods involve administering to the patient a
        therapeutically effective amount of a stabilized chlorite
        solution sufficient to inhibit antigen presentation and to
        alleviate symptoms associated with the clinical conditions. In
        particular, the methods of the invention are useful for
        preventing transplant rejection, and for treating autoimmune
        disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, lymphoproliferative
        disease such as lymphoma, and diseases associated with chronic
        inflammation. Diseases associated with chronic inflammation
        include chronic hepatitis, hepatitis B and C, chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease, and all inflammation in mucosal
        disease (e.g. Crohn's disease and colitis).<br>
        <br>
        [0049] The dosage of the stabilized chlorite preparation that is
        administered to a patient to achieve a desired therapeutic
        result will depend upon various factors, including the body
        weight and gender of the patient. Methods of adjusting dosage
        regimens to take body weight, gender, and other metabolic
        factors into account are well known in the art. The particular
        therapeutic endpoint that is to be achieved will vary depending
        upon the particular pathology and symptoms of the disease that
        is being treated, but these endpoints are well known in the art.
        For example, both hepatitis B and chronic persistent hepatitis
        are associated with laboratory findings of markedly elevated
        levels of transaminase activity. Efficacy of treatment using the
        chlorite preparation may be estimated by measuring levels of
        transaminase activity both before and after treatment.
        Similarly, patients suffering from systemic lupus erythemotosus
        display a high titer of antibodies against double-stranded DNA,
        and a reduction in this titer following treatment is one
        indication of the efficacy of the treatment. The skilled artisan
        readily will appreciate, however, that clinical benefit often
        may readily be ascertained by observing general improvement in
        the symptoms reported by a patient, without the need for a
        quantitative measurement of clinical response. Similarly,
        absence of a measurable response in certain laboratory findings
        does not of itself preclude the existence of clinically
        significant benefit.<br>
        <br>
        [0050] In the context of the present invention, those skilled in
        the art will appreciate that the term “an inhibition effective
        amount” indicates an amount of solution which, when administered
        in vivo to a subject, will bring about an inhibition of the
        antigen presentation, and consequently, an inhibition of the
        proliferation of T cells. A therapeutically effective amount of
        the solution is that amount that produces a therapeutically
        significant reduction in one or more symptoms of the disease
        under treatment, or that produces a statistically significant
        improvement in a recognized clinical marker of the disease.
        Typically, an inhibition effective amount of the chlorite
        solution will vary between about 0.1 ml/kg to about 1.5 ml/kg,
        preferably, about 0.5 ml/kg of body weight and at a
        concentration of about 40 to about 80 mMol ClO2 per liter,
        preferably about 60 mMol ClO2 per liter, respectively. Without
        being bound by any theory, applicants believe that the
        relationships described above between the effects on antigen
        presentation and the clinical results achieved in treating
        certain diseases means that the therapeutically effective amount
        will be similar or the same as the inhibition effective amount.<br>
        <br>
        [0051] Preferably, the chlorite solution of the invention is
        administered once daily for anywhere from about three to seven
        days, preferably five days, followed by a period of rest of from
        10 to 20 days, preferably from 14-18 days, and more preferably,
        16 days, to constitute one cycle of treatment. Preferably,
        patients are treated with more than one cycle, more preferably,
        at least three cycles, and most preferably, at least five
        cycles. The skilled artisan will recognize, however, that other
        regimens are possible, and may in fact be preferable. Methods of
        manipulating such regimens are well known in the art.<br>
        <br>
        [0052] For example, an alternative treatment regimen consists of
        intravenously administering the stabilized chlorite solution of
        the invention once daily for a period of five days, followed by
        two days of rest (e.g., over the weekend), followed by five more
        consecutive days of administration, followed by a period of rest
        from anywhere between 1 and 4 weeks to constitute one cycle.
        Preferably, patients are treated with more than one cycle, more
        preferably more than three. Skilled artisans are capable of
        modifying the administration of the stabilized chlorite solution
        of the invention depending on the disease treated and the size
        of the patient, using the guidelines provided herein.<br>
        <br>
        [0053] The use of an aqueous solution containing a stabilized
        chlorite solution for treating wounds and infections is known in
        the art. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,507,285 and 4,725,437, the disclosures
        of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety,
        and EP 0 200 157, the disclosure of which also is incorporated
        by reference herein in its entirety, describe the use of a
        stabilized chlorite solution in stimulating the wound healing
        response in humans, as well as in treating infections caused by
        parasites, fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or mycoplasma. Kühne et
        al., European Patent No. 200,156, the disclosure of which is
        incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes the
        use of a stabilized chlorite solution in conjunction with
        radiation therapy to aid in repairing damaged irradiated tissue
        and reducing side effects.<br>
        <br>
        [0054] The mode of action in treating damaged and/or infected
        tissue is thought to involve amplifying the “oxidative burst”
        response of phagocytes in the presence of bioactivators, e.g.,
        heme compounds. Wound healing and treatment of the reported
        infections are believed to be effected via activation of
        macrophages, which in turn serve to activate fibroblast cells
        that stimulate the wound healing response. The stabilized
        chlorite solutions are thought to activate macrophages by
        complexing with the heme moieties present in the macrophage
        membrane. Upon activation, the macrophages stimulate the
        fibroblast cells which in turn generate collagen and endothelial
        cells that are useful in repairing damaged tissue caused by the
        wound or by the infections.<br>
        <br>
        [0055] While not intending on being bound by any theory, the
        present inventors believe that a macrophage is stimulated by the
        stabilized chlorite solution by the following sequence of
        events. In the presence of heme compounds (e.g., hemoglobin,
        myoglobin, peroxidases, cytochromes, etc.), which are present in
        the serum which also are part of the cell membrane of phagocytic
        cells like macrophages, the stabilized chlorite solution becomes
        a secondary oxidant with oxidative properties different from
        chlorite and hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, the stabilized chlorite
        solution of the invention has shown significant pharmacological
        differences when compared to equimolar chlorite solutions.<br>
        <br>
        [0056] The present inventors believe further that the known
        wound-healing mechanism via macrophage activation of the
        chlorite solution of the invention also stimulates and enhances
        the phagocytic activity of the macrophage. Thus, the activated
        macrophage is primed to ingest, digest and dispose of foreign
        antigens. The use of a stabilized chlorite solution to render
        macrophage phagocytic is described in EP 0 200 157.<br>
        <br>
        [0057] Prior to the present invention, however, it was not known
        that a stabilized chlorite solution also can inhibit an
        antigen-specific immune response, while at the same time enhance
        the activity of phagocytes. While not intending to be bound by
        any theory, the present inventors believe that the stabilized
        chlorite solution, when administered to a mammal in need
        thereof, partially or completely impedes the antigen
        presentation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) by activating
        the alternative macrophage activation pathway. Throughout this
        description, the expression, “antigen presenting cells” denotes
        a cell that is capable of presenting an antigen and eliciting an
        immune response. Useful antigen presenting cells include
        macrophages and dendritic cells. Inhibition of antigen
        presentation upon administration of a stabilized chlorite
        solution is demonstrated by the in vitro data described in the
        examples.<br>
        <br>
        [0058] A typical immune response involves stimulating a
        macrophage, the stimulated macrophages present MHC Class I and
        II bound antigens on the surface, which, when coupled with the T
        cell receptor, will stimulate T cells (typically a T cell subset
        such as CD4 or CD8 cells, and the like) to proliferate and form
        cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) cells which in turn kill cells
        expressing the antigen. After antigen presentation and upon
        coupling with the T cell receptors, the stimulated APC
        (macrophage and the like) also secretes various cytokines that
        can aid in the proliferation of CTLs. Cytokines, or growth
        factors, are hormone-like peptides produced by diverse cells and
        are capable of modulating the proliferation, maturation and
        functional activation of particular cell types. Herein,
        cytokines refer to a diverse array of growth factors, such as
        hematopoietic cell growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin, colony
        stimulating factors and interleukins), nervous system growth
        factors (e.g., glial growth factor and nerve growth factor),
        mostly mesenchymal growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth
        factor), platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth
        factor I, II and III, including interferons.<br>
        <br>
        [0059] It will be appreciated that there may be several
        cytokines that are involved in inducing cell differentiation and
        maturation, and that cytokines may have other biological
        functions. In the case of IL-1, there may be several forms, such
        as IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta, which nevertheless appear to have a
        similar spectrum of biological activity. Those cytokines that
        are primarily associated with induction of cell differentiation
        and maturation of myeloid and possibly other hematopoietic cells
        include, inter cilia, IL-1, G-CSF, M-CSF, GM-CSF, Multi-CSF
        (IL-3), and IL-2 (T-cell growth factor, TCGF). IL-1 appears to
        have its effect mostly on myeloid cells, IL-2 affects mostly
        T-cells, IL-3 affects multiple lymphocyte precursors, G-CSF
        affects mostly granulocytes and myeloid cells, M-CSF affects
        mostly macrophage cells, GM-CSF affects both granulocytes and
        macrophage. Other growth factors affect immature platelet
        (thrombocyte) cells, erythroid cells, and the like.<br>
        <br>
        [0060] As shown in FIG. 1, when an antigen is presented to a
        patient with a normal, or uncompromised, immune system, the
        following sequence of events typically takes place. This
        mechanism can be seen on the left-hand side of FIG. 1 labeled
        “Immune Response.” The antigen (or foreign body) is enclosed in
        vesicles in the macrophage which breaks down the foreign matter
        into smaller antigenic peptides. An MHC class II molecule
        transports one of the smaller antigenic peptides to the surface
        of the macrophage, where it is presented to a T cell receptor
        (TCR). Binding with the cell receptor triggers the release of
        activating factors and cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, etc., which
        restores the self-defense of the macrophage and enhances the
        intracellular killing of the foreign body. If binding does not
        occur, the activating factors are not released and the
        macrophage will not break down the foreign matter into smaller
        peptides. As it is used in this description, the expression
        “antigen presentation” therefore denotes the process of
        presentation of a foreign antigen copied to an MHC Class II
        molecule on the surface of an APC followed by subsequent binding
        with a TCR.<br>
        <br>
        [0061] As described above, the alternative macrophage activation
        pathway is thought to act as an important modulator of the
        proinflammatory macrophage response, and alternatively activated
        macrophages are thought to play a key role in reducing
        inflammation in allergic and autoimmune diseases. Without being
        bound by any theory, the inventors believe that one of the
        mechanisms by which administration of a stabilized chlorite
        solution operates to prevent and/or inhibit antigen presentation
        is by activation of the alternative macrophage activation
        pathway. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the period of suppression
        of antigen presentation by a stabilized chlorite solution, which
        appears to last for periods of days to weeks without the need
        for further administration of drug, closely parallels the
        duration of expression of MIP-4 in alternatively activated
        macrophages, which also remains elevated over an extended
        period. This extended period of MIP-4 expression indicates that
        the macrophages also remain activated and can play an
        anti-inflammatory role over the entire period of activation.<br>

        [0062] Previously known therapies for preventing T cell
        proliferation typically acted on cytotoxic T-cells after
        cytokine stimulation. For example, cyclosporin A is believed to
        act on the cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte shown at the bottom left of
        FIG. 1 to prevent T-cell proliferation. At this point, however,
        the APC already has released cytokines that might assist CTL
        proliferation. Accordingly, a significant amount of these drugs
        must be administered to prevent the CTL proliferation. There are
        no known methods for impeding an immune response, however, where
        the APC or TCR are affected in a manner that partially or
        completely interrupts the antigen presentation interaction
        between the APC and the T cell.<br>
        <br>
        [0063] Patients suffering from autoimmune diseases and diseases
        caused by inappropriate immune response such as myasthenia
        gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, serum disease, type I
        diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
        rheumatic fever, Sjörgen syndrome, systemic sclerosis,
        spondylarthropathies, Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, autoimmune
        hemolysis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune neutropenia,
        autoimmune polyglandular disease, autoimmune thyroid disease,
        multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, Crohn's
        disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and the like, do so because
        the immune response is inappropriate. Chronic obstructive
        pulmonary disease (COPD) also may have some autoimmune etiology,
        at least in some patients. In an autoimmune response, the
        patient's body produces too many CTLs, or other cytokines which
        turn against the body's own healthy cells and destroy them. In
        transplant or graft patients, an inappropriate immune response
        occurs because the immune system recognizes the transplanted
        organ or graft's antigens as foreign, and hence, destroys them.
        This results in graft rejection. Likewise, transplant and graft
        patients can develop a graft vs. host response where the
        transplanted organ or graft's immune system recognizes the
        host's antigen as foreign and destroys them. This results in
        graft vs. host disease. Other inappropriate immune responses are
        observed in allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic
        dermatitis.<br>
        <br>
        [0064] In addition, diseases that produce symptoms of chronic
        inflammation also involve an inappropriate immune response,
        characterized by excessive macrophage activation. For example, a
        healthy response to tissue insult, such as a physical wound, or
        invasion by pathogenic organisms such as bacteria or viruses,
        involves activation of macrophages (via the “conventional,”
        proinflammatory route) and leads to an inflammatory response.
        However, this response can “overshoot” in an inappropriate
        manner, leading to chronic inflammation if the proinflammatory
        immune response cannot be suppressed. Diseases such as hepatitis
        B and C, chronic hepatitis, and manifestations of COPD such as
        obstructive bronchitis and emphysema that apparently are caused
        by prolonged exposure to non-specific bronchial and pulmonary
        irritants, are characterized by chronic inflammation (of the
        liver in hepatitis and of the pulmonary tissue in COPD) induced
        by excessive macrophage activation.<br>
        <br>
        [0065] Conventional therapies for autoimmune diseases such as
        systemic lupus erythematosus and transplant rejection invoke
        application of cytotoxic agents, particularly those that affect
        the lymphoid system (and therein particularly inhibit
        proliferation of T-lymphocytes). These cytotoxic drugs are
        similar to those often used in cancer chemotherapy, and have
        well known myeloid and other hematopoietic side effects. In
        addition to these drugs, specific antibodies against lymphoid
        cells, particularly T-cells, have been used as immunosuppressive
        agents. For example, Uchiyama et al., (J. Immunol. 126:1393 and
        1398 (1981)) described an anti-Tac monoclonal antibody that
        specifically binds the human IL-2 receptor of activated T-cells,
        and which can be conjugated to cytotoxic agents, such as drugs,
        toxins or radioisotopes, to effect a relatively select killing
        of these cells involved in organ rejection. Such antibodies can
        be conjugated with a ß- or a-emitting radioisotope, and can be
        administered to a patient prior to undertaking organ
        transplantation and, if needed, also thereafter. The aqueous
        solution containing a stabilized chlorite solution can be used
        in place of the aforementioned agents. Alternatively, stabilized
        chlorite solution can be used in combination with the
        conventional immunosuppressive agents.<br>
        <br>
        [0066] Administering an aqueous solution containing a stabilized
        chlorite solution to a mammal inhibits the antigen-specific
        immune response without compromising the immune system entirely,
        because the solution also is effective in enhancing phagocytic
        activity. Thus, the present invention encompasses methods of
        treating auto-immune diseases, preventing transplant organ or
        graft rejection and septic shock as a result thereof, and
        reducing inappropriate immune responses such as excessive
        inflammation and allergic reaction. Because other methods
        already are known to treat these disorders, skilled artisans are
        capable of modifying the known techniques by administering an
        inhibition effective amount of an aqueous solution containing a
        stabilized chlorite solution, using the guidelines provided
        herein. For example, skilled artisans are capable of designing a
        treatment regimen to treat any of the aforementioned disorders
        using the stabilized chlorite solution of the invention by
        varying the dosage amount, frequency of administration, or mode
        of administration.<br>
        <br>
        [0067] A preferred embodiment of the treatment of this invention
        entails administration to a mammal in need thereof, an aqueous
        solution of a product that has been termed
        “tetrachlorodecaoxygen anion complex,” commonly abbreviated as
        “TCDO.” This substance can be prepared using the procedures
        described in Example 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,285 (“the '285
        patent”), and is a water clear liquid, miscible with alcohols,
        and has a melting point of -3° C. The Raman spectrum shows bands
        of 403, 802 (chlorite) and 1562 cm&lt;-1 &gt;(activated oxygen).
        The skilled artisan will recognize that any chemically
        stabilized chlorite solution can be used in the methods of the
        present invention, and that the scope of the invention is not
        limited to use of the product described in the '285 patent.<br>
        <br>
        [0068] The present invention, thus generally described, will be
        understood more readily by reference to the following examples,
        which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended
        to be limiting of the present invention. In the examples, “WF10”
        denotes an aqueous stabilized chlorite solution.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0069] In this example, and the following examples 2-4, details
        regarding the methods used in performing these examples can be
        found in Fagnoni et al., Immunology, 85: 467-74 (1995), the
        disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its
        entirety. This example, together with the following examples
        2-4, elucidate the role of a stabilized chlorite solution in
        preventing dendritic cell-mediated costimulation.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Effect of WF10 on Dendritic Cell DC Stimulated Allogeneic MLR</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0070] Dendritic cells, T cells and monocytes were obtained in
        the manner described in Fagnoni et al. To assess the effects of
        WF10 on DC-dependent T cell activation, freshly isolated
        CD4&lt;+&gt;-T cells were activated with allogeneic MLR in the
        presence or absence of WF10 to DC. Purified resting CD4&lt;+&gt;
        T cells (5-10×10&lt;4&gt;/well) were cultured with irradiated
        (25 Gy) allogeneic DC in U-bottomed 96-well plates containing
        200 µl of complete medium. The cultures were maintained at 37°,
        8% CO2 in humidified air for 5 days. Cultures were pulsed with 1
        µCi[&lt;3&gt;H]thymidine (6-7 Ci/mm, New England Nuclear, Boston
        Mass.) 19 hours before harvest. The [&lt;3&gt;H]thymidine
        incorporation by proliferating cells was measured in a
        ß-scintillation counter. WF10 was added to DC stimulated
        allo-MLR DC and incubated at 4° for about 3 minutes before the
        addition of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells. The number of proliferated
        T-cells for samples using no WF10, and for samples using WF10
        are shown in FIG. 2. The results in FIG. 2 represent the
        mean±SEM of quadruplicate cultures, and data are representative
        of four experiments.<br>
        <br>
        [0071] As shown in FIG. 2, the CD4&lt;+&gt; T cell response to
        DC stimulated allogenic MLR was inhibited in a dose-dependent
        manner by WF10. The WF10 was administered by adding WF10 to
        culture medium at time 0 in doses of 25 µg/ml or 50 µg/ml. As
        seen in FIG. 2, even as the number of dendritic cells (DC) per
        well was increased, the number of CPM+SE (counts per
        minute+standard error) remained essentially the same, with the
        greatest degree of inhibition resulting from WF10/1600. The
        expression WF10/number denotes that dilution of WF10 and
        designates the amount of WF10 per ml of solution. For example,
        WF10/1600 denotes a diluted solution of WF10 containing 1 ml of
        WF10 per 1600 ml of solution.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
        </b><b><br>
        </b><b>Effect of WF10 on Monocytes Stimulated Allogeneic MLR</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0072] Example 1 was repeated with the exception that adherent
        monocytes, obtained in accordance with Fagnoni et al. were used
        instead of DC. The results are shown in FIG. 3, and demonstrate
        that administration of WF10 was effective in inhibiting
        proliferation of CD4&lt;+&gt; T-cells from monocyte stimulated
        MLR. Indeed, with administration of WF1/1600, the stabilized
        chlorite solution was effective in completely inhibiting
        proliferation of CD4&lt;+&gt; T-cells from monocytes stimulated
        with allogeneic MLR, despite increased concentration of
        monocytes per well.<br>
        <br>
        [0073] The results of examples 1 and 2 therefore show that WF10
        is effective in inhibiting proliferation of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells
        from DC or monocytes stimulated with allogeneic MLR.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0074] Examples 3 and 4 were carried out to determine the effect
        of WF10 on the inhibition of antigen-induced proliferation of T
        cells using various antigens. In this example, purified resting
        CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells (5-10×10&lt;4&gt;/well) were cultured with
        irradiated (25 Gy) autologous DC in U-bottomed 96-well plates
        containing 200 µl of complete medium. The cultures were
        maintained at 37°, 8% CO2 in humidified air for 6 days. Cultures
        were pulsed with 1 µCi [&lt;3&gt;H]thymidine (6-7 Ci/mm, New
        England Nuclear, Boston Mass.) 19 hours before harvest. The
        [&lt;3&gt;H]thymidine incorporation by proliferating cells was
        measured in a ß-scintillation counter.<br>
        <br>
        [0075] Soluble keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and tetanus
        toxoid (TT) were added to autologous DC. Measurements were taken
        for no addition of WF10, addition of WF10/200 and WF10/800
        (representing administration of WF10 to the culture medium at
        time 0 of 0, 1 ml/200 ml of solution and 1 ml/800 ml of
        solution, respectively) to determine the proliferation of
        CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells when no antigen, TT, KLH25 (25 µg/ml) and
        KL1450 (50 µg/ml) were presented by DC. The number of
        proliferated T-cells for samples using no WF10, and for samples
        using WF10 are shown in FIG. 4. The results in FIG. 4 represent
        the mean±SEM of quadruplicate cultures, and data are
        representative of four experiments.<br>
        <br>
        [0076] As shown in FIG. 4, significant proliferation of
        CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells occurred when DC presented the soluble
        antigens KLH and TT. Administration of WHO, however, almost
        completely inhibited the proliferation of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells
        when either KLH or TT were presented by DC.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0077] Example 3 was repeated except that monocytes were used
        instead of DC for antigen presentation. In addition, WF10 was
        administered in the following increments WF10/200, WF10/400,
        WF10/800 and WF10/1600. The results are shown in FIG. 5. As
        shown in FIG. 5, there was significant proliferation of
        CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells when monocytes presented the soluble
        antigens KLH and TT. Administration of WF10, however, almost
        completely inhibited the proliferation of CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells
        when either KLH or TT were presented by monocytes.<br>
        <br>
        [0078] The results achieved by administration of an aqueous
        solution containing a stabilized chlorite solution reveal that
        it is capable of inhibiting an antigen-specific immune response.
        It has previously been reported that administration of an
        aqueous solution containing a stabilized chlorite solution is
        effective in enhancing phagocytic activity. Thus, it now is
        possible by administering only one medicament to inhibit one
        type of immune response, (antigen presentation and proliferation
        of T cells) while at the same time, enhance another type of
        immune response (phagocytosis).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        [0079] A phase 2 trial was conducted at San Francisco General
        Hospital. The study enrolled 18 patients in an open label
        pathogenesis study of WF-10. Patients received one hour
        infusions of WF-10 for one week, followed by two weeks of rest.
        On the third week, the patients again received one hour
        infusions of WF-10 daily for one week followed by two weeks of
        rest. Parameters studied included measures of macrophage
        activation/function immunologic activation and HIV viral load.
        RBC hemolysis evaluation studies included 51 Cr-RBC survival
        studies compared with changes in hemoglobin, haptoglobin and
        reticulocyte values.<br>
        <br>
        [0080] There were no side effects noted in any of the 18
        patients. Data on eight of the patients were gathered and the
        results are tabulated below, and depicted in FIGS. 6-13. There
        appeared to be acute increases in the following parameters as
        measured by flow cytometry (FACSCAN as recommended by, for
        example, Becton-Dickinson) in relation to drug administration,
        changes that generally returned close to baseline within 2 weeks
        of drug administration: CD-4, CD-8, CD14&lt;+&gt;/CD69&lt;+&gt;,
        CD14&lt;+&gt; side scatter, CD20/DR&lt;+&gt; cells. Several
        values seemed to generally increase through the study, showing
        no clear downward trend by the end of the study and may
        represent long-term changes induced by WF-10. These include an
        increase in macrophage phagocytosis index and an increase in the
        CD3&lt;+&gt;/CD8&lt;+&gt;/CD28&lt;-&gt; subset of T-cells.<br>
        <br>
        [0081] Potential downward trends were noted in the following
        categories: macrophage intracellular TNF-a secretion, and a
        decrease in the number of circulating CD14&lt;+&gt;/DR&lt;+&gt;
        cells. It has been reported that immune paralysis results when
        the number of circulating CD14&lt;+&gt;/DR&lt;+&gt; cells
        decreases to such an extent as to reach a threshold value. No
        obvious changes were noted in T-cell PHA activation values or
        HIV load as measured by the HIV bDNA assay (most of the patients
        had no detectable HIV thoughout the study). Results of the RBC
        survival studies showed no evidence for hemolysis in response to
        the treatment.<br>
        <br>
        [0082] As shown in FIG. 6, administration of WF10 results in an
        increase in CD14&lt;+&gt;/CD69&lt;+&gt; cells, with dramatic
        increases immediately following infusion. FIG. 7 shows a
        decrease in CD14&lt;+&gt;/TNF secretion after administration of
        WF10, thereby indicating that a stabilized chlorite solution is
        effective in decreasing secretion of the tumor necrosis factor
        cytokine.<br>
        <br>
        [0083] FIGS. 8 and 9 show that administration of WF10 to
        patients in vivo results in a steady increase in the number of
        CD3&lt;+&gt;/CD8&lt;+&gt;, as well as a steady increase in the
        number of CD3&lt;+&gt;/CD8&lt;+&gt;/CD28? T cells. The in vitro
        data above show inhibition of antigen presentation using
        CD4&lt;+&gt; T cells, and FIGS. 8 and 9 show an increase in the
        number of circulating CD28&lt;-&gt; T cells (CD3&lt;+&gt; T
        cells).<br>
        <br>
        [0084] FIG. 10 illustrates an increase in phagocytosis index
        upon administration of WF10. FIG. 11 shows a decrease in immune
        function upon administration of WF10 by virtue of the decrease
        in CD14&lt;+&gt;/DR&lt;+&gt; cells. The inventors therefore
        believe that the stabilized chlorite solution of the invention
        is capable of up-regulating phagocytosis, while at the same
        time, down-regulating or suppressing the cell-mediated and
        humoral immune response.<br>
        <br>
        [0085] The results tabulated below summarize the data from 15
        patients and show the changes in various measured parameters
        between the 8thday and the 47thday of treatment. The 8thday
        represents the first day of WF10 administration because the
        first 7 days of treatment are devoted to patient evaluation.<br>

        <br>
        [0086] These data show that administration of WF10 in vivo to
        humans shows an increase in the production of CD28&lt;-&gt;
        subset of CD8&lt;+&gt; T-cells. The data also show an increase
        in macrophage activation leading to phagocytosis. The data
        further show no evidence of RBC hemolysis. When coupled with the
        in vitro studies showing the inhibition of antigen presentation
        for CD4&lt;+&gt; cells, it is believed that administration of
        WF-10 in vivo will result in inhibition and/or prevention of
        antigen presentation in APC, as well as stimulate macrophage
        activation resulting in increased phagocytosis.<br>
        <br>
        Example 6<br>
        <br>
        [0087] Based on the in vivo data above, administration of WF10
        has shown a consistent down regulation of
        CD14&lt;+&gt;/DR&lt;+&gt; cells achieving statistical
        significance. In addition, WF10 administration in vivo has shown
        overall reduction of CD3&lt;+&gt;/CD8&lt;+&gt;/CD28&lt;+&gt;
        cells, and significant increased levels of
        CD3&lt;+&gt;/CD8&lt;+&gt;/CD28&lt;-&gt; cells of long-term
        duration. The in vitro data above also show that WF10 is
        effective in inhibiting and/or preventing antigen presentation.
        This reduced antigen presentation may be critical in inhibiting
        lymphoproliferative disease, and in particular in inhibiting
        B-cell lymphoma and thus, it is expected that WHO therapy will
        be effective for treatment of lymphoma. In accordance with this
        expectation, in the case of a single patient suffering from
        B-cell lymphoma, the patient responded to WF10 therapy with a
        notable reduction of tumor size with no recurrence to date.<br>
        <br>
        [0088] Adult patients having low grade follicular lymphoma are

        open-label, single arm, single center study. Patients will
        receive periodic 0.5 ml/kg infusions of WF10 from days 1-5 (week
        1) and days 8-12 (week 2). After screening evaluations are
        completed (about 14 days), eligible patients will attend
        pre-study visit in week 0 to acquire the baseline data.<br>

        <p><b>SODIUM CHLORITE</b> </p>
        <p><b>The Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)</b> </p>
        <p><b>By Walter Last</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Sodium chlorite</b> is presently being promoted as a miracle
        mineral supplement or MMS with superior antimicrobial activity.
        You can appreciate its power from a statement by the discoverer
        of this remedy that all 75,000 individuals with malaria that
        have been treated were cured within a day, with 98% being cured
        within 4 hours (1).This obviously has great ramifications not
        only for self-healing but also for the drug industry and
        medicine. In the following I want to comment on these issues. </p>
      <p><b>Conventional Use of Sodium Chlorite</b> </p>
      <p>Acidified sodium chlorite is being used in many countries,
        including Australia and the USA, as an antimicrobial treatment
        in the food industry, for water purification, and for
        sterilizing hospital and clinic rooms and equipment. In
        hospitals it has been used as a disinfectant for a hundred years
        and in the US meat industry for about 50 years. Health-conscious
        countries and municipalities are increasingly replacing the
        health-damaging chlorine for the harmless chlorine dioxide in
        treating public water supplies (2). </p>
      <p>In solution sodium chlorite (NaClO2) is very alkaline and
        stable but when acidified it forms the gas chlorine dioxide
        (ClO2) which smells the same as chlorine and probably is the
        strongest all-round antimicrobial and parasite remedy. While it
        destroys all anaerobic microbes and parasites, it does not
        damage the beneficial lactobacteria of out intestinal flora. The
        only residue left in water, food, or in the body after treatment
        with MMS is a small amount of table salt or sodium chloride
        (NaCl). </p>
      <p>In 2003 the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code was
        changed to permit the use of sodium chlorite acidified with
        citric acid or other food acids for antimicrobial surface
        treatment of meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables (3). The
        time between mixing and application is less than 5 minutes, and
        chlorine dioxide levels do not exceed 3 ppm. The safety
        assessment report concluded that if properly used no residues
        would be detected in the raw foods following treatment and prior
        to sale, and therefore there would be no toxicological concerns.
      </p>
      <p>In solid form sodium chlorite is unstable and commonly mixed
        with about 20% sodium chloride. Commercially it is produced and
        shipped in Australia as a 31% solution in water. For end users
        in the food and agricultural industries it is available as a 5%
        solution called Vibrex. In the US and the UK it is also
        available as tablets that release chlorine dioxide (e.g.
        releasing 4 ppm per1 liter or per 30 liter of water). In Germany
        and Italy chlorine dioxide is the main treatment chemical for
        public water supplies. </p>
      <p>Curiously, stabilized sodium chlorite that does not generate
        chlorine dioxide has been patented for intravenous use in the
        treatment of autoimmune diseases, hepatitis and lymph cancers.
        It supposedly prevents or reduces antigen activity and
        autoimmune responses (4). </p>
      <p><b>The Discovery of MMS, the Miracle Mineral Supplement</b> </p>
      <p>Jim Humble, a chemist and metallurgist accidentally discovered
        the MMS by using a whole bottle of Stabilized Electrolytes of
        Oxygen (S.E.O.) to immediately cure a companion of malaria
        during a jungle expedition. S.E.O. contains about 3 % sodium
        chlorite. </p>
      <p>Humble gradually realized that S.E.O. is too weak and that it
        does not work by releasing oxygen but rather that it must be
        acidified to release chlorine dioxide as the active ingredient.
        This is also how it has been used as a hospital disinfectant.
        The problem was to find a safe dose and procedure that allowed
        this most effective antimicrobial to be used for people. Humble
        ended up using a nominally <b>28% solution which, because of a
          nearly 20% sodium chloride content, actually contains only
          22.4% sodium chlorite</b>. Because of its miraculous effect in
        supporting the immune system against invading microbes and
        parasites Humble called his sodium chlorite the Miracle Mineral
        Supplement. However, I prefer to call it Miracle Mineral
        Solution, as supplements require the approval of health
        authorities, while a solution for treating water does not need
        to be registered. </p>
      <p>Using this at a maximum dose of up to 3 x 15 drops he writes:
        ”MMS is producing some of the quickest results that I have seen
        with people's health, including cancer, diabetes, arthritis,
        shingles, warts going hard and dropping off, and many more.”
        Also AIDS patients in debilitated conditions went back to work
        without any further signs of disease (1). </p>
      <p>Basically all diseases associated with microbes and immune
        reactions respond very well, and that includes not only
        infections and autoimmune diseases but most of our diseases.
        Chlorine dioxide was used to kill Anthrax during the 2001
        Anthrax attack. Even most diseases that are not known to be
        associated with microbes and the immune system reportedly have
        improved (1). </p>
      <p>As an example of the unexpected results of using MMS, Humble
        relates the following incident: a teenage girl, overweight with
        depression and failure to develop breasts, was given MMS. The
        next day her breasts started to grow. After another dose 4 days
        later she had the first period after 6-months, her breasts were
        fully developed, her depression lifted, and she started losing
        weight (1). My interpretation of this is that all her problems
        were caused by Candida. </p>
      <p>Because of its strong oxidizing ability, chlorine dioxide seems
        to inactivate many poisons, may help with toothache, and makes
        stored heavy metals soluble so that they can more easily be
        expelled. Another advantage of chlorine dioxide as compared to
        chlorine is that it does not react with organic matter, such as
        food, body cells or even our “good” intestinal bacteria, but is
        specific in destroying pathogenic microbes. However, it does
        react with vitamin C and possibly other reactive antioxidants. </p>
      <p>If this treatment option would become widely known and used by
        the general population that would be devastating for the
        medical-pharmaceutical complex. The FDA has a long history of
        jailing and otherwise neutralizing inventors of effective
        natural remedies and therapies that harm the drug industry, and
        Humble, as an American, tries to protect himself by remaining in
        hiding in Africa or Central America. </p>
      <p><b>Usage Instructions</b> </p>
      <p>It should be stressed that MMS is not used to treat people but
        rather to purify water. We can then drink the purified water and
        receive a boost to our immune system as a consequence. The
        common recommendation is to start with 1 or 2 drops of MMS and
        gradually increase up to 15 drops three times a day. Mix the MMS
        with an acid activator. Most recommended is a 10% solution of
        citric acid in water which you may make yourself by dissolving 1
        spoonful of citric acid crystals in 9 parts of water. Citric
        acid tends to be available from supermarkets as an ingredient
        for baking. Acid activation releases chlorine dioxide. </p>
      <p>Lemon juice, lime juice or vinegar have been used as activator
        before it was found that 10% citric acid is much more effective.
        Cider vinegar may aggravate fungal problems but white vinegar is
        suitable. The usual recommendation is to add 5 times more acid
        than MMS. Drops from a standard glass eye dropper should be
        multiplied by 1.5 to equal the number of drops from the standard
        MMS bottle. However, different types of eye droppers, pipettes
        and bottle tops have different drop sizes, and you may
        standardize your dropper by counting how many drops from the MMS
        bottle and how many from your eye dropper are needed to fill a
        teaspoon or another suitable measure. One millilitre or ml of
        MMS contains 17 standard drops. A level teaspoon of MMS, lemon
        juice or 10% citric acid solution has about 80 drops. So a
        quarter teaspoon has about 20 drops. </p>
      <p>Therefore, for easier use the drops of the acid do not need to
        be counted, provided you make sure that you take more rather
        than less acid. When taking 15 drops of MMS you can mix it with
        a full teaspoon of acid, when taking 6 or 7 drops of MMS mix
        with half a teaspoon of acid, and generally take more or less
        acid according to the amount of MMS. Furthermore, 10% citric
        acid is about 5 times stronger than the other acids. Therefore
        to achieve the same results you may use more of the other acids
        compared to citric acid. The stronger the acid, the more
        chlorine dioxide is released within a short period. Therefore
        the chlorine dioxide smell is much stronger after acidifying
        with 10% citric acid, and equally the destructive effect on
        microbes and parasites is much higher. Therefore, difficult
        conditions, such as Lyme disease (caused by a virus transmitted
        by ticks) responded to 15 drops of MMS acidified with 10% citric
        acid but not if the other acids had been used. </p>
      <p>Generally you do not need to be too concerned with the
        mentioned numbers and sizes of drops. The general idea is to
        keep slowly increasing the amount of MMS until you have overcome
        your immune-related problem. </p>
      <p>Three minutes after adding the acid dilute with half a glass of
        water and additional herb tea, or juice without added vitamin C,
        e.g. apple or grape juice but not orange juice. Also cinnamon,
        on its own or with some honey stirred into the water, helps to
        disguise any unpleasant taste of the solution. The initial
        strong smell is now reduced as the chlorine dioxide remains
        dissolved in water rather than escaping into the air. Do not
        take any antioxidant supplements close to MMS. If it tastes too
        acid for you, then neutralize the liquid with sodium bicarbonate
        shortly before drinking. </p>
      <p>Drink the diluted MMS all at once or possibly spaced out in
        sips over an hour or two to minimize nausea. It acts best on an
        empty stomach but that also easily causes nausea. If that
        happens temporarily reduce the dose or have some food in the
        stomach. Alternatively you may take a dose, say 6 drops, and
        another 6 drops an hour later. Such a double dose seems to be
        more effective than a single dose two or three times during the
        day. The highest double dose would be with two times 15 drops,
        but few will be able to take this without vomiting. </p>
      <p>It may be best to take MMS just before going to bed. MMS works
        very fast, and people often become sleepy after taking a dose of
        MMS. Also, it is easier to cope with nausea if you can fall
        asleep. If you take MMS twice a day, take one of the doses in
        the evening before going to bed. However, some individuals
        experience the opposite effect and have difficulty falling
        asleep after taking MMS. </p>
      <p>Humble believes it is safe to give children MMS as needed for
        infections. The maximum dose for children, underweight or
        overweight individuals, is stated as 3 drops per 11.4 kg or 25
        pounds of body weight. I would instead use 2-3 drops per 12 kg
        as a maximum dose. </p>
      <p>For most conditions Humble regards the intensive MMS treatment
        as completed after taking 15 drops two or three times daily for
        one week. If you cannot reach this level then just remain
        somewhat longer at the highest dose that you can use.&nbsp;
        Following this Humble recommends a maintenance intake for older
        individuals of 6 drops daily and for younger individuals of 6
        drops twice weekly. </p>
      <p>My own preference is for a relatively high intake for several
        weeks twice a year or when indicated by a developing infection,
        and not using it for the rest of the time. However, this also
        depends on body conditions. For instance if someone has root
        canal fillings, bio-films on surgical implants or other microbe
        factories that cannot be immediately sanitised, then I would
        recommend several drops of MMS daily until the condition is
        rectified. Also if a sufficiently high dose cannot be reached to
        cleanse the body of harmful microbes and spores of microbes,
        then it may be preferable to remain for longer periods on a
        sufficiently low dose that does not cause discomfort. </p>
      <p><b>Different Conditions</b> </p>
      <p>With serious acute infections or poisonings, such as with
        malaria Humble recommends giving immediately 15 drops followed
        an hour later by another 15 drops. While most conditions tend to
        improve with a medium-dose taken over a long period, some
        parasitic and viral conditions seem to require at least one high
        double dose to get results. It seems that with life-threatening
        acute conditions a high double dose can be more easily handled
        than with chronic conditions. </p>
      <p>For chronic or long-standing conditions always increase the
        number of drops very slowly over a period of weeks. it is best
        to increase by 1 drop each day until you feel some nausea. The
        next day drop back by 2 drops and stay at this level for several
        days until increasing again by 1 drop a day. In this way you
        gradually work your way higher, reducing and then increasing
        again to keep nausea under control. You may reduce problems by
        dividing the daily dose into a morning and a bedtime portion,
        but after some time always try to edge higher until you start
        feeling the nausea. If you continue to encounter nausea whenever
        you raise the dose then just remain for a long time on a level
        that does not cause problems. Eventually nausea with vomiting or
        diarrhea may catch up with you anyway but it is better if that
        is at a high rather than a low level of MMS. </p>
      <p>With an acute infection you may start with 3 or 4 drops and
        increase quite rapidly, even if this means nausea, vomiting and
        diarrhoea. With severe parasite problems, such as malaria
        attack, or if one had taken a poison, or has food poisoning, or
        with snake bites, a high double dose of MMS will often help. </p>
      <p>For abscessed teeth, infected gums, and pyorrhea use 6 drops of
        acidified and diluted MMS and rinse for several minutes, for a
        sore throat gargle frequently. Finally you can add more water,
        tea or juice and drink it; experiment to find the dose that
        works for you. </p>
      <p>With sinus infections you may mix a drop with acid and several
        times sniff up the chlorine dioxide, first through one nostril
        and then through the other. However, this can be rather
        irritating to the mucous membranes. Therefore do this only very
        carefully. </p>
      <p>For inflammatory and infective skin conditions you may bathe or
        wash the affected area with suitably diluted acidified MMS. I
        have been told of a case where psoriasis went away after a few
        weeks of topical treatment. I would also use it internally as
        well as externally for all autoimmune diseases, including
        scleroderma, leukoderma/vitiligo and alopecia or
        autoimmune-related baldness. </p>
      <p>For burns Humble advises to squirt the MMS full strength
        straight out of the bottle all over the burn. Do not use the
        acid in this case. Very lightly with the tips of the fingers
        spread it completely over the burn. Let is remain there for only
        30 seconds to a minute. The acidic chemical in the burn is
        neutralized by the alkaline solution of the MMS. The pain stops
        immediately, within seconds. Wash the MMS off with water. You
        absolutely must wash it off or the burn will become worse. If
        you do this correctly, the burn will heal in about ¼ the usual
        time for a similar untreated burn. For sunburns he advises
        leaving the MMS on for 15 to 30 seconds and then rinse off with
        water. </p>
      <p>To reduce nausea, but also with bowel cancer or inflammatory
        bowel conditions you my try using it activated in half a liter
        of water as a retention enema. Use another enema beforehand to
        clean the bowels, or use a laxative to clean out. With cancer of
        the uterus/cervix/ovaries you may also try inserting the
        activated solution in a non-irritating concentration. </p>
      <p>With colds the MMS kills the virus but does not stop the
        beneficial mucus release. This can be stopped with the Sugar
        Cure: Keep a teaspoon of fine sugar in the mouth until it is
        dissolved, then spit out and take another teaspoonful. Continue
        with this for one or two hours and repeat on subsequent days as
        required. The sugar draws mucus combined with lymph fluid from
        the lymph glands and so gradually clears the headspaces. </p>
      <p><b>Side Effects and Problems</b> </p>
      <p>Individuals may find it difficult to continue with the MMS
        program because of frequent nausea. This is especially a problem
        with advanced cancer and other long-term conditions. Therefore I
        generally recommend a program of intestinal sanitation and
        antimicrobial therapy with milder agents before starting MMS
        therapy. This will remove most of the toxic load with less
        discomfort than by starting immediately with MMS. As part of
        this preliminary program I recommend a 3-week course of Lugol’s
        solution or a less concentrated form of aqueous iodine, and
        finally a course of water that has been purified with MMS. For
        instructions see the Ultimate Cleanse at
        www.health-science-spirit.com/ultimatecleanse.html. </p>
      <p>Some individuals with advanced degenerative diseases become
        very weak on MMS seemingly unrelated to die-back reactions. I
        believe that this is due to antioxidant deficiency, and
        especially to lack of glutathione. In this case take 1 gram of
        N-Acetyl Cysteine daily to stimulate glutathione production.
        This also helps to expel toxic minerals. </p>
      <p>Commonly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea will occur sooner or
        later and are beneficial for cleaning out. Sometimes also other
        reactions, such as inflammations may temporarily occur. To stop
        nausea you may take 1000 mg or more of vitamin C, but this also
        stops the antimicrobial activity. Other methods that may help
        against nausea are vitamin B6, ginger, pressing 2-3 cm below the
        wrist in the middle of the underarm, and also reflexology:
        pressing the foot reflex for the stomach - just below the joint
        of the big toes, press against a pointed stone/rock, step or
        corner of some furniture. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, I found that much of the nausea can be relieved by
        cleaning out the bowels before taking the drops or immediately
        when nausea starts. This may be done with an enema or colonic,
        or by taking a suitable laxative before the nausea starts. In
        addition with bowel cancer or inflammatory bowel conditions you
        may try using activated MMS in half a liter of water as a
        retention enema. Use another enema beforehand to clean the
        bowels, or use a laxative to clean out. With cancer of the
        uterus/cervix/ovaries you may also try inserting the activated
        solution in a non-irritating concentration. </p>
      <p>In the case of cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis it
        has been suggested that with MMS therapy cholesterol deposits
        may be removed too fast and lead to a weakening of the affected
        blood vessels. To avoid or minimize problems Dr Matthias Rath
        recommends taking high amounts of vitamin C, up to 10 g daily in
        divided doses, for several weeks before starting MMS therapy.
        This is to strengthen the blood vessels and make them more
        elastic.&nbsp; Some other nutrients to improve elasticity are
        lemon juice, green juices, copper salicylate, magnesium
        chloride, MSM, and N-Acetylglucosamine. In the case of cancer I
        also recommend using additional therapies as recommended by
        natural therapists, for example see the 8-part program in
        www.health-science-spirit.com/diseases.html. </p>
      <p><b>Oxidants versus Antioxidants</b> </p>
      <p>Besides nausea also inflammations may arise as a side effect of
        MMS therapy. To understand this effect we need to have a look at
        the function of inflammation and the role of oxidants and
        antioxidants in this process. Inflammations increase blood and
        nutrient supply to an area and are essential for the immune
        system to work and for healing of damaged organs and tissue to
        occur. If the immune system is not strong enough to eliminate
        invading microbes and diseased body cells, originally healing
        immune inflammations become destructive chronic inflammations,
        and this is a symptom of our present epidemic of chronic
        diseases. </p>
      <p>Oxidants support the immune system by killing microbes outright
        and by giving the immune system more firepower. This results in
        increased inflammation when using strong oxidants such as
        chlorine dioxide. Therefore as during any real health
        improvement various healing reactions, including temporary
        inflammations, may develop during MMS treatment. This is
        beneficial for healing in the long-term even if uncomfortable in
        the short-term. For a more detailed explanation of this process
        called a healing crisis or healing reaction see
        www.health-science-spirit.com/healingcrisis.html. </p>
      <p>The reverse of this process, the suppression of inflammation,
        can be seen in the conventional medical approach of using
        anti-inflammatory steroids in the treatment of autoimmune
        diseases. It is my experience that such diseases may be overcome
        within weeks or months using natural approaches, but when
        steroidal drugs are used at the same time, it is much more
        difficult to make headway. In this case any increased immune
        activity that results in increased inflammation is blocked by
        steroidal drugs. However, it is not advisable to greatly reduce
        any anti-inflammatory drugs until the intestines and infected
        teeth have been sanitized, and until after antimicrobial
        therapy. </p>
      <p>Antioxidants have the opposite role to oxidants. They protect
        our body cells and functions from being oxidized. Oxidation
        needs to take place only in well established and protected
        pathways to generate energy or to eliminate invaders and harmful
        agents. If we step up the intake of oxidants, we also need to
        increase the intake of antioxidants otherwise we may get
        unnecessary inflammations due to irritation of tissues and other
        degenerative changes. An example of this is deteriorating
        eyesight that may occur when using high doses of MMS for more
        than a few days. </p>
      <p>Antioxidant deficiency is common with chronic diseases and
        advancing age. High intake or prolonged use of MMS will make
        this situation worse. Therefore it is important to increase
        antioxidant intake when using MMS. However, oxidants and
        antioxidants should be separated during the day or they may
        neutralize each other. For instance you may be using MMS before
        breakfast and at bedtime and antioxidants from mid-morning to
        the evening meal. </p>
      <p>This does not only apply to antioxidants in supplement form,
        such as vitamin C and E, B-complex, coenzyme Q10 or grapeseed
        extract, but also to food high in antioxidants, such as purple
        berries and juices, fresh fruit, polyunsaturated oils, turmeric,
        black or green tea, cocoa and others. Because chlorine dioxide
        reacts especially well with vitamin C, it is advisable to take 1
        gram or more when on a high dose of MMS for more than a few days
        to protect oxidation-sensitive structures, such as heart, brain
        and eyes. </p>
      <p>Overdose of sodium chlorite: Anyone who has consumed more than
        ½ teaspoon of the miracle mineral solution should immediately
        begin drinking water, as much as possible. It is best to add ½
        teaspoon each of bicarbonate of soda and sodium ascorbate to
        each glass of water or whichever is available. After drinking
        plenty of water you may also try to induce vomiting. </p>
      <p>Before using MMS, especially in case of serious health
        problems, you may also look for the latest updates and technical
        instructions (1). For distributors see the Internet; in the US
        visit www.globallight.net/Mms_86.html, in Canada
        www.health4allinfo.ca, and inAustralia www.strideintohealth.com.
        Keep MMS protected from direct sunlight. </p>

      <p><b>1. Telling if MMS will help the cancer -- and MMS cancer
          protocol</b> </p>
      <p>Here is something your doctor will never tell you, there has
        been a medical test for cancer that is 99% effective for more
        than 25 years.&nbsp; It is more effective, less dangerous and
        cheaper than all other medical cancer tests.&nbsp;
        It&amp;rsquo;s called AMAS cancer test. You don&amp;rsquo;t have
        to go to a doctor; the test is available on the Internet.&nbsp;
        The cost is $165.&nbsp; The kit is free, you take a smear of
        your own blood and send it in and pay when the results are
        ready. The test is for specific cancer antibodies that will be
        present. Go to <a href="http://www.oncolabinc.com"
          ">www.oncolabinc.com</a>. I have no financial
        interest what so ever. </p>
      <p>You can get an idea if the MMS will handle the problem by
        evaluating the nausea.&nbsp; That is, if you start out at say
        one drop or even 1/2 drop and it does not make you&nbsp;
        nauseous and then you begin to increase the drops twice a day
        once in the morning and once in the evening.&nbsp; That is if
        1/2 drop doesn't make you nauseous in the morning, then in the
        evening or late afternoon try one full drop.&nbsp; Then the next
        morning take two drops and in the evening 3 drops.&nbsp; Sooner
        or later the number of drops is going to make you
        nauseous.&nbsp; You then take a drop or two less the next dose
        for a time or two and continue to increase the drops.&nbsp; You
        are always looking for the nauseous point, taking less for a
        time or two and attempting to take more. </p>
      <p>You will be able to know if it is going to help you if you can
        continue to pass the nausea point and increase the drops.&nbsp;
        What is happening is that when nausea hits, some of the cancer
        has been destroyed and it is now a poison that the body can
        clear out.&nbsp; Being able to clear out this poison is a part
        of it.&nbsp; The body can clear this poison out but it might
        generate some nausea in the process, or diarrhea or even
        vomiting.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s not bad.&nbsp; The idea
        is that as the cancer is destroyed the body must clean out the
        poisons.&nbsp; As the cancer is destroyed the body can tolerate
        more and more drops.&nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s the indicator, is
        the body being able to tolerate more and more drops?&nbsp; If
        you find that you finally can increase the drops without getting
        nauseous it is an indicator that the body is doing it's job. </p>
      <p>In the case of cancer, you have got to work at it.&nbsp; You
        start out slowly but increase quickly.&nbsp; At first you might
        just take the drops twice a day, but as you find you can do it
        twice a day without nausea, then increase to three times a day,
        and then four, and even as much as five times a day. </p>
      <p>What would indicate that you are not getting well is if the
        body got nauseous every time you take a dose no matter what
        amount of dose it is, and the body never seems to be able to
        increase the doses without nausea.&nbsp; If you can take say two
        drops at a time without nausea and you get nausea when you go to
        three drops, you may have to tolerate the nausea for a short
        time, but if the nausea always occurs when you take three drops,
        it shows that you are not gaining on the cancer.&nbsp; That can
        happen if the cancer is growing faster than the MMS is killing
        it.&nbsp; There is, however, always hope.&nbsp; One way would be
        instead of increasing the number of drops,&nbsp; increase the
        number of times that you take drops during the day. Read
        below.&nbsp; There are other items that can help. Never,
        however, in any case stop taking the MMS. </p>
      <p>So if there is an indication that one is not improving, then I
        suggest the following direction.&nbsp; Purchase some Indian Herb
        from Kathleen in texas.&nbsp; It costs $60&nbsp; a vial and that
        is plenty. Phone 806 647?1741 She has a thousand letters from
        people who have been helped.&nbsp; She and her father have been
        selling the Indian herb for over 60 years.&nbsp; When you get
        this herb use it with the MMS to get the best results. </p>
      <p><b>The AMAS cancer test listed above gives anyone a fantastic
          advantage.&nbsp;</b> One can do a test, use the MMS for
        several weeks or a month and then do a second test to see how
        much improvement has taken place or to see if any improvement
        has happened at all. </p>
      <p>When I mention drops of MMS I always mean add 5 times that many
        drops of lemon, lime, or citric acid solution, wait three
        minutes and then add 1/3 to 2/3 glass of water or juice and
        drink. Never use MMS without the addition of lemon, lime, or
        citric acid or in an emergency if you have no citric acids, use
        vinegar.&nbsp; Use only apple, grape, or pineapple juice without
        added vitamin C or ascorbic acid or see #6 below for overcoming
        the taste. </p>
      <p><b>2. The Standard MMS Protocol</b> </p>
      <p>Note: When following the instructions below, keep this
        paragraph in mind. Always activate the MMS drops with one of the
        food acids, either lemon juice drops, or lime juice drops, or
        citric acid solution drops (to make citric acid solution add 1
        level tablespoon of citric acid and 9 tablespoons of water.
        Store it in a bottle with a lid.) Always use 5 drops of one of
        these food acids to each one drop of MMS, mix in a empty dry
        glass and wait at least 3 minutes, then add 1/3 to 2/3 glass of
        water or juice and drink. (You can expand the 3 minutes out to
        10 minutes, and after adding the juice or water you can wait up
        to an hour before drinking.) </p>
      <p>1. All protocol for taking MMS in the Americas starts with one
        or two drops. Never start with more than one or two drops.
        People who are very sick and/or sensitive should start with ½
        drop. Activate the drops as given above. </p>
      <p>2. If you do OK and do not notice nausea on the first dose,
        increase by one drop for the second dose. If you notice nausea
        reduce the amount of MMS for the next dose. Do two doses a day,
        one in the morning and one in the evening. Continue to increase
        by one drop each time you take a new dose. When you notice
        nausea, reduce the dose by one drop, or bad diarrhea reduce by 2
        or 3 drops. Usually reduce for one or two times before going
        back the amount that it took to make you nauseous. </p>
      <p><i>Note</i>: If you notice diarrhea, or even vomiting that is
        not a bad sign. The body is simply throwing off poisons and
        cleaning itself out. Everyone says that they feel much better
        after the diarrhea. You do not have to take any medicine for the
        diarrhea. It will go away as fast as it came. It will not last.
        It is not real diarrhea as the body is just cleaning out, and it
        is not caused by bacteria or virus. When the poison is gone, the
        diarrhea is gone. </p>
      <p>3. Continue to follow the procedure given in 2 above. Until you
        reach 15 drops twice a day without nausea. At that point
        increase to 3 times a day. Stay at 3 times a day for at least
        one week and then reduce the drops to 4 to 6 drops a day for
        older people and 4 to 6 drops twice a week for younger people. </p>
      <p>Note: Once you have completed step 3 above most of the viral,
        bacteria, mold, and yeast load will be gone from your body. Your
        body will be clean. You no longer have to worry about feeding
        the microorganism load. You can base you diet on nutrition,
        rather than not feeding the load. The diabetes will be gone,
        thus you no longer need to worry about sugar. You won't have to
        worry about the pancreas over reacting thus giving you a shock
        of insulin. Instead it will give you just enough insulin to
        knock the blood sugar lever to the right level (You won't feel
        sleepy after eating a candy bar). Your body will then be able to
        easily adsorb vitamins and minerals and many other nutrients it
        might have been missing up to this time. You should feel better
        as time goes by. Do not quit taking the MMS. </p>
      <p><i>For Children:</i> The protocol for children is essentially
        the same. One should usually start at 1/2 drop. Just make a one
        drop drink and pour out 1/2 of the drink before giving it to the
        child. Then increase from 1 to 2 to 3 drops as given above, but
        do not go beyond 3 drops for each 25 pounds (11.4 kg) of body
        weight. With a baby start with 1/2 drop and increase to one drop
        up to 2 drops, but no more. So if you give 1/2 drop in the
        morning wait until the afternoon before giving 1 drop and then
        the next morning for 2 drops. It the baby or child should become
        nauseous wait an extra hour or two before giving another dose
        and also give a smaller dose. Give smaller doses until the baby
        or child can tolerate more, but do not stop giving doses. </p>
      <p><b>3. Clara's 6 and 6 Protocol</b> </p>
      <p>For people who have pain, flu, colds, pneumonia, or other
        diseases that are <u>not</u> generally considered
        incurable.&nbsp; When people are very sick and in bed they
        should use the standard protocol #2 above and start out with a
        tiny dose. </p>
      <p>I've named this new protocol Clara's because she was the first
        to really apply it consistently. You may have read the last
        chapter in the second edition of the book <i>The Miracle
          Mineral Supplement of the 21st Century </i>for sale on this
        Web Site (miraclemineral.org) You will recall that there were a
        number of success stories about Clara treating people in her
        home.&nbsp; Since then I have rented an office from Clara and
        her mother and I have seen quite a few more people come
        in.&nbsp; Last night 12/14/07 a lady about 65 years old and her
        husband arrived to buy some MMS and Clara always gives them a 6
        drop dose, has them wait one hour, and then she has them mix the
        next dose to make sure that they have it right.&nbsp; Then she
        has them wait a few minutes up to an hour before they leave. </p>
      <p>Both the right hand and the right foot of the lady that came in
        last night was completely paralyzed.&nbsp; She came in with a
        walker but she could not hold on to the walker so her husband
        had to hold her to the walker.&nbsp; It was a chore getting in
        the door.&nbsp; Clara gave her a 6 drop dose with 30 drops of
        citric acid as the activator, she waited the 3 minutes as always
        and then added 1/2 glass of water and handed it to the
        lady.&nbsp; The lady lifted the glass with with some difficultly
        to her mouth with her left hand as her sciatica (lower back
        pain) was also paining her.&nbsp; Within 40 minutes she was
        starting to feel a reduction of pain in her back and some
        tingling in her hand.&nbsp; At 60 minutes she could slightly
        move several fingers.&nbsp; Clara handed her another 6 drop
        identical drink.&nbsp; As we waited for the second hour to pass,
        Clara called me in from the office.&nbsp; The lady was
        exercising her hand.&nbsp; She had complete mobility in her hand
        and she had her shoe off and was exercising her toes.&nbsp; In
        fact she was exercising her entire foot and she could move her
        toes and other muscles better than most people I know.&nbsp;
        When she left, she was still using the walker, but her husband
        didn't have to help her and her lower back pain was gone.&nbsp;
        I could see that she would be walking without that walker in a
        few days.&nbsp; This is not unusual.&nbsp; It happens around
        here all the time. </p>
      <p><b>So this is&nbsp; "Clara's 6 and 6 protocol" for MMS.&nbsp;
          It is simple.&nbsp; It's for most conditions.</b> </p>
      <p><i>Step No. 1.</i> Put 6 drops of MMS in a glass and add 30
        drops of 10% solution of citric acid, or 30 drops of lemon
        juice, or 30 drops of lime juice.&nbsp; Shake the glass so that
        the acid and MMS are mixed and wait at least 3 minutes.&nbsp; A
        little longer is OK in case you walked away and forgot. 10 or 15
        minutes would be OK as the solution remains at about the same
        strength. Then add about 1/2 glass of water to the solution and
        drink.&nbsp; You can also use a juice that does not have added
        vitamin C.&nbsp; Use apple juice, grape juice, pineapple juice,
        or cranberry juice. </p>
      <p><i>Step No. 2.</i> Wait one hour and do exactly the same thing
        as in step No. 1.&nbsp; Normally the person will experience some
        relief within two hours of taking the first dose especially if
        he goes ahead and takes the second dose.&nbsp; Of course, here
        is no guarantee.&nbsp; If the person does or does not experience
        relief he should go to 7 and 7 that is a 7 drop dose and in one
        hour a second 7 drop dose, but he should do this only if he did
        not get sick. By getting sick I'd mean that he was nauseous for
        more than 10 minutes or he vomited, or he had diarrhea. In the
        case he did get sick you should not increase to 7 and 7, but
        rather again do 6 and 6.&nbsp; If he was very sick it would be
        best to drop back more, such as 3 and 3, but that seldom
        happens. Normally do 6 and 6 until one can tolerate it without
        being nauseous, and then begin increasing to 7 and 7, etc. </p>
      <p>In all cases one should begin increasing towards 15 and 15 or
        he could revert to the Standard protocol as given above and
        increase as quickly as reasonable to 15 drops and then increase
        to 15 drops twice a day or 3 times a day for one week as
        explained below. </p>
      <p>The general goal of the number of drops that anyone should take
        is 15 drops 2 or 3 times a day and of course, less for children.
        For children normally it would be 3 drops for each 25 pounds
        (11.4 KG) of body weight. This number of drops, 15, would be OK
        <b>twice</b> a day for a grown up that weighed 150 pounds (68.1
        KG) or less and 15 drops <b>three</b> times a day for a grown
        up weighing over 150 pounds. <b>This number of drops pretty
          well ensures that one's body is completely free of pathogenic
          microorganisms and heavy metals.</b>&nbsp; Once one has
        reached this goal for a week, he should drop back to a
        maintenance level of one 6 drop dose twice a week.&nbsp; (In all
        cases when drops of MMS are mentioned we also mean that 5 drops
        of lemon, or lime, or citric solution is added for each 1 drop
        of MMS&nbsp; and one then waits 3 minutes before adding water or
        juice and consuming it.) </p>
      <p>Of course, the goal of it all is not being sick.&nbsp; So take
        6 drops twice a week.&nbsp; If you feel the flu coming on, then
        do the Clara 6 and 6 protocol as described above.&nbsp; You will
        have the flu for no more that 12 to 24 hours and usually less
        than 6 hours after taking your 2nd dose.&nbsp; That's not enough
        power to do you harm. The 6 drops twice a week keeps your immune
        system strong and the pathogens weak.&nbsp; You probably
        remember from school that there are always pathogens in your
        body.&nbsp; The 6 drops keeps them at bay. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Jim Humble</b> discovered a simple health drink cure for
        malaria in South America during a prospecting venture.&nbsp;
        When he returned from the prospecting trip he worked on the
        health drink formula for several years sending it to friends in
        Africa who were able to use it in the field.&nbsp; Eventually a
        missionary group invited him to Africa where he personally
        treated over 2000 malaria victims and those he trained while
        there treated over 75,000 malaria cases. </p>
      <p>The formula was a simple health drink that had already been
        used for years for other reasons.&nbsp; Jim drastically improved
        the effectiveness by adding a few drops of vinegar to the
        drink.&nbsp; Since that time thousands of cases of many
        different diseases have been treated with complete success. </p>
      <p>Jim brought the treatment to the world.&nbsp; His book not only
        gives complete details of his work, but it also has a chapter,
        written by Dr. Hesselink, listing over 160 scientific papers
        describing more than 100,000 scientific tests using essentially
        the same formula that Jim used and still uses.&nbsp; These tests
        verify all of Jim's basic concepts covering&nbsp; mostly data
        concerning malaria. </p>
      <p>Jim started his career in the Aerospace industry where he
        quickly became a research engineer. He worked on the first
        intercontinental missile, the moon vehicle, wrote instruction
        manuals for the first vacuum tube computers, set up experiments
        for A-bomb explosions, worked on secret radio control
        electronics, set up experiments in electrical generation by
        magneto hydro dynamics, complete wired the first machine to be
        controlled by computers at Hughes aircraft company and invented
        the first automatic garage door opener. </p>
      <p>In the mining field he wrote 4 books updating older technology
        and improving the health hazards for those involved.&nbsp; He
        first overcome the hazards of mercury and then he invented ways
        of eliminating mercury from mining altogether.&nbsp; His
        technology including methods of eliminating chemical leaching
        finally using nothing but water for the recovery of gold. </p>
      <p>Jim's immediate goal is to return to Africa to eliminate all of
        the malaria in a single African nation in order to prove to the
        world that it is possible.<br>

      <br>
      In early 2008 Nexus published an article about the discovery by
      Jim Humble that the proper use of chlorine dioxide could lead to a
      malaria cure. It triggered an phenomenal level of interest, which
      resulted in large-scale reader experimentation. The reported
      results from readers and users across the world were of amazing
      successes with a huge range of diseases and conditions. (See
      Nexus, volume 15, number 2). A year later we updated the article
      with yet more health information, and again received a flood of
      testimonies from happy readers. In other words, the stuff works
      folks. Simple as that...<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Drama:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It was a long weekend, I had a bad night's sleep. Even though it
      was a public holiday I went to work to check the email. An email
      from Herman in Holland was advising that Laura Knight-Jadzyck had
      pulled out of the conference, was accusing Jim Humble of being a
      conman, fraud and hoaxer, and was accusing Nexus Magazine of being
      a cointelpro outfit. These public slanders were appearing on the
      SOTT website, on their Focus page; and on her Facebook page. I hit
      the roof and vented my rage on her Facebook page. Not a very
      mature thing to do, nor is what I said very polite or mature. But
      stuff it, I was being attacked by someone I had considered an
      ally. I had ignored the rumours that she was a fraud, and if
      anything, tended to think the rumours were evidence she was doing
      a good job. Ditto with Jim Humble...<br>
      <br>
      Laura and Joe have distorted many pieces of key information about
      what happened regarding the Nexus Conference fiasco, and their
      mindless followers have lapped it up. I am now seen as the
      aggressor in all this, and my actions are being used as evidence
      that Laura is under attack from cointelpro forces - and thus by
      default, Laura must be 'right' and is a 'threat' to the system.<br>
      <br>
      I surrender guys - you cannot argue with the deliberate
      distortions of the SOTT leaders, nor with their mindless
      followers.<br>
      <br>
      To any 'normal' people reading this - I'm only human, I had a bad
      day and called Laura nasty names (like: fatso, freak lard-arse,
      mindless and more). I confess I was so pissed off that I couldn't
      even type properly. My bad day will be used by SOTT forever as
      evidence that I am a cointelpro operation, that MMS is dangerous
      and needs to be removed from the market, and that Jim Humble is an
      evil conman. Go figure!<br>
      <br>
      If I were to apologise to anyone, it would not be to Laura, or her
      followers, it would be to the people out there like Roy (Roysta) -
      ie people who know I am capable of behaving better, and were let
      down.<br>

      dangerous allopathic drug<br>

      <br>
      The analogy of a chemotherapeutic drug hits the nail on the head.
      The way MMS is promoted in the alternative health area is quite
      irresponsible, it is clearly not a natural solution!<br>
      <br>
      "Death in Paradise":<br>
      <br>
      "People who drink MMS are consuming chlorine dioxide, a bleach
      added to drinking water and swimming pools and used to prepare
      some foods, such as flour. Because it is highly explosive, it must
      be mixed by adding citric acid to sodium chlorite from an MMS kit
      on site, before it is imbibed.<br>
      <br>
      The product's American creator, Jim Humble, describes himself
      variously as a scientist, prospector and saviour of the human race
      who discovered the substance's powers while looking for gold in a
      South American rainforest in 1996.<br>
      <br>
      In 2007, says the promotional blurb, ''this man heroically stepped
      out of the shadows to make this information and natural solution
      freely available to all humanity''.<br>
      <br>
      ''He believes the long-term availability of this substance … may
      soon be heavily controlled by 'the powers that be'.'' At $US20 a
      bottle, Humble claims 200,000 Americans are now using it to cure
      everything from cancer to HIV to swine flu.<br>
      <br>
      Nash, meanwhile, has spent his months in Vanuatu warning the world
      about Humble's elixir.<br>
      <br>
      His letter to friends was published by a US magazine and on
      alternative health websites, sparking a cyberspace barney.
      Devotees swore by its healing powers. Critics linked it to other
      deaths."<br>

      The fact of the matter is that MMS is VERY DANGEROUS. It may have
      helped some people, but is essentially poison to the human
      organism and kills the good with the bad. It can be likened to
      chemotherapy in this respect. Also, like chemotherapy, MMS is
      considered an option by many already very ill and weakened
      individuals. The difference is that MMS, unlike chemotherapy, is
      recommended to almost anyone with even a case of the cold and
      these people are advised NOT to talk with their doctors about the
      treatment.<br>

      Product contains industrial strength bleach<br>
      <br>
      SILVER SPRING, Md., July 30 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to take
      Miracle Mineral Solution, an oral liquid solution also known as
      "Miracle Mineral Supplement" or "MMS."&nbsp; The product, when
      used as directed, produces an industrial bleach that can cause
      serious harm to health.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA has received several reports of health injuries from
      consumers using this product, including severe nausea, vomiting,
      and life-threatening low blood pressure from dehydration.<br>
      <br>
      Consumers who have MMS should stop using it immediately and throw
      it away.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      MMS is distributed on Internet sites and online auctions by
      multiple independent distributors. Although the products share the
      MMS name, the look of the labeling may vary.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The product instructs consumers to mix the 28 percent sodium
      chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice.&nbsp; This
      mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent bleach used for
      stripping textiles and industrial water treatment. High oral doses
      of this bleach, such as those recommended in the labeling, can
      cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe
      dehydration.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      MMS claims to treat multiple unrelated diseases, including HIV,
      hepatitis, the H1N1 flu virus, common colds, acne, cancer, and
      other conditions. The FDA is not aware of any research that MMS is
      effective in treating any of these conditions. MMS also poses a
      significant health risk to consumers who may choose to use this
      product for self-treatment instead of seeking FDA-approved
      treatments for these conditions.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The FDA continues to investigate and may pursue civil or criminal
      enforcement actions as appropriate to protect the public from this
      potentially dangerous product.<br>
      <br>
      The FDA advises consumers who have experienced any negative side
      effects from MMS to consult a health care professional as soon as
      possible and to discard the product.&nbsp; Consumers and health
      care professionals should report adverse events to the FDA's
      MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088 or online at
      www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.<br>

        </b><b> Sarah Cain&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      6 August 2010<br>
      <br>
      Introduction<br>
      <br>
      On the 30th of July, I browsed through my e-mail messages to make
      a startling discovery.&nbsp; We had received a message from none
      other than Jim "MMS" Humble.&nbsp; After a brief moment of eye
      rubbing, to ensure that I had not been hallucinating, I eagerly
      read his message and then shared it with Thomas.&nbsp; Humble was
      upset about the unflattering findings that our research uncovered
      about his cash cow, which I chronicled in the article, Another
      Fraud Of Alternative Medicine: M.M.S..<br>
      <br>
      His message thusly began:<br>
      <br>
      Thomas and Sarahlcain,<br>
      <br>
      In looking this site over I find quite a lot of useful
      information.&nbsp; Thus I wondered if you might be interested in
      opening a dialogue concerning what I am doing since there is a lot
      of inaccuracies in you information about my stuff, MMS, that is if
      you know who I am.<br>
      <br>
      I have no animosity towards those of you who talk as you do.&nbsp;
      Possibly we could have an amiable dialogue.<br>
      <br>
      up to you<br>
      <br>
      Jim Humble<br>
      <br>
      Thomas replied with:<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Humble,<br>
      <br>
      Yes, we did plenty of research into M.M.S., so we are familiar
      with you.&nbsp; There are two possibilities that I see here: 1.
      You really believe in what you are doing or 2. you have real
      guts.&nbsp; It is possibly both.<br>
      <br>
      We take our work very seriously.&nbsp; Seeking the truth is one of
      our highest objectives: just behind 'first do no harm'.&nbsp; We
      would never print anything that we were not absolutely certain was
      true.&nbsp; Not only are there moral issues at play; but moreover,
      our credibility is always on the line.<br>
      <br>
      If you would like a chance to debate us, in order to demonstrate
      that we have been wrong, then I suggest we do it out in the
      open.&nbsp; Let's not debate privately in the shadows, because
      complete openness and honesty are principals that we value, and
      because this issue has the potential to have a massive impact on
      the lives of our readers.&nbsp; We normally would not make such an
      offer to someone who we so strongly feel is harming people, but I
      get the overwhelming impression that you sincerely believe in what
      you are doing.&nbsp; Your noble intentions have earned you some
      karma in my opinion.<br>
      <br>
      If an open and public debate seems agreeable to you, then we will
      need to agree to some basic rules, like how long our debate should
      last, and how long the replies may be.&nbsp; I will do no editing
      on your replies, unless you want me to.&nbsp; Perhaps I could use
      a picture of us and a picture of you at the top, if that's
      okay.&nbsp; Readers really like that sort of personal touch, and
      it draws them into the story.<br>
      <br>
      -- Thomas Corriher<br>
      <br>
      Jim Humble accepted the challenge, so here we are with the debate
      for all to see.&nbsp; We play no games and have very few secrets
      here.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. Humble did not do the same.&nbsp;
      Immediately after accepting our challenge, we suddenly and
      coincidentally began getting flooded with pro-MMS e-mails and
      article comments from people pretending to be concerned average
      Joes and regular readers of The Health Wyze Report.&nbsp; Mr.
      Humble and his sock puppet partners apparently believe that we are
      as naïve as M.M.S. customers are, despite the work that we have
      already done in exposing him.&nbsp; This MMS brigade has flooded
      countless online forums with deceptive astroturf messages in an
      attempt to convince everyone that M.M.S. is a legitimate medicine,
      and that people all over the world are using it safely every day
      to cure any and every ailment.&nbsp; Some of these posts even
      claim that it is doctor recommended by phantom doctors who do not
      seem to exist, even though it is not approved for human
      consumption (much less medicine) in any country in the
      world.&nbsp; Until we began getting such messages recently, a part
      of me wanted to believe that he meant well, and might actually
      conduct himself in an honorable manner.&nbsp; Further aggravation
      was caused by the fact that I have a personal problem with anyone
      who makes a habit of insulting our intelligence; especially
      concerning those who have not the intellectual resources to do
      it.&nbsp; Yes, that's a personal problem, and now all of you know
      that it is one of my buttons.<br>
      <br>
      I suppose that we should have expected the behavior that he
      demonstrated from his well known reputation as a con artist; but
      whenever someone writes that he wants to begin a peaceful and
      friendly relationship, then a part of me really wants to believe
      it.&nbsp; I want people to be good and to do the right things, and
      it breaks my heart that it is so rare.&nbsp; In regard to Humble's
      infamous reputation, just look him up on the Internet for
      yourself.&nbsp; Readers will notice that he, and his business
      partners, are all over flooding forums with dishonest astroturf
      messages in an attempt to convince us that M.M.S. is legitimate
      medicine.&nbsp; The number of messages from people clearly hiding
      their identities and their exaggerated claims grow every time that
      we look.&nbsp; The usual pattern is that you don't need anything
      except M.M.S., because it does everything from cancer to AIDS, and
      it even makes a person stronger than Popeye.&nbsp; The M.M.S.
      claims are flabbergasting, but they barely compare to Humble's
      claims about himself.<br>
      <br>
      Did you know that Humble is single-handedly wiping out malaria in
      Africa?&nbsp; All the Africans had to do was drink his bleach-like
      'miracle' solution, and suddenly their malaria symptoms were not
      so noticeable anymore.&nbsp; Isn't that like hitting oneself on
      the toe with a hammer in order to forget a tooth ache?&nbsp; Now
      that's what we call 'medical progress' at HealthWyze.&nbsp; We are
      still waiting for the proof of Humble's 'miracles', but that data
      is just too suppressed to ever get out; according to Humble, that
      is.&nbsp; Convenient, isn't it?&nbsp; In the meantime, we'll just
      have to bank on Humble's integrity.<br>
      <br>
      Believe it or not, that's not all that Humble has
      accomplished.&nbsp; According to one of his marketing sites, "Jim"
      is a former aerospace engineer.&nbsp; We figure he builds full
      scale space shuttles in his back yard, but that's not all!&nbsp;
      He also helped the moon missions by designing the lunar
      rovers.&nbsp; This just the beginning of Jim's glory.&nbsp; He
      helped design the first atomic bombs too, so he was likely
      personal friends with Albert Einstein.&nbsp; I must wonder if he
      constantly insulted Einstein's intelligence too.&nbsp; He also
      made the first satellite remote control digital logic circuits at
      Huges Aerospace Corp., and then he innovated analog electronics
      too, by documenting how forgone vacuum tube based computers
      work.&nbsp; He did that last task for the less gifted, little
      people.<br>
      <br>
      On the topic of his MMS websites, there are some unique patterns
      to them.&nbsp; All of them pretend to be made by independent 3rd
      parties, yet virtually all of them are hosted with Bluehost.&nbsp;
      That's just a coincidence, of course.&nbsp; If that were not
      enough of a coincidence, then how about the fact that each of
      these sites hides the person who registered their DNS (dot.com
      name) by using the anonymous Domains By Proxy service?&nbsp;
      Indeed, the 'Miracle Mineral Solution' web sites' network 'whois'
      (Who Is ....) information is entirely unavailable for any of the
      main MMS sites, because all of their registrations are being
      hidden via Domains By Proxy.&nbsp; A person could get the
      impression that all those "independent" sites were produced, and
      paid for by a single person, who is trying to hide his identity.<br>

      Anyway, Thomas specified the rules of my debate with Humble.&nbsp;
      The rules specified a 500 word limit for each side's replies, and
      a single argument per day, which was to last for a period of 2
      weeks.&nbsp; Of course, Mr. Humble did not abide by the
      rules.&nbsp; He pretended like he was too confused to understand
      our previously agreed upon rules of conduct, once he began sending
      us his tirades.&nbsp; Considering his supposed past intellectual
      accomplishments, we found his sudden confusion to be rather
      intriguing, and it is what we would expect from a sociopathic
      manipulator.&nbsp; We have seen Humble's type of arrogance before,
      and we studied Humble's modus operandi enough to anticipate that
      he would flood us with overwhelmingly lengthy, circular arguments,
      in an attempt to wear us down.&nbsp; The confirmation of our
      predictions about him told us that Mr. Humble had no comprehension
      whatsoever of what, or who he was up against.&nbsp; We were okay
      with that.&nbsp; He was welcome to make a noose and insert his
      head inside.&nbsp; So be it.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Round 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The first mistake that you enter into your Criticism of MMS is
      that you think that Chlorine Dioxide and Chlorine are the same
      thing and that they would thus have the same result in the human
      body.&nbsp; So let me address that point first.<br>
      <br>
      The fact is, there is no available chlorine in chlorine
      dioxide.&nbsp; It’s sort of like table salt, there is no available
      chlorine in table salt, if there were, you would have been dead
      long ago.&nbsp; Do you see?&nbsp; Table salt is made of chlorine
      and sodium.&nbsp; Yet it doesn’t kill you.&nbsp; The same
      situation exists with chlorine dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      Let me suggest a little bit of chemical technology reading.&nbsp;
      Lenntech a Corporation that sells many kinds of chlorine for
      various purification purposes has published a technical article on
      chlorine dioxide that is quoted in many Colleges and Universities
      around the world.&nbsp; The name of the article is "Disinfectants
      Chlorine Dioxide."&nbsp; Let me quote just a couple sentences in
      the paragraph labeled Chlorine Dioxide as an oxidizer: "As an
      oxidizer chlorine dioxide is very selective.&nbsp; It has this
      ability due to unique one-electron exchange mechanisms.&nbsp;
      Chlorine dioxide attacks the electron-rich centers of organic
      molecules.&nbsp; (I hope everyone understands that pathogens are
      made of organic molecules)&nbsp; "First, chlorine dioxide takes up
      a single electron and this causes it to reduce to chlorite: The
      chlorite ion is oxidized and becomes a chloride ion and that
      during this reaction it accepts 5 electrons.&nbsp; The chlorine
      atom remains, until stable chloride is formed from it."&nbsp; I
      hope you understand what that means.&nbsp; It means that no
      chlorite or chlorine is formed.&nbsp; It turns to chlorite first,
      but only for milliseconds and then to chloride (which is table
      salt.)<br>
      <br>
      To explain those quotes a little bit if it is too technical, the
      "Chloride" that is mentioned that is formed is table salt (sodium
      chloride).&nbsp; The chlorine atom remains until chloride is
      formed.&nbsp;&nbsp; No free chlorine ever becomes available from
      the chlorine dioxide.&nbsp; The Lenntech.org&nbsp; article goes on
      to explain that chlorine dioxide has a very low oxidation
      potential (under .95 volts), much lower than chlorine which is
      (over 1.4 volts), or oxygen which is (about 1.3 volts), or
      hydrogen peroxide which is (1.8 volts) and thus cannot oxidize
      many of the microorganisms in water supplies and other plants
      where selective oxidizers are needed.&nbsp; And to then explain
      that in terms of MMS, chlorine dioxide in very low concentrates
      cannot kill some of the beneficial organisms located in the
      stomach and intestines that are required for digestion.<br>
      <br>
      This data is available from many different educational sources in
      the world.&nbsp; Don’t take it from me.&nbsp; Look it up for
      yourself.&nbsp; You may not be aware of the fact that sodium
      chlorite has been sold in Health food stores for 80 years in the
      US and was brought to America from Germany about 1930.&nbsp; Only
      the name was different it is called stabilized oxygen.&nbsp;
      Hundreds of thousands... [Word count rule exceeded]<br>
      <br>
      Thank you for not getting "too technical" for our feeble minds. We
      appreciate your concern for us.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Humble, it has been you who has been intentionally blurring
      and confusing the lines between the different compounds that
      chlorine can form.&nbsp; On one hand, you claim MMS is as harmless
      as salt, while on the other hand, you speak of how powerfully
      reactive the chlorine is, which supposedly enables it to "kill
      everything".&nbsp; By the way, we actually agree on that last
      part.&nbsp; So which is it?&nbsp; Is the chlorine neutralized, so
      your customers are buying glorified table salt, or is it the
      powerful reactive chlorine that is well known for its
      toxicity?&nbsp; Either way, it's called "fraud".&nbsp; You cannot
      have it both ways, but nice try.<br>
      <br>
      Just so you know, table salt is not harmless either, as I'm sure a
      great world-changing engineer like yourself knows.&nbsp; The only
      salt that is almost harmless is sea salt, because it contains
      minerals that counteract the toxic effects of the chloride.&nbsp;
      Table salt is well known for its toxic effects, so even if your
      safety claims were true, you would still be arguing from an eroded
      position.&nbsp; You also recommend M.M.S. for people with heart
      disease and high blood pressure, so if your product is safe "like
      salt", then you are part of their health problems.<br>
      <br>
      As far as its safety, first let us state that your chlorine
      dioxide is identical to that used for pool decontaminations, and
      the effects of intentionally consuming it are well known.&nbsp;
      For one thing, it is an E.P.A. registered pesticide.&nbsp;
      According to the E.P.A., "Chlorine dioxide is an antimicrobial
      pesticide recognized for its disinfectant properties since the
      early 1900s. Chlorine dioxide kills microorganisms by disrupting
      transport of nutrients across the cell wall."<br>
      <br>
      We already looked it up, and that's why we wrote the original
      article.&nbsp; The burden of proof is upon you to prove us wrong,
      if you can.<br>
      <br>
      There is no chlorine dioxide in stabilized oxygen.&nbsp; There is
      a small amount of table salt inside it.&nbsp; Nice try, but we're
      well-versed in your slight-of-hand tricks.<br>
      <br>
      I'm standing here with Thomas' electronics multimeter, with its
      probes inside some hydrogen peroxide, and frankly, I'm just not
      getting any voltage reading from it. Should we recalibrate the
      meter?&nbsp; We are a little slow, after all.&nbsp; Seriously, we
      can talk about your atomic theories all you want, and go into as
      many circles with those as you want, but the fact that matters is
      that the effects of your product upon the human body are already
      well known, and the electrons really don't care.&nbsp; Let's stick
      with the real issues here, and you can impress us with your
      fancy-smancy nuclear knowledge later.<br>

      <br>
      In the criticism of MMS the writer continues to confuse the
      technologies of chlorine and chlorine dioxide not realizing that
      there is a life and death difference in the two
      technologies.&nbsp; So let me use the same heading on my article
      as is used in a section of the Critical article on MMS.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The effects of Chlorine on the
        Body.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In reading the Healthwyze write up concerning this subject I
      notice that the problems concerning ingestion of chlorine seemed
      to be pretty much according to the research of the literature that
      I also found.&nbsp; Chlorine is an oxidizer and in order to
      destroy most any compound found in the body, it must in the
      process of oxidation combine with that compound forming a totally
      new compound and these new compounds are often carcinogenic in
      nature.&nbsp; This kind of oxidation is known as
      chlorination.&nbsp; This is one of the main reasons that most new
      water purification plants employ chlorine dioxide.&nbsp; It does
      not combine with the item being oxidized, but rather it steals the
      electrons that hold the item being oxidized together.&nbsp; With
      the electrons being removed the item, pathogen or heavy metal or
      other poison, flies apart into its compounds which can be neutral
      or a poison.&nbsp; The electrons then change the chlorine dioxide
      components into a chloride which is the basis of table salt,
      sodium chloride.&nbsp; There is no chlorine dioxide in Clorox or
      any of the chlorine bleaches, only chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      You may remember in my last article I mentioned that chlorine
      dioxide actually has no chlorine available at any time during the
      chemical oxidation cycle and that includes the degeneration cycle
      into chloride.&nbsp; The chemical oxidation cycle with any
      pathogen and chlorine dioxide consists of the chlorine dioxide
      stealing 5 electrons from the cell walls of the pathogen. The
      sequence goes like this.&nbsp; First a single electron is drawn
      off of the cell wall and onto the chlorine dioxide ion changing it
      to a sodium chlorite ion, but that only lasts for a millisecond or
      two.&nbsp; Then the newly formed sodium chlorite ion exerts a much
      heavier attraction and thus 4 more electrons are instantly drawn
      off.&nbsp; No other ion in pathogen chemistry has this unique
      sequence. The chlorine dioxide doesn’t have the power until it
      converts to a chlorite and then it blows a hole in the side of the
      pathogen and thus killing it.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of chlorine dioxide there are a number of conditions
      that the pathogen must meet in order to be destroyed.&nbsp; The
      most important condition is the ORP (Oxidation Reduction
      Potential) voltage of the cell walls of the pathogen.&nbsp; It
      must match the voltage of the chlorine dioxide in the proper way
      to be destroyed.&nbsp; Chlorine kills (oxidizes) everything in its
      path, but as mentioned above, by chlorination, but chlorine
      dioxide is very selective.&nbsp; It does not combine; it destroys
      by disassembling the biological components of the cell walls of
      the pathogen by removing the electrons that hold it together....
      [Word count rule exceeded] <br>
      <br>
      Stealing electrons? That is some bad, bad, naughty chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      Maybe we could get back on topic now.&nbsp;&nbsp; We answered most
      of this in our previous rebuttal.&nbsp; All of your irrelevant
      atomic theory smoke screens will continue to get ignored. You may
      discuss those at a physics or chemistry site.&nbsp; Perhaps
      they'll even be impressed.&nbsp; We're not.&nbsp; We're concerned
      only with the health implications of M.M.S., and your attempts to
      distract our readers away from that topic will fail.<br>
      <br>
      We agree that chlorine kills everything in its path, and so does
      chlorine dioxide. There is nothing "selective" about either.&nbsp;
      When your product is used as an E.P.A. registered pesticide, for
      instance, it does not merely kill the bad pathogens inside
      termites.&nbsp; It kills them.&nbsp; All of them. A poison in
      small doses is still a poison, regardless of whatever the
      electrons are doing.&nbsp; It is also worth noting that we, as
      humans, have cell walls too, so chlorine is also bad for us.&nbsp;
      What's worse is those scientific studies, like the one below.<br>
      <br>
      Meggs et al. (1996) examined 13 individuals (1 man and 12 women) 5
      years after they were occupationally exposed to chlorine dioxide
      from a leak in a water purification system pipe.&nbsp; The
      long-term effects of the accident included development of
      sensitivity to respiratory irritants (13 subjects), disability
      with loss of employment (11 subjects), and chronic fatigue (11
      subjects).&nbsp; Nasal abnormalities (including injection,
      telangectasia, paleness, cobblestoning, edema, and thick mucus)
      were found in all 13 individuals.&nbsp; Nasal biopsies taken from
      the subjects revealed chronic inflammation, with lymphocytes and
      plasma cells present within the lamina propria in 11 of the 13
      subjects; the inflammation was graded as mild in 2 subjects,
      moderate in 8 subjects, and severe in 1 subject.<br>
      <br>
      I really liked this statement, "The chlorine dioxide doesn’t have
      the power until it converts to a chlorite and then it blows a hole
      in the side of the pathogen and thus killing it."&nbsp; Wow, that
      must be impressive.&nbsp; Could you give us a peer-reviewed, 3rd
      party, independent study that proves this is exactly what your
      product does, while not harming human tissues and blood?&nbsp; I
      mean, I'm sure your contentions are backed with credible
      scientific evidence, after all.&nbsp; Otherwise, you would just be
      pulling this stuff out of your butt.<br>
      <br>
      You actually state in one of your movies that your product kills
      only the weaker cancer cells, which would put your formula in the
      same category as chemotherapy; if this were indeed true.&nbsp;
      Didn't you also claim that your product would not harm human
      tissues (like chemotherapy does)?&nbsp; Aren't the cancer tumors
      made from human tissues?&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I forgot: it's
      "selective".&nbsp; I suppose the moral here is to never
      underestimate the intelligence of chlorine, at least not
      atomically, and always underestimate the intelligence of the
      Health Wyze Report Staff.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Round 3</span><br>
      <br>
      It would seem only fair that someone being sarcastically critical
      of someone else's work should at least know their chemistry so
      that they can adequately explain the mistakes that persons is
      making.&nbsp; So let me correct their writing about how pathogens
      are killed so that later you the reader will be able to understand
      what really happens to diseases if you&nbsp; should take a drink
      of MMS.<br>
      <br>
      My critic says, "Bleach kills the pathogens by poisoning them, and
      then corroding them."&nbsp; But you see that really isn't the
      chemical process at all.&nbsp; Actually the chlorine in the bleach
      actually attracts the electrons that hold the pathogen together
      and the pathogen and chlorine mix together to form a new compound
      and the pathogen is killed in the process of forming a compound
      with the chlorine.&nbsp; But although wrong, that really isn't
      important to us as MMS uses chlorine dioxide and no chlorine is
      available.&nbsp; Chlorine dioxide kills in a different way.&nbsp;
      As I already explained the chlorine dioxide removes the electrons
      that hold it together and it flies apart or at least part of it
      does.<br>
      <br>
      Then the critical writer asks for a list of bleach resistant good
      bacteria, and then he says we know that they do not exist and of
      course I have to agree.&nbsp; But then again I am not talking
      about bleach and chlorine.&nbsp; I am talking about chlorine
      dioxide a substance as different from chlorine as is table salt.<br>
      <br>
      The next paragraph the critical writer mixes chlorine bleach and
      sterilization and chlorine dioxide sterilization so thoroughly
      together that I cannot explain what he is saying.&nbsp; They are
      not the same thing.&nbsp; They are not used in industry for the
      same thing except on occasion&nbsp; Yes chlorine is&nbsp;
      poisonous to most everything, but there is no chlorine in chlorine
      dioxide.&nbsp; This is confusing because it has that same word in
      it "Chlorine,"&nbsp; but a chemist quickly comes to understand
      that they are not the same.&nbsp; If they were the same, then
      table salt would kill you.<br>
      <br>
      So last year 975 thousand people in the US died after taking a
      dose of one drug or the other ALL OF WHICH WERE FDA
      APPROVED.&nbsp; During that same time more than one million people
      used MMS and not a single one died and many reported getting
      better quickly.&nbsp; More than 5 million people have downloaded
      my free MMS book.&nbsp; I have personally given more than 5000
      sick people drinks of MMS.&nbsp; Most of them became well in a few
      hours.&nbsp; I make no money from the sales of MMS.&nbsp; I don't
      manufacture it, or sell it, or receive royalties from the sale of
      it.&nbsp; I am just trying to make Earth a better place to live.<br>
      <br>
      We really don't care about your Chemistry 101 homework.&nbsp;
      Likewise, none of our readers care whether you believe that an
      electron moves this way, or that.&nbsp; Some people believe
      gremlins are under their beds, but that has nothing to do with the
      health effects of chlorine dioxide, or the price of eggs in China.<br>
      <br>
      As far as nobody dying from M.M.S., perhaps you should review the
      news articles at:

      You already knew about Silvia's death, because you publicly
      attacked her grieving husband for telling the press about the

      Most people won't immediately die from M.M.S., but from long term
      secondary conditions such as cancers, which will be difficult to

      O.S.H.A. has this to report about chlorine dioxide:<br>
      <br>
      "Chlorine dioxide is a very unstable material even at room
      temperatures and will explode on impact, when exposed to sparks or
      sunlight, or when heated rapidly to degrees C (212 degrees
      F).&nbsp; Airborne concentrations greater than 10 percent may
      explode...&nbsp; Chlorine dioxide reacts with water or steam to
      form toxic and corrosive fumes of hydrochloric acid...&nbsp;
      Chlorine dioxide is a severe respiratory and eye irritant in
      experimental animals...&nbsp; Chlorine dioxide dissolves in water
      to produce chlorate and chlorite ions.&nbsp; Chlorite has been
      shown to produce methemoglobin in rats and cats"<br>
      <br>
      Methemoglobin, a particular type of hemoglobin is useless for
      carrying oxygen to tissues.&nbsp; Since hemoglobin is the key
      carrier of oxygen in the blood, its wholesale replacement by
      methemoglobin can cause cyanosis (a slate gray-blueness) due to
      suffocation.<br>
      <br>
      The National Institutes of Health reported, "The results indicated
      that CIO2 may have central neurotoxic potential."&nbsp; (May?)<br>
      <br>
      One of the material data sheets from a chlorine dioxide
      manufacturer states that chloride dioxide is:<br>
      <br>
      "CORROSIVE to the eyes and skin.&nbsp; Can cause damage to
      vegetation.&nbsp; Inhalation: Severe respiratory irritant.&nbsp;
      May cause bronchospasm and pulmonary edema, which may be delayed
      in onset.&nbsp; May also cause severe headaches.&nbsp; All
      symptoms may be delayed and long lasting.&nbsp; Long term exposure
      may cause chronic bronchitis.&nbsp; An LC50 value of 500 ppm/15m3
      (rat) is quoted in the literature.&nbsp; Skin Absorption: May be
      absorbed, causing tissue and blood cell damage.&nbsp; Ingestion:
      Not applicable except for solutions, in which case the symptoms
      would be expected to parallel those for inhalation.&nbsp;
      Hazardous Combustion Products: Chlorine, oxygen, and hydrochloric
      acid."<br>
      <br>
      Pay attention to: "Ingestion: Not applicable except for solutions,
      in which case the symptoms would be expected to parallel those for
      inhalation."&nbsp; Thus, interested parties should investigate the
      identical inhalation results. (Your own work says its gas is
      released during product preparation.)&nbsp; We hope those

      dumb I can't believe you expert chemists could possible prepare
      the formula for an apple pie.&nbsp; You all have less knowledge of
      chemistry than a 6th grader and you then you call me names with
      sarcasm and hate.&nbsp; Frankly I don't see why you don't apply
      for a nice job at the FDA as you all have the same
      mentality.&nbsp; Here is a guy trying to help mankind so lets just
      see if we can make him look like shit.&nbsp; And you can, for a
      little while, then you will find that you were wrong about
      everything.&nbsp; I offered to help you and you just treated me
      worse that a cow.<br>
      <br>
      I must not understand me.&nbsp; Maybe you can help.&nbsp; Why am I
      spending 18 hours a day doing all this for no income for the last
      14 years.&nbsp; People didn't listen at all for the first 10
      years, just the last 4 years.&nbsp; I spent all my retirement
      money and sold everything I own and gave my house trailer away to
      one of those homeless girls... [Word limit Reached]<br>

      Firstly, chemistry is not the solution to the diseases that plague
      our society.&nbsp; It's the cause.<br>
      <br>
      Your success statistics are only available from you: an uncredible
      and self-serving source of information.&nbsp; We have given you
      chance after chance to provide real evidence that M.M.S. has some
      benefit, and that it is indeed safer than the bleach that it
      is.&nbsp; With thousands of purported 'miracle' cures worldwide,
      we would expect for at least one credible, independent,
      verifiable, 3rd party somewhere to actually document it.<br>
      <br>
      If we ever decide to begin a business of poisoning already sick
      people (for instance with bleach), then we'll accept your advice
      about getting proper chemistry degrees.&nbsp; Until then, we'll
      make due with our inferior educations and intellects.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike yourself, real saints do not boast about their own
      greatness, stroke themselves publicly, or falsify
      information.&nbsp; You're far from the altruistic, selfless saint
      that you have consistently paraded yourself as being.&nbsp; It is
      unnecessary for truly righteous people to tell us of their
      greatness, and real saints have no desire to brag about
      themselves.&nbsp; You are hurting people, and you have willfully
      chosen to continue hurting people indefinitely.&nbsp; That is the
      opposite of saintly, as far as we are concerned.<br>
      <br>
      Your allegation of not making money from your M.M.S. scam is
      cunning.&nbsp; You know that the one thing that we cannot verify
      is your financial records, and therefore we cannot prove that you
      are lying about this.&nbsp; Be aware that this will quickly change
      if you are ever prosecuted in the U.S. for your crimes, because
      the incriminating evidence would become public records.&nbsp; You
      can count on us to be one of the first to publish it.&nbsp; We
      noticed you moved to Mexico, which is a smart move for staying out
      of prison.&nbsp; I likewise noticed that you said elsewhere, "I
      live in Mexico, just in case."&nbsp; Would a saint cowardly flee
      to another country, and would he even have a reason to?<br>
      <br>
      Your personality closely matches a sociopathic boyfriend from when
      I was age 14.&nbsp; He was a convict and a pedophile in his middle
      thirties.&nbsp; This boyfriend followed the familiar sociopathic
      pattern of first reigning me in with fantastic fabrications about
      his history that made him appear heroic and saintly.&nbsp; Later,
      when he felt that his position and power had diminished somewhat,
      he began beating my spirit down by telling me about how inferior I
      was morally, and about how intellectually crippled I was.&nbsp; We
      know people like that, don't we, Mr. Humble?&nbsp; Finally, when
      all else failed, and he had become really desperate from his
      manipulation failures, he appealed to my conscience with guilt
      games about how I was hurting a modern day messiah.&nbsp; Sounds
      really familiar, doesn't it?<br>
      <br>
      You are too arrogant to realize that you were beaten long ago, Mr.
      Humble, and you're too prideful to ever admit that we read you
      like a book from the very beginning.&nbsp; I hope this stands as a
      testament of your modus operandi, so that others will not be taken
      in by your slick games in the future.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Humble, you are in ours and many others' opinion, an
      inherently evil man.<br>
      <br>
      May we call you "Jim"?<br>
