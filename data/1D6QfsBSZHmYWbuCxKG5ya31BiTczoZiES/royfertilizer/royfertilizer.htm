        <p>BERTHOUD - <b>Andre Roy</b> is a man of many ideas. But his
          latest idea is garnering attention from scientists at Colorado
          State University. </p>
        <p>Working in an industrial park in Berthoud, Roy developed an
          efficient process to turn dead trees into nutrient-rich
          fertilizer. </p>
        <p>"There's no added chemicals," Roy said. "It's just 100
          percent natural." </p>
        <p>Roy's patent-pending process is now being called
          revolutionary by forestry and plant specialists at CSU. </p>
        <p>"This is the real deal," James Self, director of CSU's Soil,
          Water and Plant Testing Laboratory, said. </p>
        <p>First, Roy, who's not exactly sure himself how his process
          works, says the fertilizer produces miracles in the garden. </p>
        <p>"A lot of the cells have been broken exposing a lot of the
          nutrients," he said. </p>
        <p>Second, the process may provide one solution to the question
          of what to do with the pine beetle kill. </p>
        <p>"If you were to grind up a pine tree without this process,
          the plants just couldn't utilize the product," he said. </p>
        <p>But now, by making the dead trees both usable and profitable,
          Roy says more landowners will clear out their property. </p>
        <p>Roy has been working on this project for three years. The
          former business owner already has a small amount of product on
          the market. </p>
        <p>Still, he'd like an institution like Colorado State
          University to take it from here. </p>
        <p>"It still needs to be vetted out correctly and it also needs
          a better manufacturing method," Roy said. </p>
        <p>Claiming the process takes a very small amount of energy, Roy
          would like to see his invention make its way into developing
          countries. </p>
        <p>"As long as they have vegetative matter, they can improve
          their soil and grow bigger and better crops," he said. </p>
        <p>Fort Collins' stores Jax and Green Logic are the only places
          carrying Roy's product, which is called Mill Creek Soil
          Primer.</p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] The present invention relates generally to processing
        vegetative material and, more particularly, to an apparatus and
        method for homogenizing vegetative material including plants,
        woody plants, and agricultural waste. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] Tree logging, thinning of young timber and clearing
        operations for constructing through forested areas have the
        undesirable effect of generating quantities of slash or forest
        residue which often must be removed from the operation site.
        Slash generally includes unused portions of a tree including
        tree tops, limbs, cull logs, stumps and roots, often amounting
        to as much as 50% of a tree. Forest residue can also include
        small trees and fallen or decayed trees. Slash is usually burned
        or deposited in landfill areas since accumulation thereof in
        forested areas creates fire hazards and breeding sites for
        insects, and adversely affects wildlife, water-sheds, and forest
        aesthetics. </p>
      <p>[0003] Toppled or uprooted trees and other plants including
        shrubs and bushes are also removed to landfill sites after
        storms bearing high winds, flooding, landslides and the like.
        Other vegetative material resulting from gardening, landscaping
        and agriculture often finds its way to land fill sites as well
        or is incinerated if it cannot otherwise be used as silage or
        directly for fodder. </p>
      <p>[0004] Processing slash and live trees to form relatively
        uniform, finely divided particles suitable for applications
        where consistency of nutrient release or more rapid reaction
        with chemical agents is desired. It is difficult to generate
        such uniformity from forest and agricultural material, since the
        cutting blades of presently available fine shredding mills are
        quickly halted as a result of the release of pine sap and/or
        other sticky materials into the resulting mixture as the trees
        are being processed. Chipping and chopping of such materials are
        more tolerant to the present of sticky substances because of the
        use of larger cutting blades and significant power employed by
        such devices. </p>
      <p>[0005] Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
        provide a method and apparatus for processing vegetative
        material. </p>
      <p>[0006] It is another object of the invention to provide a
        method and apparatus for transforming waste vegetative material
        into useful materials. </p>
      <p>[0007] Another object of the invention is to provide finely
        divided particles having substantially similar size from slash
        and agricultural materials. </p>
      <p>[0008] Still another object of the invention is to provide
        finely divided particles into which pine sap and other liquids
        are absorbed, from slash containing coniferous plants. </p>
      <p>[0009] Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the
        invention will be set forth in part in the description that
        follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in
        the art upon examination of the following or may be learned by
        practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the
        invention may be realized and attained by means of the
        instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in
        the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0010] To achieve the foregoing and other objects, and in
        accordance with the purposes of the present invention, as
        embodied and broadly described herein, the method for processing
        vegetative material hereof includes the steps of: loading a
        chosen quantity of the vegetative material into a cylindrical
        plastic tube having a cylindrical axis disposed approximately
        horizontally, and containing at least one free metal rod; and
        rotating the cylinder about the cylindrical axis for a chosen
        period of time, wherein particles of the vegetative material
        having a selected particle size are formed. </p>
      <p>[0011] In another aspect of the present invention, in
        accordance with its objects and purposes, the composition hereof
        formed by the process including the steps of: loading a chosen
        quantity of vegetative material into a cylindrical plastic tube
        having a cylindrical axis disposed approximately horizontally,
        and containing at least one free metal rod; and rotating the
        cylinder about the cylindrical axis for a chosen period of time,
        wherein particles of said vegetative material having a selected
        particle size are formed. </p>
      <p>[0012] In yet another aspect of the present invention, in
        accordance with its objects and purposes, the apparatus for
        processing vegetative material hereof includes in combination: a
        cylindrical plastic tube having a cylindrical axis disposed
        approximately horizontally; at least one free metal rod disposed
        in the plastic tube; and means for rotating the cylinder about
        the cylindrical axis for a chosen period of time, wherein
        particles of the vegetative material having a chosen particle
        size are formed. </p>
      <p>[0013] Benefits and advantages of the present invention
        include, but are not limited to providing substantially uniform,
        finely divided particulates from vegetative matter including
        slash or other plant material which are useful for applications
        requiring high surface contact are and consistent reaction of
        materials. Further, in situations where significant pine sap,
        water or other liquids are present in the starting materials,
        these liquids appear to be substantially homogeneously infused
        into the particles. </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>[0014] The accompanying drawing, which is incorporated in and
        forms a part of the specification, illustrates an embodiment of
        the apparatus of the present invention and, together with the
        description, serves to explain the principles of the invention.
        In the drawing: </p>
      <p>[0015] The FIGURE is a schematic representation of a side view
        of the apparatus of the present invention showing the plastic
        cylindrical processing vessel having screw-in end caps, and the
        at least one metal bar thereof. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0016] Briefly, the present invention includes a composition
        and an apparatus and method for generating a chosen, relatively
        uniform size of particles having a dry feel and a pleasant odor
        from chipped slash or other vegetative material. In the
        situation where the starting materials are of substantially
        identical substances, such as hay, flowers, grass, or pine
        needles, as examples, the process material is substantially
        uniform both in particle size and composition. When pine sap
        and/or other liquids are present in the starting materials, the
        present invention permits the generation of particulates into
        which such substances are substantially uniformly absorbed. The
        composition hereof finds use as fertilizer or soil amendment,
        feed, absorbent, traction aid, and potpourri, as examples. </p>
      <p>[0017] Reference will now be made in detail to the present
        embodiment of the present invention, examples of which are
        illustrated in the accompanying drawing. Turning now to the
        FIGURE, a schematic representation of a side view of an
        embodiment of the apparatus, 10, of the present invention is
        shown. At least one, free, metal bar, 12, is disposed inside
        plastic cylinder, 14, having its axis, 16, oriented
        horizontally. Plastic cylinder 14 is shown to have internal
        threads, 18a, and 18b in the vicinity of open ends, 20a and 20b.
        End caps, 22a and 22b, having threads 24a and 24b, respectively,
        adapted to be screwed into threads 18a and 18b, respectively,
        provide a barrier to liquid flow out of plastic cylinder 14, but
        not necessarily a gas-tight barrier, while permitting vegetative
        material, 26, to be introduced and processed materials removed
        from plastic cylinder 14. After loading with bars or rods 12,
        and a selected amount of vegetative material, 28, apparatus 10
        is rotated, 30, about axis 16, at a selected speed for a chosen
        period of time using a commercially available ball mill, not
        shown in the FIGURE. The processing is stopped when particles of
        vegetative material having a chosen size are formed in
        significant quantities. The mixture may then be screened or
        sieved to pass particles having smaller than a selected
        dimension, and the remainder of the material is returned to the
        cylinder for further processing. It should be mentioned that the
        longer the processing, the smaller the particle size of the
        resulting vegetative material. In the situation when hay,
        flowers, grass or pine needles, as examples, are used for the
        starting material, a fine dust will result if the processing is
        permitted to continue for a sufficiently long period. </p>
      <p>[0018] As currently understood by the present inventor, and in
        no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention, the
        rods slowly crush and grind the vegetative material and chipped
        tree parts and, in the case of threaded rods, may also tear
        apart the previously chipped tree parts (typically,
        approximately 1/2 in. to 3/4 in. starting size), allowing pine
        sap, in the case of pine wood slash, and other liquids to be
        intimately mixed with the smaller, higher surface area pieces. A
        substantially uniform mixture of flowing, substantially
        dry-to-the-touch particles which are easy to pour and otherwise
        handle, and which have a pleasant odor is formed after an
        appropriate processing time. In situations where the wood is too
        green or the speed of processing is too rapid, a liquid may be
        formed. If this liquid is permitted to stand for a selected
        period in an open, stationary (non-rotating) tube, and the tube
        rotation is recommenced after this period, the substantially
        uniform, dry-to-the-touch particles are formed after a time.
        Such liquefaction has also been observed when the present
        apparatus is used for processing pine needles, flowers, pine
        cones, hay, grass, berries, and shrubs. Particles having the
        size of fine dust particles to particles having a size of
        approximately, 2 mm, after sieving, are formed before product
        collection is undertaken; however, larger particles may also
        find use. </p>
      <p>[0019] It has been found that "seasoned"
        acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer cylinders 14 give
        better material conversion than vinyl or acrylic tubes.
        Seasoning is achieved by processing a few batches of vegetative
        material. Although end caps 22a and 22b make the assembled
        plastic tube/end cap combination water tight, it is expected
        that gases and vapors may pass through threaded portions 18a,
        24a and 18b, 24b. Nickel-plated, all thread rods 12 have been
        found to perform better than unthreaded steel rods which become
        coated with material during processing and must be periodically
        cleaned or the processing takes longer. Steel rods also corrode.
        The nickel plated rods remain bright after months of use.
        Chrome-plated steel, ball mill balls (1/2 in. to 3/4 in. in
        diameter) have been found not to work well. It should be
        mentioned that during processing, small particles of the
        vegetative materials cling to the rods, apparently by
        electrostatic forces. It has been found that three threaded
        nickel-plated rods having a 1/2 in. to 3/4 in. diameter, and a
        length shorter than the interior length dimension of the
        cylinder having the end caps in place along the cylindrical
        axis, process the vegetative material efficiently, while not
        taking up too much of the volume of the cylindrical tube and
        permit the rods to freely move within the tube. It is expected
        that unthreaded nickel-plated rods will perform effectively.
        Clearly, the number, type, length, and diameter of the rods is
        provided only as an example, and other combinations and mixtures
        of rods may be effective in the practice of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>[0020] Having generally described the present method, more
        details thereof are presented in the following EXAMPLE. </p>

      <p>[0021] A commercial ball mill was operated at 91 rpm, and a 22
        in. long.times.4.5 in. outer diameter ABS cylindrical tube
        containing three, 1/2 in. to 1/2 in. diameter, approximately 20
        in. long nickel-plated threaded metal rods which allows about 1
        in. play on each side of the closed cylinder, and approximately
        2 quarts of chipped pine tree, was placed on the rollers and
        rotated for about 5 h to achieve a product which will pass
        through a 2 mm screen, and having approximately fine dust to 2
        mm particle sizes. It was found that processing time can be
        reduced by periodically removing particles smaller than a chosen
        dimension by screening or sieving. </p>
      <p>[0022] The process of the present invention has been
        successfully applied to chipped, live trees, cut trees, dried
        tree materials, branches, needles, pine cones, hay, flowers,
        grass and shrubs. As stated hereinabove, care must be taken if
        the starting materials are too fresh and moist, since such
        starting materials may generate a dark, moist, fermented
        product. If this product is removed from the cylinder and
        allowed to dry, or allowed to dry in the cylinder, with
        subsequent continuation of the processing, the desired final
        product is the normally obtained product. To avoid this
        intermediate drying step however, before chipping, cut live
        trees may be allowed to stand for between about two weeks to a
        month. </p>
      <p>[0023] Chipped pine tree materials weigh about 7 lbs per cubic
        foot, while the processed material weighs about 14 lbs per cubic
        foot. </p>
