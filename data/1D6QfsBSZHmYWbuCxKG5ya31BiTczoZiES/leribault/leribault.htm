      </b><b>THE MEANING OF A STORY</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1985 while working as an independent forensic scientist for the
      French judiciary, Le Ribault joined forces with a highly acclaimed
      research chemist, Professor Norbert Duffaut from the University of
      Bordeaux. Between them, they hoped to develop their common work on
      organic silica, a substance which they believed had a wide range
      of therapeutic uses.<br>
      <br>
      After twelve years work together, perhaps as a consequence of
      their work on the new therapy, Duffaut was dead, poisoned in
      suspicious circumstances and Le Ribault himself had suffered two
      months solitary confinement in a French jail."<br>
      <br>
      "I shall continue my actions of distributing OS5 despite all the
      opposition. I do it for all those patients for whom I have the
      opportunity and honour of caring, those who were abandoned by
      modern medicine which was unable to offer them a cure or who found
      the orthodox treatments offered worse than the illness itself."<br>
      <br>
      Loic Le Ribault, France's most renowned forensic scientist (1) and
      specialist in the study of silica, holds court in the dingy
      surroundings of the Flying Fish pub on the harbour in St Helier,
      Jersey. With a Gaelic shrug and in faltering English, he explains
      how the pub has become his home and his office.<br>
      <br>
      He knows almost everyone in the bar, as he knows the bus drivers,
      the local shopkeepers and many of the harbours boat owners. He
      knows them, he says, 'because I have treated them, for this
      illness and that illness. Many of them I have cured with OS5'.<br>
      <br>
      Sitting in the Flying Fish, drinking bitter and smoking the
      occasional Galloises, Le Ribault does not seem like a man who has
      been hounded out of France because he discovered and distributed a
      treatment for arthritis and a number of other common ailments.<br>
      <br>
      In 1985 while working as an independent forensic scientist for the
      French judiciary, Le Ribault joined forces with a highly acclaimed
      research chemist, Professor Norbert Duffaut from the University of
      Bordeaux. Between them, they hoped to develop their common work on
      organic silica, a substance which they believed had a wide range
      of therapeutic uses.<br>
      <br>
      After twelve years work together, perhaps as a consequence of
      their work on the new therapy, Duffaut was dead, poisoned in
      suspicious circumstances and Le Ribault himself had suffered two
      months solitary confinement in a French jail.<br>
      <br>
      Today, Le Ribault is on his own, forced to ground in Jersey, a
      stateless alien on the run from the French police. His life turned
      into a desperate adventure, Le Ribault is paying the price for
      falling out with scientific orthodoxy, medical professionals and
      the French establishment.<br>
      <br>
      Loic Le Ribault appears quintessentially French. He is phlegmatic
      and when he is not laughing gently and self-deprecatingly, his
      rubbery face deflates with the world-weary sadness of a circus
      clown. In well-worn casual clothes, with white wings of cotton
      wool hair floating around the bald dome of his head, his lack of
      fluent English, for which he constantly apologises, makes him
      appear wise but forgetful. Listening to him, you have to keep
      reminding yourself that over the last five years, he has lost
      everything but his mind.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>AN EARLY PROMISE</b><br>
      <br>
      Thirty years ago, still in his twenties, Loic Le Ribault was a
      precocious young academic, having ground-breaking papers published
      by the French Academy of Science. At twenty-four, in 1971, he
      discovered a new function for the electron scanning microscope
      (ESM) which enabled him to discern the history of grains of sand.<br>
      <br>
      Previously the electron scanning microscope capable at that time
      of 30,000 magnification had been used in biology and medicine, no
      one had imagined that it might be used for looking at rocks. Under
      the electron scanning microscope, Le Ribault found that he could
      discern the entire history of a a grain of sand; where and when it
      originated, how it was formed, where and how it had been
      transported, where it had next lodged, how long it had stayed in
      that place. By the time he had finished his research, he had
      devised a list of two hundred and fifty criteria by which the
      history of sand might be diagnosed. The field was later to become
      so specialised that it would take three years to train a scientist
      in the technical knowledge to carry out these tests. (2)<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault's approach to analysis and detection of sand, had some
      academic and commerical uses but was most clearly an invaluable
      aid to policing. While still working at university, he was
      approached by the FBI and became a forensic consultant for them.<br>
      <br>
      Despite this early discovery of a new use for the ESM, Le Ribault
      found it hard to get work in the universities after he qualified
      and in 1982, he set up his own national laboratory for electron
      microscopy, called CARME and quickly became France's most noted
      forensic scientist. CARME became the principal laboratory used by
      the police service, the judiciary and the French Home Office.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault is the first to admit that he is not a diplomat, even
      that he is anarchistic in his view of society. Constant struggles
      between himself and the French Home Office, seemingly about
      hegemony, did not endear him to servants of the State. At the
      height of CARME's work, Le Ribault was a nationally recognised
      figure with a high public profile, working and commenting on some
      of France's most intriguing criminal, military and political
      cases. Always a populist, he was much sought after by television,
      radio and newspapers as well as the French political parties.<br>
      <br>
      'When I had CARME, every week I had articles in the press and on
      TV, and every French party asked me to be involved with them. On
      TV and in newspapers, I made information accessible, very often I
      did lectures in Primary and secondary schools as well as
      universities'.<br>
      <br>
      Despite a brilliant record as an expert witness, the French Home
      Office and the police service seemed to have been wary of Le
      Ribault's cavalier genius as well as his tacit control of Home
      Office forensics. He says that the French State frequently
      referred to him as their scientist and to his laboratory as that
      of the Home Office.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault's career as France's most eminent forensic scientist
      came to a sudden end in 1991, when the Home Office decided to
      integrate their own regional forensic laboratories equipped with
      electron microscopes. In the following debacle, Le Ribault lost
      his laboratory, which had employed thirty odd people, and his home
      which he had mortgaged as surety for the laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      A resilient character, Le Ribault adapted to his new life, lived
      in the family home and returned to his first love, silica. Back in
      1972, while working with sand on the ESM he had made an
      interesting discovery, a layer of water-soluble amorphous silica
      which contained micro-organisms covered the surface of some sand
      grains. He found that these micro organism and the secretions
      which they left on the sand contained organic silica. Organic
      silica differs from mineral silica which makes up the majority of
      the earths crust, in that it containes Carbon and can be readily
      assimilated by animals.<br>
      <br>
      By 1975, Le Ribault had created a process by which it was possible
      to recover these deposits from the surface of the sand. All of
      this work was accepted by the scientific establishment and his
      papers published by the French Academy of Science.<br>
      <br>
      There had been constant research into organic silica over the
      previous fifty years and some of this research had raised
      questions about its therapetic use. In his early work, as a
      geologist, Le Ribault had not been following the research into
      silica and health. But in the early eighties, while working on the
      organic silica deposits he had found, he immersed his hands in
      organic silica solution and found that his psoriasis was cured.
      From then on, Le Ribault's work became focused in the therapeutic
      properties of silica.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FROM POLLUTANT TO ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silica is an essential element of living matter. Found in body
      tissue, the thymus gland, the vascular lining, the adrenal glands,
      the liver, the spleen, the pancreas and in considerable quantity
      in hair. With age the body loses its store of organic silica and
      is unable to replace it from sources outside the body which are
      predominently mineral silica.<br>
      <br>
      It was originally thought that silica was at worst an
      environmental contaminant of the human body and at best an element
      which quickly passed through the body and was excreted. These
      ideas were based almost entirely upon observations of mineral
      Silica, which in the form of dust and particles was responsible
      for a number of serious illnesses such as silicosis.<br>
      <br>
      Silica in mineral form had been used therapeutically, it was
      however absorbed inefficiently into the human body. It had
      traditionally gained a place in the pantheon of herbal remedies,
      being present in Horse's Tail Fern, and some vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      Work over the years on absorbable mineral and organic silica since
      the nineteen thirties, showed irrefutably that organic silica
      could be described as an essential nutrient for both humans and
      other animals. (3) It is necessary for early calcification of
      bones and animals shells, its deficiency has been found to produce
      alterations and abnormailities in bone growth. It has also been
      observed that silica plays a part in the make up of the cells
      which formed blood vessel walls. Perhaps most importantly, silica
      has been found to directly affect and form a large part of the
      connective tissue and cartilage which plays an important part in
      joints and the illnesses which affect them.<br>
      <br>
      In studies during the nineteen seventies it was found that silica
      supplementation aided bone and cartilage growth, in 1993, it was
      reported that treatment with silicon could stimulate bone
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      By the nineteen nineties, silica formulations were being used by
      some pharmaceutical companies, on wound dressings and burn
      dressings because it was recognised that wounds healed more
      quickly and burns could be stabilised. (4,5)<br>
      <br>
      <b>A MAN ON THE MOON</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1982, Le Ribault began work with Professor Norbert Duffaut, a
      chemist and research engineer at the CNRS (The National Centre for
      Scientific Research) situated at the University of Bordeaux. In
      1957, Duffaut had synthesised a molecule of organic silicon which
      was capable of being absorbed by the human body.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike Le Ribault, Duffaut had been using his organic silica as a
      therapeutic agent, treating patients since his first discoveries
      in the nineteen fifties. Like Ribault, Duffaut paid little
      attention to the academic papers on organic silica, convinced that
      he was ahead of the field.<br>
      <br>
      When Le Ribault first met Duffaut, he had been treating people for
      years and he was well known in the South West of France and even
      in Paris. Duffaut had created NDR, the Norbert Duffaut Remedy, and
      had manufactured many litres, for thousands and thousands of
      patients. Whether to avoid the regulatory agencies, or simply out
      of sheer cussedness, Duffaut refused to keep any records of his
      transactions. 'He absolutely refused to keep a record of anything
      which he did', says Le Ribault. He would say, 'We are right, we
      will win in the end'.<br>
      <br>
      In 1958 Duffaut had begun successful clinical work with Dr Jacques
      Janet, a gastroenterologist. He had also begun treating people,
      very successfully, for arthritis. Duffaut was, however, sure that
      cardiovascular work and blood circulation work were the most
      important therpeutic goals in relation to organic silica. In the
      nineteen sixties, Duffaut worked with Dr Rager a cardio-vascular
      surgeon, who used organic silica for post-operative recovery. In
      1967 Rager was awarded the J Levy Bricker Prize by the French
      Academy of Medicine for his work on the use of organic silica in
      the treatment of man. Rager's work also determined that organic
      silica helped cancer patients withstand chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault and Duffaut had more than a passion for silica in
      common. Duffaut, in his sixties, was considered by many to be an
      impossibly difficult man. Le Ribault, speaking with sadness but
      with his usual humour says of Duffaut<br>
      <br>
      'He was less diplomatic than me! A lot less diplomatic than me!
      Can you imagine? He was impossible. He considered that the system
      was made up of stupid people, he was right of course, but he said
      it to them on many occasions. He was eccentric, very much an
      individualist. I guess I was the only person able to work with
      him'.<br>
      <br>
      Like Le Ribault, Duffaut also used humour to shield himself from
      the deeper conflicts. 'Duffaut was a very, very clever man, really
      a genius, a high level chemist who was always singing and joking
      and smiling, all the day long - every day!' Le Ribault fondly
      remembers an unmarried man, utterly immersed in his scientific
      work, cut off from the humdrum intercourse of the everyday world
      to such an extent, Le Ribault jokes, that he was, 'on the moon'
      for much of the time.<br>
      <br>
      When Le Ribault met Duffaut, he had been testing his synthetic
      organic silica molecule therapeutically for fifteen years and had
      frequently offered his invention free to the French State and its
      medical research organisations. All his approaches had been met
      with an utter and seemingly deliberate silence.<br>
      <br>
      In 1985, Duffaut and Le Ribault took out an international patent
      to protect the therapeutic use of organic silica. And in 1987,
      like many other publicly concerned scientists outside the
      pharmaceutical companies, they made representations to the French
      Minister of Research, asking that he consider their discovery for
      trials in cases of AIDS-related illnesses. So determined were they
      to force recognition of the health-giving qualities of silica on
      the Government that they had their request, and the evidence to
      support it, legally served on the Minister. Duffaut and Le Ribault
      receive no reply.<br>
      <br>
      In November 1993, Duffaut, was found dead in his bed by neighbours
      who noticed he had not been out of his house. Despite the fact
      that Duffaut was in his early seventies and had died in bed, a
      post-mortem was held and potassium cyanide in his system. Although
      no letter was found and despite the fact that witnesses had seen
      Duffaut the night before in good spirits, the police concluded
      that he had committed suicide.<br>
      <br>
      Initially, Le Ribault accepted the suicide of his colleague but
      has since begun to have doubts. His principle doubt was that
      Duffaut, a highly trained chemist would have chosen Potassium
      Cyanide as a vehicle for suicide, knowing that it would occasion
      an incredibly painful death. Duffaut's writing prior to his death
      did show a despondency clearly brought about by continual
      disappointment and frustration. His last notes contained the
      senetence. 'The authorities have condemned my discovery out of
      hand without having even tested it'.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As his work progressed with Duffaut, Loic Le Ribault found that
      there was, in his mind, less and less academic considerations
      about the therapeutic uses of organic silica. He was preoccupied
      throughout the eighties and early nineties with trying to make the
      organic silica Duffaut had been using for compresses, drinkable.<br>
      <br>
      'One of the most serious difficulties, was trying to make G5
      drinkable. The solution we had created was slightly toxic, alright
      for using on the skin but not for drinking. Perhaps no more toxic
      than red wine, but I didn't want it to be at all toxic'.<br>
      <br>
      When Le Ribault first make his therapeutic discovery, he was
      sceptical. However, after two or three years working with a number
      of doctors who used the discovery on patients and after his years
      of work with Duffaut, he decided that he was in a position to send
      files to the Ministry of Health, asking them to carry out trials
      on the basis of free solutions which would be supplied by him. He
      did not receive an answer to his many communications. The private
      treatment of patients, did not fit with either Le Ribault or
      Duffaut's ideas about health care, both wished that the French
      government would take up the idea of organic silica. By the mid
      nineties, between them, Le Ribault and Duffaut had treated well
      over ten thousand people, firstly with organic silica poultices
      and then with a drinkable tonic solution.<br>
      <br>
      Determined to make his findings of public consequence, Le Ribault
      arranged personal meetings in America with the Chairmen of the
      main pharmaceutical laboratories; he travelled to visit executives
      in Canada and the length and breadth of France. All the people he
      met showed interest and most told him that they would be in touch
      within weeks, as he now says, 'I have been waiting fifteen years
      for a reply'. One executive of a pharmaceutical company offered
      him £1,000,000 just to bury his discovery.<br>
      <br>
      <b>REGULATING MOLECULES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At the end of 1994, Le Ribault, now working on his own with an
      organic silica molecule suspended in water, which he called G5,
      stepped up production and distribution to people with health
      problems. It was Le Ribault's case that as a natural non toxic
      substance, G5 did not need a licence; he saw it as a tonic or
      dietry supplement.<br>
      <br>
      The problem of who pays to test a novel medical product, developed
      outside the pharmaceutical companies, has become a serious issue
      in America and European countries. On the boundaries of different
      kinds of medical treatment, a constant war is being waged. Trade
      and practice with non-pharmaceutical treatments are constantly
      attacked by big companies. The most common aggressors in this war
      of attrition are the pharmaceutical companies. With close allies
      in the regulatory agencies, university research departments,
      hospital Trusts and the media, a strategy of attrition whittles
      away at the number of herbs which are legally available and
      constantly attempts to restrict the availability of vitamins and
      food supplements.<br>
      <br>
      The highly capitalised pharmaceutical companies can afford to
      compete with each other, paying hundreds of thousands, often
      millions, of pounds to carry out trials and then thousands of
      pounds for preparatory paper work so that their cases can be put
      before the regulatory agencies. When they have obtained licences,
      aggressive marketing strategies, regulatory protection and
      sometimes 'dirty tricks' ensure competitive ascendancy.<br>
      <br>
      Herbalists, homoeopaths, nutritional therapists and those
      producers and practitioners who work with non-pharmaceutical
      treatments, unable to raise the money or hire sympathetic
      laboratories to carry out trials, are forced to market and use
      their treatments with one hand tied behind their back, unable to
      advertise any health-enhancing effects of any of their therapies.<br>
      <br>
      Some few innovators are fortunate, in acheiving special
      discretionary awards from the FDA in America, or the Medicine
      Controls Agency or MAFF in Britain, which exempt their natural
      therapies from the the needs of a license (6).The career of these
      odd treatments is irregular and haphazard and is probably
      dependant upon whether or not there is competition from
      pharmaceutical products.<br>
      <br>
      The competitive, financial and professional censorship by
      multinationals and doctors of novel natural health therapies, at
      this lower end of the health care market, has inevitably spawned
      'illegal' businesses and made criminals out of some doctors,
      scientists and therapists. But perhaps more importantly, in an odd
      way the pharmaceutically protective regulations and their policing
      have also created criminals out of many patients. By denying
      patients the freedom to chose their own treatments, the law and
      the regulatory agencies have forced some patients into a culture
      of underground health care.<br>
      <br>
      It was into this maelstrom of pharmaceutical protection,
      pharmaceutical company biased regulation and confused policing,
      that Le Ribault, tired of the invisibility of the authorities and
      angered by the odd death of his colleague, launched G5 in 1994. Le
      Ribault's determination to confront the big companies and the
      regulatory agencies was to bring his life collapsing about him.<br>
      <br>
      Soon after Le Ribault began to distrubute G5, in June 1995,
      Jean-Michel Graille, a journalist on Sud-Ouest Dimanche,
      approached him and asked if he could write about his discovery.
      Ten years previously, Graille had written a book called Dossier
      Priore; une nouvelle affaire Pasteur? (7) After getting agreement
      from his editor, Graille attached himself to Le Ribault for four
      months, observing his work as a scientist, innovator and now
      entrepreneur. After some initial scepticism, Graille became
      completely convinced of the therapeutic effects of Le Ribault's
      discovery. In October 1995, Sud-Ouest Dimanche published, across
      five pages of their magazine, a detailed account of Le Ribault's
      work and the suppression of his findings.<br>
      <br>
      The unbelievable results of this article were to drag Le Ribault
      into an uncontrollable conflict with the judiciary and other, more
      hidden, forces. In the days following publication, Le Ribault
      received 35,000 phone calls, letters and visiting patients. He was
      obliged to rent an hotel and call scientists, doctors and personal
      friends to help sort out the calls and callers. Sud-Ouest Dimanche
      had to hire eight receptionists to answer calls. The local
      telephone service broke down and the phone lines to police
      stations and post offices were blocked for days. In the three
      months that followed the article, Le Ribault did his best to treat
      the thousands of people who converged on the area, seeking help.
      He says now, that pharmacists in the area, lost around 35% of
      their turnover in this tidal wave.<br>
      <br>
      The article had other, more sinister results. As soon as it came
      out, Le Ribault claims, other newspapers were warned not to
      publish more articles. He received frequent death threats, his
      house was burgled, and his collaborators were threatened. One
      middle aged woman, who had been his aide for many years, was held
      hostage for an hour, in Le Ribault's house, attacked and seriously
      wounded. Le Ribault and his colleague knew the assailant, a
      Marseilles criminal who had tried to force Le Ribault to give him
      a franchise on G5. The police did nothing when they were informed.<br>
      <br>
      Either by conspiracy, or simple criminal opportunism, companies
      suddenly began to spring up claiming to be using organic silica
      for health therapies. Many of these companies, used Le Ribault and
      Duffaut's names, their photographs and even their fake signatures.
      Illegal advertising material flooded the market using quotes from
      Graille's article. Le Ribault later saw public laboratory analysis
      of these products, which he says were either water, mineral silica
      or dangerous, unstable synthesis of organic silica.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault had nothing to do with these ventures, but in January
      1996, after a number of apparently genuine complaints had been
      received about these fake products, the Order of Doctors and the
      Order of Pharmacologists, the professional institutions which
      protect the interests of doctors and pharmacists throughout
      France, laid a complaint against Le Ribault before an examining
      Magistrate. The complaint cited the illegal practices of medicine
      and pharmacology. Initially, with the naivete of one divorced from
      politics, Le Ribault was pleased that the complaint had been
      lodged; 'this was something which I had been looking for,
      something which I expected. I thought that now the court would be
      obliged to instruct someone to make the tests'. Le Ribault had
      about six months grace before the hearing was due.<br>
      <br>
      In the middle of these assaults, Le Ribault was unable to see the
      wood for the trees, unable to perceive that an all-out campaign
      had begun, the objective of which was to put an end to the
      therapeutic use of his discovery. His confusion and unhappiness
      were deepened by the death of Jean-Michel Graille in April 1996.
      Graille, perhaps his most articulate public supporter died
      suddenly and unexpectedly, aged fifty, of a stroke, while relaxing
      in his garden.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GOING TO ANTIGUA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Le Ribault looks back upon his own unworldliness and the dangers
      which he has faced with some mirth. His most self-deprecating
      story, in an otherwise dark melodrama, is the story of how he came
      to end up in Antigua.<br>
      <br>
      Following the publication of Graille's story, many individuals
      sent money, in total £500,000, to enable Le Ribault to build a
      clinic. Amongst the sharks who suddenly appeared wanting a piece
      of the action, were a group of businessmen who sought to advice Le
      Ribault on the setting up of a company. He took their advice,
      transferring the control of the new company to nominee
      shareholders suggested by the group.<br>
      <br>
      After some discussion and planning, Le Ribault was told that
      contacts had been made and bank accounts opened, for him to set up
      his clinic in Antigua. Le Ribault's passport had been stolen when
      his house was burgled. With his fare paid by the company, he set
      off for Antigua, undercover, via the French protectorate of
      Martinique. It was only when he landed in Antigua and found no one
      there to meet him, that he began to realise he was alone on the
      other side of the world with no passport, no English language, no
      funds or friends.<br>
      <br>
      'I was told that the Prime Minister himself would be waiting for
      me in Antigua with a diplomatic passport and I would be free to
      travel. I was told that there was a bank account for me and
      everything was ready to start the clinic. Of course, when I got
      there, no one was waiting for me. I had only three small bottles
      of G5'.<br>
      <br>
      As resourceful as ever, Le Ribault began treating the rich,
      elderly and often arthritic boat owners as they returned from
      their days sailing around the coast. At the end of his first days
      work, he had a hundred pounds and appointments for the whole of
      the following week. A week later, he had enough money to travel
      back to France, had he wanted to.<br>
      <br>
      By his own perseverance, Le Ribault made the contacts himself
      which should have been made for him in Antigua.<br>
      <br>
      'I got permission from the Prime Minister to start a health
      centre. I had two kinds of patients, local patients, who have no
      money and I never asked money from them, they paid what they were
      able for their treatment; they brought me fish and vegetables and
      other things. In the evenings I went to the big hotels filled with
      the millionaire tourists, to cure them of their sunburn. Every day
      I had between twenty and forty tourists to cure. G5 gets rid of
      the pain of sunburn within five minutes and within an hour cures
      the sunburn itself. I also taught the barmen in the hotel bars how
      to use G5, so every evening the barmen applied poultices to the
      tourists'.<br>
      <br>
      During his time in Antigua, Le Ribault pursued an embittered
      relationship with his homeland. When he received regulatory
      agreement to produce and use G5 on Antigua, he made sure that the
      French press raised awkward questions about the situation in
      France.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault's strategy of embarrassment was to cost him dear. Two
      days after the issue was raised in the French newspapers, the
      French police raided the home of his eighty-five year old mother
      and questioned her for five hours. His mother, who had been fit
      and healthy before the interrogation, fell ill that evening. She
      never recovered her health and died two weeks later.<br>
      <br>
      The police told Ribault's mother that there was now a warrant out
      for Le Ribault's arrest and they were searching for documents not
      only about G5 but also about Ribault's forensic laboratory CARME.
      Le Ribault thinks now, that when his trouble began to develop over
      G5, the police became concerned about the possible leaking of
      information about sensitive police cases.<br>
      <br>
      Stranded in the Caribbean, Le Ribault was deeply saddened by the
      death of his mother and angered by what appeared to be a
      gratuitous police strategy. He had not hidden himself in Antigua:
      the judge who was dealing with the complaint against him, had his
      fax, phone number and address,<br>
      <br>
      'The police knew that my mother was very old and tired. When she
      died, I suppose they reckoned that I would turn up at the funeral
      and they would be able to arrest me.'<br>
      <br>
      In November 1997, Le Ribault felt obliged to go back to France to
      recover the personal and work documents which he needed to
      continue work in Antigua. Knowing that there was a warrant out for
      his arrest, he decided to return covertly. 'It was my intention to
      show the Antiguan agreements to people in France in the hope that
      I could get a similar one there. I visited doctors and a number of
      other sympathizers who I thought could push my case forward'.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DIRECTLY TO JAIL</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although Le Ribault was 'underground' in France, two of his
      friends suggested that he give a lecture, about G5, to a select
      audience. Unbeknown to him, however, with the intention of
      creating media interest in his case and G5, his friends had
      contacted the police and told them where the seminar was being
      held. To set Le Ribault's mind at ease his friends told him that
      if the police did appear he would be whisked away, leaving
      sympathetic attending journalists to report the crisis. In the
      event Le Ribault was whisked away, not by his friends but by a
      jubilant police posse.<br>
      <br>
      And so, by accident, the most frightening part of Le Ribault's
      journey began.<br>
      <br>
      'I was sent immediately to jail. I was taken first to the Bordeaux
      station of the Regional Crime Squad, from where the police called
      the judge dealing with my case, they said to him, "Victory, we
      have caught Le Ribault"'.<br>
      <br>
      The judge declined to hear Le Ribault that day and he was taken to
      Gradignan prison.<br>
      <br>
      The next day, Le Ribault was taken before the judge for a
      ten-minute hearing. Despite the fact that the only complaint
      against him was, he thought, a civil complaint from the Order of
      Doctors and Pharmacists, the judge ordered that Le Ribault be kept
      in prison. In answer to his lawyer's protests that in the prison,
      he was in danger from men whom he had helped convict, the judge
      ruled that he be kept in solitary confinement.<br>
      <br>
      What worried Le Ribault as he was taken back to the jail, was the
      fact that no time limit had been put on his imprisonment. The
      judge who was clearly 'building a case', had said only that with
      Christmas coming up his schedule would be full and he would not be
      able to hear the case. Le Ribault was also concerned that the
      judge who had been selected to hear his case had been one of the
      main customers for his forensic services when he worked for the
      police: a judge known throughout Bordeaux, according to Le Ribault
      to be 'a crazy judge, very strange, very dangerous'.<br>
      <br>
      Earlier on the day of his arrest, Le Ribault had five teeth
      extracted, now as he entered solitary confinement he was not only
      uncomfortable and isolated but also unable to eat. In the depths
      of winter, with snow falling outside and no heating inside, Le
      Ribault served his solitary in a cell which had next to no glass
      in the windows. Two fingers on one hand and both his feet became
      frozen and, consequently, he now has trouble walking any distance.<br>
      <br>
      'The cold was the worst problem, even greater than not knowing
      when I would be released'.<br>
      <br>
      The deprivations which Le Ribault suffered in a contemporary
      French prison sound echoes of Solzynitsin. As with many prisons,
      old systems had fallen into disuse or been adapted by the screws.
      Every cell had a bell in case of emergency but the guards had
      switched them off because of the continuous noise. To get help,
      the prisoners had to push a piece of paper between the door and
      the door jam which could be seen in the corridor. This, Le Ribault
      says, was 'all right as long as the officers liked you', if they
      didn't, you could wait 'a thousand hours'. The judge allowed Le
      Ribault visits from only two working colleagues, while
      specifically excluding his partner.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault's scientific imagination is also very creative. In
      prison, he not only recorded the day-to-day events and his
      thoughts, but made a number of detailed drawings of his
      surroundings, including the prison courtyard and his cell. Having
      finished these, he began meticulously copying the graffiti of
      other prisoners from the walls; 'Some of the drawings were very
      good, very interesting, some poems had a lot of feeling'.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RELEASED FROM PRISON</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At his second and last hearing before the magistrate, Le Ribault
      discovered that more complaints had accumulated in his file. The
      charges had grown from two civil complaints to include nine
      criminal charges, such as, the selling of a toxic substance,
      illegal experimentation in biology, and advertising a medicine in
      the press. Le Ribault was guilty of none of these further charges.<br>
      <br>
      Of the charge that he was not a doctor, Le Ribault could say only
      that his qualification, that of a Doctor of Science, was the
      highest qualification awarded by a university in France. He also
      made the point that any biologist and similar natural scientist
      who wished to emulate Pasteur, himself not a doctor, stood a good
      chance of being thrown in prison in modern France.<br>
      <br>
      Following the arrest of Le Ribault, the authorities made a number
      of statements relating to G5; one, very much in his favour, was an
      assurance that the substance was completely not toxic.<br>
      <br>
      Desperate to get La Ribault out of this nightmare backwater, his
      lawyer made an application to the High Court for his release.<br>
      <br>
      'I was released by the High Court but the judges reserved their
      opinion and gave it two days after the hearing, which meant that I
      was an extra three days in prison. Three days in which I did not
      know whether I would be released.' <br>
      <br>
      On his release the court imposed strict conditions on his bail, he
      had to surrender his passport and he was to report to the police
      station twice a week.<br>
      <br>
      Released from prison, Le Ribault stayed first with a friend but
      two months after he settled there, he received a phone call from a
      police friend informing him that police officers were on their way
      to arrest him. Five minutes later, with Le Ribault watching from
      the garden, six police officers raided his friend's house.<br>
      <br>
      He went next to stay with another friend, a woman with whom he had
      been in contact while in prison, the next day Le Ribault noticed
      police cars observing the address. This time, he decided to make
      his way to Belgium.<br>
      <br>
      'It took me one month to get to the Belgian border, where I was
      hidden in a police station by a friend who was an officer of the
      Gendarmerie. The policemen drove me over the Belgian frontier,
      using his police papers. From there I rang Belgium friends and
      spent four months in an isolated house in the middle of the
      Ardennes forest'.<br>
      <br>
      From Belgium, Le Ribault went secretly to England and from there
      to Jersey, where he has stayed for the last eleven months. He is
      now very aware of his position as man without a home or a public
      identity. Although he does not mention it, he must frequently
      weigh up his situation in light of his early brilliant career.<br>
      <br>
      'My friends have helped me because I have absolutely nothing. I
      have no money, no relatives. I am an illegal person, a stateless
      alien'.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SOME JERSEY CASES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Loic Le Ribault has become a medical attraction on Jersey; he has
      given his treatment, now called OS5, to hundreds of people and
      although a few have found it to be ineffective for certain
      conditions, in the main, his clients have been satisfied. Most of
      those who have been treated know of Le Ribault's deeper problems
      and some of them, infected by the fear which surrounds such cases
      do not want to be interviewed. Many others, however, are
      transparently behind him in his efforts to provide OS5 to wider
      public.<br>
      <br>
      Maria de Jesus is a nervous and exuberant thirty three year old
      Maderian who has lived in Jersey for the last 22 years. In the
      first months of this year, training to run 150 miles across the
      Sahara desert in the Marathon des Sables, she nearly broke her
      ankle when her foot caught in a hole.<br>
      <br>
      With five weeks to go before the marathon, hospital doctors gave
      her crutches and told her that she would definitely not be fit for
      the race. She became increasingly convinced of this, when after a
      week and a half of concentrated physiotherapy, she was no better.<br>
      <br>
      A friend suggested that she visit Le Ribault and made an
      appointment for her.<br>
      <br>
      'My friend rang him at eight o'clock in the evening and he said
      come over. I told him about my ankle, he looked at it and told me
      that I would be able to do the race. I did not believe him and was
      very sceptical. I had to drink a spoonful as well as putting a
      poultice on my foot. I was quite frightened but I was willing to
      do anything in order to go on the race'.<br>
      <br>
      Maria says that, after taking OS5 for a few days, she felt more
      energetic and began jogging. A week after she began the treatment,
      her ankle was completely healed. Three weeks later, Maria set off
      for Morocco where she ran the gruelling one hundred and fifty mile
      race across the desert.<br>
      <br>
      Maria has advised a number of her friends to use 0S5 and to see Le
      Ribault and says that from these people, she has not had a single
      complaint.<br>
      <br>
      'This is a treatment with absolutely no adverse side effects and
      it should be freely available to people. I hope that Mr Le Ribault
      is able to open a clinic here on the island'.<br>
      <br>
      Frank Amy is a tough, level headed, sceptical working-class man,
      who has had a crumbling spine for the last eighteen years.
      Initially it was Le Ribaut who contacted Amy, wanting him to help
      in introducing OS5 to the Island. After his first meeting with Le
      Ribault, Ames read the case histories of other treatments and felt
      complete disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      Amy, who had been on strong pharmaceutical pain killers for eight
      years, was sleeping only from two to five hours a night because of
      discomfort and pain but what really upset him was that he was
      unable to bend enough to tie his shoe laces. After his first
      meeting with Le Ribault in November 1997, Amy began treating
      himself with OS5.<br>
      <br>
      Feeling that it was important, 'to be fair to the treatment', Amy
      stopped taking his expensive pain killers. Within a fortnight of
      taking the treatment he was feeling and sleeping better; some
      nights he was sleeping for eight hours. Within a month he could
      bend down to tie his shoe laces. Amy took OS5 for ten weeks, now,
      seven months after the treatment, he says he still feels very well
      and he is almost able to touch his toes without the slightest
      pain. Apart from the continuing problem of a crumbling spine and
      occasional painful twinges which he puts down to sensitive nerves,
      he considers himself cured.<br>
      <br>
      Since his experience with OS5, Frank Amy has become the
      distributor of the therapy on Jersey. As Head Constable of his
      elected Parish police, one of twelve on Jersey, Amy is in charge
      of licensing; he also sits in the States Parliament. With these
      duties, he feels a certain responsibility for Le Ribault and his
      therapy, he also feels that it is important to get proper legal
      status for him and a specially built clinic. Amy suggests that his
      full time post as Head Constable, a little like an English Mayor
      means that he should 'assist the people as much as possible'. He
      sees the possibility of help being extended to Le Ribault because
      he is in effect a businessman, and to his parishioners who might
      gain from his treatment. Sitting in the States parliament, Amy
      also keeps a weather eye on the Island's drugs bill and can see
      evident savings if OS5 were to be used more widely.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Leverdier is a forty year old pool technician for the Jersey
      General Hospital, a carefully spoken triathalon athlete who works
      with patients in the hospital pool. In early 1998 he suffered with
      chronic achilles tendonitis, a painful tightening and jamming of
      the achilles tendon often caused by overtraining.<br>
      <br>
      Laverdier's tendonitis had lasted for six months and was badly
      affecting the running and cycling aspects of his triatholon
      events. A physiotherapist colleague at the hospital had tried to
      treat the condition with ultra sound and frictions (a massaging of
      the tendon). After six months, the problem had been going on for
      so long that Leverdier began to think that he would reluctantly
      have to take long-term rest.<br>
      <br>
      In February, after Laverdier was introduced to Le Ribault, he put
      SO5 on a tissue, taped it to the back of his ankle and left it
      overnight. Previously, when he went running, the pain on starting
      to run and speeding up had been crippling. The morning after he
      treated himself, there was no pain and, when he had finished, the
      tendon was not jammed up with heavy mucus as it had been in the
      past. He continued with the treatment for two more consecutive
      nights, now treating both tendons. Five months after the
      treatment, Laverdier seems to have shaken off the tendonitis
      completely and is turning in triatholon times which he would have
      been proud of five years ago.<br>
      <br>
      Laverdier has still not told his colleagues at work about his
      self-medication; he would, he says, be embarrassed by their
      scepticism.<br>
      <br>
      <b>THE MEANING OF A STORY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dr Loic Le Ribault's story reads in part like a Walt Disney film
      in which the boffin-like scientist, after some hocus pocus in the
      laboratory, discovers a 'cure-all elixir' and is then hounded,
      chemical flask in hand, by men in black hats. From another
      perspective, however, his story reads in shades of the darkest
      noire, a synthesis of classic contemporary dramas, in which the
      publicly concerned scientist, finds himself, like Ibsen's
      character, in 'An Enemy of the People', beyond the pale of the
      orthodox community, branded as a fraud and a charlatan and hounded
      by the furies of profit and power.<br>
      <br>
      However we read the tale, we might recognise it as a once
      apocryphal story which is fast becoming an everyday reality. The
      scientist, medical scientist or doctor, forced to work beyond
      orthodoxy and subjected to powerful manipulation, ridicule,
      sabotage or criminalisation, is becoming an increasingly common
      figure in contemporary drama and real life.<br>
      <br>
      Although the ethnic or national details of these histories of
      scientific dissent, whether their subject be BSE, Vitamin B6, OS5,
      cold fusion, homoeopathy or everlasting light bulbs, differ
      slightly, they are all Euro-American stories of the post-modern
      era. Le Ribault's case, that of a well established scientist
      living on an independently governed island, in exile from a
      European, apparently democratic, power and owning a medicinal
      product which is legally produced and distributed across the
      world, illustrates the international nature of the condition.<br>
      <br>
      It would be theoretically attractive to describe a temporal and
      social continuum for dissident scientists, beginning with the
      resurgence of science as a powerful ideology in the
      post-industrial period. In fact, the struggle between science and
      the ideological establishment and within science between its
      ruling groups and its dissidents, has changed little in quality,
      since the time of Galileo who was tortured by the Catholic church
      for claiming that the earth revolved around the sun.<br>
      <br>
      It seems possible, however, that a century ago, or even fifty
      years ago, Le Ribault's work, pursued only out of a pure and
      curious interest in science and health, might have been supported
      by the State or by philanthropists and the results of his work
      offered by some commercial organisation to the people. In
      post-industrial Europe and France particularly, 'the public' no
      longer has a voice at powerful tables. Today the remarkable
      discovery of Loic Le Ribault and Norbert Duffault, which is
      indisputably in the interests of the public, has become the
      carrion for the wolves of private, vested interests.<br>
      <br>
      In an era when the market, especially in medicine, is fought over
      by multinational corporations and manipulated by huge trading
      blocs, Le Ribault's path is an increasingly well-trodden one. The
      metropolitan centres of orthodox industrial science are now
      fringed by dissidents: intellectual 'travellers' who are as surely
      banished as the religious heretics who wandered medieval Europe.<br>
      <br>
      In the post-modern era, vested commercial interests regulate both
      science and medicine and more than ever before the leading
      institutions of the scientific and medical professions are in the
      pockets of industry. This free-for-all between science,
      professional dogmatism and vested interests was most colourfully
      displayed during the years which followed Robert Gallo's
      'discovery' that the probable cause of AIDS was HIV.<br>
      <br>
      For those who take an interest in dissent within science, the year
      1985 is recognisable as the point at which scientific work began
      to be reviewed by press conference rather than peers groups. In
      France, in the years that the Wellcome Foundation protected its
      monopoly licence for AZT, a number of medical research scientists
      found themselves facing the possibility of criminal charges, for
      persuing their own scientific investigations of AIDS related
      illness. In both Britain and America, scientists who failed to
      concur with the viral model of AIDS-related illness were frozen
      out of their work and their funding withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      When Le Ribault and Professor Duffaut applied to have G5 tested on
      people with AIDS-related illnesses, in 1987, the Wellcome
      Foundation had, weeks before, gained its monopoly licence to
      market AZT. This initial licensing in Britain and America, which
      had been received only six months after Phase II trials for the
      drug had been aborted, was followed by a multi-million dollar
      campaign across the world, beseeching governments to buy. In 1989,
      for example, the Brazilian government paid US$130 million for AZT.
      France bought into AZT within a matter of weeks of it being
      licensed.<br>
      <br>
      It was clear from the amount of money which Wellcome pumped into
      professional committees, advertising and ongoing research into
      AZT, that when a country bought AZT, it was also expected to cease
      research on any other approach to the problem of Aids- related
      illnesses. In America and other European countries,
      non-pharmaceutical and specifically non anti-viral approaches to
      AIDS, were discouraged.<br>
      <br>
      The other ailments for which OS5 has proved most effective, rather
      than speculative, have been inflammatory illnesses like arthritis
      and injuries such as muscle strains. These are all highly
      competitive areas of profit for the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
      <br>
      If Ribault's case is anything to go by, the French, like the
      Americans, appear to have a very demonstrative way of resolving
      their battles over science. While the British tend to be fair and
      transparent in theory, while secretly smudging decisions in
      practice, the French take their recalcitrant scientists to court
      or throw them in prison, while at the same time silencing the
      press.<br>
      <br>
      In Italy, patients and cancer doctors have been publicly divided
      by the unorthodox vitamin and hormone treatment developed by
      Professor Luigi Di Bella. But there, as is often the case in
      Italy, the people have taken to the streets to express their
      views, turning choice in medicine into a fundamentally political
      issue, related to concepts of democracy as well as science.<br>
      <br>
      In America and Canada, countless physicians and research
      scientists working especially in the field of innovative cancer
      treatments have been pushed over the national boundaries, into
      Mexico or to off-shore islands like the Bahamas. During the early
      nineties, a number of herbal practitioners were sent to prison for
      contravening the laws which govern the use and prescription of
      herbs. Throughout the eighties and nineties, numerous
      practitioners have been brought before professional disciplinary
      panels for practising alternative or complementary medicine. In
      1995, armed FDA officers, in search of B vitamin complexes, raided
      the laboratory and offices of one of America's leading nutritional
      doctors, Jonathan Wright. Clinic workers were made to raise their
      hands and stand against the wall, while officers pointed guns at
      them. It took the agents, with the help of police, fourteen hours
      to strip the clinic of all equipment and its vitamin and food
      supplement stocks.<br>
      <br>
      In 1989, a French Canadian scientist and pioneer of microscopy,
      Gaston Naessens, was put on trial in Quebec. After forty years'
      research, Naessens, had concluded that it was possible to diagnose
      cancer by observing the life-history of micro-organisms in the
      blood. The Canadian government and the medical establishment
      indicted Naessens on charges of manslaughter as well as the
      illegal practice of medicine. More recently, another French
      Canadian, medical doctor Dr Guylaine Lanctot, resigned from the
      Royal College of Canadian Physicians, rather than stand
      disciplinary trial over her position on vaccination and what she
      had termed The Medical Mafia, in her book of that name.<br>
      <br>
      In Britain, in 1990, powerful individuals within orthodox medicine
      and medical science, tried to shut down the Bristol Cancer Help
      Centre. They gave world-wide publicity to bogus research results
      claiming that anyone going to the Centre was three times more
      likely to die of cancer than someone who sought orthodox help. In
      1997, vested interests in science and the pharmaceutical industry
      managed to persuade the new Labour government that the sale of
      vitamin B6, particularly useful in cases of stress and hormonal
      problems in women, should be restricted.<br>
      <br>
      Because the power of today's corporations is so awesome, there are
      fewer and fewer people willing to fight the corner for the Loic Le
      Ribaults of the world, disparaged or criminalised by the system.
      This lack of popular defence for those who argue the public
      interest is a sad reflection on European democracy. Although the
      voice of the dissident has always been with us, the wilderness
      into which that voice now sounds has radically changed in the
      post-industrial era. Dissidents are no longer popular figures as
      they were in the nineteen fifties and sixties.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault has harsh words for the French public, who he feels
      must have known of his circumstances but did nothing.<br>
      <br>
      'I have cured maybe 20,000 patients and there are now many doctors
      using OS5. Everyone in France knew that I was put in jail, many of
      my patients knew that I was in jail. Yet I received only 30
      letters. Even about such an important problem as their own health,
      French people unfortunately do not act together. I keep
      remembering that during the second world war, many of them were
      like sheep and numerous people in authority collaborated with the
      enemy. Only a very few dared make any resistance. I have lost
      everything to help people, now the patients have to fight if they
      want the cure. They have to ask for the right to use the medicines
      they want'.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault sees the patients 'right to choose' as being the
      salient right in the dispute between himself and the French State.
      In arriving at this conclusion, he has much in common with those
      on the American Right who are demanding the break up of big
      regulatory government and protective professional cartels.<br>
      <br>
      'One point of great weight' Le Ribault says, 'seems to have been
      forgotten in this whole affair. It is not the medical authorities
      who should be deciding the fate of sick people. It is for the sick
      themselves and only the sick to make such decisions'.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault has so far survived his ordeal, with his sense of
      humour remarkably intact and his mental and moral faculties well-
      balanced. He is presently putting the finishing touches to a 400
      page book entitled A Letter to my Judges. The book bears no
      resemblance at all to The History of a Grain of Sand the major
      work of his intellectual youth. His new book is a gauntlet thrown
      at the feet of the French establishment, studded with the names,
      addresses and telephone numbers of those in the judicial and
      policing establishment who brought about his downfall. It reads
      like a handbook for intellectual guerilla warfare. Not
      surprisingly, the book will not be published by any of Europe's
      leading publishing houses but sent only in a special edition of
      500 to individuals in the French media. Although Le Ribault holds
      out little hope, and has, anyway, little desire for his political
      and social resurrection in France, he still wants to force the
      French establishment, the police and the judiciary in particular,
      to face their crimes.<br>
      <br>
      If A Letter to my Judges fails to stir the conscience of the
      French Republic, then Le Ribault hopes that his case, due to be
      heard before the European Court of Human Rights in the next months
      and involving thirty-seven charges against the French authorities,
      will at least send a public signal to those who have tried to
      destroy him. His struggle has turned Le Ribault into a political
      radical; he says ironically, that although he has never had
      anything to do with French politics, his next book could well be
      about revolution.<br>
      <br>
      On a personal level, Le Ribault is becoming frustrated with his
      virtual house arrest in Jersey. Despite the fact that the
      authorities have acted with understanding and the locals with
      empathy, and although he still considers plans to set up a clinic
      there, he also feels the call of his newly-adopted Antigua. He
      hopes in time to reclaim his possessions, his books and papers,
      from France, and begin a new life of retirement working on his
      molecule and fishing in the warm clear seas around the island.<br>
      <br>
      His principal regret, he says laconically, 'is not that I have
      this story to tell, but that such a story should have to be told
      in modern France'. Asked if he is sad that he cannot return to
      France, Le Ribault is definite: 'I never' he says, slowly, 'wish
      to set my foot on France soil again ... ever. Perhaps to see the
      graves of my parents, for a moment I would go back' he adds, 'but
      then come away again. I consider now that I was before a citizen
      of Brittany and not of France'. He can hardly contain his anger,
      'I have been told by the police that if I am in France again, I
      would not just be arrested but killed. I hate France' he says
      softly.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault now feels, that he has done all he is personally able
      to do with OS5:<br>
      <br>
      'I have agents in many countries and about 100 doctors and
      practitioners now using OS5. I receive calls from new doctors
      every day, there is a lot of interest in France, Belgium, Ireland,
      Switzerland and Portugal. I have the task of improving the
      molecule, it is doctors that should be treating people. The
      production of OS5 is in France, it is legal and it is non-toxic
      and it is to high standards.'<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault is still angry and perturbed that the French government
      did not take the discovery from him and Norbert Duffaut, taken
      over its production, and introduced it to the world as an accepted
      international medicine.<br>
      <br>
      'But' he says, 'It is not the government who are in control of the
      country, but the multinational corporations and the financial
      people, my struggle is evidence of that'.<br>
      <br>

      </b><br>
      1 -- Between 1982 and 1991, Le Ribault gave evidence in over a
      thousand cases, helping to convict 800 defendants mainly of murder
      and other violent crimes. He introduced not only the electron
      scanning Microscope to French criminal forensic work, but also the
      high technology mobile laboratory constructed in the back of a
      van. He published over fifty papers in journals about different
      aspects of forensic work and was the subject of hundreds of
      newspaper articles.<br>
      <br>
      2 -- Le Ribault received his doctorate in geology and as a result
      of his early work with electron microscopy, he got to know silica
      so well, that he could determine the geological history of a grain
      of sand. In his first book The History of a Grain of Sand, told
      this very story. When he was first approached by the FBI to test
      three blinded sand samples, he was able to tell them the exact
      location in the world from which they had been collected, that one
      sample had been gathered from the bonnet of a car and that another
      had been in the vicinity of an explosion in Buiruit.<br>

      <br>
      Silicium Laboratories LLC's Organic Silica 5th generation molecule
      was invented by the late Dr. Loïc Le Ribault. Throughout the
      nineteen eighties, Loïc Le Ribault was the most important and
      renowned forensic scientist in France . He collaborated with the
      FBI and was greatly admired by his American colleagues. This
      collaboration and admiration was expressed by the Pulitzer winner,
      John McPhee, in his book Irons in the Fire, 1998. As a precocious
      young academic with a love for silica, Le Ribault had
      ground-breaking papers published by the French Academy of Science.
      At twenty-four, in 1971, he discovered a new function for the
      electron scanning microscope (ESM), called exoscopy, which enabled
      him to discern the history of grains of sand.<br>
      <br>
      The following year, in 1972, while working with sand on the ESM,
      Le Ribault made an interesting discovery: a layer of water-soluble
      amorphous silica which contained micro-organisms covered the
      surface of some sand grains. He found that these micro organism
      and the secretions which they left on the sand contained organic
      silica. Organic silica differs from mineral silica which makes up
      the majority of the earths crust, in that it contains carbon and
      can be readily assimilated by animals.<br>
      <br>
      By 1975, Le Ribault had created a process by which it was possible
      to recover these deposits from the surface of the sand. All of
      this work was accepted by the scientific establishment and his
      papers published by the French Academy of Science.<br>
      <br>
      There has been constant research into organic silica over the
      previous fifty years and some of this research had raised
      questions about its therapeutic use. In his early work, as a
      geologist, Le Ribault had not been following the research into
      silica and health. However, in the early eighties, while working
      on the organic silica deposits he had found, he immersed his hands
      in an organic silica solution and found that his psoriasis was
      cured. From then on, Le Ribault's work became focused in the
      therapeutic properties of silica.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault repeatedly tested and refined his organic silica
      molecule until he had the safest and highest bioavailable form on
      the market. This molecule, now known as 5th generation organic
      Silica, is the best known product in Europe and the most efficient
      way to take silica. It has a 70% assimilation rate compared to the
      5-20% rate found with other silica molecules on the market.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault gave lectures and taught courses throughout the world.
      He authored 11 books and published dozens of well received
      scientific studies. The last conference he held was in Barcelona
      on May 20, 2005 in the Exhibition Hall to 500 doctors and
      professional nutritionists. He died in 2007.<br>
      <br>
      Loïc Le Ribault left two great legacies: the exoscopy and the
      organic silica molecule contained in Silicium products. In 2005, a
      collaborative agreement was signed between Silicium Laboratories
      Ltd. in Europe and Loïc Le Ribault to commercialize his discovery
      through the manufacture, promotion and distribution of his organic
      silica molecule and its derivatives. Thanks to Loïc Le Ribault,
      5th generation organic Silica is now available in the USA , UK and
      worldwide.<br>

      Silicium G5 Siliplant is a dietary supplement that provides
      bioavailable organic silica to the body. Silica is an essential
      oligoelement for humans, meaning it is indispensable for the body.
      Silicium G5 Siliplant restructures and helps maintaining a healthy
      metabolism in general. It shows no side effects. Many people
      suffer from dietary deficiencies of silica, due to this, an extra
      input of silica is very important (Seaborn Nielsen 1993-2004).<br>

      There are a few scientists who have advanced the study of
      orthomolecular nutrition and Loic le Ribault is certainly among
      them. His discovery of the process of developing a high potency
      form of organic silica could potentially revolutionize the
      treatment of wounds, psoriasis, cardiovascular diseases,
      arthritis, and a myriad of ailments plaguing mankind today.
      Organic silica happens to be one mineral that most people are
      deficient in and our ability to assimilate the optimum daily
      amount not only diminishes with age but is nearly impossible to
      obtain solely from plant sources. His discovery and subsequent
      successful study of thousands of "patients" throughout Europe with
      OS5, his patented form of high-potency organic silica, must not be
      forgotten even though he will likely never be mentioned in our
      "corporate-controlled" history books.<br>
      <br>
      Loic le Ribault, who had a doctorate in geology, was Frances most
      renowned forensic scientist. While in his 20s, several of his
      groundbreaking research articles were published by the French
      Academy of Science.<br>
      <br>
      <b>History of a grain of sand</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In 1971, Le Ribault discovered a unique function for the electron
      scanning microscope (ESM), enabling him to discern the entire
      history of a grain of sandwhere and when it originated, how it
      was formed, where and how it had been transported, where it had
      next lodged and how long it had stayed in that place.<br>
      <br>
      By the time he had finished his research, he had devised a list of
      250 criteria by which the history of sand might be diagnosed. The
      field was later to become so specialized that it would take three
      years to train a scientist in the technical knowledge necessary to
      interpret the data from these tests.<br>
      <br>
      While in the process of understanding more about the silica
      coating on grains of sand, he wrote his first book, The History of
      a Grain of Sand. When Le Ribault was first approached by the U.S.
      Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) to test three sand samples,
      he was able to tell them the exact location in the world from
      which each had been collected, such as identifying one as coming
      from Beirut, Lebanon in the vicinity of an explosion.<br>
      <br>
      In 1972, while working with sand on the ESM he made an interesting
      discovery: A layer of water-soluble amorphous silica which
      contained micro-organisms covered the surface of some sand grains.
      When looking through the ESM at certain grains of sand with
      10,000x magnification, the image looks something like a flower
      blooming (see photo in silica story above).<br>
      <br>
      What this mineral flower represents is secondary crystallizations
      that develop on quartz crystals under specific conditions. Certain
      grains of sand acquire these deposits from the combined actions of
      micro-organisms that break down the sand and the diverse
      environmental conditions in which the granule finds itself. The
      end result is a form of silica that contains more carbon and
      hydrogen thus making it organic in nature.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of this discovery may not seem significant to some,
      but to others, especially those who are interested in leading a
      healthier lifestyle, its importance rings loud and clear. Organic
      silica differs from mineral silica in that it contains carbon and
      can be readily assimilated by animals, making his discovery
      important for its potential therapeutic applications.<br>
      <br>
      Though our bodies are made out of minerals, they do not readily
      assimilate minerals found in rocks and soil. Our bodies require
      minerals that are organic by nature; minerals that micro-organisms
      or plant life have converted into organic, bioavailable forms. The
      only foods known to contain reasonable amounts of silica are some
      vegetables, bamboo, the husks of seeds, and horsetail herb. But
      the main problem is that the amount of silica in these foods is
      simply not enough to support our body's daily requirements for
      silica, which increases as we age.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Harvesting organic silica</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      By 1975, Le Ribault had created a process by which it was possible
      to recover these deposits from the surface of the sand. All of
      this work was accepted by the scientific establishment and his
      papers were published by the French Academy of Science. Although
      much research had been conducted on the possible therapeutic
      applications of organic silica since the 1930s, Le Ribault had not
      been following this research as he continued perfecting the
      process of extracting organic silica deposits from grains of sand.<br>
      <br>
      But, in the early 80s, while working on the organic silica
      deposits, he immersed his hands in an organic silica solution and
      found that his psoriasis had disappeared. From then on, Le
      Ribaults work became focused on the therapeutic properties of
      silica.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;<b>Adventures in microscopy</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      After le Ribault discovered his silica "blooms," he continued on
      with his career of microscopic adventures until he found himself
      at the head of the worlds forensic experts. In 1982 he set up his
      own laboratory known as CARME which became the main laboratory
      used by the French police, judiciary and the French Home Office
      for solving crimes. He would go to the scene of the crime, take
      samples, go back to his laboratory CARME and investigate what had
      occurred.<br>
      <br>
      Through amazing skill and keen observation, the mystery as to what
      happened would be revealed, often leading to solving the case. For
      many years he performed incredible feats of detective work, acting
      as though he was a veritable Sherlock Holmes only with a much more
      powerful magnifying glass.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Blacklisted</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Unfortunately, as a result of his work on organic silica, the same
      agencies that Le Ribault had worked with turned against him,
      funneling to the media false information. In 1985, Le Ribault
      published a famous comprehensive text entitled "Microanalysis and
      Criminology," which was distributed to all the Gendarmeries
      (police force) in France. Several years later, text from this
      publication was later reviewed and some "interesting"
      modifications were discovered. Important references to CARME were
      missing, his method for marking invisible objects was no longer
      mentioned as patented and his name was completely omitted from his
      own report. After these unfortunate events, CARME was not able to
      stay open for more than a few more years due to lack of clients.<br>
      <br>
      Although this was hard for Le Ribault to handle, he was a
      resilient fellow. Thankfully, during the years CARME had been in
      operation, he had been engaged in research with a highly acclaimed
      research chemist, Professor Norbert Duffaut from the University of
      Bordeaux who had synthesized an organo-silicon molecule. Between
      them, they hoped to develop an easy to ingest form of organic
      silica and to apply it therapeutically to patients who they
      believed could benefit from its application.<br>
      <br>
      Success. He stabilized it in salicylic-acid and it proved to be an
      effective therapy. Duffaut treated numerous patients and stated
      having success with joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis, skin
      ailments and other health conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault and Duffaut worked together for many years, treating
      patients for free out of their own houses. In 1985, they secured
      an international patent for their organic silica formulation which
      they called G4. Word soon spread about their successes with G4 and
      articles were published about their discovery in newspapers and
      popular magazines.<br>
      <br>
      Persecution. In November 1993, after 12 years of working together,
      and perhaps as a consequence of their work on the new therapy,
      Duffaut was dead, poisoned in suspicious circumstances and Le
      Ribault himself had suffered two months solitary confinement in a
      French jail. The primary charge? Practicing medicine without a
      license.<br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault had always justified his lack of a license for both
      himself and his reformulatedproduct, G5, saying G5 was a natural,
      non-toxic substance that was more of a tonic or dietary
      supplement.<br>
      <br>
      Vindication. Then, in October, 1995, an investigative article
      written by Jean-Michel Graille appeared in the magazine, Sud-Ouest
      Dimanche, outlining most of the case studies done by Le Ribault
      and Duffaut, including pictures and testimonials from satisfied
      patients. The response was overwhelming.<br>
      <br>
      In the three months following the articles publication, Le
      Ribault did his best to treat thousands of people who converged on
      the area needing help. The backlash from the pharmaceutical and
      medical professions was swift. Apparently, local pharmacists lost
      35 percent of their business during this tidal wave of patients
      seeking help from Ribaults new formulation, G5.<br>
      <br>
      The rest of Le Ribaults story takes a turn for the worst after
      his G5 gained so much notoriety. He had been appealing to several
      pharmaceutical laboratories about the importance of G5,
      encouraging them to produce it. After 15 years there was no reply
      except from one pharmaceutical executive who was willing to give
      him $1 million USD in exchange for his patents. The man wanted to
      put an end to G5, which he stated "is showing to be too
      effective."<br>
      <br>
      Exile. Although Le Ribault denied the offer, several charlatans
      began capitalizing on the popularity of G5, and imitation and
      frequently dangerous products flooded the market, leading to his
      arrest. After spending several months in prison, he ended up
      fleeing France through Belgium and then onto England where he
      settled on Jersey, the southernmost of the Channel Islandsabout
      as close to France as one can be without being there. He spent a
      few years in Jersey, making a significant impact on the health of
      its residents.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b> A couple of his Jersey cases</b><br>
      <br>
      Le Ribault began administering his treatment, now called OS5, to
      hundreds of people and although a few found it to be ineffective
      for certain conditions, in the main, his clients were extremely
      satisfied. Most of those who were treated knew of Le Ribaults
      deeper problems and some of them, infected by the fear which
      surrounds such cases, did not want to share their stories
      publicly. However, there were many more who stood by him in his
      efforts to provide OS5 to more and more people.<br>
      <br>
      Maria. Thirty-six year old athlete Maria de Jesus had lived in
      Jersey since 1982. In 2004, she began training to run 150 miles
      across the Sahara desert in the Marathon des Sables, but nearly
      broke her ankle when her foot caught in a hole. With only five
      weeks to go before the marathon, hospital doctors gave her
      crutches and told her she would definitely not be fit for the
      race. She became increasingly convinced of this, when after a week
      and a half of concentrated physiotherapy, she was no better.<br>
      <br>
      A friend suggested that she visit Le Ribault and made an
      appointment for her.<br>
      <br>
      "My friend rang him at eight oclock in the evening and he said
      come over. I told him about my ankle, he looked at it and told me
      that I would be able to do the race. I did not believe him and was
      very skeptical. I had to drink a spoonful as well as putting a
      poultice on my foot. I was quite frightened but I was willing to
      do anything in order to go on the race."<br>
      <br>
      After taking OS5 for a few days, Maria felt more energetic and
      began jogging. A week later, her ankle had completely recovered.
      Three weeks later, Maria set off for Morocco where she ran the
      grueling, 150 mile race across the desert.<br>
      <br>
      Frank. Frank Amy is a tough, level headed, skeptical working-class
      man, who has had a crumbling spine for the last 18 years. Amy, who
      had been on strong pharmaceutical pain killers for eight years,
      was sleeping only two to five hours a night because of discomfort
      and pain but what really upset him was his inability to bend
      enough to tie his shoe laces. After his first meeting with Le
      Ribault in November 1997, Amy began treating himself with OS5.<br>
      <br>
      Feeling that it was important "to be fair to the process" Amy
      stopped taking his expensive pain killers. Within two weeks of
      taking the treatment he was feeling and sleeping better; some
      nights he slept for eight hours. Within a month he could bend down
      to tie his shoe laces.<br>
      <br>
      Amy took OS5 for 10 weeks. Seven months after this trial period,
      he still felt good and was almost able to touch his toes without
      the slightest pain. Apart from the continuing problem of a
      crumbling spine and occasional painful twinges which he puts down
      to sensitive nerves, he considers himself symtom-free.<br>
      <br>
      Paul: Paul Leverdier was a 40-year-old pool technician for the
      Jersey General Hospital, a carefully spoken triathalete who works
      with patients in the hospital pool.<br>
      <br>
      In early 1998 he was suffering from chronic Achilles tendonitis, a
      painful tightening and jamming of the Achilles tendon often caused
      by overtraining. After six months without relief, a
      physiotherapist colleague at the hospital tried to treat the
      condition with ultra sound and frictions (a massaging of the
      tendon).<br>
      <br>
      After another six months, the problem had been going on for so
      long that Leverdier began to think that he would reluctantly have
      to take long-term rest. After Laverdier was introduced to Le
      Ribault, he taped OS5 to the back of his ankle and left it
      overnight. Previously, when he went running, the pain on starting
      to run and speeding up had been crippling.<br>
      <br>
      The morning after he treated himself, there was no pain and, when
      he had finished, the tendon was not jammed up with heavy mucus as
      it had been in the past.<br>
      <br>
      Leverdier continued with using OS5 for two more consecutive
      nights, applying it to both tendons. Five months later,
      Laverdiers tendonitis was completely gone and he turned in
      triatholon times he would have been proud of five years earlier.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Loic Le Ribaults legacy</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      He successfully worked with more than 100,000 people with
      something as simple as an organic mineral. Le Ribault described
      his organic silica as a very important substance that proved its
      importance time after time. He stated that, "it has the capacity
      to penetrate the outer and inner layers of the skin to be diffused
      throughout the body, reaching areas that have been damaged, or are
      suffering from pain. It a anti-inflammatory processes and
      strengthens the immune defenses of the organism. It plays a major
      role in supporting collagen formation, bone mineralization and
      body metabolism in general. With age, the amount of organic silica
      present in the body dwindles irreversibly, since the human system
      is incapable of transforming the mineral silica ingested from food
      and drink into organic silica."<br>
      <br>
      It is fairly self-evident the monumental importance of Le
      Ribaults discoveries and their applications. Because of them, Le
      Ribault was known wherever he went. People he had never met, upon
      hearing his name would come over and introduce themselves and
      thank him for everything he had done for them or a family member.
      Many times it was these people that helped Le Ribault out when he
      was in desperate need.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that Loic Le Ribault had passed on in June of this
      year, we felt it was important that he not only be remembered but
      never forgotten for the important contributions he made to the
      science of orthomolecular nutrition and to humanity as a
      compassionate practitioner.<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A substance with therapeutic applications comprises, in aqueous
      solution: (1) at least one organo-silicon compound having either
      of the following formulas: in which: n is an integer between 1 and
      1000, and preferably between 1 and 50; p, q, r are integers
      between 0 and 1000, and preferably between 0 and 60; R and R'
      represent, independently of one another, a linear aliphatic group,
      branched or cyclic, saturated or not, hetero-linear branched or
      not, cyclic saturated or not, aromatic, heteroaromatic,
      arylaliphatic, or heteroarylaliphatic, which may also be
      functional, whilst R may also be OH, OR or OSiR3; SIGMA is R, H or
      SiR3, where R is as previously defined; SIGMA ' is R and more
      particularly CH3, OR, OH or OSiR3, where R is as defined above,
      and (2) at least one metal selected from the group comprising
      titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, germanium, chromium,
      rhodium, gold, iridium, platinum, osmium, the rare earths and
      uranyl derivatives, preferably in the form of a salt, an oxide or
      a hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention concerns new substances with therapeutic
      applications, usable in particular to treat certain troubles of
      cellular mitosis and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the prior art human beings for many years,
        due in particular to the discoveries of N. DUFFAUT.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      These water-soluble and atoxic compounds pass easily through the
      epidermis and dermis on local application (GUEYNE, DUFFAUT and
      QUILICHINI, Therapie 1962, 17, 417).<br>
      <br>
      The numerous therapeutic properties of these organo-silicon
      compounds used on their own have been disclosed in several patents
      (in particular French <b>Pat. Nos. 2.158.068, 2.160.293 and
        2.230.376).</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to these documents, organo-silicon compounds are
      administered by intraveinous or intramuscular injection or by
      electrophoresis, the active ingredient being then in solution in
      water (isotonic solution), with the possible addition of an
      alcohol or polyalcohol, such as glycerol and/or a sodium salt of a
      pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid.<br>
      <br>
      It has previously been shown, in particular in the above mentioned
      patents, that certain substances of various kinds are able to
      potentiate and widen the scope of the organo-silicon compounds.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been unexpectedly found that it is possible to obtain a
      new substance with therapeutic applications by combining one or
      more organo-silicon compounds with one or more metals, preferably
      in the form of their salts (chloride, nitrate, sulfate or organic
      acid salt, for example) or in the form of oxides or hydroxides,
      all this by way of example with no limiting effect.<br>
      <br>
      The metals concerned are titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium,
      chromium, germanium, rhodium, gold, iridium, platinum and/or
      osmium, but use may also be made of uranyl derivatives and the
      rare earths.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been found that substances of this type are especially
      useful for treating certain troubles of cellular mitosis and
      cardiovascular diseases against which they have a specific action,
      and that the substances thus obtained can be simply administered
      transcutaneously.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one aspect, the invention consists in a substance with
      therapeutic applications, usable in particular for treating
      troubles of cellular mitosis and cardiovascular diseases,
      comprising, in aqueous solution:<br>
      <br>
      (1) at least one organo-silicon compound having either of the
      following formulas: ##STR2## in which : n is an integer between 1
      and 1 000, and preferably between 1 and 50;<br>
      <br>
      p,q,r are integers between 0 and 1 000, and preferably between 0
      and 60<br>
      <br>
      R and R' represent, independently of one another, a linear
      aliphatic group, branched or cyclic, saturated or not,
      hetero-linear branched or not, cyclic saturated or not, aromatic,
      heteroaromatic, arylaliphatic, or heteroarylaliphatic, which may
      also be functional, whilst R may also be OH, OR or OSiR3 ;<br>
      <br>
      .SIGMA. is R, H or SiR3, where R is as previously defined;<br>
      <br>
      .SIGMA.' is R and more particularly CH3, OR, OH or OSiR3, where R
      is as defined above, and<br>
      <br>
      (2) one or more metals preferably in the form of salts (chloride,
      nitrate, sulfate or organic acid salt, for example) or in the form
      of oxides or hydroxides without these forms having any limiting
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      The organo-silicon(s) compound(s) is/are used in a concentration
      varying from 10@-5 to 10@-10 atom-gram of silicon per liter and
      more particularly 10@-2 to 10@-4 atom<br>
      <br>
      The metals usable are titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium,
      germanium, chromium, rhodium, gold, iridium, platinum and/or
      osmium, but use may also be made of uranyl derivatives or the rare
      earths.<br>
      <br>
      The proportions of the addition of (2):(1) are comprised between
      10@-10 and 10@-5 atom-gram of metal per per liter of solution, but
      these proportions may be significantly reduced by using the metal
      elements in the form in which they are employed in homeopathy
      (preferably 5 to 20 granules at the dilution defined for
      homeopathy of 5 CH (CH=Hahnemann centesimal) in a liter of
      organo-silicon solution, nevertheless this dilution may vary very
      widely, from 20 CH to 1 D (D =Hahnemann decimal), and the
      concentration may be even higher as mentioned hereinabove).<br>
      <br>
      The substance in accordance with the invention may also comprise,
      in a proportion appropriate to neutralizing and possibly
      stabilizing these substances, one or more organic acids (or their
      salts, in particular their alkaline salts), such as for example
      salicylic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, aspartic acid,
      glutaric acid, glutamic acid. It should however be noted that
      salicylic acid must be proscribed for the treatment of patients
      allergic to phenols and to salicylic acid in particular and that,
      to the extent that this situation may be encountered, it is then
      entirely possible to substitute for this acid citric acid or its
      salts, as is shown later in the examples.<br>
      <br>
      The organic acid or its salt is in practice employed at
      concentrations varying from 10@-5 to 10@-1 molecule-gram per liter
      or more, and more particularly from 10@-2 to 10@-4 molecule-gram
      per liter.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases, it would seem preferable that the solution have a pH
      between 3 and 7, or better still between 3 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      The organo-silicon compounds corresponding to the above stated
      formula are products known per se.<br>
      <br>
      There may be used for obtaining the substances in accordance with
      the invention either those available commercially or their known
      precursors from which they are obtained by hydrolysis, such as for
      example the corresponding silazanes or alcoxysilanes (in this
      context see in particular document FR-A-2.230.376 the text of
      which is herein incorporated by way of reference).<br>
      <br>
      The metals may be combined with the organo-silicon compounds by
      addition to the solution of the latter either in the solid state
      or in the form of an appropriately titrated aqueous solution,
      either from the outset or at the time of application and in
      particular at the time of the use for therapeutic purposes of the
      substance in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The substance in accordance with the invention may thus consist
      either in a single product containing the organo-silicon compound
      and the metals or in a two-component product containing separately
      the organo-silicon compound and the metals, which may be mixed
      together extemporaneously.<br>
      <br>
      The substance may be made available to users in bottles or in
      ampoules which constitute unit doses containing a measured
      quantity of product for each application.<br>
      <br>
      The unit doses of the complete substance recommanded for each
      transcutaneous application are advantageously 200 cm@3
      approximately.<br>
      <br>
      The substances may further comprise neutralizing and/or
      preservative agents compatible with the active ingredients, such
      as those indicated hereinabove, as other constituents such as
      coloring agents, scents and other excipients, such as the man
      skilled in the art is able to select and incorporate on the basis
      of his own knowledge and according to requirements.<br>
      <br>
      From tests carried out on man, it has been possible to establish
      that applying organo-silicon compounds associated with metals, in
      the form of application of substances in accordance with the
      invention to the skin, as a compress, for example, has a
      transcutaneous action and exerts an action which is
      pharmacologically effective for the treatment of certain troubles
      of cellular mitosis and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
      <br>
      The results of tests show that substances in accordance with the
      inventionare particularly indicated and exceptionally effective,
      without having any significant toxicity, for the treatment or
      prevention of certain troubles of cellular mitosis and the
      treatment of cardiovascular diseases.<br>
      <br>
      By way of indication, the following dosage may be recommanded:<br>
      <br>
      Application of a cotton compress (approximately 5 cm by 7 cm)
      impregnated with the substance in accordance with the invention to
      the painful or deficient area or any other part of the body. The
      compress is covered with a film of plastics material or any other
      material able to retain moisture. The compress is applied for a
      period of between eight and twelve hours per day (overnight, for
      example).<br>
      <br>
      Dabbing the skin with wadding impregnated with the substance in
      accordance with the invention. Dabbing is carried out two to four
      times per day, on the forearm, for example at the place where the
      blood vessels are most apparent. It has been possible to establish
      that the substance in accordance with the invention passes readily
      through the epidermis.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been possible to apply simultaneously the constituents
      of the substance in accordance with the invention by ionokinesis
      practised locally at (or outside) the deficient or painful area.
      The ionokinesis equipement consists of a direct current generator
      (generating approximately 10-15 milliamperes) provided with a
      device for progressively establishing or interrupting the current
      and capable of maintaining a constant current throughout the
      duration of the treatment. The current is progressively increased
      to 10 mA and maintained for twenty minutes before it is
      progressively reduced and then interrupted. In certain cases, the
      current may be increased to 25 mA, the duration of the treatment
      possibly being as much as 30 minutes. The generator is connected
      to two electrodes of carbon or other materials as routinely used
      for ionokinesis treatment. The surface area of the electrode,
      although varying widely, is routinely on the order of 200 cm@2.
      Each of the two electrodes is surrounded with hydrophilic cotton
      impregnated with the substance in accordance with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode connected to the negative terminal of the generator
      is applied to any part of the body, preferably the deficient or
      painful area; it is held in contact with the skin by means of a
      bandage. The other electrode, connected to the positive terminal
      of the generator, may be applied to any location on the skin or
      merely held in the hand, the area of contact being as large as
      possible. In certain special cases the polarity of the electrodes
      is reversed during the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      It should be indicated that a course requires ten to thirty
      treatments at intervals of twenty-four through seventy-two hours,
      the rate most routinely adopted being two to three treatments per
      week. The course is totally without pain. However, certain
      sensitive subjects experience a pricking sensation at the location
      of the electrodes during the treatments. No local or general
      reaction of the organism has been noted, except slight erythema in
      the area to which the electrodes are applied.<br>
      <br>
      However, when the subject is allergic to phenol derivatives, a
      solution not containing this type of derivative must be selected.<br>
      <br>
      Intramuscular injections may also be used.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising
      organo-silicon compounds and sodium or magnesium hyposulfite. The
      composition is effective at treating asthma and manifestations of
      allergy in general, sinusitis, herpes, viral hepatitis, and viral
      diseases in general.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to new compositions for therapeutic use,
      particularly useful for the treatment of asthma and manifestations
      of allergy in general, as well as sinusitis, herpes and viral
      hepatitis, Herpes Zoster and viral diseases in general in man.<br>
      <br>
      Organo-silicon compounds have already been used in human therapy
      for numerous years.<br>
      <br>
      These water-soluble, atoxic compounds easily pass through the
      epidermis and dermis by local application (GUEYNE, DUFFAUT and
      QUILICHINI, Therapie, 1962, 17, 417).<br>
      <br>
      Numerous therapeutic properties of organo-silicon compounds used
      alone have been described in several patents (in particular French
      patents published under No. 2,158,068, 2,160,293 and 2,230,376,
      which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us5o.jpg" height="135"
          width="363"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      French patent No. 2,230,376 describes organo-silicon compounds
      according to the formula: ##STR1## wherein R is an aliphatic,
      aromatic, cyclic or heterocyclic group; and<br>
      <br>
      n is a whole number between 0 and 20. French patent No. 2,158,068
      describes organo-silicon compounds according to the formula:<br>
      <br>
      Rx --Si--(OM)4-x<br>
      <br>
      wherein<br>
      <br>
      R is alkyl, acyl or aryl;<br>
      <br>
      x is a whole number between 0 and 3; and<br>
      <br>
      M is a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal.<br>
      <br>
      These organo-silicon compounds are administered, according to the
      above patents, by the intramuscular or intravenous route, or else
      by electrophoresis, the active principle then being in solution in
      water (isotonic solution), possibly with addition of an alcohol or
      a polyalcohol, such as glycerol, and/or a sodium salt of a
      pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid.<br>
      <br>
      It has already been demonstrated in particular in the above
      patents that certain substances of various natures potentialise
      and broaden the action spectrum of organo-silicon compounds.<br>
      <br>
      It has now been unexpectedly found that a new composition for
      therapeutic use can be made by combining in the appropriate
      proportions one or several organo-silicon compounds with sodium or
      magnesium hyposulfite (or thiosulfate).<br>
      <br>
      It has also been found that compositions of this type are quite
      particularly useful against asthma and manifestations of allergy
      in general, sinusitis, herpes and viral hepatitis, Herpes Zoster
      and viral diseases in general, against which they have a specific
      action, and that the compositions thus made can be administered
      simply by the transcuataneous route in man and animals.<br>
      <br>
      The first object of the invention is a composition for therapeutic
      use particularly useful for the treatment of asthma, sinusitis,
      herpes and viral hepatitis among others, wherein it includes in
      aqueous solution:<br>
      <br>
      (1) at least one organo-silicon compound represented by either of
      the two formulas: ##STR2## where:<br>
      <br>
      n is a whole number between 1 and 1000 and, preferably, between 1
      and 50;<br>
      <br>
      p, q, r are whole numbers between 0 and 1000 and, preferably,
      between 0 and 60;<br>
      <br>
      R and R' representing, independently of one another, a saturated
      or unsaturated linear, branched or cyclic group and possibly
      including heteroatoms, or an aromatic, hetereroaromatic,
      arylaliphatic, or heteroarylaliphatic group, possibly substituted
      by functional groups, it being possible also for R to be OH, OR or
      OSiR3.<br>
      <br>
      .SIGMA. being R or H or SiR3 ;<br>
      <br>
      .SIGMA.' being chosen from R and more particularly CH3 or OR, or
      OH or OSIR3, (where R is such as is described above), or alkali
      metal or addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid,
      of said compound, the organo-silicon compound(s) being used at a
      concentration varying between 10@-5 and 10@-1 atom-gram of silicon
      per liter and more particularly between 10@-4 and 10@-2
      atom-gram/liter of water, and<br>
      <br>
      (2) sodium hyposulfite (Na2 S2 O3, 5 H2 O) or magnesium
      hyposulfite, the ratio of (1) to (2) being 5 to 50 g of
      hyposulfite per liter of organo-silicon solution, perferably about
      20 g/liter of organo-silicon solution.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the compounds disclosed in French patent Nos.
      2,230,376 and 2,158,068 fall within the scope of the
      above-described formulae for the organo-silicon compound.<br>
      <br>
      As a variant, the composition according to the invention can also
      include in an appropriate proportion to neutralize or possibly
      stabilize these compounds one or several organic acids (or their
      salts, in particular their alkali salts), such as for example
      salicylic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, aspartic acid,
      glutaric acid and/or glutamic acid. However, it should be noted
      that salicylic acid must not be used for the treatment of patients
      allergic to phenols and salicylic acid in particular and that, in
      such an eventuality, this acid may quite well be replaced by
      citric acid or its salts, as is shown later in the examples.<br>
      <br>
      An organic acid or its salt is used in concentrations varying
      between 10@-5 and 10@-1 molecule-gram or more per liter,
      particularly between 10@-2 and 10@-4 molecule-gram per liter.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases, it has found to be preferable for the pH of the
      solution to be between 3 and 7, or, better, between 3 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      The organo-silicon compounds represented by the above formula are
      products known in themselves.<br>
      <br>
      To make compositions according to the invention use can be made
      either of those available in commerce, or their known precursors,
      which yield them by hydrolysis, such as for example silazanes or
      corresponding alkoxysilanes (see in particular document
      FR-A-2,230,376 on this subject).<br>
      <br>
      Sodium or magnesium hyposulfite may be combined with
      organo-silicon compounds by addition to a suitably proportioned
      solution of these, either in its solid state or in the form of a
      suitably proportioned aqueous solution, either originally or
      during application and in particular during the utilization of the
      compositions according to the invention for therapeutic purposes.<br>
      <br>
      The composition according to the invention may therefore consist
      either of a unique product containing the organo-silicon compound
      and the hyposulfite, or a two-component product containing
      separately the organo-silicon compound and the hyposulfite, whose
      mixture can then be freshly prepared just before use.<br>
      <br>
      The composition can be made available to users in bottles or
      ampoules which constitute unit doses containing a quantity of
      product dosed for each administration.<br>
      <br>
      The unit doses of the complete composition recommended for each
      transcutaneous administration are advantageously 10 cm@3.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions can be supplemented by neutralizing agents and/or
      preservatives compatible with the active principles, such as those
      indicated above, as well as by other constituents, such as dyes,
      perfumes or other excipients, which the man skilled in the art is
      able to chose and incorporate as needed according to his knowledge
      of the subject matter.<br>
      <br>
      From trials carried out in man, it has been established that the
      application of organo-silicon compounds combined with sodium or
      magnesium hyposulfite to the skin, for example, by dabbing
      compositions according to the invention, has a transcutaneous
      action exerting a pharmacologically effective action against
      attacks of asthma and manifestations of allergy in general,
      sinusitis, herpes, viral hepatitis, Herpes Zoster and viral
      diseases in general.<br>
      <br>
      Trial results have shown that compositions according to the
      invention are particularly indicated and exceptionally effective
      without having any appreciable toxicity (as will be shown later),
      for the treatment and/or the prevention of asthma, headaches and
      manifestations of allergy in general, sinusitis, herpes, viral
      hepatitis, Herpes Zoster and viral diseases in general.<br>
      <br>
      As an indication, the utilisation modes that can be recommended
      are:<br>
      <br>
      Application of a cotton compress (about 5 cm by 7 cm) soaked with
      the composition according to the invention to the painful or
      deficient area or any other part of the body. The compress is
      covered with a sheet of plastic material or any other material
      that can preserve the moisture by preventing evaporation. The
      compress is applied for a period of between 8 and 12 hours per day
      (or overnight, for example).<br>
      <br>
      Massage with a composition according to the invention applied in
      the form of a cream according to a known technique.<br>
      <br>
      Dabbing the cutaneous area with a pad soaked with the composition
      according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      This dabbing is carried out 2 to 4 times a day, for example, on
      the forearm, where the blood vessels are more apparent. For it has
      been demonstrated that the composition according to the invention
      easily passes through the epidermis.<br>
      <br>
      The composition can also be applied simultaneously, locally or
      not, by ionokinesis, to the painful or deficient area.<br>
      <br>
      The ionokinesis apparatus consists of a direct current generator
      (about 10-15 milliamperes), provided with a device for
      establishing or shutting off the current gradually and maintaining
      a constant amperage for the duration of a session.<br>
      <br>
      The amperage is gradually brought to 10 mA and maintained for 20
      minutes before being gradually lowered and then turned off.<br>
      <br>
      In certain cases the amperage can be raised up to 25 mA, it then
      being possible for the duration of the session to be up to 30
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The generator is connected to two carbon electrodes or other
      commonly employed materials for electrodes used in ionokinesis
      treatments. Although the surface area of the electrode may be very
      variable, it is commonly of the order of 200 cm@2.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the electrodes is surrounded by cotton-wool which is
      impregnated with the composition according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The electrode connected to the negative pole of the generator is
      applied to any part of the body, but preferably to the deficient
      or painful area. It is maintained in contact with the bandage.<br>
      <br>
      The other electrode, connected to the positive pole of the
      generator, can be applied to any place on the skin or simply held
      in the hand, the contact surface area being as large as possible.
      In certain particular cases, the polarity of the electrodes is
      reversed during a session.<br>
      <br>
      It should be pointed out that a treatment requires 10 to 30
      sessions at 24 to 72 hour intervals, the most common rate being 2
      to 3 sessions per week.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment is absolutely painless. However, some susceptible
      subjects experience a prickling sensation near the electrodes
      during sessions. No local or general reaction of the organism has
      been noted except slight erythema in the electrode application
      area.<br>
      <br>
      However, when a subject is slightly allergic to phenolic
      derivatives, a solution not containing this type of derivative
      must be chosen.<br>
      <br>
      Intramuscular injection may also be given.<br>
      <br>
      To assess the acute toxicity of a potassium
      methylsiliconate+sodium hyposulfite composition, the following
      experimentation described hereinafter was carried out. The
      composition administered was in the form of 1.5% (weight/volume)
      aqueous solution. The experimentation consisted in determining the
      LD50 for female mice by sub-cutaneous administration. It was
      conducted under the conditions described below:<br>
      <br>
      <b>I-Animals</b><br>
      <br>
      150 Swiss race female mice of 30 g average weight were taken from
      a batch of animals that had been received fifteen days ago, and
      therefore well-accustomed to the animal house.<br>
      <br>
      There were divided into 6 batches of 25 animals and numbered from
      1 to 25 within each batch, the batches themselves being identified
      by the letters A to F.<br>
      <br>
      The animal house conditions were as follows:<br>
      feed and beverage: ad libitum<br>
      type of feed: commercial complete feed (Extra Labo)<br>
      average temperature: 21 DEG C.<br>
      relative humidity: 73%<br>
      experiment start time: 9 hours<br>
      <br>
      <b>II-Doses administered</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was established from a preliminary experiment performed on some
      25 animals that doses of between 30 and 40 ml/kg showed a greater
      or lesser mortality resulting in the following doses being
      selected:<br>
      25 ml/kg, or 375 mg/kg of potassium methylsiliconate+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group A;<br>
      30 ml/kg, or 450 mg/kg of potassium methylsiliconate+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group B;<br>
      35 ml/kg, or 525 m/kg of potassium methylsiliconate+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group C.<br>
      40 ml/kg, or 600 mg/kg of potassium methylsiliconte+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group D;<br>
      45 ml/kg, or 675 mg/kg of potassium methylsiliconate+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group E;<br>
      50 ml/kg, or 750 mg/kg of potassium methylsiliconate+sodium
      hyposulfite for Group F.<br>
      <br>
      Subcutaneous injection was chosen as the mode of administration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>III-Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      BATCH A: No mortality, nor any external sign of toxicity appeared,
      neither immediately after administration, nor subsequently, that
      is, during the fifteen days for which the animals were kept under
      surveillance. The behaviour and general condition of these were
      quite normal.<br>
      <br>
      BATCH B: Just as for Batch A, no mortality, nor any behavioural
      trouble were observed. Their general condition was excellent
      during the period following administration of the potassium
      methylsiliconate+sodium hyposulfite composition.<br>
      <br>
      BATCH C: 6 animals of this group had died under comparable
      circumstances and in times ranging from 45 minutes to 90 minutes
      after administration. The clinical ante-mortem signs were
      prostration, need for isolation, dulling of the fur and onsets of
      shivering (more or less violent, but without convulsions) starting
      15 to 20 minutes before death, which was preceded by a few
      accentuated bounds.<br>
      <br>
      Post-mortem examination showed that all the internal organs had a
      normal appearance: in particular, the liver, spleen, pancreas,
      kidneys and adrenal capsules did not reveal any visible anomalies.
      However, it was noted that the bladder was regularly empty and
      that the heart had stopped in the systole position. The lungs were
      slightly pinkish. There was no particular sign at the injection
      point.<br>
      <br>
      The majority of the surviving animals did not appear to have been
      affected by the product. Three showed slight signs of discomfort,
      which soon died away. However, the fur of all the animals of this
      group was dull for 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the behaviour and general conditions of the surviving
      animals reverted to normal for fifteen days after administration.<br>
      <br>
      BATCH D: 11 animals of this group died under conditions and in
      times identical with those of Group C. The ante-mortem clinical
      signs and post-mortem anatomical examinations were quite
      comparable to these. Four animals showed transient signs of
      discomfort. The fur of all the surviving animals had a dull
      appearance for 24 hours; thereafter, their behaviour and general
      condition were completely normal during the observation period.<br>
      <br>
      BATCH E: 14 animals of this group died under conditions and in
      times identical with those of the preceding groups, with quite
      comparable clinical and anatomical pictures.<br>
      <br>
      Two animals showed momentary discomfort. All the survivors had a
      dull fur for 24 hours. Thereafter, as for the survivors of Batches
      C and D, complete normalization of behaviour and general
      conditions were noted throughout the observation period.<br>
      <br>
      BATCH F: In this group 17 animals died under circumstances and in
      times comparable to those of Groups C, D and E.<br>
      <br>
      The ante-mortem behaviour noted and the post-mortem examinations
      showed that the observations were an exact copy of those of the
      preceding groups. Four animals showed momentary discomfort.<br>
      <br>
      All the survivors had a dull fur for 24 hours. They then reverted
      to completely normal behaviour and general condition during the
      observation period.<br>
      <br>
      Following the observation period of fifteen days, all the animals
      surviving these trials were alive and in good health after a
      period of one month.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV-Discussion and interpretation of results.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From this experimentation, it was possible to calculate the
      percentage mortality in accordance with the dose administered:<br>
      Batch A mortality: 0%<br>
      Batch B mortality: 0%<br>
      Batch C mortality: 24%<br>
      Batch D mortality: 42%<br>
      Batch E mortality: 56%<br>
      Batch F mortality: 67%<br>
      <br>
      The subcutaneous LD50 for the mouse was therefore well between two
      points below and two points above its value. The probit/log chart
      (percentage mortality against logarithm of dose in mg/kg) plotted
      from these results enabled the LD50 to be established at 645 mg/kg
      for the composition of the invention tested.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, it has been possible to determine a limit at which
      the first reversible signs of toxicity appear, such as somnolence
      and need for isolation. This limit was evaluated at 380 mg/kg.<br>
      <br>
      <b>V-Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The compositions according to the invention are seen to be little
      toxic, since the doses which are recommended to be used for
      therapeutic purposes are hundred times lower than the dose which
      causes the first signs of toxicicity to appear.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is described and illustrated in detail in the
      examples hereinafter, which in no way limit it and which include
      all the information concerning the compositions and their
      preparation and the properties revealed by pharmacological trials
      relating to various diseases in man.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      J. R., suffering from herpetic keratitis with ulceration of the
      cornea, intense lacrymation and major vasodilation of the
      conjuctiva, was treated with cortisone eye wash, without any
      result.<br>
      <br>
      For three days, two daily eye baths were given with a solution
      according to the invention consisting of the following:<br>
      <br>
      1 g of salicylic acid was introduced into a 1-liter beaker and 700
      ml of distilled water added to it.<br>
      <br>
      Onto this solution was poured slowly, while stirring vigorously,
      1.2 ml of 45% dry extract solution of potassium methylsiliconate.<br>
      <br>
      The solution was brought to a pH of 4.7 and made up to 1 liter
      with distilled water. 20 g of sodium sodium hyposulfite were then
      added.<br>
      <br>
      Following the application of this treatment, with a solution made
      isotonic and buffered, the inflammation disappeared in 24 hours
      and cicatrization was found to be complete after 7 days.<br>
      <br>
      Examined again after three months, the patient did not show any
      after-effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mrs. L. Z. very frequently (about twice a month) suffered from a
      hepatic eruption on the upper lip.<br>
      <br>
      A series of local applications were made with a cotton-wool pad
      soaked with the solution of the composition according to the
      invention, made as follows:<br>
      <br>
      1 g of citric acid was introduced into a 1-liter beaker and 700 ml
      of distilled water added to it. Onto this solution was poured
      slowly, while stirring vigorously, 1.7 ml of a solution of 45% dry
      extract potassium siliconate. The solution was brought to a pH of
      4.7 and made up to 1 liter with distilled water. 20 g of sodium
      hyposulfite were finally added to the whole.<br>
      <br>
      At a rate of three applications of a cotton-wool pad soaked with
      the above composition, cicatrization was found to have taken place
      without any visible trace remaining after 7 days, and no
      recurrence was noted after a waiting time of three months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. M. L. had contracted recurrent genital herpes which affected
      the glans and prepuce.<br>
      <br>
      A series of local applications to the lesion were made using a
      solution of the composition according to the invention, made as
      follows: 1 g of citric acid was introduced into a 1-liter beaker
      and 800 ml of distilled water added to it. Onto this solution were
      poured gradually, stirring vigorously, 2.5 ml 30% dry extract
      sodium methylsiliconate. The solution was brought to a pH of 4.7
      and made up to 1 liter with distilled water and 20 g of sodium
      hyposulfite added.<br>
      <br>
      Three local applications were made daily by dabbing with a
      cotton-wool pad soaked with the solution described above.<br>
      <br>
      After a week of this treatment, it was found that the eruption had
      disappeared, without leaving any visible trace. After three
      months, there were no signs of recurrence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Miss L. B., with recurrent herpes of the vulva suffered every
      month a painful eruption with major oedema affecting the labia
      minor and the labia major one week before menstruation.<br>
      <br>
      A series of local applications to the lesion were made using the
      composition according to the invention, made as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Into a 1-liter beaker containing 500 ml of water, previously
      cooled with crushed ice, were introduced slowly, while stirring
      vigorously, 0.65 g of dimethylchlorosilane and 0.85 g of sodium
      bicarbonate. A check was made that the pH was about 7. The
      solution thereby obtained was homogeneous.<br>
      <br>
      1.1 g of sodium salicylate was added slowly, while stirring
      vigorously. The solution was brought to a pH of 4.7 and made up to
      1 liter with distilled water, and finally 20 g of sodium
      hyposulfite were added.<br>
      <br>
      Two local applications were made daily during the eruptive phase
      by dabbing with a pad of cotton-wool soaked with the solution
      described above. The patient experienced very rapid relief, and
      the oedema disappeared in a few days.<br>
      <br>
      In the following three months there was no irruption during the
      pre-menstrual period.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. R. B. was suffering from a sudden onset of jaundice.
      Laboratory analyses confirmed the diagnosis of viral hepatitis.
      The transminases level was high: 1100.<br>
      <br>
      A cotton-wool compress soaked with composition according to the
      invention, covered with a plastic sheet, described above in
      Example 3 was applied in the region of the liver. This compress
      was maintained in position for ten hours per day.<br>
      <br>
      After six days, the jaundice had definitely regressed, and the
      transminases level dropped to 50.<br>
      <br>
      After two months, the patient no longer showed any clinical or
      biological sign of hepatitis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mr. E. F. suffered from attacks of nocturnal dispnea with
      suffocation.<br>
      <br>
      Seven applications were made by dabbing his forearm in the evening
      before he went to bed with a cotton-wool pad soaked with the
      composition according to the invention, described in Example 1.
      These applications were combined with nasal instillations with the
      same solution.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that attacks decreased in intensity after 4 days and
      gradually ceased altogether.<br>
      <br>
      A maintenance treatment of one application per week was continued
      for two months. In addition, the patient was advised during this
      period to resume dabbing (combined with nasal instillation) if
      there was the least breathing discomfort, as a preventive measure.<br>
      <br>
      After three months, the patient no longer suffered from any
      attacks and the disease had not shown any signs of reccurrence for
      eight months.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mrs. B. P. had undergone a series of examinations which had
      revealed viral hepatitis. Among these, chemical analyses of the
      blood in particular gave the following results:<br>
      <br>
      Transminases:<br>
      S.G.O.T: 1290 IU/l<br>
      S.G.P.T.: 2170 IU/l<br>
      <br>
      The patient then underwent treatment with the composition
      according to the invention such as is described above in Example
      1, consisting of massage of the region of the liver, 4 times a
      day, with a cream made with this composition.<br>
      <br>
      Five days later the results of the blood analyses were the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      Transminases:<br>
      S.G.O.T.: 50 IU/l<br>
      S.G.P.T.: 210 IU/l<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Mrs. Y. L. had suffered from sinusitis for several years. Although
      during this period she had had several operations (removal of
      tonsils, ablations of adenoids) and various treatments and
      examinations without any durable results.<br>
      <br>
      After a further major attack against which conventional treatments
      had not given any appreciable result, the patient was given
      treatment by a first application of the composition according to
      the invention as described in Example 2 above, by rubbing the top
      of the nose with a cream made with this composition. This
      application was repeated 4 times a day. One hour after the first
      application nasal discharges obliged the patient to blow her nose
      continuously up to evening. As early as the following day the
      patient felt "freed" and breathed normally. No further attack of
      sinusitis has been recorded since then.<br>
