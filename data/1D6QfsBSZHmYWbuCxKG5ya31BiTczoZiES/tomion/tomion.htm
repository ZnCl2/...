        joins us to talk about his patented StarDrive Device, a modified

      <p>The primary advantage of Tomion's research is having converted
        the otherwise esoteric "Searl Effect Generator" into a
        rigorously-researched set of Electrical-Engineering equations,
        that he claims can reproduce the effects of the SEG within the

      </center>
      <p>"The preceding material will hopefully prepare us for a look at
        some very basic trans-light mechanics, for I will acknowledge
        myself to be conversant with respect to such an abstract and
        complex concept only in general terms! It should be possible,
        however, for us to examine certain fundamental principles which
        may be involved in the workings of a hyperspace "warp-jump" with
        an application of straightforward logic and a couple of basic
        relativistic formulas that are actually easy to work with. </p>
      <p>"The analytical procedure we'll use in this discussion derives
        from the method of breaking the time-light barrier that was
        proposed at the end of the last Chapter: whereby a StarDrive
        [EDF] Generator will be driven to a speed sufficient to cause
        its relativistic mass to very closely approach a level which
        would ordinarily correspond to the Chandrasekhar limit [about
        1.4 solar masses] in reliance upon its Field electron degeneracy
        pressure to prevent the formation of a neutron object or a black
        hole. In doing so, it is hoped that an open-ended wormhole will
        arise which is navigable by means of the Lorentz transformation,
        in accordance with the work of Olexa-Myron Bilaniuk. </p>
      <p>"In order to work with the largest values for starship mass and
        Field electron velocity (as a function of Field voltage), data
        will be supplied for a vessel 100 feet in diameter – which as
        I've said is the largest model advisable using this technology.
        What we will do first is calculate such a vessel's total
        relativistic mass at a velocity which corresponds to its Field
        electron collision speed: the reason being that it will be
        interesting to see what happens when the starship reaches a
        velocity which a reactionary ion-thrusted rocket, having the
        same exhaust speed, couldn't possible exceed. </p>
      <p>"The next step will be to compute the starship's expected
        foreshortening in the direction of travel, according to the
        Lorentz contraction* which is an inevitable consequence of
        relativity. This 'shrinking' of the vessel's length along its
        axis of velocity may be figured according to the most
        fundamental factor or expression in relativity theory, which is
        sometimes called the FitzGerald ratio. This factor, usually
        designated t (tau), is equal to (1 – v2/c2)1/2 and is used in
        any calculation of relativistic mass or time dilation. </p>
      <p>It must be noted here that while the Lorentz contraction does
        not involve any actual subjective physical deformation of an
        object with relativistic velocity, it is nevertheless a very
        real effect and does indeed involve the non-uniform relative
        deformation of the space-time in which such an object is moving.
      </p>
      <p>"Since the computations we will be making here are only
        intended to constitute the roughest of approximations, being
        largely illustrative and instructional in nature, a related
        parameter called the Schwarzschild radius will then be
        calculated. This radius defines the physical size at which a
        'cold' spherical object cannot avoid becoming a black hole.
        Again, this expression is actually very simple: Rs = 2GM/c2,
        where c is the speed of light, M is the total mass, and G is the
        universal gravitational constant (at 6.6726 x 10–11 nt-m2/kg2).
      </p>
      <p>"Our goal in this endeavor is then simply to observe how
        closely the ship's foreshortened half-length approaches its
        Schwarzschild radius! We will let Lo equal the starship's rest
        length, while bearing in mind that it will drive upper-face-on
        during space flight, and this "length" (or hull height) is equal
        to 2(hz + hf); then, Lr will be the resultant contracted length.
        If we assume that one half of Lr will need to approach Rs as
        closely as possible in order for a stable wormhole to be
        induced, we can state our tentative trans-light or "warp drive"
        parameter thusly: Lr/2 &gt; Rs . </p>
      <p>The max. net cabin volume available aboard any size StarDrive
        vessel is outlined in yellow ? above. </p>
      <p>Serious "starship design" enthusiasts should take a look at our
        Manned Vessel Design DataSheet <br>
        [weight, displacement, Field voltage, &amp; peak rotor current
        for vessels of 40, 60, 80 and 100 feet in dia.; ( <a
          href="http://www.stardrivedevice.com/vessel_design_data.pdf"

        ; 2 pgs., 283kB)] </p>
      <p>"Using the pdf Hull Configuration Spreadsheet [ <a
          href="http://www.stardrivedevice.com/hull_config.pdf" http:=""
          www.youtube.com="" watch?v="q-XO03Jg79U&lt;b">http://www.stardrivedevice.com/hull_config.pdf</a>
        ], the hull volume or displacement of the 100ft.-dia. "Toltec"
        is 39,168 ft3 and, at a weight/volume ratio of 79.2 lbs/ft3, the
        starship's rest mass (Mo) is 1.4071 x 106 kg. And, it turns out
        that the value for Lo is equal to 4.205 m. The equations in
        steps [1] ~ [4] on pg. 119 (in the 'FIELD POWER OUTPUT'
        worksheet) may then be used to calculate the peak Field electron
        velocity and a corresponding value for t, but we must first know
        the value for peak Field voltage. Using the [standard
        specification] method developed in WorkSheet I(a), this Field
        voltage value is 4.9383 x 109, or nearly 5 billion volts! </p>
      <p>"Accordingly, the peak Field electron velocity is between "8-
        and 9-9's light": in other words, 0.999 999 995 c. [It should be
        noted that in performing relativistic calculations, you
        basically can't use too many decimal places!] The contingent
        value for t is then equal to 1.0000 x 10–4. The ship's total
        relativistic mass is equal to Mr = Mo/t, at 1.4071 x 1010 kg;
        and, Lr = Lo(t) = 4.205 x 10–4 m. Computing the rough value for
        the 100ft. starship's [theoretical] Schwarzschild radius, we
        find that the vessel's Rs = 2.0893 x 10–17 m; and, Lr/2 is equal
        to 2.1025 x 10–4 m. So, we can see that the foreshortened
        half-length is indeed greater than the absolute minimum safe
        value, but by many orders of magnitude instead of only
        marginally: in fact, about ten trillion times greater! </p>
      <p>"However, if we calculate the critical density of an object of
        Chandrasekhar limit mass and Schwarzschild radius, this density
        is equal to 9.4 x 1018 kg/m3. Then, if we compute a relativistic
        density for the 100-foot starship, neglecting its non-sphericity
        and assuming that its hull volume is reduced by the given
        Lorentz factor t, we find this relativistic density equal to
        3.9845 x 1012 kg/m3. Now, that limit critical density exceeds
        the starship's said theoretical relativistic density by "only"
        2.36 x 106 or 2.36 million times. To actually achieve a
        Schwarzschild critical density, by which time we know a warp
        field must be induced, we can merely allow our starship to apply
        positive reactionless acceleration a bit longer to raise its
        velocity just slightly above Field impulse velocity and lower
        its factor t by (2.36 x 106)1/2 or 1,536 times: this will
        yield&nbsp; t&nbsp; =&nbsp; 6.51 x 10–8,&nbsp; and a starship Mr
        = 15,360,983 Mo. </p>
      <p>"So, it would seem that the latter 'trans-light parameter' will
        tend to indirectly verify a StarDrive vessel's ability to induce
        a metric warp field, although the first such exercise did not.
        And, I can't presently say just how close such a ship must come
        to equality with either parameter that we developed above (the
        latter being preferred). It also seems reasonable to postulate,
        however, that a narrow velocity range will exist within which
        the desired wormhole effect is stable: on the lower end of such
        a "safety zone", the vessel risks "dropping out of warp" (with a
        bothersome loss of time and energy), and on the high end its
        mass [Mr] risks a rapid ascent to certain&nbsp; disaster! This
        latter effect I feel would be a consequence of the starship's
        magnetic field, which so far we have not even considered. And,
        at the levels of charge and velocity we're considering, the
        strength of the magnetic field "corridor" associated with such a
        vessel will be truly tremendous! Remember what we learned about
        'magnetic energy density' in relation to the Tokamak
        equation?!... </p>
      <p>"By far the most important consideration to bear in mind,
        however, is that a StarDrive vessel represents an asymptotic
        reactionless drive, and therefore the ship's ultimate velocity
        is not limited to the velocity of the electrons comprising its
        isometric Drive Field. Unlike most forms of rocket, it is free
        to accelerate beyond its "exhaust" velocity – and to achieve an
        ultimate velocity in space-time which is only infinitesimally
        less than that of light. Therefore, an unmanned probe Drive Unit
        could be turned loose to accelerate until its relativistic mass
        becomes almost astronomical, and it either finds a stable warp
        corridor within such a safety zone or is destroyed in the
        process". </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>This device is a brushless high-voltage
        electrical generator, requiring suitable means of input rotary
        torque, for purposes of producing a very-high-energy external
        electrodynamic field or continuous quasi-coherent DC corona or
        arc discharge of uniform current density which completely
        encloses the machine's conductive housing. This housing is
        divided into distinct electrical sections and contains a flat
        conductive rotor which electrically links separate negative and
        positive housing sections and upon which a plurality of toroidal
        generating coils are rotatably mounted. Circular arrays of
        stationary permanent magnets are affixed within the housing
        which induce a constant DC voltage within said coils upon their
        rotation. The primary voltage so-generated is electrostatically
        impressed across the rotor such that great quantities of
        electronic charge may be transported between the opposite
        polarity sections of the housing, in such a manner that a much
        higher secondary voltage is caused to appear across interposed
        neutral sections thereof, and the resulting external breakdown
        current once initiated is independent of the generating coils'
        ampacity. Ancillary mechanical, electrical, an/or electronic
        features may be attached upon or within the housing to aid in
        harnessing and controlling the useful effects associated with
        the external dynamic electric field produced by the device. <br>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is related in general to rotary direct
        current (DC) electrical generators which incorporate permanent
        magnet fields, and in particular to similar electromechanical
        generating devices whose principal purpose is to produce a
        useful continuous high-voltage DC corona discharge. This
        invention also pertains to the field of aerospace vehicles which
        are capable of propulsion through the utilization of an
        ultra-high-voltage corona or arc discharge of a special type and
        form. </p>
      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</b> </p>
      <p>In order to provide background information so that the present
        invention may be completely understood and appreciated in its
        proper context, reference is made hereinbelow to a number of
        related art patents. These cited references contain certain
        similarities to the present invention, primarily related to the
        objective of producing electrically-developed thrust. However,
        key differences and limitations with regard to achieving this
        objective are in evidence. </p>
      <p>The related art disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,949,550 proposes
        three attendant objects which are quite similar to certain of
        the objects of the present invention: (i) to provide an
        apparatus for the direct conversion of electrical potential to
        usable kinetic energy; (ii) to provide such an apparatus having
        a hollow body or housing which contains a source of high
        electrical potential; and (iii) to provide a self-propelling
        vehicular apparatus which includes a pair of electrically
        conductive body portions joined by an insulative portion,
        whereby said conductive portions constitute electrodes. A
        further similarity is that the vehicular embodiment proposed
        preferably be of a circular disc shape somewhat thicker in its
        center than at its edges. The device set forth in this Patent
        just cited is noticeably different from the present invention,
        however, in that a positive voltage is applied to the housing
        periphery and a negative voltage is applied at the central axis.
        The proposed arrangement is furthermore limited to operation
        within a gaseous dielectric medium, upon which it is reliant for
        the production of the claimed motive force, and is to be
        operated at a potential gradient less than that which would
        produce a visible corona. This device moreover makes no
        provisions for the production and/or extraction of vast
        quantities of useful thermal kinetic energy, as the present
        invention does. </p>
      <p>The related art disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,071,705 is based
        on three empirical principles of electrostatics which also
        figure prominently in explaining the actual shape of the
        discharge current field that will be produced by the present
        invention: (i) electrostatic lines of force tend to concentrate
        on the surface of a charged conductor in those places with the
        smallest radius of curvature; (ii) they are normal to the
        surface from which they emanate; and (iii) they do not cross but
        will bend under the influence of another charged body. The
        device set forth in this Patent just cited is in fact quite
        similar to that of the Patent cited immediately before, in that
        relatively massive positive atmospheric ions and entrained
        neutral air molecules are repelled from the positive electrode
        toward the negative electrode along a linear axis--thereby
        inducing an air flow or "electric wind" which represents the
        fundamental source of thrust. It is therefore once again limited
        to operation in a gaseous dielectric medium, and does not make
        use of a flow of negative and greatly less massive electron
        current in the course of thrust production--which may achieve
        comparatively enormous acceleration and even relativistic
        velocity and specific impulse at a similar given level of
        applied potential gradient--as the present invention does. </p>
      <p>The related art disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,177,654 actually
        addresses the issue of producing electrically-developed thrust
        which is not limited to atmospheric operation, and the stated
        primary object thereof is to provide a propulsion system for
        enabling controlled flight in the atmosphere which may continue
        extensively into space without changing the system's basic
        operation. One embodiment thereof also proposes a circular
        disc-shaped vessel wherein high-voltage electrode elements
        ionize atmospheric gases by corona discharge, and a pulsed
        electromagnet arrangement causes the ejection of the resultant
        plasma from the propulsion chamber--producing thrust by
        reaction. This device furthermore addresses the issue of
        producing local thrust differential(s) on the body or housing
        thereof, for purposes of flight maneuvering and/or directional
        control, by providing for a plurality of such pulsed discharge
        propulsion units arranged in concentric rings (within the
        discoid body) and having individual divergent nozzles. As such,
        however, the device set forth in this Patent just cited actually
        constitutes an ionized jet propulsion method, requiring the use
        of either a gaseous medium like air or the onboard storage and
        release of relatively massive ionizable reaction material for
        any operational capability in space. Moreover, the pulsed mode
        of operation used, which limits the ionizing potential gradient
        to a value of less than breakdown field intensity, significantly
        restricts the level of power produced as thrust as compared to
        the continuous DC discharge field current produced by the
        present invention--at voltages which may be greatly in excess of
        breakdown intensity. Finally, this said device relies upon an
        unspecified source of generated electrical power in operation
        which must be assumed would have to be nuclear if conventional
        in nature, for said device to avoid otherwise having to carry a
        massive and range-limiting onboard store of fuel, and not upon
        convenient and protracted-use permanent magnets of high energy
        density as the prime energy source (as the present invention
        does). </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No. 3,464,207 discloses a quasi-corona aerodynamic
        vehicle which bears only a limited relationship to the present
        invention, but which is referenced nonetheless as being further
        indicative of the predominant trend in conceptualization in
        relation to devices intended for producing
        electrically-developed thrust. This device also relies upon
        pulsed corona discharge operation between spaced electrodes at
        less than breakdown field intensity, thereby greatly
        constraining the propulsive power obtained. It is furthermore
        effective only in a gaseous dielectric medium and is based upon
        an electric wind pressure gradient arising of an admitted
        incompletely-understood mechanism. This same device evidences a
        great deal of theoretical complexity and construction material
        specificity, which might seem to indicate a narrow range of
        feasibility. Such attributes are not uncommon in the field of
        electrical aerospace propulsion, and are, to a degree, shared
        even by the present invention. Nevertheless, it is interesting
        to note that sizeable thrust in the form of an aerodynamic
        pressure gradient or lift of up to 30 lbs./ft.sup.2 of external
        electrode area or more is asserted to be obtainable from said
        same device by utilizing asymmetrical electrodes or electrode
        arrays, rather than using electrodes or electrode arrays of
        approximately equal area (as the present invention does)--which
        therefore present a uniform cross section of discharge current
        conduction. </p>
      <p>PCT Application WO 85/03053 discloses a flying apparatus whose
        primary similarity to the present invention is that it
        incorporates a hollow annular flywheel which provides gyroscopic
        stability and encircles a relatively stationary central cabin
        and/or payload area. The device set forth therein also provides
        free-rolling means to center and stabilize the flywheel or rotor
        within a discoid housing, and addresses the issue that
        horizontal flight maneuvering and/or directional control may be
        accomplished by altering the local angular acceleration of the
        rotor--as does the present invention. This said other device,
        however, relies upon the questionable concept that the very
        large angular momentum of the rotating flywheel is somehow able
        to compensate the potential energy caused by gravitation and
        that the overall weight of the apparatus may thereby be
        annulled. Vertical lift must then be provided for said device in
        operation by atmospheric thermal updraft means, and no
        electrical discharge means are utilized to produce a force of
        lift or thrust. </p>
      <p>The device set forth in UK Patent GB 2 312 709 A is a flying
        craft which is essentially disc- or saucer-shaped and which has
        a central axial post electrode and a spaced enclosing ring
        electrode whereby an electrical arc may be struck between the
        two, to either ignite fuel introduced via nozzles or greatly
        heat an exhausted air flow produced by fan means. Thus, this
        device actually provides hybrid jet or turbo-fan means for
        producing propulsive thrust, and utilizes direct electrical
        discharge not as the primary source of thrust but to enhance
        thrust produced by other means. To this end, said device must
        therefore operate solely in a gaseous atmosphere and/or carry
        onboard a range-limiting store of combustible fuel. This same
        device does, however, utilize powerful magnetic fields to impart
        a rotational and de-randomizing aspect to the arc discharge,
        thereby promoting a more uniform distribution of the arc
        discharge field's energy, as does the present invention. </p>
      <p>In summary, a number of similar or significant electrical,
        magnetic, and mechanical features of the several related art
        devices have been examined but, whatever the precise merits and
        advantages thereof, none of said devices achieve the correct
        combination of such features required to fulfill the purposes of
        the present invention. In this respect it may be stated that
        none of these related art devices attain the distinction of
        being able to operate extensively in the vacuum of space without
        the onboard storage of relatively massive reaction material for
        the production of thrust. Furthermore it would appear that none
        of these same devices utilize a charged conductive housing
        comprising suitably disposed electrodes and/or electrode arrays
        to create and control an asymmetrical electromotive field of
        force on itself without expelling a reaction mass, whether in a
        gaseous dielectric medium or the vacuum of space, to achieve a
        propulsive object as the present invention does. Finally, it is
        observed that none of the aforementioned related art devices can
        develop this type of useful thrust-producing electrodynamic
        field in a manner which allows more than one objective function
        to be fulfilled thereby, such as the production of useable
        thermal kinetic energy and/or the development of potential
        signal communications capability. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is a brushless permanent magnet
        electrical generator which produces a useful ultra-high-energy
        external electrodynamic field, or continuous quasi-coherent DC
        corona or arc discharge of uniform current density, that
        completely surrounds and encloses the machine's symmetrically
        disc-shaped conductive housing and tends in consequence toward a
        balanced bihemitoroidal shape. </p>
      <p>The invention incorporates a uniform arrangement of stationary
        electromagnetic armatures which may be employed as a group to
        impart a holistic and de-randomizing rotational force to the
        external discharge current that acts to inhibit the formation of
        concentrated arc streamer or channel phenomena, and thus to
        assist in rendering the electrodynamic field quasi-coherent in
        nature. The arrangement of electromagnetic armatures in said
        generator acting as a group simultaneously also contribute a
        portion of the machine's required input rotary torque upon the
        current-carrying rotor assembly thereof. </p>
      <p>This invention provides a permanent magnet high-voltage
        generator wherein the primary DC voltage induced within its
        rotating coils is electrostatically impressed across the
        conductive rotor assembly thereof, in a brushless manner
        utilizing vacuum tube cutoff bias techniques, such that a
        secondary DC corona or arc discharge current is thereby
        initiated about the housing thereof which is orders of magnitude
        larger than the operating current through the said coils. </p>
      <p>The said high-voltage primary generator of the invention then
        has a housing or hull which is divided into separate negative
        (emitter), neutral, and positive (collector) electrical
        sections, such that the continuous external flow of such
        discharge current is best facilitated and conducted internally
        by the proximal rotor, and wherein suitable means to circulate
        one or more form(s) of liquid coolant through any one or more of
        said housing sections may be employed for purposes of extracting
        an extremely high level of recoverable thermal energy (arising
        from such discharge current)--which is intended principally for
        use in the large-scale production of electrical power and/or
        distilled or desalinated water. </p>
      <p>This invention as an electrodynamic field generator also
        provides an appreciable and practical level of
        electrically-developed thrust, from the relativistic impulse of
        an induced ultra-high-voltage external DC arc discharge current
        incident upon its positive (collector) housing sections, which
        may be rendered variably non-isometric in nature and therefore
        directionally propulsive by means of selectively controlling:
        (i) the resistance of the brushless electrical linkages between
        the positive housing sections and the proximal current-carrying
        rotor; and/or (ii) the magnetic flux output of the various
        stationary electromagnetic armatures. </p>
      <p>The invention as an ultra-high-energy field generator
        furthermore presents a unique yet practicable method of
        producing a variable electromagnetic and/or gravimetric signal,
        by means of which useful information may be both transmitted to
        and received by a separate similar device, in further harnessing
        the effects associated with the device's external electromotive
        field. The relationship of said field effects to quantum
        potential vacuum fluctuation theory just now being studied,
        which may allow the devising of such a signal having an
        unconventional nature, is referred to again below. </p>
      <p>In any event, the electrodynamic field generator described may
        be feasibly manufactured and marketed in various sizes according
        to need or desire in pursuit of its remarkable objects; may be
        operated either in a gaseous dielectric medium or in the vacuum
        of space; and may incorporate ancillary mechanical, electrical,
        and/or electronic features upon or within its housing to
        accomplish all the objects set forth hereinabove. </p>
      <p>Briefly, in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the
        invention, first provided is a flat annular segmented rotor of
        very high conductive ampacity which is rendered capacitive in
        nature by the attachment of suitably paired electrode rings.
        Alternating in placement amidst such capacitive ring pairs are
        also attached on the rotor a series of toroidal generating coils
        of very large mean radius relative to the cross-sectional radius
        thereof. The resultant composite rotor assembly is then
        rotatably mounted within a sectional conductive housing. The
        potential energy inherent in the fields of ring-shaped
        stationary permanent magnets, which are affixed in concentric
        circular arrays within the housing, is utilized to electrically
        polarize the rotor across its radial annular width by means of
        the "primary" DC voltage created upon relative rotational motion
        between such coils and magnets. The thereby polarized rotor is
        electrically linked on one hand (about its positive inner
        circumference) to two axially-central collector housing
        sections, by electrostatic induction via a system of
        plane-parallel electrode elements, and on the other hand (about
        its negative outer circumference) to two radially-peripheral
        emitter housing sections across an evacuated space charge
        chamber. The rotor's subsequent transportation and storage of
        electronic charge between the proximal opposite-polarity
        sections of the housing causes a much higher "secondary" voltage
        to appear across interposed neutral sections thereof and results
        in a continuous ultra-high-energy DC discharge current flow
        about the housing externally and across the rotor internally. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p><b>Method of Operation</b> </p>
      <p>The invention disclosed herein is an Electrodynamic Field
        ("EDF") Generator. The primary challenge involved in fulfilling
        the objects of the present invention is how to generate and
        maintain a multi-megavolt potential difference across the
        exterior sectional housing which is not immediately neutralized
        due to uncontrolled direct arc discharge. The first part of the
        problem in this respect is that it is not possible to produce
        this kind of voltage directly within a traditional generating
        coil arrangement, so the voltage applied to the charged housing
        sections must be achieved by special electrostatic means.
        Secondly, the discharge current must be produced and conducted
        internally in such a manner that: (i) only a tiny percentage
        thereof is actually conducted by the generating coils (within
        their very limited ampacity compared to that of the rotor); and
        (ii) the negative and positive housing sections are each charged
        faster than they are discharged until an enormous equilibrium
        field potential difference is established which is a sum of
        roughly equal negative and positive housing section voltages. </p>
      <p>Having thus stated the principal parts of the overall problem,
        it is perhaps best to examine and explain the means to its
        solution in the reverse order. Therefore, it is deemed of
        fundamental import to realize that the EDF Generator's housing
        configuration as proposed will demonstrate a significant static
        capacitance, despite its unusual geometry, given the fact that
        the negative and positive sections of its housing are to have
        essentially equal surface areas. This simple precept ensures two
        very important consequences: (i) that the voltage across the
        housing will attain a value representing equal negative and
        positive potentials, in reliance upon the absence of a fixed
        ground reference, given induced surface charge densities which
        are sufficient to cause a continuous `leakage` current between
        the opposite-polarity sections thereof; and (ii) that a leakage
        current between the opposite-polarity housing sections will tend
        to assume a relatively uniform cross section and current density
        in response to a calculable level of non-uniform surface charge
        density between non-parallel but equal-area `plates`. Thus, it
        is possible to determine using traditional formulas just how
        much electron charge must be stripped from the positive housing
        sections, and stored in ballast capacitors, in order to
        establish a positive surface charge density which corresponds to
        the desired housing or hull potential difference. </p>
      <p>Next, the Generator must, and will, be able to charge these
        positive housing sections (by stripping them of native
        electrons) far faster than the positive surface charge
        so-created is neutralized by corona or arc discharge from the
        negative housing sections. Because these discharge current
        electrons will ultimately attain a transit time approaching
        zero, this in turn means that it must be "easier" per volt to
        strip negative charge from the positive sections--using a field
        induction system which is comprised of "primary electrode
        arrays"--than it is to deliver this charge to the negative
        sections across a vacuum chamber using relatively massive
        rotor-mounted field emitters. </p>
      <p>It can be shown that the potential difference across said
        primary arrays will tend to be equal and opposite in operation
        as proposed to that across such vacuum chamber, in part due to
        the Faraday shielding principle, and the negative `plate`
        voltage of the capacitive housing will naturally tend toward
        numeric equality with that of the positive sections by
        electrostatic induction. Therefore, the stationary
        electron-emitting primary cathodes which link the positive
        sections of the housing to the rotor are to have a much lower
        surface work function (and higher emissivity) than the rotating
        electron-emitting elements which link the rotor with the
        negative housing sections. This criterion is achieved by
        thorium-impregnating these cathodes (to stimulate their
        emissivity) and by not so-impregnating the rotor field emitters.
      </p>
      <p>The relationship just described establishes what electrical
        engineers refer to as an `instantaneous charge differential`
        with respect to these two sets of components as operated at
        equal but opposite charging voltages or potential differences,
        and the ratio of their respective electron emissivities will
        thus define the maximum ratio by which the said secondary field
        voltage (across the exterior housing) can be expected to exceed
        that in evidence across the stationary internal primary
        electrode arrays. This ratio will hereinafter be referred to as
        the "primary voltage expansion ratio", and the instantaneous
        charge differential concept as well as its relationship to the
        said voltage expansion ratio will be explained in further detail
        in a pertinent section to follow. It is important to note at
        this point, however, that for this voltage expansion to be
        realized it must and will be supported by ballast capacitors
        having suitable total capacitance as outlined hereinabove, which
        provide a corresponding force of electrostatic induction. </p>
      <p>Finally, a method of impressing as large a primary DC voltage
        across the rotor as may practicably be developed in the device's
        principal generating system must and will be employed, without
        such "Primary Power System" circuit conducting more than a
        minute percentage of the discharge current thereby initiated. To
        do so, and in a manner that requires no brushes, vacuum tube
        cutoff bias technique is utilized in the present invention:
        whereby such primary voltage is electrostatically induced upon
        the rotor between two sets of capacitive electrode ring pairs
        (in vacuo), yet the current flow across these rotor-mounted
        induction electrode arrays--and through the principal generating
        circuit itself--is absolutely minimized by the application of a
        control grid voltage which is substantially negative with
        respect to the corresponding cathodes. </p>
      <p>At a certain relative potential, the electrostatic force
        exerted by such control grid(s) on rotor circuit cathode-emitted
        electrons is sufficient to all but completely cut off the flow
        of DC current across these rotor induction arrays; yet the
        primary DC voltage is transmitted to the large conductive rotor
        segments such that a comparatively huge charging current between
        the opposite-polarity housing sections is initiated and
        maintained (across the rotor)--which subsequently expresses the
        expanded secondary voltage as a discharge current about the
        housing. Thus, an analogy could be made in describing the EDF
        Generator as a DC equivalent for boosting voltage by
        electrostatic induction means to the AC transformer (for
        boosting AC voltage by electromagnetic induction means). </p>
      <p><b>General Form of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, the present
        invention constitutes a novel form of brushless permanent magnet
        electrical generator for producing a useful ultra-high-energy
        external electrodynamic field, or continuous quasi-coherent DC
        corona or arc discharge of essentially uniform current density,
        and as such the Generator fundamentally comprises and
        incorporates: </p>
      <p>[A] a flat conductive rotor (6) principally formed of a large
        number of evenly-spaced individual metallic conductors or
        segments (14) and an equal number of conductive
        electron-emitting elements or field emitters (17), radially
        arranged in an annular flywheel configuration rather like the
        rotatable deck of a carousel, which are all connected in
        parallel electrically by the attachment of a thin metallic
        electrode ring (68) about the positive inner circumference of
        each of the two major flat faces of the annular flywheel thus
        formed and by the attachment of another such ring (22) about the
        negative outer circumference of each such flat rotor face; </p>
      <p>[B] a principal electrical generating system mounted on said
        rotor and used to create a very high primary DC voltage within a
        plurality of rotating toroidal field coils (35)(40)(56) by
        electromagnetic induction with an equal number of circular
        arrays of ring-shaped stationary permanent magnets (34)(39)(55)
        (which are positioned adjacent and concentric thereto), such
        that an internal primary discharge current may thereby be
        initiated between the rotor (6) and a housing electron "Emitter
        Ring" (47)--across an evacuated space charge chamber (11)--which
        is orders of magnitude larger than the operating current through
        said field coils; </p>
      <p>[C] a conductive exterior housing (1) divided into a plurality
        of distinct electrical sections--negative (3), neutral (4), and
        positive (5)--which may be charged from the internal rotor by
        electrostatic induction and/or by such primary discharge current
        (as the case may be) and within an evacuated induction
        compartment (12) of which said rotor (6) as an assembly,
        including the said generating coils attached thereto, is
        rotatably mounted; </p>
      <p>[D] a plurality of individual systems of stationary
        plane-parallel electrode elements (64)-(67) which electrically
        link the polarized rotor (6) by electrostatic induction about
        its positive inner circumference (within said evacuated
        compartment (12)) to two axially-central electron collector
        housing sections (5), and a plurality of similar individual
        systems of rotor-mounted plane-parallel electrode rings and/or
        radial electrode elements which may be utilized to connect a
        principal portion of the individual DC voltage outputs of said
        rotating field coils in opposed series-parallel across such
        composite rotor assembly; </p>
      <p>[E] this composite rotor assembly (6) as a means for the
        transportation and capacitive storage of electronic charge
        between opposite-polarity sections of the housing (5) and (3)
        (which are proximal to the inner and outer rotor circumferences
        respectively), such that a vastly higher secondary voltage is
        caused to appear across interposed neutral housing sections (4),
        resulting in a continuous ultra-high-energy DC discharge current
        about the housing externally which is also conducted internally
        across the rotor segments (14) that extend across the neutral
        housing portion and between the positive sections; </p>
      <p>[F] a large number of stationary electromagnetic armatures (37)
        in a uniform circular arrangement located within the neutral
        electrical region (4) of the housing which are to be operated
        principally on variable DC voltage, but which may also accept
        limited pulsed unidirectional or alternating voltage input, and
        which are employed as a group to impart an orderly rotational
        magnetic vector moment to the external discharge current that
        acts to inhibit the formation of concentrated arc streamer or
        channel phenomena and thus to assist in rendering such current
        quasi-coherent in nature; and </p>
      <p>[G] the said principal electrical generating or Primary Power
        System as operated and used in such a manner that a minor pulsed
        unidirectional or alternating voltage is superimposed upon the
        high-energy DC rotor current, and the external discharge current
        therefore acquires a discrete AC power factor, for purposes of
        modulating the electrodynamic characteristics of the external
        field during normal operation and/or for purposes of exploring
        the invention's potential signal communications capability in
        relation to intriguing new theories in high-energy quantum
        physics and relativity. </p>
      <p>In a "single-stage" rotor electrical circuit embodiment of the
        Generator, as intended for use in an electrical and/or thermal
        energy output application, any such minor AC voltage present in
        said rotor circuit receives only a modest and single level of
        amplification--in a manner generally associated with a single
        multi-electrode vacuum tube. In a "three-stage" rotor electrical
        circuit embodiment of the Generator, as intended for use in a
        propulsive and/or communications application, any such minor AC
        voltage may receive a substantial and multiple level of
        amplification--in a manner generally associated with a multiple
        number of sequentially-coupled multi-electrode vacuum tubes. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows a side sectional view of the general form of the
        invention, as if cut through the central axis of the circular
        structure. Only one side of the tapered peripheral portion of
        the structure is shown, the overall Generator being symmetrical
        about the axis along which the section shown is cut. FIG. 2
        shows a top sectional view of the invention, as if cut through
        just above the rotor assembly at the "equator", with only about
        a 30.degree. radial sector of the circular structure shown (the
        remaining 330.degree. being identical around the Generator). In
        each case, identical reference numbers are used to indicate
        identical elements. FIGS. 3 and 4 are side and top or bottom
        views of the Generator (respectively), showing the outward
        appearance of the invention and the external field it produces.
        The following discussion of the general form of the invention
        will be in reference to FIGS. 1 to 4, unless otherwise noted. </p>
      <p>The entire apparatus of the invention is contained within a
        circular conductive exterior hull or housing (1), which is
        tapered from its vertical centerline ("axis") to its rim (or
        "equator"). The overall housing is radially symmetrical around
        the axis, and bilaterally symmetrical about the equator. This
        housing's two central one-base spheric-zone-shaped sections (5)
        will be positively charged, its two intermediary conical
        ring-shaped sections (4) will be electrically neutral, and the
        convergent outermost or peripheral conical ring-shaped sections
        (3) will be negatively charged. Preferably, the surface areas of
        the outer (3) and inner (5) housing sections are equal, and
        specific details of the housing or hull design are given in a
        section to follow. </p>
      <p>Each of the housing's two symmetrical positive sections (5), or
        hull positive "zones", should be divided into equal-area radial
        sectors (42) which are equal in number to the number of like
        sections into which the device's superstructure is divided.
        Thus, in the preferred embodiment of the Generator these two
        positive zones (5) will each be divided into 36 such sectors,
        and isolated top and bottom, yielding a total of 72 individually
        controllable discharge collector areas. The positive zone
        sectors (42) jointly comprise what may hereinafter be referred
        to as the device's "Field Hub", and should be composed of a
        conductive refractory metal or high-temperature structural alloy
        such as #310 stainless steel. These positive sectors are
        insulated from sector-to-sector by insulating "partitions" (43)
        of a suitable ceramic material (such as Cordierite), and must be
        supported by an insulating understructure (not shown). </p>
      <p>At least one hull "neutral ring" surface layer (46) is also to
        be affixed on a housing frame and composed of one or more
        insulating ceramic material/s (such as Cordierite, Zirconia,
        and/or Kezite, as necessary). Said neutral hull layer/s may be
        applied in the form of plates and/or tiles to nonmetallic "deck"
        sheeting (not shown separately) supported by superstructure
        beams (153). This decking and its supporting beams are both
        preferably composed of a carbon composite material, and will
        thus be fairly conductive. Therefore, both must be isolated from
        the positive Field Hub by a dielectric buffer material (45) and
        from the hull's Emitter Ring (47), comprised of two negative
        housing sections (3), by an auxiliary dielectric buffer (50).
        The Generator's neutral housing section superstructure is shown
        in detail in FIG. 14, as is a piping system of coolant tubes or
        "thermal conduits" (74)-(79) for maintaining the hull neutral
        sections (4) and superstructure--as well as the enclosed Primary
        Power System--at an acceptable operating temperature. Such an
        intercooler system would utilize a cryogenic coolant such as
        liquid air or nitrogen when the EDF Generator is operated in the
        atmosphere for purposes of thermal energy output, and will be
        explained in greater detail in a section to follow. </p>
      <p>The negative hull plates which form each section (3) of the
        Generator's peripheral Emitter Ring (47), to which the rotor (6)
        distributes the discharge current forming the exterior field
        envelope, should be composed of high-purity aluminum which is
        copper-clad and then nickel-plated to prevent erosion at high
        field voltage and current levels. The abutting edges of all of
        the adjacent such plates must be welded one to another, and
        affixed to any necessary neutral hull section hardware, such
        that a hard vacuum may be drawn within the peripheral chamber
        (11) thereby formed. The induction compartment (12) enclosed
        between the two neutral hull sections (4) is contiguous with the
        peripheral or space charge chamber (11), and thus is equally
        evacuated. </p>
      <p>A pressurizable central chamber (2) within the housing (1),
        located between the two hull positive zones (5) thereof,
        constitutes the location of the Generator's control cabin and of
        its payload area when used as an aerospace vessel. The interior
        (11)-(12) of the negative (3) and neutral (4) housing sections
        (respectively) is separately sealed, and must be as highly
        evacuated as possible to promote the efficiency of the various
        rotating and stationary electrode arrays and to prevent their
        destructive failure. The main vacuum seals (155) and the rotor's
        vacuum chamber charge buffers (156) are shown in FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>Inside the evacuated induction compartment (12) of the housing
        (1), and surrounding the central chamber (2), is located the
        composite rotor assembly (6) in the form of a flat annular
        flywheel. In the preferred embodiment, 180 individual conductors
        or segments (14) of very high collective ampacity are employed
        in the rotor, as will be seen in the discussion of FIG. 5 below,
        as are a like number of inter-segment insulators or segment
        "separators" (16). The preferred material for the rotor segments
        is high-purity copper which is certified oxygen-free, to resist
        the production of free oxygen radicals at high operating
        temperatures which would degrade the performance of the various
        electrode arrays and cause an undesirable increase in vacuum
        chamber (11) temperature. </p>
      <p>The inner ends of the rotor segments (14) and segment
        separators (16) are mechanically connected via a retaining and
        lockdown section thereof to one or more ring gear(s) (8), which
        run/s entirely around the central aperture of the rotor
        assembly. Suitable insulating attachment hardware (7), as
        described in detail in the following section (and shown in FIG.
        15), will be used to effect a rigid mechanical union of the
        segments and separators to the said ring gear(s) and associated
        drive means such that the gear(s) and all conductive components
        of such drive means are electrically isolated from the energized
        segments. The ring gear(s) (8) may be engaged by one or more
        pinion or drive gear/s (162) powered by a motor (9) or plurality
        thereof, which may be of various types (such as electrical or
        hydraulic), causing the rotor to rotate around the central
        chamber (2). The rotor is supported near its outer edge by two
        ballraces (25) mounted to the housing superstructure and to the
        rotor, and having bearing balls (26), allowing it to spin
        freely. </p>
      <p>As can be seen in either FIG. 1 or 7, the rotor segments (14)
        are electrically connected together at each end by continuous
        inner (68) and outer (22) electrode rings, and also at
        intermediate points by induction cathode rings (28) and
        induction anode rings (61). The inner electrode rings (68)
        constitute the primary induction ring array anode elements, as
        will be described below. The outer electrode rings (22) are each
        covered by a dielectric layer (23) which is in turn covered by
        an anode ring (24), and each combination of rings (22) and (24)
        separated by dielectric layer (23) forms a housing charge
        ballast capacitor whose function will be explained in detail
        below. Induction anode rings (29) and cathode rings (59) are
        used to electrostatically induce corresponding negative and
        positive voltages on rotor-mounted rings (28) and (61),
        respectively, thereby electrically energizing the rotor segments
        as will also be described in further detail below. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows details of the basic rotor construction.
        Wedge-shaped ceramic pieces or segment separators (16) equal in
        number to the conductive rotor segments (14) are to be
        positioned uniformly between the individual segments, as are the
        rotor's peripheral field emitters (17). To form the base rotor
        construction, the segments, separators, and field emitters must
        be equal in number, preferably using 180 of each. The said
        segment separators are actually more structural than insulative
        in purpose, and not only stiffen the entire rotor to prevent its
        distortion at elevated temperature and rotational speed but also
        provide a nonconductive base for mounting all other rotor
        assembly components. Each of the ceramic separators (16) is
        bonded to its adjacent segments (14) by refractory adhesive
        layers (15). </p>
      <p>Two important criteria for selecting a ceramic segment
        separator material are that the compound chosen be readily
        machinable like steel and provide very high physical strength
        yet require no firing. These parameters limit the choice made
        almost to a solitary substance: magnesium silicate
        (MgSiO.sub.3). When suitably formed, this material can be
        milled, drilled, and tapped like steel (using low-speed tungsten
        carbide tools) and approaches the physical strength of
        dry-pressed porcelain. It is ready for use directly after
        shaping and requires no kiln hardening. </p>
      <p>This latter characteristic is very important as it is extremely
        difficult to produce fired ceramic pieces with the exacting
        dimensional control necessary in this case, and it eliminates
        the tendency of thicker fired pieces to develop micro-cracks
        which may potentially cause destructive failure of the component
        under high centrifugal loading. Surfacing can be done with
        abrasive paper or grinding wheels, and it is very important that
        this material be machined or worked perfectly dry as it is
        fairly porous and any lubricant used tends to significantly
        alter its dielectric properties. Magnesium silicate of this type
        is available from CeramTec NA as CeramTec designation AlSiMag
        222, and will withstand constant working temperature of over
        1300.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The insulating separators (16) are shorter than the conductive
        segments (14), allowing for the field emitters (17) to be
        fastened outboard of the separators. The field emitters are thus
        located around the outer circumference of the rotor assembly and
        should be formed of a sintered refractory composite, such as
        tungsten-copper, selected for its relative surface work function
        and superior arc-erosion characteristics. As can be seen in
        FIGS. 5, 6a, and 6b, the field emitters are fastened
        mechanically and electrically to the conductive segments (14)
        through locator pins (19), which fit into mating holes recessed
        into the ends of the segments. These emitters (17) taper to a
        somewhat rounded edge at the tips (20) which form the outermost
        periphery of the rotor (as an assembly), and are squared-off at
        their bases (18) to fit tightly against the insulating
        separators (16). From the top view of FIG. 6b, it can be seen
        that the field emitters follow the tapering of the segment
        separators (16), increasing slightly in width from their bases
        (18) to the tips (20). The conductive segments (14), in
        contrast, are of constant width over their length. </p>
      <p><b>Overall Description of the Primary Power System Structure</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rotor Drive and Positioning Assemblies</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 15, a split-frame centrifuge-style
        carrier assembly reminiscent of the rotatable mounting
        arrangement for the turntable of a carousel may be employed to
        firmly suspend, center, and rotatably mount the composite rotor
        assembly about its inner circumference within the evacuated
        induction compartment of the housing, and such carrier assembly
        should preferably be constructed of a weldable nonmagnetic metal
        alloy which is suitably insulated from the electrically
        energized rotor assembly components. </p>
      <p>The rotatable carrier assembly may be mechanically-affixed
        and/or welded to one or more large metal ring gear(s) which may
        be comprised of like sections (163) to facilitate construction
        and which in turn may be supported, driven, and dynamically
        braked by one or more low-voltage DC motor-generator unit(s)
        (161) (similar to those used in large electric trains) and drive
        pinion gear/s (162). Such ring gear(s) may additionally be
        supported by pinion gear and pillow block bearing assemblies (if
        necessary--not shown in FIG. 15). Such drive motor-generators(s)
        (161) and said pillow block bearing assemblies (if any) must be
        separately and nonrotatably affixed to the relatively stationary
        housing superstructure. </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIG. 15, it can be seen that in the
        preferred embodiment the inner end of each rotor segment (14)
        and segment separator (16) is flared outward into a retaining
        "fantail" (160). These retaining fantails are preferably
        enclosed and prepared for connection into a driven assembly
        using a system of: [i] insulating inner (171) and outer (173)
        ceramic thermal spacers; [ii] axial (172) and radial (174) nylon
        (or equivalent) load buffers; and [iii] insulating displacement
        (170) and lockdown (175) ceramic bushings. The retaining
        fantails are then secured into a driven assembly by two
        identical carrier half-structures comprising frame struts and
        members (168) and retaining ring sections (167), using: [i]
        mounting ring sections (164) each having two ring gear sections
        (163) attached thereto; [ii] a corresponding number of mounting
        ring spacers (165) each having a very stiff metallic flexor
        plate (166) attached thereto; and [iii] nylon (or equivalent)
        torsion buffers (169). The drive pinion gears (162) allow a
        preferred total of 32 like and evenly-spaced DC drive
        motor-generator units (161), which are mounted to the
        Generator's ground frame (10), to apply input rotational torque
        (or counter-rotational braking torque) to the composite rotor
        assembly by engaging a total of four ring gears (comprised of
        sections (163)) which are mounted to the rotor's described drive
        carrier assembly. </p>
      <p>Rolling bearing assemblies should be employed to further center
        and stabilize the composite rotor about its outer periphery
        within the evacuated induction compartment of the housing, as a
        readily feasible mechanical alternative for that purpose to
        `zero-friction` electromagnetic positioning systems (of the type
        normally associated with mag-lev train technology) which are of
        a much greater complexity. </p>
      <p>Such rolling bearing assemblies may comprise two complimentary
        pairs of stationary and rotating circular-groove raceways (25)
        about the outer periphery of the composite rotor assembly, as
        well as an appropriate number of bearing balls (26) including
        uniform ball separation means, and these bearing assemblies may
        be composed of nonmagnetic stainless steel and/or a specialized
        ball bearing ceramic (such as silicon nitride (Si.sub.3
        N.sub.4)) which may run unlubricated in a very hot
        electrically-charged environment </p>
      <p><b>The Rotor and Associated Elements</b> </p>
      <p>There are a number of electrical structures attached to the
        base rotor construction, which rotate with the segments,
        separators, and field emitters as a composite assembly. It will
        be understood that the structures mounted on the rotor and those
        interacting with the rotor are symmetrical above and below the
        incorporating device's equator, as well as either continuous or
        repeating in placement around the device in the plane of the
        rotor segments, so that a reference to an element at one point
        above the rotor also applies to the similar elements below and
        around the rotor. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, and in the preferred three-stage
        embodiment of the invention suitable for an aerospace vessel (as
        shown schematically in FIG. 9), the following elements of the
        principal electrical generating means are mounted upon the
        annular rotor. Generally starting at the outer circumference of
        the rotor and working inward, and, for each structure, starting
        at the rotor and working upward, these are: </p>
      <p>[a] the ballast capacitor, comprising a negative ring element
        (22) attached directly to the rotor, a dielectric layer (23)
        affixed thereto, and a positive ring element (24); </p>
      <p>[b] the bearing ballrace (25), within which the bearing balls
        (26) roll between two identical raceway halves--one on the
        rotor, and one mounted to the vessel's stationary structural
        frame. The ballrace (25) and bearing balls (26) support the
        rotor peripherally and are structurally mechanical, not taking
        part in the electrical operation of the invention; </p>
      <p>[c] the voltage-induction diode ring array, in the form of a
        cathode ring (28) which is mounted on and electrically connected
        to the rotor segments (14) and an anode ring (29) which is
        affixed plane-parallel to the cathode ring (28) and insulated
        from it by a suitable supporting structure using insulating
        posts, pins, or brackets in or on the segment separators (16).
        Although the resulting combination could be thought of as a
        2-element or diode vacuum-tube construct and is similarly named,
        it is more accurately a "cold" parallel plate capacitor of high
        value and appreciable AC conductance which preferably exhibits a
        modest circuit DC leakage current; </p>
      <p>[d] the outer field coil (35), helically wound and supported
        upon a continuous coil support or structural core which is
        preferably nonferromagnetic (not shown). There are preferably
        two windings on the core which together comprise such coil, as
        will be discussed in the circuit section below and as is shown
        in FIG. 9--the major portion or field winding (81), and a minor
        portion or bias winding (82); </p>
      <p>[e] the outer voltage-transfer triode ring array, in the form
        of cathode (30), control grid element (31), and anode (32) rings
        or elements, affixed plane-parallel or radially-concentric above
        the rotor segments (14) and insulated from them and from each
        other by similar such supporting structure (using insulating
        posts, pins, or brackets) in or on the segment separators (16).
        This combination also comprises a triode vacuum-tube construct
        with controllably variable AC conductance; </p>
      <p>[f] the center field coil (40), helically wound and supported
        upon a continuous coil support or core of the type described.
        There are again two windings on the core, as will be discussed
        in the circuit section below (and as is shown in FIG. 9)--the
        major portion or field winding (83), and a minor portion or bias
        winding (84); </p>
      <p>[g] the inner voltage-transfer triode ring array, in the form
        of cathode (51), control grid element (52), and anode (53) rings
        or elements, affixed plane-parallel or radially concentric above
        the segments and insulated from them and from each other by the
        described supporting structure(s). This combination again
        comprises a triode vacuum-tube construct with controllably
        variable AC conductance; </p>
      <p>[h] the inner field coil (56), helically wound and supported
        upon such continuous coil support or core. There are once again
        two windings on the core, as will be discussed in the circuit
        section below and as is shown in FIG. 9--the major portion or
        field winding (85), and a minor portion or bias winding (86); </p>
      <p>[i] the voltage-induction triode ring array, in the form of an
        anode ring (61) which is mounted on and electrically connected
        to the rotor segments (14) as well as a cathode ring (59) and
        control grid element ring (60) affixed plane-parallel to the
        anode ring (61) and insulated from it and from each other by the
        said supporting structure(s). The resulting combination
        comprises a triode vacuum-tube construct with controllably
        variable AC conductance; </p>
      <p>[j] the primary induction anode ring (68), which is also
        mounted on and electrically connected to the rotor segments (14)
        and which provides the positive element of the stationary
        plane-parallel electrode systems used to induce the exterior
        field; and </p>
      <p>[k] the ring gear(s) (8) or other appropriate means for
        allowing a drive mechanism to spin the rotor. </p>
      <p><b>Field Coils</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, the field coils (35)(40)(56) which
        comprise the major rotating portion of the primary DC voltage
        generating means are formed of conductive insulated magnet wire
        multi-layer toroidally wound upon cores (not shown) whose
        permeability should generally be minimized, and main portions of
        the DC voltage outputs of the three field coils comprising each
        of two like groups thereof--one above the plane of the rotor and
        one below--are sequentially connected via a plurality of
        individual systems of rotating plane-parallel electrode rings
        (or alternatively, modular radial electrode element systems or
        tubes) in the preferred three-stage rotor emodiment of the
        invention shown. The number of wire turns comprising each such
        field coil should in general be maximized (in a practical
        manner), in either the single- or three-stage embodiments. </p>
      <p>As is depicted more clearly in FIG. 8, each such field coil may
        be compound wound or comprise two or more independent voltage
        generating portions, with either all or the major portion of
        each coil constituting the field winding (81)(83) or (85) or
        principal DC voltage generating portion of that coil as a whole,
        and the principal or field winding portions of the field coils
        comprising either of the said two like groups thereof may be
        hooked in series one to another by direct physical connection in
        the single-stage rotor embodiment of the Generator shown. Each
        of the two like sets of three such field windings thus formed
        are then connected on their respective sides of the rotor
        between the plate resistor (91) of the diode array anode ring
        (29) and the inner triode array cathode ring (59), while
        observing appropriate conventions of polarity assignment. </p>
      <p>The remaining minor portion (if any) of each field coil may
        comprise one or more independent bias and/or control winding(s),
        or secondary DC voltage generating portion(s) of that coil as a
        whole, with the largest such secondary winding if any
        constituting the control grid bias winding of that coil. As
        shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, one such bias winding (82)(84) or (86)
        is provided for each field coil and is positioned in the
        schematic(s) immediately thereabove. In the single-stage rotor
        embodiment of FIG. 8, these bias windings are also directly
        connected in series one to another between the inner triode
        array cathode ring (59) and the corresponding grid resistor (90)
        of that same array's control grid (60), with the negative end of
        each bias winding toward the said grid resistor. </p>
      <p>In the three-stage embodiment of FIG. 9, the field winding of
        each said field coil is connected in series between the plate
        resistor (92) attached to the anode ring of the outerlying
        electrode system which is adjacent to that coil and the cathode
        ring of the innerlying electrode system adjacent thereto, while
        observing appropriate conventions of polarity assignment. The
        bias winding (if any) of each said field coil is then connected
        between the cathode element (30)(51) or (59) of such innerlying
        electrode system and the grid resistor (90) attached to the
        negative control grid (31)(52) or (60) (respectively) of that
        same electrode system, while observing appropriate conventions
        of polarity assignment, such that said bias winding is in
        parallel with the cathode ring or element of that electrode
        system and may therefore provide an AC and/or DC voltage bias
        with respect thereto in the manner associated with electron
        vacuum tubes. </p>
      <p><b>Rotating Electrode Arrays</b> </p>
      <p>Electron vacuum tube design, construction, and operating
        methods are employed to impress the principal portion of each
        field coil group's combined series DC voltage output across the
        Generator's rotor in an opposed parallel arrangement (comprising
        two like field winding circuits or rotor subcircuits), such that
        the rotor segments become electrically polarized, although the
        rotor is not considered uniformly energized electrically until a
        finite DC Primary Power System circuit current is established
        against the series capacitance and high bias voltage of the
        several rotor-mounted electrode systems. </p>
      <p>Two special pairs of highly-capacitive electrode rings (22)(24)
        seperated by a dielectric media (23) are affixed upon the
        polarized rotor (6) near the outer negative periphery thereof,
        and supplied with a portion of the Generator's positive primary
        DC output voltage, in order to accomplish the storage of a
        predetermined amount of ballast electron charge which is
        sufficient to enable a desired much-higher secondary voltage to
        appear across the neutral sections of the housing (given the
        static capacitance and surface charge density characteristics of
        the housing as a whole in operation). </p>
      <p>Electron vacuum tube design, construction, and operating
        methods may be employed to induce and/or modulate a substantial
        DC bias upon the plate currents of any or all of the various
        rotating plane-parallel and/or radial electrode systems or
        "arrays" employed in the present invention. Each rotating
        three-electrode system or triode array so-employed should be
        constructed in such a manner that it exhibits a minimum design
        amplification factor (.mu.) equal to 4.0, with reference to any
        AC voltage or signal present in its electrical circuit and as a
        function of its engineered relative electrode spacing(s). </p>
      <p>Electron vacuum tube design, construction, and operating
        methods may furthermore be employed to induce, modulate, and/or
        amplify a minor pulsed unidirectional or alternating voltage
        upon the high-energy DC rotor current, and therefore on the
        field envelope current as well, as a means by which the
        electrodynamic field produced by the Generator may potentially
        be used (as a form of antenna) for purposes of transmitting and
        receiving a variable electromagnetic and/or gravimetric resonant
        frequency signal either to or from itself or a separate similar
        device (as the case may be). </p>
      <p>In light of this teaching, it is contemplated that one possible
        type of communications signal which might be investigated
        employing the EDF Generator would couple the electric, magnetic,
        and gravitic forces to utilize the wave mechanics of quantum
        potential vacuum fluctuations (.DELTA.E.sub.q /.DELTA.t), which
        are believed by some theoretical physicists to propagate at
        c.sup.2 in order to explain the uniform operation of gravity and
        entropy in two space-time continuums which are coincident but
        completely out-of-phase. Should this quantum gravity theory
        prove correct, the transmission delay of a
        gravimetrically-coupled EM signal at this wave speed would be
        only 0.10525 seconds per light-year. </p>
      <p>In any event, it should be noted that the rotor interstage
        coupling transformers (89) which are depicted in FIGS. 1 and 9
        (but are not shown in FIG. 2) would be employed only in a
        preferred three-stage rotor embodiment, and mounted (one each)
        immediately above the rotating diode and transfer triode arrays
        ((28)-(29), (30)-(32), and (51)-(53) respectively). These
        transformers may preferentially take the form of continuous
        toroid coils on either powdered iron or nonmagnetic cores (like
        the field coils), having single-layer primary and secondary
        windings, or of one or more pairs of balanced toroidal
        arc-section coils and cores of similar composition which are
        uniformly distributed above said rotating arrays. Each
        transformer (89) uses two DC blocking capacitors (88). </p>
      <p>It may be appreciated from FIGS. 8 and 9 that each bias winding
        or series group thereof, its associated triode array, and a
        corresponding output plate resistor (91) or (92) together
        comprise one stage of amplification of any AC signal voltage
        which may be present across that triode's grid resistor (90) as
        an input. In this way, electromagnetic waves of one form or
        another from outside the external field created by the Generator
        may be both detected, from their influence on the waveform(s) of
        the field envelope current, and amplified from within the device
        (when used as an aerospace vessel). </p>
      <p><b>The Interaction of the Rotor and Frame-mounted Elements</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic Rings</b> </p>
      <p>A plurality of circular arrays of stationary permanent magnets
        essentially comprise the stationary portion of the primary DC
        voltage generating means, and each such magnet is preferably to
        be formed as a C-shaped ring composed of axially round stock of
        a metallic ferromagnetic substance which exhibits a very high
        residual induction (such as the alloy family commonly known as
        Alnico). The number of individual magnetic rings comprising each
        such array should in general be maximized (in a practical
        manner). Preferably, each magnet array has a rigid and annular
        nonmagnetic round core (not shown) which is roughly equal in
        minor diameter to the inside diameter of the constitutent rings,
        such that the rings may be easily strung thereupon rather like
        beads on an abacus wire. </p>
      <p>Referring once again to FIGS. 1 and 2, each of the several
        magnetic ring arrays (34)(39)(55) may be installed in sections
        which are preferably equal in number to the number of like
        sections into which the incorporating device's superstructure is
        divided. The rotating field coil (35)(40) or (56) associated
        with each such circular array of individual magnetic rings must
        be respectively concentric and adjacent thereto, and is
        basically positioned on both the radial and axial centerlines of
        the flux gaps of that array's constituent rings. As power is
        generated thereby, these rings may need periodic replacing. </p>
      <p>The maximum length of the flux gap of each such C-shaped
        magnetic ring must of course be just slightly larger than the
        minor outside diameter of its associated field coil, and should
        be roughly equal to or just slightly less than the formed inside
        diameter of that magnetic ring. In the preferred embodiment
        these ring flux gaps are oriented horizontally, although they
        may also be readily oriented vertically if so desired. Each
        magnetic ring may also be mounted within the superstructure of
        the housing such that a comparatively small thin
        axially-polarized wafer of a highly-coercive permanent
        ferromagnetic substance (like sintered Ferrite 5 (BaO.6Fe.sub.2
        O.sub.3)) is positioned in the hollow center of that ring
        magnet, with such wafer's magnetic poles facing the like poles
        thereof, so as to act as a leakage flux blocking or reducing
        mechanism with respect thereto. These optional components would
        be most easily installed by insertion into a corresponding slot
        cut into each of the described mounting cores, and are
        recommended for use in very large devices. </p>
      <p>Also arranged concentrically around the evacuated induction
        compartment (12) of the Generator, but fixedly mounted within
        the vessel's structure instead of rotating with the rotor
        assembly, are the following elements of the principal electrical
        generating means. Again, they are discussed in order from the
        outer circumference of the vessel inward, as shown in FIGS. 1
        and 2, and a reference to an element at one point above the
        rotor also applies to the similar elements below and around the
        rotor: </p>
      <p>[a] the stationary half of the ballrace (25); </p>
      <p>[b] the outer array (34) of stationary permanent magnets, which
        should be mounted on a nonmagnetic core and in the preferred
        embodiment incorporates a maximum of 900 such ring magnets
        equally spaced around the vessel superstructure; </p>
      <p>[c] the circular group of stationary electromagnetic armatures
        (37) or "variable inductor" array, as used to impart a
        rotational magnetic force upon both the external discharge
        current and the internal rotor assembly (which is proximal
        thereto). Each such array preferably comprises a maximum of 180
        such armatures, and is to be approximately centered within the
        neutral region of the housing so that its constituent armatures
        are axially parallel to the rotor's axis of rotation; </p>
      <p>[d] the center array (39) of stationary permanent magnets,
        which should be mounted on a nonmagnetic core and in the
        preferred embodiment incorporates a maximum of 720 such ring
        magnets equally spaced around the vessel superstructure; </p>
      <p>[e] the inner array of (55) stationary permanent magnets, which
        should be mounted on a nonmagnetic core and in the preferred
        embodiment incorporates a maximum of 576 such ring magnets
        equally spaced around the vessel superstructure; and </p>
      <p>[f] the stationary anode ring (58), located adjacent and
        plane-parallel to the rotating cathode (59) of the inner
        electrostatic-induction triode array, which develops an induced
        positive voltage that is made available to the control circuitry
        shown in FIG. 10 as described below. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 8 and 9 show two embodiments of the Primary Power System.
        The "Field Induction System" or stationary plane-parallel
        electrode arrangement(s) employed to induce the exterior field
        is/are basically the same in either case, and the voltage
        control system of FIG. 10 may be used with either embodiment. </p>
      <p>The simpler single-stage rotor system of FIG. 8 is primarily
        intended for applications wherein the EDF Generator would be
        employed to produce useful electricity or heat, the latter being
        extracted from a principal liquid hull coolant circulated
        through the primary thermal conduits (48) (shown in FIG. 1) that
        encircle the field power resistors (63). Two thermal exchange or
        main service manifolds (not shown) would provide ground-based
        support to such a Generator from an associated utility or
        physical plant, as well as a remarkable level of electrical or
        thermal output from such Generator thereto. Each such manifold
        would connect directly to a single circular center sector of one
        of the two positive housing zones. Each of these two center
        sectors (44), one or either of which is depicted in FIG. 4, must
        in this case be composed of a nonconductive material. </p>
      <p><b>Description of the Primary Power System Circuit</b> </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 8, the respective outer, center, and
        inner field windings (81)(83)(85) are directly connected in
        series, and the voltage thus generated is applied to the inner
        induction triode array cathode ring (59) and (through plate
        resistor (91)) to the outer induction diode array anode ring
        (29) and to the ballast capacitor anode ring (24). The
        respective outer, center, and inner bias windings (82)(84)(86)
        are also connected in series, and the voltage thus generated is
        applied between the inner induction triode array cathode ring
        (59) and (through grid resistor (90)) to the control grid (60)
        of that same array. This places said control grid in parallel
        with that cathode electrically. </p>
      <p>The turns numbers of the bias windings (82)(84)(86) and the
        grid resistor (90) values are chosen to apply a bias voltage to
        control grid (60) such that the inner induction triode array is
        biased very nearly to current cutoff. This results in a very
        high voltage being induced on the rotor segments (14) between
        outer induction cathode ring (28) and inner induction anode ring
        (61), but at a very low series field coil current due to the
        near-cutoff bias of the triode array. It is expected that the
        voltage on the rotor segments between these two rings, in a
        preferred embodiment using this arrangement, would be
        approximately 8,000 volts for a four-foot diameter prototype, or
        about 2,000 volts per foot of housing diameter. It is also
        anticipated that series field coil current could be limited to
        fractional amperage in smaller such devices and to single-digit
        amperage in the largest. </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 9 is a three-stage rotor
        system which is considered to be much more useful for
        applications wherein the EDF Generator may be employed as an
        aerospace vessel, in that it allows energy/wave-function signals
        from outside the vessel to be detected and amplified in the
        manner previously described. </p>
      <p>In this embodiment, instead of the field windings (81)(83)(85)
        being directly connected together in series, intermediary
        voltage-transferring triode vacuum tube constructs are used to
        effect an indirect series connection between the said field
        windings. The voltage thus generated is again applied to the
        inner induction triode array cathode ring (59) and (through
        plate resistors (92)) to the outer induction diode array anode
        ring (29) and to the ballast capacitor anode ring (24). The bias
        windings (82)(84)(86) are in this case used to provide an
        independent bias voltage to the control grids (31)(52)(60) of
        the outer, center, and inner rotating triode arrays,
        respectively, in parallel with their cathodes. </p>
      <p>As in the single-stage rotor embodiment described above, the
        turns numbers of the bias windings (82)(84)(86) and the grid
        resistor (90) values are chosen to apply a bias voltage to
        control grids (31)(52) and (60) respectively such that each
        corresponding triode array is biased very nearly to current
        cutoff. This results in a very high voltage being induced on the
        rotor segments (14) between outer induction cathode ring (28)
        and inner induction anode ring (61), again at a very low or
        fractional current due to the near-cutoff bias of the triode
        arrays. It is expected that the voltage on the rotor segments
        between these two rings, in a preferred embodiment using this
        arrangement, would be approximately 1,500 volts per foot of
        vessel diameter. </p>
      <p>In general, the stationary anode rings (58) and all of the
        rotating electrode rings except the primary anode rings (68)
        should be composed of a nonmagnetic structural nickel alloy
        (such as Inconel 600). All rotating control grid element wires
        should be composed of an alloy such as that commonly known as
        nichrome. The rotating cathodes may be composed of
        modestly-thoriated tungsten, however, if and only as necessary
        to establish a small DC Primary Power System current if the
        observed `dark discharge` current values are deemed
        insufficient, particularly in the three-stage embodiment wherein
        amplification of a minor AC signal voltage may be desired for
        communications purposes. The ceramic material Titania, with a
        nominal dielectric constant of 85, may preferably be used to
        form the posts, pins, or brackets which support the various
        rotating electrodes. </p>
      <p>It is important to observe that both Primary Power System
        (rotor) field winding circuits as configured in both the single-
        and three-stage Generator embodiments will have an inherent AC
        series resonant frequency, and operation at that frequency will
        maximize the series field winding AC line currents (within given
        circuit resistor constraints) as well as the dependent stage
        plate voltage drops (across resistor(s) (91) or (92)
        respectively) which allow stage AC signal reproduction and
        amplification. As in traditional related practice, the series
        resonant frequency will be that at which the given circuit's
        inductive and capacitive reactances are approximately equal and
        opposite. Thus, the series resonant frequency of either of said
        Generator rotor circuit embodiments will be largely contingent
        upon the total field winding inductance and coil core
        permeability, as the various rotor electrode arrays and the
        plate resistor(s) (91) or (92) must have quite specific fixed
        relative design values of capacitance and resistance
        (respectively)--as a function of total field winding
        voltage--for proper overall DC and AC circuit performance. </p>
      <p>Each Primary Power System control grid winding subcircuit as
        configured in the three-stage rotor embodiment may then be
        readily tuned for stage AC parallel resonance at the said
        inherent series resonant frequency, thereby minimizing stage
        grid subcircuit line current while maximizing the stage grid
        voltage drop (across each grid resistor (90)) which determines
        the level of net stage AC signal voltage gain or amplification
        obtained. As in traditional related practice, the parallel
        resonant frequency will once again be that at which the given
        subcircuit's inductive and capacitive reactances are
        approximately equal and opposite. This condition may be achieved
        by connecting an optional capacitor of suitable value if desired
        across the secondary winding (or control grid resistor side) of
        each rotor stage coupling transformer (89), as indicated in FIG.
        9. </p>
      <p><b>The Field Induction System</b> </p>
      <p>Before commencing a technical discussion of the stationary
        induction electrode systems which will be used to charge the
        positive housing sections, it will be necessary to further
        elucidate certain aspects of the Primary Power System electrical
        circuit so that a few of its key operational characteristics are
        more clearly understood. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 7, each of the Generator's two identical
        groups of rotating field coils (one above and one below the
        rotor) are in essence connected in simple series across the
        rotor segments using pairs of capacitive electrode rings, thus
        forming a single series loop with respect to the rotor. The two
        such series loops are at the same time, however, connected in
        mutually-opposed electrostatic parallel with respect to the
        rotor segment circuit leg common to both such loops. </p>
      <p>Based on applicable principles of proper circuit resolution and
        series DC capacitance, such an opposed series-parallel circuit
        may readily be configured such that equal and opposite-polarity
        voltages will result upon the rotor-mounted induction cathode
        (28) and anode (61) rings in the absence of a fixed ground
        reference. To this end, the rotor assembly itself is to remain
        completely without direct earth or chassis ground in operation,
        and a corresponding segment polarization will continue as the
        circuit is duly energized by a finite DC conduction current. </p>
      <p>When a primary DC rotor current is also established to the
        housing's Emitter Ring (47) and an external discharge current in
        turn occurs to the positive zone sectors (42), the two systems
        of primary induction electrodes (64)-(68) also complete two
        simple series loops back to the rotor and the two such external
        field envelope subcircuits in parallel constitute the EDF
        Generator's "Field Induction System" circuit. Thus, the total
        field discharge current equals the primary rotor current, and
        the rotor segment circuit leg is common to both of the major
        system circuits described. </p>
      <p>As is apparent from the section on Method of Operation, it is
        imperative that the charged housing sections also have no direct
        earth or chassis ground, being instead of a `floating-ground`
        reference with respect to the described primary rotor circuit.
        The cathodes (64) of these two primary electrode systems may
        have a chassis ground reference at a very high resistive bias
        (as indicated in FIG. 10), across which any actual cathode
        charge imbalance or potential in operation may be detected and
        measured. </p>
      <p>Therefore, in light of the Faraday shielding principle and the
        said equal and opposite voltages which occur at opposite ends of
        the rotor segments (14), the potential difference between the
        rotor field emitters (17) and the inner surfaces of the two
        negative hull sections (or Emitter Ring (47)) will tend to
        become equal (and opposite) in operation to that across the
        primary electrode systems. And thus, a suitably vast and
        engineered differential in the electron emissivity of the field
        emitters (17) and the said ground-referenced primary cathodes
        (64) will define the primary voltage expansion ratio which may
        be obtained (in the manner first outlined in the section on
        Method of Operation). This topic will be discussed in more
        detail in a section to follow. </p>
      <p>Moreover, a basic field-envelope-circuit generator design is
        disclosed which thus far, in accordance with Faraday's and
        Lenz's Laws, can produce a very high DC primary voltage with
        minimized circuit AC current inductance losses. The Primary
        Power System's DC voltage is not readily available, however, for
        purposes of normally-usable electrical output. Brushless
        electrode rings (58) must once again be employed to extract any
        portion of this primary voltage for off-rotor use. The Primary
        Power System schematics shown in FIGS. 8 and 9 in conjunction
        with FIG. 10 best illustrate the use of these two additional
        stationary anode rings (58), one suspended adjacent to each
        inner rotor induction cathode ring (59), which allow a large
        electrostatically-induced positive DC voltage to be `picked
        off`. This positive voltage may then be used as a source of low
        power within an external circuit, provided that circuit is
        negatively-grounded and only to the Generator's chassis, and is
        therefore really intended for auxiliary onboard usage only. </p>
      <p>It can be seen thus far, and especially in FIG. 7, that there
        are essentially two major systems involved in creating the
        voltages which must be applied to the positive and negative
        housing or hull sections in order to form the electrodynamic
        field that will surround the Generator in operation. These two
        systems are: </p>
      <p>[A] the Primary Power System, which generates a large DC
        voltage by electromagnetic induction and then electrostatically
        induces a major portion of that voltage upon the rotor segments
        (14) between two pairs of induction anode (61) and cathode (28)
        rings which are conductively affixed thereto (about the inner
        and outer circumferences of the rotor assembly, respectively);
        and </p>
      <p>[B] the Field Induction System, which utilizes the potential
        difference which then exists between the positive inner
        circumference of the rotor--and its two attached primary anode
        rings (68)--and two separate sets of highly electron-emissive
        stationary cathodes (64) which are maintained at chassis ground
        and which are circularly-arranged near and
        electrically-connected to the periphery of each central
        collector housing section (or "zone") so that they may jointly
        charge their respective zone sectors (44) and/or (42) positively
        by stripping them of native electrons. </p>
      <p>Each of these primary electrode array cathodes (64) connect
        directly to a field power resistor (63), which in turn connects
        to one positive radial zone sector (42) of the central housing
        sections. Each such cathode (64) is also vertically aligned
        inboard with a group of three stationary plane-parallel grid
        electrode elements and one of the two innermost rotating
        induction anode rings (68) conductively-affixed to the rotor
        segments (14) (about their positive inner circumference). Each
        such group of three grid elements is comprised of a control grid
        (65), an accelerator grid (66), and a suppressor grid (67), with
        one such combined grid element assembly per radial zone sector
        (42). </p>
      <p>Together with the said primary induction anode ring (68), each
        such 5-electrode group constitutes what is termed a "unit
        pentode array" ((69) as seen in FIG. 7). The unit pentode arrays
        (69) and their associated frame-mounted power resistors are thus
        arranged in two ring-shaped sets, located between the rotor and
        the two positive housing sections, which are referred to
        throughout as the "primary induction ring rays". </p>
      <p>The potential difference between the unit pentode array
        cathodes (64) and rotor primary anode rings (68) is then
        referred to as the "primary array voltage", as the unit pentode
        arrays of each primary induction ring array are connected in
        parallel electrically (between the field envelope and rotor),
        and the number of unit pentode arrays should be equal to the
        number of like sections into which the Generator's
        superstructure is divided. </p>
      <p>Electron vacuum tube design, construction, and operating
        methods may be employed to induce and/or modulate a substantial
        DC bias upon the plate current(s) of the several unit pentode
        arrays, which electrically link the polarized rotor to the
        central housing sections, for purposes of rendering the external
        electrodynamic field variably non-isometric and therefore
        directionally propulsive. Each such "stationary" 5-electrode
        system or unit pentode array (69) (whose anode element actually
        rotates) should be constructed in such a manner that it exhibits
        a minimum design amplification factor (.mu.) equal to 12.0,
        again with reference to any AC voltage or signal present in the
        Field Induction System circuit and as a function of its
        engineered relative electrode spacing(s). </p>
      <p>The rotating primary induction anode rings (68), stationary
        cathodes (64), and various grid element wires which are
        associated with the stationary multi-electrode systems should be
        composed of tungsten, due to the extremely heavy conduction
        current across these primary arrays. Ceramic posts, pins, or
        brackets composed of a specialized material such as Titania may
        once again be used to support all of the various stationary
        electrodes and grid elements, and each unit pentode array's grid
        wires should be vertically aligned (or mutually-shading)
        similarly to those in a "beam power pentode" vacuum tube. </p>
      <p>As generally depicted in FIG. 1, a primary thermal conduit (48)
        with an imbedded coolant-carrying core (49) encircles and
        mechanically supports each unit pentode array, its power
        resistor (63), and that resistor's enclosing dielectric buffer
        (45). These thermal conduits and dielectric buffers will be
        examined in further detail hereinafter. </p>
      <p>The operation of the Field Induction System is regulated by a
        central Field Voltage Control System which is modular in nature,
        as illustrated in FIG. 10, and which is therefore mechanically
        and electrically connected to the stationary cathodes and grid
        elements of each unit pentode array (69). In this regard, the
        auxiliary stationary anode rings (58) described above are to
        serve as the source of positive voltage applied to the
        accelerator grids (66) of said unit pentode arrays, and such
        Field Voltage Control System is designed to directly accept this
        voltage for that purpose. The Field Induction and Voltage
        Control Systems will be discussed further in sections to follow.
      </p>
      <p><b>Zone Sector Construction</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now generally to FIGS. 3 and 4, one major goal in
        dividing each of the two hull positive zones or sections (5)
        which jointly comprise the Generator's Field Hub into a large
        number of radial sectors (42) in electrical parallel is to limit
        the external field current reaching each particular power
        resistor and unit pentode array combination to a fairly uniform
        level, while somewhat reducing field current return eddy losses
        as well. However, each radial sector (42) is thereby also given
        the capability of effecting a local thrust production
        differential (in propulsive three-stage rotor devices), by
        virtue of its electrical isolation, as it is then possible to
        vary the local resistance presented to the electrodynamic field
        with respect to any given radial sector so that a substantial
        measure of navigational control in the z-axis may thus be
        achieved by varying the proportional field current conducted by
        that sector. </p>
      <p>Because the inherent resistance of each such sector itself will
        be negligible even at an extremely elevated operating
        temperature, in part due to the very low temperature coefficient
        of resistivity of the proposed steel hull plate material, the
        voltage drop across the radial length of each sector will also
        be negligible. Thus, the determination of an appropriate sector
        thickness becomes an entirely structural consideration. A
        secondary design goal with respect to zone sectorization is
        therefore to select a uniform cross-sectional area for the
        radial zone sectors (42) which yields a Field Hub total
        conduction mass approaching that of the device's rotor segments
        (14). </p>
      <p>The hull plating which forms each positive zone (or section
        (5)) of the Generator's Field Hub should preferably be composed
        of stainless steel or a refractory metal, and divided into
        thirty-six equal-area radial zone sectors (42) of truncated
        wedge shape and a circular center zone sector (44). As stated
        earlier, in the single-stage Generator embodiment these two
        center zone sectors must be of a nonconductive material or
        construction, and should also comprise approximately 4 to 5% of
        the total area of their respective zones to allow the connection
        of the exchange or main service manifolds described above. In
        the three-stage embodiment such center sectors (44) must instead
        be conductive as just prescribed for the radial zone sectors
        (42), and should each comprise about 1% of the said zone area.
        Each such positive radial sector should be formed of a single
        piece of the hull plating material in such a manner that its
        cross-sectional area in the direction of its radial length is
        maintained at a very uniform value. </p>
      <p>The uniform thickness of each center zone sector (44) should be
        equal to that of the radial sectors as measured at the minor
        (inner) arc width thereof, and the radial sectors must be
        insulated from the respective center sector where they meet that
        center sector's periphery (except in single-stage rotor
        devices). A suitable thin ceramic insulating partition (43) may
        therefore be installed between each adjacent pair of radial zone
        sectors (42), and around each center sector (44) in three-stage
        devices, and the uniform flat thickness of these sector
        insulators should in general be minimized. </p>
      <p>In three-stage devices, four radial sectors (42) of each
        positive housing zone which correspond to cardinal points
        separated by 90 degrees of the hull's circumference, and which
        divide the Field Hub into four equal quadrants (as indicated
        with phantom lines in FIG. 4), should be connected in parallel
        with the center sector of that positive zone at the maximum
        positive voltage end of those four sectors' respective power
        resistors (63). </p>
      <p>The parallel resistance of the four conductors which therefore
        connect each center zone sector (44) (in three-stage devices) to
        its respective network of power resistors should then be such
        that that sector's per unit surface area level of field current
        conduction is slightly higher on the average than that of its
        adjacent radial sectors (42), under uniform zero-signal field
        bias conditions as hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>The four unit pentode arrays (69) of each primary induction
        ring array which correspond to the power resistors so-connected
        to that primary array's center zone sector (44) would generally
        not be utilized individually in the active field current bias
        modulation related to the production of local thrust
        differentials (in three-stage rotor devices), being instead
        reserved primarily for potential involvement in signal
        communications transmission and/or reception activities. </p>
      <p><b>Power Resistors</b> </p>
      <p>As best seen in FIG. 1, the cathode element (64) of each
        plane-parallel electrode system or unit pentode array which is
        used to link the rotor assembly with a positive housing
        collector section or radial zone sector (42) is electrically
        connected to such positive section or sector by means of a
        ceramic resistor block (63), of a certain low dielectric
        constant and high volume resistivity, which becomes a poor but
        effective conductor at the elevated operating voltage and
        temperature of such housing collector sections and which ensures
        an adequate external field current voltage drop between such
        section or sector (42) and said cathode element (64) (which is
        chassis-grounded as shown in FIG. 10). </p>
      <p>Referring still to FIG. 1, each said ceramic resistor block or
        "power resistor" (63) is to be entirely jacketed by a hollow
        ceramic thermal conduit (48), including a dielectric buffer (45)
        composed of a ferroelectric material having a certain high
        dielectric constant and very high volume resistivity which does
        not become a conductor even at the elevated operating voltage
        and temperature levels of said power resistors. These thermal
        conduits (48) mechanically connect the power resistors to a
        flattened inner surface of such positive hull section or radial
        sector (42) and a form of very-high-temperature heat transfer
        fluid such as liquid sodium may be circulated therein so that
        the proper resistor temperature is maintained to ensure an
        optimum cathode potential with respect to ground. </p>
      <p>A suitable manifolding, pump, and heat exchanger system (not
        shown) may be used to extract or transfer an extremely high
        level of recoverable thermal energy from the power resistors
        (63), arising from the field current voltage drop associated
        therewith, by means of such primary heat transfer fluid
        circulated through the thermal conduit cores (49) in the manner
        normally associated with nuclear power plants. Similarly, the
        rate at which such primary hull coolant is circulated may be
        used to directly regulate and limit the external field current
        to a value within the safe ampacity of the rotor assembly. </p>
      <p>It is important to point out that each of the Generator's power
        resistors (63) and its associated dielectric buffer (45) and
        primary thermal conduit (48) may be designed, as an assembly, to
        incorporate a fixed positive reduced-voltage tap (not shown),
        whereby a main source of onboard or output DC or AC electrical
        power may be provided either for or from the Generator within a
        limited-duty circuit which is grounded directly to the primary
        cathodes. Provisions should and may also be provided for
        biasing, damping, and/or inductively coupling any primary
        conduit connecting sections, to control or harness electromotive
        currents induced in the highly-conductive primary coolant.
        Onboard electrical resistive heating means should and may be
        incorporated for purposes of pre-heating the primary coolant
        and, in turn, the power resistors and dielectric buffers. </p>
      <p>Referring briefly to FIG. 11, it is also important to note that
        the Generator's power resistors must be in a conductive state
        before the housing potential difference reaches breakdown field
        intensity, as figured along a minimum semicircular arc
        trajectory (142) across the hull neutral sections (4), and the
        flow of field discharge current commences. Therefore, the actual
        maximum dielectric constant of the resistor material used in
        very-high-voltage single-stage rotor devices, and in
        ultra-high-voltage three-stage rotor devices as well, may be
        calculated at about k=11. </p>
      <p>As is best seen in FIG. 14, the recovery thermal conduits (79)
        of the secondary hull coolant system which assist in supporting
        the entire tapered peripheral portion of the housing must pass
        inboard between the power resistor assemblies referred to above,
        and therefore the resistors (63) must assume a complex tapered
        shape to provide the necessary clearance. As generally depicted
        in FIGS. 1 and 2, they will have a trapezoidal cross section at
        the `top` or outward-facing end (with radial length somewhat
        greater than minor circumferential width) and a rectangular
        cross section at the bottom or cathode end (with circumferential
        width much greater than radial length). In this regard, their
        engineered shape should still maintain a uniform conduction
        cross section exactly analogous to that of the preferred
        positive zone sector construction described above. </p>
      <p><b>Dielectric Buffers</b> </p>
      <p>Referring once again to FIG. 1, it is imperative to
        electrically insulate the power resistors (63)--due to the
        extreme voltage drop that will occur across them in
        operation--to prevent direct discharge to other nearby
        structural components from taking place. However, not only is
        this a problem due to the thickness of insulation which would be
        required at any `ordinary` dielectric value, but the power
        resistors' projected operating temperature range of 600 to
        700+.degree. C. completely precludes the use of almost all known
        dielectrics. Fortunately, the search for high-temperature
        dielectrics for use in aerospace electronics applications
        (particularly multi-layer capacitors) has resulted in the
        development of a small number of exotic materials potentially
        suitable for use as a space charge buffer (156) or dielectric
        encapsulant (45) for the Generator's power resistors (63). </p>
      <p>In the application contemplated herein, the volume resistivity
        of the resistor encapsulant is somewhat secondary to its
        dielectric constant k at high temperature, because no opposing
        contact voltage is present (as in a capacitor) to encourage
        circuit conduction losses within the material. Therefore, the
        prime consideration is the dielectric's ability to exhibit a
        very large k value at over 600.degree. C. This places the
        material squarely in the realm of a very small select group of
        Class III high transition temperature ferroelectrics. These
        materials, such as Tantalum-modified Lanthanum Titanate and Lead
        Ytterbium Tantalate, do not begin to demonstrate significant
        dielectric strength at less than 300 to 450.degree. C. One such
        compound, Sodium Bismuth Titanate (Na.sub.0.5 Bi.sub.4.5
        Ti.sub.4 O.sub.15), actually exhibits an amazing peak k value of
        about 3100 near the middle of the said power resistor operating
        temperature range: at 655.degree. C. (1,202.degree. F.). This
        would seem to indicate that this compound is eminently suited
        for use in forming the necessary rotor space charge buffer
        pieces (156) and/or resistor dielectric buffers (45) in this
        application. </p>
      <p>It should be stressed that great care in quality control must
        be exercised in formulating and sintering this or any similar
        such special compound during manufacture of the dielectric
        buffer pieces. An absolute minimum of impurities must be
        assured, the density of the constituent powder maximized, and
        each piece finally certified as being free of the smallest
        physical defect prior to use in order to attain the desired
        operating performance. It is also hoped that these crucial
        components may each be compaction die formed and sintered
        simultaneously with a respective power resistor (63), and
        perhaps even with the corresponding primary thermal conduit (48)
        as well. </p>
      <p>The core (49) of the thermal conduit associated with each power
        resistor (63) should be constructed of a refractory metal or
        alloy tubing (such as molybdenum) which is jacketed with
        high-purity Alumina or a comparable material formed directly
        thereupon. Thus, each such primary thermal conduit becomes an
        extremely strong structural member which may also be used to
        support the stationary electrodes of the corresponding unit
        pentode array, while circulating the preferred liquid sodium
        heat transfer fluid or coolant around the outward faces of that
        power resistor to recover or remove its excess heat. </p>
      <p>Each power resistor (63), its dielectric buffer (45), and
        associated primary thermal conduit (48) together comprise one
        power resistor assembly, and each such assembly in combination
        with its corresponding unit pentode array is considered for
        present purposes as forming the constituent component group of
        which the primary induction ring arrays and Field Induction
        System are comprised. </p>
      <p>Extensive calculations reveal that a suitable power resistor
        material in most sizes of the single-stage embodiment of the
        Generator would be a ceramic material with the chemical formula
        Mgo.SiO.sub.2, which is available from CeramTec NA as CeramTec
        designation Steatite 357. A suitable power resistor material in
        most sizes of the preferred three-stage embodiment of the
        Generator would be a somewhat different ceramic material with
        the chemical formula 2MgO.2Al.sub.2 O.sub.3.5SiO.sub.2, which is
        available from CeramTec NA as CeramTec designation Cordierite
        547. </p>
      <p><b>Overall Description of the Field Induction System Circuit</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before an overview of the EDF Generator's Field Induction
        System electrical circuit is presented, a somewhat comprehensive
        examination of the nature of the housing or hull configuration
        should be made, as in this application the hull itself is an
        active part of that circuit. Its electrostatic characteristics
        as a function of such configuration will therefore have a
        fundamental influence upon the nature of the external field
        envelope discharge current itself. </p>
      <p><b>Hull Design</b> </p>
      <p>The derivation of the Generator's design hull configuration, as
        best seen in FIG. 3, comprises a long and complicated story.
        This should not be taken to imply that the final and rather
        exacting composite shape selected is the only one that `works`
        properly. It merely reflects the preferred embodiment of the
        inventor's conceptualization of a fundamentally mechanical
        device which happens to entail both tremendous electrical
        complexity and inspiring aeronautical implications. </p>
      <p>Should the proposed vessel eventually be used to explore the
        possibility of transcending the time/light barrier, extremely
        precise calculations regarding its spatial displacement and
        charge/mass ratio will no doubt become necessary. Therefore, one
        of the principal reasons for the chosen hull design is that the
        total vessel displacement may readily be calculated using
        traditional formulas from analytic geometry for the volumes of
        the two truncated right conic sections and two one-base spheric
        zones, and the volume of the remaining cylindrical central
        chamber region. </p>
      <p>Using just these formulas, a vessel hull configuration has
        therefore been developed which may be linearly expanded (as a
        scalar function of the hull radius) to virtually any size with
        no significant loss of accuracy. The Table of Dimensions which
        follows and the attendant schematic hull diagram of FIG. 3, upon
        which all of the subsequent Detailed Calculations quoted are
        based, illustrates the application of this design technique to a
        theoretical vessel hull only 48" in diameter. It must be
        emphasized that the construction of an Electrodynamic Field
        Generator this small might not prove entirely practical in
        reality, due strictly to mechanical limitations, and the
        inventor believes this prototype model to be in fact the
        smallest such machine that could be built. This original hull
        size was deliberately selected, however, to encourage the
        development of the maximum possible accuracy with respect to
        contingent specifications for the relative size and positioning
        of the Generator's principal components, prior to the actual
        construction of larger machines. </p>
      <p>The surface areas of the negative (3) and positive (5) hull
        sections are set equal to each other, and for two very important
        reasons: [i] to give the vessel hull a significant theoretical
        capacitance (despite its unusual geometry); and [ii] to render
        the two "driving" or discharge current portions of the field
        envelope uniform in cross section. Essential considerations
        which are related to these fundamental design criteria are best
        expressed in the following electrostatic formula for uniform
        field intensity in a DC capacitor which exhibits a continuous
        leakage current: </p>
      <p>where V = equilibrium potential difference in volts, </p>
      <p>.sigma. = average surface charge density of one plate, </p>
      <p>d = plate separation in meters, </p>
      <p>.epsilon..sub.o = universal electrostatic constant, </p>
      <p>and E = uniform field intensity in volts/meter. </p>
      <p>This equation plays an important supporting role in the
        invention's Method of Operation, as previously discussed in that
        section above. </p>
      <p>The volumes of the peripheral right conic sections of hull
        volume surrounding the Field Hub and and those of the one-base
        spheric zones comprising the Field Hub itself are also set equal
        in a preferred embodiment, as this criterion is postulated to
        promote both the structural integrity of the hull in any attempt
        to breach light speed (and establish a stable Kerr metric space
        warp about the vessel) as well as the gravimetric stability of
        the central chamber/cabin area in light of the relativistic mass
        effects involved while doing so. </p>
      <p>As the case may be, to achieve this equal-area/equal-volume
        design, it was found necessary to employ two crucial
        interrelated constants (in addition to the ratio 1/5 used to
        radially "step off" the hull's interior space): the Hull Area
        Constant and the Polar Hull Constant. The Area Constant is (as
        the name implies) necessary to achieve the equal-area part of
        the overall design solution, and merely dictates the small
        deviation of the neutral (4) and negative (3) housing sections'
        ring radii from the stated preferred design increment of the
        hull's radial width. </p>
      <p>The other requisite design factor, the Polar Hull Constant, is
        much more complex in nature. This value specifies the maximum
        height of the spheric hull zones (5) as a function of their
        arc-shape, and the corresponding contingent Polar Volume
        Differential is absolutely essential to achieving the
        equal-volume aspect of the preferred design. It is important to
        note that certain allowances must be made in practice for a
        finite but electrically-significant peripheral edge `thickness`
        (and therefore surface area) at the equator of the device's
        negative housing Emitter Ring (47), but will in general only
        minimally modify the "pure" design-model values obtained using
        the mathematical formulas given in the Table of Dimensions to
        follow. </p>
      <p><b>Hull Configuration</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the exterior housing or hull
        (1) is designed specifically to have a circular disc shape the
        thickness of which along the vertical axis of symmetry (that
        also constitutes the rotor's axis of rotation) is relatively
        minor as compared to the diameter along its radial centerline
        plane, and which tapers gently from a maximum thickness along
        such vertical centerline to a very minor thickness at the radial
        periphery (47) of the housing. </p>
      <p>The tapered disc shape of the hull is postulated to promote the
        formation and maintenance of a stable bihemitoroidal corona or
        arc discharge field based upon certain empirical principles of
        electrostatics and upon laboratory experiments performed by the
        inventor involving concentric circular electrodes. Such an
        electrodynamic field may be characterized electrostatically in
        this application by an axial positive polar electric field
        contiguous with a biplanar negative electric field, with each
        field of one given polarity tending strongly to become oriented
        parallel to a field of opposite respective polarity but similar
        intensity. </p>
      <p>The exterior housing or hull (1) is therefore divided into two
        axially-central positive electron collector sections (5), as
        well as: [i] either a single radially-peripheral negative
        electron emitter ring (47) which is biplanar in cross section or
        two or more such ring sections (3) which are uniplanar in cross
        section having separate planar orientations; and [ii] two
        dielectric neutral sections (4) which are interposed between
        said positive and negative sections such that each such section
        of a given polarity is spatially separated from each section of
        the opposite respective polarity. </p>
      <p>The total external surface area of the housing's negative
        Emitter Ring (47) or sections (3) is essentially equal to that
        of the positive collector housing sections (5) or zones, such
        that the overall housing configuration thereby acquires a
        significant theoretical static capacitance by design as
        intended. An estimated base value for such hull capacitance `C`
        may be obtained by applying the surface area `A` of the hull's
        two sets of "plates", as figured using the formulas in the Table
        of Dimensions below, to the standard formula for parallel-plate
        capacitance (C=.epsilon..sub.o A/d). When plate separation `d`
        is taken to be the simple average of the longest (141) and
        shortest (142) purely-semicircular arc current trajectories
        across the hull, as depicted in FIG. 11, this estimate of hull
        capacitance is approximately 13 to 14 mmf for an EDF Generator
        48" in diameter. </p>
      <p><b>Field Composition</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 11, the external discharge current once
        initiated may be expanded as a function of the operative field
        voltage to fill two hemitoroidal spatial volumes of rotation
        (140) whose outer perimeters (141) are defined by a semicircular
        electron arc trajectory across the full housing radius in a
        plane perpendicular to the housing surface, or from the
        outermost point on the negative periphery thereof to the
        respective positive centerpoint of the housing lying on the
        vertical centerline thereof, and whose inner boundaries (142)
        are defined by a similar such trajectory across the hull's
        neutral ring or sections (4) from any innermost point on the
        negative periphery to the closest point thereto lying on the
        respective positive collector section (5). </p>
      <p>The physical volume (140) of the external discharge current as
        described has a uniform cross-sectional area in the radial
        direction of electron conduction which corresponds to any such
        semicircular arc trajectories between points on the housing's
        negative Emitter Ring (47) and the respective positive collector
        housing sections (5) and therefore, by the definition of a
        conductor, such discharge current must assume a uniform current
        density. While very difficult to effectively describe in verbal
        terms, the idealized mathematical configuration of the
        Generator's heat- and thrust-producing field envelope region (as
        a function of its housing geometry) is visually easy to grasp
        and is clearly illustrated in FIG. 11. </p>
      <p>As indicated in FIGS. 12 and 13, stationary electromagnetic
        armatures (37) are uniformly distributed into two circular
        arrays (145) containing equal numbers thereof which are
        positioned on opposite sides of the rotor from one another, and
        which are each located concentric to the rotor's axis of
        rotation midway between the negative Emitter Ring (47) and
        positive housing sections (5). These armature arrays (145) may
        be employed as two separate groups to impart a holistic but
        attenuating rotational magnetic vector moment upon the external
        discharge current, reaching through the thin neutral sections
        (4) of the housing, and thus may be used to modulate the field
        envelope's kinetic and electrical characteristics in a variety
        of ways useful to the invention and its objects. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 12 and 13 also show the electric field vectors (143) as
        described above, and magnetic field vectors (144) as produced
        and modulated by the armatures (37) comprising the two armature
        or variable inductor arrays (145). FIG. 13 specifically depicts
        the regular lateral bending or displacement of the
        radially-impinging electron trajectories (143), under the
        influence of the inductor arrays (145), which is postulated to
        have a unitizing effect on the driving portions (140) of the
        field envelope. </p>
      <p>It can therefore be seen that the device contemplated herein
        may be operated in such a manner that its external breakdown
        discharge current field achieves a uniform conductive cross
        section and current density, as well as a holistic and orderly
        rotational aspect which subsequently acts to assist in rendering
        such current quasi-coherent. And thus, for purposes of this
        device and its applications, such a discharge current field
        should be thought of as a special qualified type and form of DC
        corona or arc discharge--having significant propulsive potential
        (to be further examined)--which then merits technical
        description as an electrodynamic field. </p>
      <p>In this respect, it may for now be emphasized that a useful
        level of electrically-developed thrust may be realized from the
        relativistic impulse of the electrodynamic field current
        electrons incident upon the positive collector housing sections
        and, postulating the operation of the device in the vacuum of
        space (with a physical field current volume as described), the
        impulse velocity of such incident field electrons may be raised
        to as high as 99.99% of the speed of light and more with the
        corresponding relativistic mass thereof then equal to 69 times
        their rest mass or indeed much more. </p>
      <p><b>Primary Voltage Expansion Ratio</b> </p>
      <p>In keeping with the logic presented at the opening of the Field
        Induction System section above, the primary array voltage will
        tend to equal only one-half (1/2) of the DC voltage expressed
        across the rotor segments (or "rotor voltage"). Therefore, to
        develop an extraordinary multi-megavolt `secondary` or field
        voltage across the Generator's housing of the type just
        described, the primary array cathodes' electron emissivity
        (expressed as a certain factor) must exceed that of the rotor
        field emitters by a ratio which is at least as large as the
        ratio of the desired field voltage to half the observed said
        rotor voltage. The latter such ratio is then thought of as the
        primary voltage expansion ratio in this application, as outlined
        in the Method of Operation section hereinabove. </p>
      <p>A difference in the instantaneous rate at which these two said
        sets of parts will tend to discharge under the impetus of a
        given equivalent voltage or potential difference is thereby
        created. This instantaneous charge differential enables the
        primary cathodes to strip native electrons from the positive
        housing sections (5) thousands of times faster than such charge
        can reach the negative emitter housing sections (3) from the
        rotor field emitters. Thus, an instantaneous charge differential
        is perhaps best described as a cumulative charge imbalance that
        is known to operate (under certain conditions) in capacitive
        and/or thermoelectric circuit arrangements and to express itself
        as an elevation of the applied voltage or potential difference
        therein. </p>
      <p>To actually achieve and support such a condition requires the
        use of two housing charge ballast capacitors whose negative
        `plate` elements or rings are affixed directly to the rotor
        segments (about their outer perimeter) and which are immediately
        able to store an amount of such charge that is sufficient to
        produce equilibrium collector surface charge densities resulting
        in the desired field voltage. This average required housing
        charge density is calculated using the traditional formula given
        in the Hull Design section above. </p>
      <p>The voltage applied to the positive rings of these ballast
        capacitors is taken from the rotor's outer field coil anode ring
        connections and therefore represents a large portion of the
        Primary Power System's generated field winding voltage. It
        should be noted that this voltage must actually be passed to
        such capacitors beneath the rotor ballrace assemblies in the
        form of recessed conductive traces on one or more of the segment
        separators. This same technique must also be employed to connect
        electrical elements of the Primary Power System lying outboard
        of the variable inductor arrays (145) with corresponding
        elements lying inboard thereof. </p>
      <p>In any event, these crucial ballast capacitors are therefore
        properly thought of as belonging to both the Primary Power
        System and Field Induction System circuits. They provide the
        necessary electric force means by which a given primary voltage
        expansion ratio (as defined) may be supported and realized using
        the engineered instantaneous charge differential concept
        described. Because of the complexity of this aspect of the
        Generator's operation, the specific example below will
        illustrate the relevant principles using the respective
        temperature emissivity factors of the chosen field emitter and
        primary cathode materials with respect to the aforementioned
        4ft. prototype model. </p>
      <p>This temperature emissivity factor, e.sup.-.phi./kT, where `e`
        is the base of natural logarithms 2.71828 . . . , `k` is
        Boltzman's constant, and `T` is the absolute temperature in
        .sup.o K, derives from the famous Richardson-Dushman equation: a
        formula for the correct thermionic emission current density `J`
        of a clean metal cathode in vacuum having surface work function
        .phi.. And, expressed in mathematical terms, the principle of
        ratio equivalence defined above may be stated as follows: </p>
      <p>Using field emitters of sintered 0.68/0.32 tungsten/copper
        composite and thorium-adsorbed tungsten primary cathodes, a 4
        ft. diameter three-stage-rotor prototype unit of the invention's
        design would achieve a primary voltage expansion ratio equal to
        about 12,106 given a field emitter .phi.=4.408 eV and primary
        cathodes of .phi.=3.639 eV with both component sets at a
        temperature of 948.degree. K (or 675.degree. C.) as figured per
        the above equation. The field voltage expressing this ratio is
        verified in the Detailed Calculations hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that this equation can readily be
        solved for the required primary cathode .phi. where the
        projected mean operating temperature of the primary cathodes is
        given (as it would be in operation), and where the field
        emitters' .phi. is also fixed and known but their actual
        operating temperature within a range of possible values must be
        experimentally or theoretically obtained. </p>
      <p>The external breakdown discharge current once initiated and
        sustained in this manner is generally limited only by the
        engineered design characteristics of the unit pentode arrays
        which comprise the Field Induction System. In particular, the
        negative DC bias voltage applied to the unit pentode array
        control grids (65) must be sufficient to limit the total primary
        induction ring array current to a value within the safe
        operating ampacity of the rotor. For purposes of this text, the
        term "full-power" as used in relation to the Primary Power
        System and its incorporating device shall be taken to indicate a
        corresponding rotor speed wherein a full nominal field envelope
        voltage is achieved, maintained, or exceeded. Such an
        operational state is depicted in FIGS. 11, 12, and 13. </p>
      <p><b>Field Current Bias</b> </p>
      <p>In a simple single-stage rotor embodiment of the Generator used
        as a "Thermal Power Unit", no active biasing of the current in
        either of the two current-carrying portions (140) of the field
        envelope (which are otherwise symmetrical) need take place at
        the primary arrays, and the current comprising each such driving
        portion of the field is essentially equal. In the preferred
        three-stage rotor embodiment intended for propulsive units, the
        field current is actively biased or proportionally shunted by
        the primary arrays between such field envelope portions (140) to
        render the impulse thrust developed thereby mutually
        non-isometric along the Generator's vertical centerline. Several
        important considerations directly related thereto are discussed
        below, and reference should generally be made to FIG. 7 in this
        section. </p>
      <p>The Generator's maximum full-power total field current must be
        equal to the rated DC parallel ampacity of the rotor segments,
        as figured using traditional methods. An operational minimum
        full-power field current in any propulsive three-stage rotor
        device used as an "Impulse Drive Unit" should then be considered
        as equal to either one-half (1/2) of the so-rated rotor ampacity
        or a level of total rotor current sufficient to allow the
        Generator to produce a net vertical thrust equal to its own
        weight, whichever is the lesser. </p>
      <p>Given the minimum engineered amplification factor of the unit
        pentode arrays (69) earlier stated, this minimum full-power
        field current may in all likelihood be maintained with an
        average value of primary array negative bias voltage (as applied
        to the stationary control grids (65) shown in FIG. 7) which is
        less than or equal to about one-half (1/2) of its specified
        design-maximum value. If no unidirectional or alternating
        voltage component of the Field Induction System current is
        present, this said average negative bias voltage value
        constitutes the primary arrays' "zero-signal" bias voltage and
        the primary arrays may be said to be in a zero-signal field bias
        condition (as mentioned earlier hereinabove). </p>
      <p>Each of the two said driving portions (140) of the Generator's
        field envelope may be referred to as a "field hemitorus" because
        of its postulated shape, and the maximum individual field
        hemitorus current at any given value of operating rotor current
        should at all times be limited to a level which is less than or
        equal to two-thirds (2/3) of that operating rotor current. Peak
        net field thrust will then equal one-third the total isometric
        thrust. Assuming the said given amplification factor, this
        maximum advisable hemitorus level of proportional total field
        current may in all likelihood be maintained with an average
        value of negative bias voltage applied to the corresponding
        primary array's control grids (65) which is equal to
        approximately one-third (1/3) of its specified design-maximum
        value (or less proportionally at a rotor current level which is
        less than rated ampacity). </p>
      <p>Due to the lag time in heating either of the two power resistor
        (63) networks through which an increasing field hemitorus
        current must return, the negative bias voltage applied to the
        corresponding primary array's control grids (65) may be briefly
        reduced to as little as one-sixth (1/6) of its specified
        design-maximum value (as a standard minimum operating control
        grid voltage) or less proportionally at a rotor current level
        which is less than rated ampacity. </p>
      <p>The minimum individual field hemitorus current at any given
        value of operating rotor current should at all times be
        maintained at a level equal to or greater than one-third (1/3)
        of that operating rotor current. Assuming the said given
        amplification factor, this minimum advisable hemitorus level of
        proportional total field current may in all likelihood be
        maintained with an average value of negative bias voltage
        applied to the corresponding primary array's control grids (65)
        which is equal to approximately two-thirds (2/3) of its
        specified design-maximum value (or less proportionally at a
        rotor current level which is less than rated ampacity). </p>
      <p>Due to the lag time in cooling either of the two power resistor
        (63) networks through which a decreasing field hemitorus current
        must return, the negative bias voltage applied to the
        corresponding primary array's control grids (65) may be briefly
        increased to as much as five-sixths (5/6) of its specified
        design-maximum value (as a standard maximum operating control
        grid voltage) or less proportionally at a rotor current level
        which is less than rated ampacity. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that the current passed by the unit
        pentode arrays (69) will depend to a great degree on the
        accelerator grid (66) voltage rather than on the overall primary
        array potential difference, just as in any standard vacuum tube
        which employs a screen or accelerator grid whose positive
        voltage is less than the applied plate voltage. It therefore
        becomes evident that this positive grid (66) voltage may also be
        modulated in a manner similar to the negative control grid (65)
        voltage. This type of `duplex` signal-handling or control
        voltage response capability allows the unit pentode arrays (of
        either primary induction ring array) to amplify a resonant
        frequency communications signal while simultaneously controlling
        an independent level of current-contingent thrust. </p>
      <p>In any event, it can be seen here in light of the Law of
        Conservation of Momentum that a sizeable force of thrust will be
        developed by each field hemitorus (140) from the relativistic
        impulse of its constituent electrons incident upon the collector
        housing sections (5), and that suitable means have been provided
        for rendering such mutually-opposed y-axis thrust vectors
        variably non-isometric. </p>
      <p>A less obvious but very important distinction which should be
        made in regard to the EDF Generator's production of such
        electrically-developed thrust is certainly this: it is not
        necessary that the Generator or in particular its positive hull
        sections (5) (or Field Hub) provide the work required to move
        the field current charge against the field potential gradient.
        Per classical electric field theory, the work may be done by the
        charge itself in being repelled along the potential gradient. In
        the first case, work is `performed` and in the second it is
        `recovered`. Furthermore, it can be shown mathematically in
        light of the preceding distinction that any net recoil force
        experienced by the negative hull Emitter Ring (47) is strictly
        Newtonian in nature, compared to the relativistic impulse thrust
        produced at the Field Hub, and that the peak value of such
        recoil would amount to no more than about 3/1,000 of one percent
        of the peak net value of the said thrust. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the Electrodynamic Field Generator's input rotary
        torque drive means will provide the work-energy required to
        establish and maintain the rotor's rotation and the resultant
        field potential gradient that is induced in the manner
        described, and the electron charge comprising field hemitorus
        current will then do the work required to effect its passage
        toward the positive Field Hub. The resulting collisions are
        almost completely inelastic, so momentum and kinetic energy are
        conserved independently, and the field current's gained kinetic
        energy is recovered almost entirely as heat. </p>
      <p><b>Field Voltage Control System</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it can also be seen that the interactive factors
        or features which result in the EDF Generator's exhibited field
        voltage as a function of its rotor voltage are much more
        complicated in nature than the simple turns ratio which defines
        an AC transformer's secondary voltage in terms of its primary
        voltage. And because of the extremely high primary voltage
        expansion ratios which will be operative in large devices, small
        fluctuations in the Generator's stationary primary array
        electrode voltages can conceivably cause very large and
        undesirable fluctuations in the exhibited field voltage.
        Therefore, a relatively simple but effective Field Voltage
        Control System is provided which may be used to monitor,
        regulate, and adjust all individual primary cathode and grid
        voltages to optimum specified and/or interim operating values
        such that rotor ampacity is not exceeded, and this system
        anticipates the use of an associated onboard computer system (to
        render its various interactive functions automatic). </p>
      <p>The embodiment of such a control system as shown in FIG. 10 is
        intended merely to provide a logical circuit model which is
        illustrative of the principles of the invention, and of certain
        principles of appropriate circuit resolution which should be
        applied within such a system in light of the following aspects
        of its teaching, and not to preclude the use of other possible
        embodiments of such control system circuitry. </p>
      <p>The cathode elements (64) of each plane-parallel electrode
        system or unit pentode array (used to link the rotor assembly to
        the positive housing sections) are to have a surface work
        function .phi. which is significantly lower and/or an operating
        temperature which is significantly higher than that of the rotor
        field emitters (17), and will therefore tend to exhibit a
        comparatively much-higher electron emissivity, such that the
        ratio of their respective temperature emissivity factors (which
        are each represented by e.sup.-.phi./kT) has a very determinate
        effect upon the respective exhibited ratio of the device's
        external discharge field voltage to the primary DC voltage
        generated internally. </p>
      <p>Referring to FIG. 10, these primary array cathodes (64) must be
        composed of tungsten or another refractory metal which may also
        be either impregnated with thorium oxide or thorium metal
        submonolayer-adsorbed to achieve such lowered comparative
        surface work function, and, to calibrate their emissivity
        relative to that of the rotor field emitters (17) as a means of
        defining and determining the device's external field voltage
        relative to its primary array potential difference (or half the
        rotor voltage). </p>
      <p>The Field Voltage Control System as shown is basically designed
        to directly accept the rather high positive induced voltage of
        the stationary anode rings (58) (shown in FIGS. 8 and 9) for the
        purpose of providing the primary accelerator grids (66) with
        their standard DC operating voltage. Due to the linear
        scalability of the Generator's overall design, the nominal (or
        zero-signal) value of such voltage relative to chassis ground
        (10) is expected to be approximately +362 to +483 volts per foot
        of hull diameter in three-stage and single-stage Generator
        embodiments (respectively). An isolation diode (126) and switch
        or relay (124) prevent such positive voltage from being
        neutralized by negative current(s) elsewhere in the control
        circuit. </p>
      <p>Any one or more of the stationary electrode elements (64)-(67)
        comprising each said unit pentode array may be artificially
        cooled, as a means of further regulating the device's external
        field voltage, and/or subjected to modest variable DC control
        voltages at times to further assist in the interim adjustment of
        that unit pentode array's current. </p>
      <p>A very high value capacitor (116) or a plurality of separate
        high value capacitors connected into a parallel or
        series-parallel matrix thereof may be employed to store the
        displacement charge caused within the Primary Power System by
        the charging of the rotor-mounted ballast capacitors, as part of
        such Field Voltage Control System. Said displacement charge
        holding capacitor(s) (116) may hereinafter be referred to as
        "ballast compensating capacitor(s)". </p>
      <p>A very high value capacitor (117) or similar such capacitor
        matrix may also be employed to prevent the grounding of positive
        housing section potential by ambient ionization charge, from
        operation in air during the device's start-up period before such
        sections are fully enclosed (by the external field hemitorus
        currents), as a further part of this Field Voltage Control
        System. Such bulk electron storage capacitor(s) (117) may
        hereinafter be referred to as "ambient charge capacitor(s)". </p>
      <p>The negative plates of these ambient charge capacitors are to
        be isolated from ground during rotor spin-up, in order to effect
        a net negative charge storage, and so their positive plate
        charge is supplied by a dedicated common variable DC voltage
        supply (98) which is oppositely connected to the ground frame.
        Each ambient charge capacitor (117) employed during the device's
        start-up period may be selectively switch- or relay-connected by
        its negative terminal to an accelerator grid element (66) of one
        or more of said plane-parallel electrode systems, in order to
        effect and control the storage of such ionization charge. Each
        such start-up capacitor (117) may also be selectively switch- or
        relay-connected by its negative terminal via a variable resistor
        and/or diode to a suppressor grid element (67) of one or more of
        said plane-parallel electrode systems, in order to effect and
        control the distribution of onboard stored negative charge
        reserves from the suppressor grid(s) (67) to the rotor, as a
        standard means of regulating the external field voltage
        (especially in the vacuum of space). </p>
      <p>Said ambient charge capacitor(s) (117) may also be similarly
        connected by the negative terminal(s) thereof either to a
        separate source of true earth ground or to one or more
        superconductive current storage ring/s (200) (including charge
        deposition and retrieval means), for purposes of removing any
        excess ambient electron charge above the bulk storage capability
        of such capacitor or capacitor matrix which may be produced from
        normal or full-power operation in air--or other gaseous
        dielectric media. </p>
      <p>Such superconductive current storage ring(s) would be used
        exclusively in large three-stage rotor propulsive models of the
        Generator, and thus constitute/s the means by which further
        expendable onboard charge reserves may be accumulated. The
        working core of each superconductive storage ring would
        preferably be a large but relatively thin torus (of small cross
        section) composed of solid mercury metal immersed in liquid
        helium, and as such would have a known ampacity measured in the
        hundreds of thousands of amps. </p>
      <p>A linearly-actuated control rod (103) or similar mechanism may
        be used to effect a mechanically variable thermal junction
        between each primary array cathode or grid element (64)-(67) and
        a cold thermal mass of the same or similar refractory metal,
        maintained at the reservoir temperature of a secondary cryogenic
        housing coolant such as liquid air or nitrogen. The plate
        elements and dielectric media of each capacitor or capacitor
        matrix employed in the Field Voltage Control System could also
        be incorporated (in a suitable manner) into the coolant vessel
        which contains said cold thermal mass. This System's diodes
        would generally not be rated for mounting at such a low
        temperature. </p>
      <p>The voltage control circuit shown in FIG. 10 is modular in
        nature, in that one such unit is provided for each of the 72
        unit pentode arrays associated with the Field Induction System
        (in the preferred embodiment). All measurements of primary
        electrode voltage(s), and of positive housing section voltage,
        are to be made with respect to the Generator's ground frame (10)
        (as generally depicted in FIG. 1): the metallic structural shell
        of the device's central chamber to which the rotor carrier
        assembly drive motor(s) should be mounted. This grounding method
        is referred to throughout as "chassis ground". </p>
      <p>One thermal control rod (103) is provided for each primary
        cathode and grid element (64)-(67) which variably engages both a
        control rod socket (104) attached thereto and a thermal junction
        (101), which is attached to a cold thermal mass (102) maintained
        at the reservoir temperature of the secondary (cryogenic)
        housing coolant, by means of a linear actuator (not shown). Such
        control rod (103) may then be used to regulate that electrode's
        temperature to approximately the same temperature as the
        associated power resistor (at 675.degree. C. .+-.55.degree.). In
        this manner, small adjustments in cathode (64) emissivity may be
        made as necessary during operation and the various grids may be
        closely matched in temperature to that of their respective
        cathode(s) to ensure the accuracy of mutual primary electrode
        voltage balance. Any deviation of cathode (64) voltage from a
        chassis ground potential may be detected and measured across a
        very-high-value resistor (107), connected between said
        cathode(s) and chassis ground, which is preferably of a large
        carbon type having multiple fixed taps (and across which an
        output voltage may exist). </p>
      <p>A dedicated common variable DC voltage supply (95) is provided
        for all primary cathodes (64) as a means of ensuring an optimum
        cathode potential with respect to ground, despite fluctuating
        power resistor temperatures (in three-stage rotor devices where
        field hemitorus current is variably biased). This supply is
        shunted with a double-pole/double-throw switch or relay (123) to
        enable either a positive or negative interim control voltage to
        be applied to the cathodes (64), in order to hold their true
        potential as close to ground as possible. A similar voltage
        supply (97) and switch/relay (123) is also provided for all
        primary accelerator grids (66) as a means of modulating the
        fixed level of applied positive grid voltage (from stationary
        anode ring (58)) and therefore the level of field hemitorus
        current, independent of the level of applied control grid (65)
        bias. In both cases, these DC supplies are isolated from chassis
        ground by blocking capacitors (106) to inhibit any net charge
        loss or accumulation from accruing to the ground frame (10)
        during operation (in propulsive units which are not connected to
        true earth ground). </p>
      <p>A dedicated common variable DC voltage supply (96) is provided
        for all primary control grids (65) as well. This voltage supply
        is not capacitor-isolated from chassis ground in this case, so
        that the primary control grids (65) and cathodes (64) may have a
        common direct ground reference as they would in a typical vacuum
        tube circuit arrangement. The said control grid supply (96)
        should also have a resistor (107) of the same type as that
        provided for the associated cathodes (64), connected between
        such supply's positive terminal and chassis ground. These two
        criteria further ensure the accuracy of mutual primary electrode
        voltage balance, and the nominal (or zero-signal) value of such
        DC control grid voltage relative to chassis ground is expected
        to be approximately -36 to -48 volts per foot of hull diameter
        in three-stage and single-stage Generator embodiments
        (respectively). A variable bypass resistor (108) may be adjusted
        to ensure a very low and relatively constant DC operating grid
        current despite fluctuations in the value of the AC input signal
        resistor (110), as discussed below. </p>
      <p>Ballast compensating capacitors (116) are provided whereby
        negative outrush charge from the stationary anode rings (58) and
        the positive plates of the rotor ballast capacitors may be
        purged from the Primary Power System during rotor spin-up, to
        prevent stage electrode array voltage ratings from otherwise
        being greatly exceeded, via these same two anode rings (one per
        primary induction ring array), connecting switch/s or relay/s
        (124), and resistor/s (125). During the Generator's spin-up and
        `run` periods, each ballast discharge switch/relay (122) is
        normally open; switch/relays (124) are `run-open`. Upon rotor
        de-spin, such ground-restoring charge must be proportionately
        returned to each stationary anode ring via switch/relays (124)
        and resistors (125), and to the Primary Power System as a whole
        via the discharge switch/relays (122) and suppressor grid
        discharge shunts (with variable resistors (113) and diodes
        (115)), for the most part after vacuum chamber current to the
        hull Emitter Ring has essentially ceased. </p>
      <p>Then, such normalizing charge may be `dumped` across the
        described suppressor grid discharge shunts at a rate sufficient
        to ensure that the entire Primary Power System returns to a
        ground potential (by brief direct surge rotor-shorting to the
        outer induction array anode rings). Thus, resistors (113)
        provide a variable time constant for the discharging of the said
        compensating capacitors (116). An a independent common variable
        DC voltage supply (99) whose negative terminal is connected to
        the ground frame (10) ensures that the proper total ballast
        compensating charge described may be stored against the high
        positive applied potential of the stationary anode rings (58). </p>
      <p>The ambient charge capacitors (117) absorb ionization charge
        (arising from operation in air) which perforce must fall into
        the potential well(s) established by the positive housing
        sections at least until the field envelope's two hemitorus
        currents are fully formed, and which would otherwise tend to
        ground the desired positive housing section voltage. Therefore,
        the negative plate voltage of these storage capacitors (117) is
        applied from another dedicated DC supply (100), which is similar
        to that (99) provided for the compensating capacitors (116), by
        means of a common dpdt switch/relay (119). None of these DC
        supplies (95)-(100) are to have internal load-line diodes. </p>
      <p>The variable output of this "dynamic compensating" voltage
        supply (100) is to be approximately the same as that of the
        ambient charge capacitors' positive voltage supply (98), thereby
        allowing the said capacitors (117) to be gradually saturated
        during rotor spin-up with electrons collected at the accelerator
        grids via storage shunt inrush current switch/relays (121) and
        diodes (114). During the Generator's spin-up and run periods,
        the "control gate" switch/relays (119) are normally closed such
        that the negative pole of supply (100) is connected to the
        negative plates of these same capacitors. In the Generator's run
        and de-spin periods, however, switch/relays (121) are normally
        open. </p>
      <p>Any excess ionization charge above these capacitors' joint
        storage capability which might lower the `run` Field Induction
        System circuit voltage must then be either grounded off or
        deposited in said superconductive storage ring(s) (200) (in
        ungrounded propulsive Generators designed for maximum ambient
        charge storage), via the same said throw of control gate
        switch/relay (119) in conjunction with shunt switch/relay (120)
        and resistor (112). In this case, the storage shunt
        switch/relays (121) remain run-closed. Otherwise, the slow `run`
        release and distribution of negative charge reserves to the
        rotor from the storage capacitors (117) is effected by the
        gradual synchronized relaxation of the voltage/s from supplies
        (98) and (100) across switch/relay (119) and discharge resistor
        (113), with shunt switchs (120) and (121) open, while diodes
        (114) and (115) ensure that the said capacitors (117) may only
        be discharged in the manner described. </p>
      <p>This discharge of stored charge reserves actually takes place
        from the suppressor grids (67), which may serve as low-power
        electron emitters given their proximity to the primary anode
        rings (68). An isolation diode (127) prevents such negative
        charge from neutralizing accelerator grid circuit voltage. It
        should be noted that the suppressor grids may be held at ground
        potential as they would in a typical beam power pentode circuit
        arrangement, or at a very low if not negligible negative voltage
        for purposes of effecting such controlled low-power charge
        release, by means of [i] a minor negative voltage induced
        thereon by the corresponding proximal primary anode ring/s
        (proportional to their capacitance relative thereto); [ii] the
        combined DC voltage drop across the paralleled resistors (109)
        and (111) connected to their respective accelerator grids;
        and/or [iii] the voltage of the dynamic compensating supply
        (100) relative either to earth ground and resistor (112) or to
        chassis ground and the relative opposing voltage of the ambient
        charge storage capacitor's supply (98). </p>
      <p>The bypass resistor (109) provided between each accelerator
        grid (66) and its associated suppressor grid (67) returns the
        inevitable stationary anode ring (58) and accelerator grid (66)
        DC circuit current to the rotor from the suppressor grids (67),
        and simply assists in maintaining each suppressor grid at a DC
        potential as close to true ground as possible. The suppressor
        grid resistor (111) which is paralleled with said bypass
        resistor (109), however, is analogous to a plate resistor on
        behalf of the corresponding inner (rotor) induction array in
        both the single- and three-stage rotor embodiments, in that any
        rotor circuit final-stage AC output voltage variations will be
        reproduced across it once field envelope circuit current
        commences. Likewise, any AC signal oscillations from an outside
        (remote) source which are induced upon the field envelope
        current will immediately act as a detected first-stage AC input
        for rotor circuit amplification, and again will be reproduced
        across the said grid resistor (111). </p>
      <p>Therefore, any rotor or field circuit AC potential difference
        across this grid resistor (111) provides an output signal
        voltage that may be: [i] received by an actual communications
        console or a simple AC control-voltage operating circuit in the
        Generator's central cabin; and/or [ii] reapplied either in- or
        out-of-phase with the voltage across the input signal resistor
        (110) of the associated control grid (65) as a further AC signal
        voltage amplification or suppression stage (respectively). An
        input AC signal or control voltage may also be applied across
        the control grid resistor (110) from such an onboard
        communications console or control-voltage operating circuit, as
        would generally apply to three-stage and single-stage devices,
        respectively. This grid resistor is variable for circuit tuning
        purposes related to resonant frequency communications (if
        desired). </p>
      <p>It can be seen from FIGS. 8 and 9, however, that the AC output
        amplification stage (or inner induction array) of the Primary
        Power System and its input stage (or outer induction array) are
        directly coupled by the rotor segments (14) in both single-stage
        and multi-stage rotor embodiments. Thus, the rotor electrical
        circuit as configured will be subject to continuous positive (or
        regenerative) feedback of any AC signal voltage present either
        in the field current or on the rotor, as described above. To
        provide a desired or requisite level of signal amplitude
        suppression or compensation, negative (or inverse) feedback may
        be applied to the rotor circuit using the feedback coupling
        relays (129) and stage transformers (130) shown in FIG. 10. </p>
      <p>Because plate voltage and grid voltage are typically
        180.degree. out of phase in a beam pentode arrangement such as
        the Generator's primary arrays, inverse feedback is achieved
        when the voltage fed back to the control grid (65) has the same
        waveform and phase as the plate or anode (68) voltage. In
        related traditional practice, an inverse feedback signal applied
        to the input (control grid) current decreases AC amplifier input
        impedance and distortion; an inverse feedback signal
        proportional to the output (plate/anode) current raises the
        output impedance of such amplifier. Therefore, an inverse
        feedback AC signal proportional to the current through resistor
        (111) which is applied in-phase with the AC line current across
        resistor (110) decreases the rotor input stage impedance yet
        also reduces the amplitude of the AC output current. A loss of
        total amplification (through a fractional stage `gain`) results,
        but is accompanied by a decrease in signal distortion. </p>
      <p>The stage feedback transformers (130) ensure voltage reference
        isolation between such stationary amplification or suppression
        stage and the corresponding rotor stages, when AC signal
        feedback across the control grid resistors (110) is necessary or
        desired. A double-pole/double-throw switch/relay (129) may be
        used to decouple each such transformer from the input signal
        resistor (110) side of its circuit connections, and/or to apply
        either positive (regenerative) or negative (inverse) feedback to
        the rotor AC amplification stage(s), and tunable blocking
        capacitors (131) isolate the transformers from circuit DC
        voltages. The coupling transformers (130), isolation relays
        (129), and blocking capacitors (131) are therefore only
        necessary in Generator embodiments not having a central AC
        control-voltage operating circuit with suitable inverse feedback
        characteristics and in three-stage Generator embodiments which
        may be used in a communications capacity. In the latter case, an
        optional capacitor across the secondary or control grid resistor
        (110) side of each such transformer (in parallel with the said
        resistor) may once again be employed in parallel resonance
        fashion, and is indicated in FIG. 10. </p>
      <p>During continuous operation of an EDF Generator in the vacuum
        of space, the exhibited DC field voltage will tend to rise
        gradually as the total amount of charge contained in the field
        envelope circuit is gradually reduced through unavoidable
        electron leakage losses (primarily at the hull Emitter Ring
        peripheral edge). To compensate for this effect, a small amount
        of stored ambient charge must therefore be continually released
        at the suppressor grids (67) into the rotor return current. The
        rate at which this gradual discharge must be effected is
        dependent upon the observed field leakage rate, as only a rough
        approximation of this leakage may be pre-calculated. It is for
        this reason that at least one superconductive storage ring
        (200)--containing a tremendous quantity of reserve ambient
        charge in the form of a continuous zero-loss current--must be
        included in any ungrounded Impulse Drive unit used in space
        exploration, as the capacity of such storage ring determines the
        vessel's effective range of operation. </p>
      <p>It is postulated that the external field current's energy
        density will be sufficiently enormous that it exhibits a virtual
        self-evacuating operational condition above a certain ultra-high
        field voltage in propulsive three-stage EDF Generators, and such
        a condition is essential to the successful atmospheric ground
        launch thereof Such kinetic occlusion of a significant portion
        of the otherwise available ambient ionization charge may also
        occur once the field envelope is fully formed even in
        ground-based single-stage devices operated at breakdown field
        intensity. During continuous operation of such ground-based
        devices in a gaseous atmosphere, field leakage losses which
        could cause an undesired gradual field voltage rise if they
        exceed available ambient charge accretion may be compensated by
        bypass-shunted charge from earth ground. In this case, the
        positive pole of supply (100) is connected at low power via dpdt
        switch/relays (119) to earth ground, in order to avoid a limited
        spin-up/run/de-spin repeating duty cycle. </p>
      <p><b>General Method of Construction</b> </p>
      <p>The actual construction of an Electrodynamic Field Generator of
        any given size is relatively straightforward, whether of a
        manned propulsive embodiment or not, and proceeds in fact from
        the inside out. Referring generally to FIG. 1, one of the most
        practical features of the construction process is that virtually
        the entire instrumentation and payload compartment or "Central
        Chamber" (2) may be outfitted first, before any portion of the
        Primary Power System is assembled or even necessarily designed.
        In the preferred three-stage embodiment to be used as an
        aerospace Impulse Drive Unit, the central chamber should
        obviously incorporate low-density materials wherever possible. </p>
      <p>Construction next proceeds with the Generator's ground frame
        (10): the metallic structural shell which provides an enclosing
        framework for the central chamber to which all ancillary inboard
        electrical equipment may be grounded. This structural framework
        should be as strong, lightweight, and nonmagnetic as possible,
        and may preferably be of a welded tubular design using stainless
        steel or a suitable titanium alloy. </p>
      <p>Once the ground frame and enclosed central chamber are
        completed, including the installation of a preferred total of 32
        high-torque DC motor-generator rotor drive units (in four sets
        of eight), the two rotor mounting frame sections and attached
        ring gear/s (8) of the "Carrier Assembly" may be built and
        dynamically balanced (using a temporary peripheral spacing
        "jig"). Then, construction of the composite "Rotor Assembly" may
        commence with the laying out of equal numbers of copper segments
        (14), ceramic segment separators (16), and refractory composite
        field emitters (17) which are all of exactly equal weight by
        type, the latter components providing the nonconductive base to
        which other rotating electrical hardware may be attached. </p>
      <p>When the three sets of said principal large rotor pieces (which
        preferably number 180 each) are bound together with electrode
        rings silver-soldered to the segments, and clamped between the
        two halves of the centrifuge-style carrier assembly, the
        assembly of the "Primary Power System" itself may begin. Once
        thin insulative rotor surface "facing", the aforementioned
        recessed and conductive separator traces, and the rotor
        ballraces (25) have all been affixed to the base rotor assembly,
        and the field coils, electrode arrays, and other rotating
        components have been added, the fabrication of the vessel's
        "Structural Intercooler System" may proceed. When this secondary
        thermal conduit (hull coolant) system is completed and has been
        pressure-tested, the "Primary and Magnetic Arrays" may be
        installed--including the 5-armature variable inductor array
        sections depicted in FIG. 14. The primary (induction ring)
        arrays here are comprised of the unit pentode arrays (69) as
        individual assemblies each having an adjunct assembly comprising
        a field power resistor (63), dielectric buffer (45), and primary
        thermal conduit (48). </p>
      <p>Finally, once the rotor has satisfied nonenergized operational
        mechanical clearance and dynamic balancing criteria (using a
        temporary outer rotor bearing support "jig") and a final
        complete thermal conduit system pressure test has been made, the
        "Outer Hull Components" may be installed. Thus, the basic vessel
        construction may be completed in a total of seven distinct steps
        or stages. Due to the tremendous weight of the finished rotor
        (as the device's most massive single assembly), an operating
        characteristic of utmost importance is the actual rotor speed
        required to maintain a specification field voltage which is
        figured using the method outlined in the Detailed Calculations
        below. This will determine the rotor's operating angular
        momentum, which in propulsive units must be sufficiently large
        to provide gyroscopic stability against the use of
        variably-imbalanced isometric thrust (produced by field
        hemitorus current) but not so large that the vessel's
        navigational and maneuvering characteristics are thereby
        rendered sluggish. </p>
      <p>It can be shown mathematically that the nominal rotor speed for
        a 4 ft. diameter theoretical design prototype would be roughly
        equal to or somewhat less than that of a typical small electric
        motor. However, as the size of the device increases, it will be
        necessary to reduce rotor rpm due to the extreme increase in the
        rotor's `tip` speed and therefore the centrifugal forces to
        which it is subjected. Sufficient information is contained in
        the basic specifications which underlie this disclosure to allow
        engineers to reduce rotor speed as necessary in larger devices
        following the course of an intensive program of small device
        tesing; e.g., the projected nominal rotor rpm for a 20 ft.
        Thermal Unit is 1045. </p>
      <p><b>Structural Intercooler System</b> </p>
      <p>The secondary thermal conduit sections which carry hull coolant
        or heat transfer fluid through the Generator's tapered "Drive
        Ring" (or the combined volume of the negative and neutral
        housing sections) must pass between the power resistor and unit
        pentode array assemblies, and so they must conform in outside
        dimension to the available space within the supporting framework
        of the neutral hull construction. The most unusual feature of
        these secondary conduits is that they also comprise (of
        necessity) the principle Drive Ring load-bearing members, and
        together they form the EDF Generator's structural intercooler
        system as illustrated in FIG. 14. </p>
      <p>These secondary hull coolant conduits should be fashioned in a
        manner similar to the primary thermal conduits described
        hereinabove, and in the preferred embodiment would be formed in
        four types or varieties: [i] the initial outbound coolant supply
        runs (75), called "headers"; [ii] the circumferential heat
        transfer sections (76) (to which the Emitter Ring hull plates
        are fastened), called "peripheral shunts"; [iii] the inner (77)
        and outer (78) intermediary coolant runs, or "transfer links";
        and [iv] the radial coolant returns (79) or "recovery lines".
        Within the Drive Ring, each of these conduit types may be
        fashioned as single sections which connect one to another in
        `series-parallel` branch systems or zones. To wit, one header
        (75) from a reservoir coolant manifold (74) connects to one
        peripheral shunt (76) which in turn connects to one recovery
        line (79). </p>
      <p>Thus, a single coolant zone is illustrated in FIG. 14, the
        arrows indicating the direction of coolant flow. A molded
        ceramic support bracket (71) having integral elbows and a set of
        mounting "knuckles" may be used to secure the inner corners of
        each two adjacent negative hull plates (72), by means of a
        matching mounting ring welded to each inner plate corner and a
        retaining pin (not shown). Each Emitter Ring hull plate (72) is
        to have an angle-stock thermal transfer channel welded along but
        just inside its inner edge (as indicated by dashed lines), which
        encloses the corresponding peripheral shunt (76). </p>
      <p>These coolant headers, shunts, transfer links, and recovery
        lines are preferably formed of molybdenum tubing, and would take
        advantage of the high thermal conductivity and electrical
        resistance of a thin Alumina coating thereon to absorb excess
        heat from the single-stage Drive Ring hull and (in particular)
        the Emitter Ring hull plates. In single-stage rotor devices
        which are used as Thermal Power Units, the recovery lines then
        exit the Generator housing through two exchange manifolds (as
        stated earlier), from a preferred total of 72 individual coolant
        zones, to an external heat exchanger. Just how effective this
        method of cooling the Drive Ring as a whole will prove to be
        during operation in air, using the preferred liquid air or
        nitrogen coolant, is somewhat difficult to project. Liquid
        helium could alternatively be used in this respect to ensure
        adequate hull cooling, but would entail significantly increased
        piping and pumping difficulties in doing so. </p>
      <p>It is expected, however, that the intercooler system described
        will be satisfactorily effective during the operation of
        three-stage devices in the vacuum of space, and is principally
        designed with this mode of usage in mind. Accordingly, it is
        believed that an Impulse Drive Unit operated in space will be
        able to purge its excess heat by actually circulating the
        primary conduit liquid sodium or equivalent through the
        secondary thermal conduit system (instead of the cryogenic
        coolant). In this case, the intercooler structure is used to
        transfer heat to the Emitter Ring hull plates as a radiative
        heat sink. This cooling method would provide the necessary means
        of liberating the Generator from permanent ground-based support
        to achieve free-ranging operation in space. </p>
      <p><b>Neutral Housing Section Construction</b> </p>
      <p>In order to establish and withstand the action of the field
        envelope discharge current, the surface of the neutral sections
        of the Generator's housing or hull (or "Neutral Ring") must be
        constructed entirely of specialized nonconductive material(s)
        which should be applied in two layers to an underlying
        superstructure that is actually conductive in nature. It is
        proposed that overlapping ceramic `tiles` be used in this
        regard, in a manner rather like that employed on the NASA space
        shuttles, which are adhesed to an underlying deck of structural
        nonmetallic sheet stock While the intercooler system conduits
        (described in the preceding section) comprise the principal
        load-bearing members which support the Drive Ring portion of the
        hull, a system of beams (153) and struts (152) that are also
        composed of the same nonmetallic structural material as the deck
        or a similar and compatible material should be utilized to
        further strengthen and `unitize` the Drive Ring superstructure
        such that an internal hard vacuum may be drawn and maintained
        prior to operation. These secondary load-bearing members are
        also depicted in FIG. 14, and in a preferred embodiment these
        members and the base deck material itself would be composed of a
        carbon composite commonly referred to incorrectly as graphite. </p>
      <p>Sophisticated carbon composites similar to those found in
        golf-club shafts and racing-bicycle frames were first developed
        to make use of their special combination of extreme strength,
        rigidity, and lightness in aerospace applications. These
        materials are generally made from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) carbon
        fibers which are heated under tension to drive off the
        non-carbon portion. The individual fibers are about 7 microns in
        diameter and approach 300 kpsi in tensile strength. They may
        then be pulled into a rope-like `tow` or woven into a
        fabric-like `matte` before being coated with either epoxy or
        polyester resin. Therefore, carbon composites are eminently
        suited to forming rods, tubes, and sheets, and display excellent
        vibration damping characteristics. The final product is,
        however, still very expensive per pound. </p>
      <p>To simplify the vast diversity in specialized grades of PAN
        carbon composite for purposes of this application, this material
        should be considered as coming in two basic density grades:
        low-density "deck" grade (at about 35% of the specific gravity
        of sheet steel), and high-density "beam" grade (at about 65% of
        the specific gravity of structural steel). It is also available
        in two standard temperature grades, depending on the bonding
        agent used: a 350.degree. F. rating (lo-temp) epoxy-bonded
        material and a 750.degree. F. rating (hi-temp) polyamide-bonded
        composition. The hi-temp grade only should be employed in the
        Neutral Ring, but the lo-temp grade may be used to build the
        Central Chamber. </p>
      <p>Thus, a low-density/hi-temp grade of carbon composite laminate
        should be used as the basic deck material in construction of the
        Neutral Ring hull sections. To wit, this deck layer itself is
        initially affixed to the vessel superstructure by solvent
        welding and/or mechanical means. The PAN carbon deck, a middle
        layer of ceramic substrate plates and an outer skin of exolayer
        tiles together then comprise the composite Neutral Ring hull.
        Several factors enter into the selection of an appropriate
        ceramic material for the substrate layer plates. Of primary
        concern here is that the material of choice have a very high
        volume resistivity and very low thermal conductivity at
        temperatures from 300-500.degree. C. It is also important that
        the material have a very low thermal expansion coefficient, as
        the substrate layer plates must be bonded to the deck layer with
        a refractory-class adhesive. Therefore, the substrate material
        should also be non-vitreous and have relatively high porosity to
        promote adequate adhesion. One of the Cordierite class of
        compounds, bearing CeramTec designation 447, has relatively low
        hardness and flexural strength but should function admirably in
        Thermal Power Units as the center layer of a bonded composite
        construction given its other highly desirable characteristics.
        Impulse Drive Units will require an alternate substrate plate
        material as discussed below. </p>
      <p>The selection of a ceramic material for use as the exolayer
        dielectric thermal tiles of the EDF Generator's housing or hull
        is contingent upon the operative field voltage, and therefore
        different materials must be specified for Thermal and Impulse
        Drive Units. To prevent substantial skin conduction losses, the
        minimum dielectric value k for the exolayer tile material used
        in Thermal Power Units has been calculated (using the peak field
        voltage) at approximately k=9. Therefore, the material of choice
        is a Zirconia composition bearing CeramTec designation 848, with
        a minimum (high-frequency) dielectric constant of 28. Even
        though this material has a comparatively high thermal expansion
        coefficient, it has very low thermal conductivity and is very
        dense and hard. Moreover, it exhibits exceptional flexural
        strength and resistance to fracture. </p>
      <p>The minimum dielectric value k for the exolayer tile material
        used in Impulse Drive Units has been calculated at approximately
        k=107. Therefore, the material of choice is the same titanate
        composition prescribed for the dielectric buffers (and described
        in some detail in a previous section). Known chemically as
        Sodium Bismuth Titanate (and commercially as Kezite), this
        highly unusual compound is technically a piezoelectric material,
        but is also ferroelectric in that its dielectric constant
        actually increases on temperature rise to a peak low frequency
        value of about 3,100 at its 655.degree. C. curie point. Like
        most ferroelectrics, its tensile and flexural strengths are
        quite low yet it is very dense and exceedingly hard. It does,
        however, exhibit a thermal expansion coefficient which is very
        high for a ceramic material. </p>
      <p>The expected higher flexural stresses upon the Neutral Ring of
        an Impulse Drive Unit (compared to a Thermal Power Unit) may
        prove sufficient to crack the substrate plates were they
        composed of the Cordierite material described above. The
        Zirconia compound mentioned earlier should therefore be
        substituted for Cordierite 447 as the substrate plate material
        in Impulse Drive Units. This would likely stiffen the composite
        Neutral Ring hull adequately to prevent such stress cracking,
        while effecting a much closer match in thermal expansion
        coefficient to the titanate tiles. In both Thermal and Drive
        Units, the exolayer tiles should be applied to the substrate
        plates with a refractory-class adhesive in a mosaic overlay
        pattern, such that the edges of each exolayer tile are evenly
        spaced as far as possible from the underlying edges of the
        nearest substrate plates. </p>
      <p>Because the underlying deck layer of the Neutral Ring hull will
        be quite conductive when composed of carbon composite sheeting,
        and referring now to FIG. 1, it becomes imperative to use an
        auxiliary dielectric buffer (50) between the inner edges of the
        Emitter Ring (47) hull plates and the outer edge of the said
        deck layer to prevent an otherwise enormous deck leakage current
        from occuring. Although it might seem that the much-cheaper and
        nearly-as-strong fiberglass composites available (which are
        nonconductive) would tend to minimize any such leakage current
        condition, their use would not prevent the possible build-up of
        unacceptable levels of static charge within the working
        induction compartment (12). Therefore, the use of conductive
        deck material ensures that the Faraday shielding principle
        protects Neutral Ring components from transient static voltages
        because the presence of a finite deck leakage current means the
        deck layer is a charged conductor, whereupon any net static
        charge must be external. </p>
      <p>A secondary concern is the actual operating temperature of the
        contact areas where the deck layer abuts to both the auxiliary
        (50) and primary (45) dielectric buffers, which must be kept
        below the 750.degree. F. temperature rating of the carbon
        composite. It can be shown mathematically that the deck leakage
        current can be held to a thoroughly acceptable fractional
        amperage per cm.sup.2 of such contact area if this condition is
        met. In Thermal Power Units, the use of a secondary cryogenic
        hull coolant should keep the auxiliary buffers (50) and outer
        deck contact areas at a temperature which is under the said
        rating. Doing so at the primary buffer (45) contact area
        locations may well require the use of auxiliary cryogenic
        thermal conduits in both Thermal and Drive Unit models of the
        EDF Generator. The auxiliary dielectric buffers in any given
        Generator should be composed of the same material used in that
        device's exolayer tiles, and should be of about half the radial
        thickness of the primary buffers employed therein. </p>
      <p>While the specific materials discussed above should not be
        construed as critical to the EDF Generator's proper
        construction, their properties and characteristics are highly
        indicative of the rather involved considerations which must be
        undertaken to ensure that the neutral sections of the vessel
        hull are physically suited to optimizing a given size device's
        performance and minimizing its housing maintainance or repair
        requirements. </p>
      <p><b>Stationary Electromagnetic Armatures</b> </p>
      <p>Because the EDF Generator's stationary electromagnetic
        armatures have no bearing on the device's rotor or field
        voltages, and no direct connection therewith, they are properly
        thought of as being part of neither the Primary Power System or
        Field Induction System circuits but rather a separate ancillary
        subsystem intended to optimize the invention's overall
        performance and efficiency in a number of important ways. To
        this end, their main purpose is to create and independently
        control a variable level of both rotor torque and field current
        rotational force, as necessary or desired. </p>
      <p>As depicted in FIG. 14, the individual stationary armatures
        (37) (or "variable inductors") may be installed in 5-armature
        groups or array sections within the Neutral Ring of the hull,
        using notched and mating supports (151) which firmly clamp the
        armatures about a reduced diameter center section of each
        armature core. These armatures and a basic control circuit
        arrangement for them are shown in FIG. 16, with the polarities
        indicated being those which would result in a clockwise rotation
        of the rotor as viewed from above. This armature power
        distribution system may be manually adjusted and/or
        automatically controlled (using a computer and/or other
        circuitry). </p>
      <p>In both single-stage and three-stage embodiments of the
        Generator, each of the two electromagnetic armature arrays
        should be wired in parallel from one or more separate source(s)
        (185) of low-voltage DC current which is/are chassis-grounded
        and which is/are common to the armatures (37) of that array. No
        variable regulation or biasing of individual armature DC
        current(s) in single-stage rotor or Thermal Power Unit devices
        is necessary. The desired individual biasing of armature DC
        current in three-stage rotor devices, for propulsion-related
        reasons explained below, may be simply accomplished through a
        variable resistor (184) associated with each armature and its DC
        power supply subcircuit(s). A minor unidirectional or
        alternating voltage component of such armature supply current
        may be added across or in parallel with such resistor (184),
        using an AC power source (186) and/or suitable control interface
        of a conventional nature, in either single-stage or three-stage
        Generator embodiments as desired. </p>
      <p>Each stationary armature (37) incorporates two separate
        electrical coils (180)-(181), to be operated principally on DC
        voltage, which are formed of conductive insulated magnet wire
        multi-layer wound upon a single ferromagnetic core. Each such
        armature core also incorporates a connecting center section or
        "flux reductor" (182) between said separate coils which is of a
        significantly reduced cross-sectional area with respect to the
        balance thereof, and which is designed to saturate magnetically
        when the respective core flux density of either of said coils is
        approximately equal to or greater than half saturation value.
        Pure annealed iron or low-carbon steel should be used as the
        armature core material, due to the high permeability, superior
        intrinsic induction, and low hysteresis thereof. </p>
      <p>The inner or "flux initiator" coils (181) of these
        electromagnetic armatures (or those closest to the rotor) may be
        used as a means of creating axial magnetic fields of force (144)
        which are perpendicular to the plane of the current-carrying
        rotor segments (14). Thus, when powered collectively at a common
        DC current value, the said inner armature coils (181) in
        conjunction with their respective cores may serve as a source of
        uniform yet variable secondary input rotary torque (or in a
        torque-assist capacity) for the invention in the course of its
        normal operation as an electrical generator. </p>
      <p>The flux initiator coils (181) are so-named because their
        as-wound polarity relative to the fixed outward direction of the
        primary DC rotor current establishes both the direction of rotor
        rotation and the required winding direction and polarity of the
        outer (and similar) armature coils (180). The said inner coils
        (181) are energized by a variable DC power supply (185), through
        an output variable resistor (184) and a filter diode (189) which
        blocks induced positive AC half-cycles (if any) from crossing
        the negatively-grounded DC supply (185). Such power supply (185)
        must, however, be sufficiently rated to carry any corresponding
        induced unidirectional negative current impulses to ground, and
        may be of a solid-state or rotary induction design. </p>
      <p>The axial armature-produced fields (144) described may also be
        individually and variably superimposed on the rotor to develop a
        selectively controllable force of rotational torque upon its
        current-carrying segments (14), through variable regulation of
        the principal DC current in individual armature inner coils
        (181), such that a locally-unbalanced force of angular
        acceleration may be applied to the rotor and therefore a
        directional force of horizontal thrust may indirectly be
        imparted to the housing for lateral flight maneuvering in
        propulsive three-stage rotor devices. </p>
      <p>The outer coils (180) of the stationary electromagnetic
        armatures, or those closest to the field envelope, may be used
        as a means of creating axial magnetic fields of force (144)
        which in this case are essentially perpendicular to the
        described field current arc trajectories. This situation is best
        illustrated in FIG. 12, which shows the hull location of the two
        variable inductor arrays (145) (or circular groups of armatures
        (37)). Thus, when powered collectively at a common DC current
        value (including any minor unidirectional or alternating
        component thereof), these outer armature coils (180) in
        conjunction with their respective ferromagnetic cores serve to
        impart an attenuating yet holistic and orderly rotational vector
        moment upon the external discharge current. The general effect
        of such applied magnetic rotational force, which may be used to
        modify or modulate the field's electrodynamic characteristics,
        is further depicted in FIG. 13. </p>
      <p>Referring again to FIG. 16, and to continue in the same vein,
        it is postulated that the quasi-coherent aspects of the field
        envelope may actually be optimized through the proper control of
        the amplitude, frequency, and/or phase relationships between any
        minor AC voltage component of the field envelope current and the
        said minor AC current (if any) collectively supplied by AC power
        source (186) to the outer or "transflection" coils (180) (of
        each variable inductor array). This consideration applies to
        both single- and three-stage embodiments of the Generator,
        although it is decidedly more important in the case of the
        latter, and may also allow the engineered reduction of field
        radiative emissions. </p>
      <p>These transflection coils (180) are so-named because they may
        be used to impart a variable transverse deflectionary force upon
        all of the radially-impinging field current electrons. In the
        region(s) of the field envelope shown in FIG. 11 between the
        surface of each neutral hull section (4) and the corresponding
        field envelope inner boundary (142), this magnetic force may in
        fact be large enough to produce a continuous annular flow of
        "displacement charge" current. In any event, and as shown in
        FIG. 16, such outer armature coils (180) are also energized by a
        variable DC power supply (185) which is similar in type to that
        of the inner coils (181), through an output variable resistor
        (184) and filter diode (189). In addition, a variable AC power
        source (186) may impress a minor unidirectional or AC voltage
        upon the DC current supplied to the said transflection coils
        (180), either across or in parallel with the output resistor(s)
        (184) of their respective DC power supply subcircuit(s), through
        separate output variable resistors (184) and DC blocking
        capacitors (188) connected to said AC power source. </p>
      <p>The axial magnetic fields (144) produced by the armatures (37)
        may also be individually and variably superimposed on the field
        envelope to develop a selectively controllable rotational force
        upon the described field hemitorus current, through variable
        regulation of the principal DC current in individual outer (or
        transflection) coils (180), such that a locally-unbalanced force
        of angular acceleration may be applied to such hemitorus
        current. Any such angular force imbalance will cause a
        corresponding change in the local field current density and
        therefore a secondary directional force of variable thrust in
        the z-axis may indirectly be imparted to the housing in
        propulsive devices, yielding a further measure of navigational
        attitude control over non-isometric thrust produced by the
        Generator which may otherwise be largely unilinear. </p>
      <p>Given the nature of the flux reductor (182) as described above,
        it can be seen that either the inner or the outer armature core
        sections may be collectively or individually operated at any
        flux density above half of saturation level without
        significantly affecting the operating flux density of the
        respective opposite core sections, provided both corresponding
        sets of armature coils ((181) and (180) respectively) are
        powered by DC current of the same relative polarity. Thus, the
        base collective full-power operational level of flux density in
        the inner armature core sections of a three-stage rotor Impulse
        Drive Generator should be roughly half saturation level, in
        order to facilitate the achievement of temporary local rotor
        torque imbalances for propulsive purposes as described above.
        Such inner core section base flux density for single-stage rotor
        or Thermal Power Unit devices may be any desired in a range
        between 0 and 100% of saturation. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 16, means have nevertheless been provided for
        reversing the fundamental DC polarity of either the inner (181)
        or outer (180) coil of any given armature (37), without changing
        the given polarity of such coil's DC power supply (185), using a
        dpdt relay (190). It can be seen that this simple feature allows
        a counter-polarity magnetomotive force (or counter-mmf) to be
        applied to either wound core section of any given armature, with
        respect to the core polarity of that armature's opposite wound
        section. This feature, when taken in conjunction with the
        described nature of the flux reductor(s), enables the outer
        armature core sections in both single- and three-stage devices
        to be operated at nearly any flux density within their output
        capability which might be required to optimize the desired
        quasi-coherent properties of the field envelope, despite the
        relative polarity and/or flux density of the inner armature core
        sections. In both single- and three-stage devices, these same
        two features also allow a substantial level of braking or
        counter-rotational torque to be applied to the Generator's rotor
        --by any or all of the inner armature core sections--while
        maintaining such an optimum level of flux density in the outer
        armature core sections: even if the two such opposite core
        sections are operated at opposite respective polarities. </p>
      <p><b>Detailed Calculations for Preferred Embodiment</b> </p>
      <p>It is important to note that all of the underlying
        specifications pertaining to the size and/or positioning of
        Primary Power System components located within the hull's
        neutral section region (or "Neutral Ring") are given in terms of
        fractional increments of the hull radius (R.sub.h) and/or the
        radial width of the Neutral Ring (C.sub.v -C.sub.a). This means
        that these components may be easily scaled in exact proportion
        to the hull, for any selected radius thereof, with no
        significant error or modification. However, an upper limit of
        vessel size utilizing the technology represented by the EDF
        Generator probably exists at a hull diameter not greatly above
        100 feet, due to inordinate DC Field Voltage concerns (as that
        voltage is calculated using the method below). </p>

      <p><b>Field and Rotor Voltages</b> </p>
      <p><b>Part A: Model Unit Field Intensity</b> </p>
      <p>[1] The Marginal Envelope DC Field Intensity for all EDF
        Generator models regardless of type should be equal to the
        breakdown dielectric strength of air or vacuum at 3 million
        (3.times.10.sup.6) volts/meter, as measured along a full pure
        semicircular arc drawn from the center point on the surface of
        either hull Positive Zone (5) to any exterior point on the
        vessel's design hull configuration which lies on the horizontal
        centerline plane thereof. This distance shall be referred to as
        the "Drive Field Perimeter" (141), as shown in FIG. 11, and is
        taken to represent the longest continuous DC field current
        trajectory. </p>
      <p>[2] For purposes of these Specifications, the "Drive Field
        Boundary" (142) shall represent the distance measured along a
        full pure semicircular arc from any point on the outer
        peripheral edge of either hull Positive Zone (5) to the closest
        point thereto which lies on the inner peripheral edge of the
        vessel's corresponding negative hull section (3) (as shown in
        FIG. 11), and is taken to represent a shortest such DC drive
        current trajectory. </p>
      <p><b>Part B: Thermal Power Units</b> </p>
      <p>[1] The Nominal Field Voltage (nom.V.sub.f) should be
        numerically equal to 1.5 million (1.5.times.10.sup.6) times the
        vessel R.sub.h as measured in feet. This value is also equal to
        the Thermal Unit's standard design Primary Voltage Expansion
        Ratio of 750 times its Specification DC Primary Array Voltage,
        as a function of the charge stored within the Primary Power
        System's two Field Ballast Capacitors and of the Unit's primary
        cathode emissivity. </p>
      <p>[2] The Specification Field Voltage (spec.V.sub.f) should be
        equal to the Marginal Envelope DC Field Intensity times the
        distance comprising the Drive Field Perimeter, or (as presently
        calculated under the above directive) 0.9666 times the Nominal
        Field Voltage. This value shall constitute the Unit's standard
        operating value of field envelope voltage. </p>
      <p>[3] The Peak (design operating maximum) Field Voltage
        (max.V.sub.f) shall be equal to 110% of the Specification value
        thereof, and should never be exceeded in operation. </p>
      <p>[4] The Nominal Rotor Voltage (nom.V.sub.r) would be
        numerically equal to one-third the product of 1,000
        (1.times.10.sup.3) times the vessel R.sub.h, as measured in
        inches, as a gauge of the basic full-power DC generator value of
        rotor rotational speed, in a `single-stage` device. </p>
      <p>[5] The Specification Rotor Voltage (spec.V.sub.r) should be
        numerically equal to 0.25776% of 1.5 million
        (1.5.times.10.sup.6) times the vessel R.sub.h as measured in
        feet, and is also equal to 0.9666 times the Nominal Rotor
        Voltage. This value would constitute the standard operating
        value of DC rotor voltage, as a function of the engineered
        Primary Power System output at a nominal design rotor rotational
        speed. </p>
      <p>[6] The Peak (design operating maximum) Rotor Voltage
        (max.V.sub.r) shall be equal to 110% of the Specification value
        thereof, and should likewise never be exceeded. </p>
      <p>[7] The Specification DC Primary Array Voltage
        (spec..DELTA.V.sub.p) will be equal to half (1/2) of the
        Specification Rotor Voltage, and affects all primary array
        electrode spacings. </p>
      <p><b>Part C; Impulse Drive Units</b> </p>
      <p>Unlike the case with Thermal Power Units, it is not possible to
        specify in one step a Nominal Field Voltage for Impulse Drive
        Units which is a linear function of the hull radius R.sub.h ;
        the DC Field Voltage which must be produced to achieve the
        chosen design goal for net linear thrust output, equal to
        five-thirds the Earth's pull of gravity, is jointly proportional
        to the rotor ampacity which rises as a function of the square of
        increases in R.sub.h and to the vessel weight (which rises as a
        function of the cube of R.sub.h increases). </p>
      <p>Therefore, a Marginal Field Voltage is initially to be computed
        for Impulse Drive Units which reflects a projected theoretical
        operating value of DC Field Voltage required to produce a vessel
        acceleration approximately equal to 1.67 `g` outside of a
        proximal gravity field. This Marginal Field Voltage is to be
        calculated using the "specific impulse" of the vessel concerned
        (in nt-sec), and for purposes of the application contemplated
        herein this term is hereby defined as being equal to five times
        the vessel weight (in newtons) divided by the rotor ampacity
        times the number of electrons per coulomb. </p>
      <p>[1] Accordingly, the Marginal Field Voltage shall then be equal
        to the Unit's specific impulse (F.sub.dt) times the speed of
        light (c) divided by the unit electron charge (q). </p>
      <p>[2] An estimated nominal Field Voltage will also be computed
        whereby a nominal value for the final electron speed of Drive
        Field current is assigned which is in fact a linear function of
        R.sub.h, as applicable to vessels of from 4 to 100 ft. in
        diameter only. </p>
      <p>[3] The Nominal DC Field Voltage (nom.V.sub.f) should then be
        equal to the simple average of the Marginal Field Voltage and
        the said estimated nominal Field Voltage. </p>
      <p>[4] The Specification Field Voltage (spec.V.sub.f) should equal
        the Nominal DC Field Voltage (nom.V.sub.f) divided by an
        assigned engineering design constant equal to 0.982826. </p>
      <p>[5] The Peak (design operating maximum) Field Voltage
        (max.V.sub.f) shall be equal to 110% of the Specification value
        thereof, and should never be exceeded in operation. </p>
      <p>[6] The Nominal Rotor Voltage (nom.V.sub.r) would be
        numerically equal to one-fourth the product of 1,000
        (1.times.10.sup.3) times the vessel R.sub.h as measured in
        inches, as a gauge of the basic full-power DC generator value of
        rotor rotational speed, in a `three-stage` device. </p>
      <p>[7] The Specification Rotor Voltage (spec.V.sub.r) should be
        numerically equal to 0.19332% of 1.5 million
        (1.5.times.10.sup.6) times the vessel R.sub.h as measured in
        feet, and is also equal to 0.9666 times the Nominal Rotor
        Voltage. This value would constitute the standard operating
        value of DC rotor voltage, as a function of the engineered
        Primary Power System output at a nominal design rotor rotational
        speed. </p>
      <p>[8] The Peak (design operating maximum) Rotor Voltage
        (max.V.sub.r) shall be equal to 110% of the Specification value
        thereof, and should likewise never be exceeded. </p>
      <p>[9] The Specification DC Primary Array Voltage
        (spec..DELTA.V.sub.p) will be equal to half (1/2) of the
        Specification Rotor Voltage, and affects all primary array
        electrode spacings. </p>
      <p>[10] The design Primary Voltage Expansion Ratio for each
        Impulse Drive Unit should then be equal to the ratio of
        Specification Field Voltage to Specification DC Primary Array
        Voltage, and is once again a function of the ballast capacitor
        charge and of the primary cathode emissivity as in the case with
        Thermal Power Units. </p>

      <p>[4] Marginal Field Voltage: The 4 ft. Drive Unit's Marginal
        Field Voltage, which represents a projected minimum standard
        operating value of field envelope voltage, is based upon the
        vessel's specific impulse (F.sub.dt)--given its calculated
        design rotor ampacity of I.sub.max =38,160 amps and estimated
        weight of 79.2 lbs/ft.sup.3 -- which is computed as follows:
        ##EQU6## </p>
      <p>where V.sub.t = 2.5068 ft, as calculated by the formulas in the
        Table of Dimensions above using an Emitter Ring displacement
        angle (.alpha.) of 7.5.degree.. Therefore, ##EQU7## </p>
      <p>Therefore, the Marginal Field Voltage is equal to: ##EQU8## </p>
      <p>[5] Estimated Nominal Field Voltage: The 4 ft. Impulse Drive
        Unit's estimated nominal field voltage, which represents an
        alternate but extremely accurate projection of the minimum
        standard operating value of field envelope voltage, is based
        upon a nominal value for the final electron speed of Drive Field
        current (.DELTA.V.sub.e) which is an assigned linear function of
        the vessel R.sub.h and is calculated as follows: </p>
      <p>where R.sub.h is in feet, for vessels from 4 to 100 ft. in
        diameter. </p>
      <p>Therefore, .DELTA.V.sub.e = [0.999+0(1.03125.times.10.sup.-5)]c
        = 0.999 c. </p>
      <p>The purpose of this text subsection is to verify that a
        goal-requisite level of Field current thrust may be produced by
        the Electrodynamic Field Generator, at an operating DC Field
        Voltage approximately equal to that stated above, within the
        ampacity of the rotor and at an assigned value of Field current
        electron velocity (for this model) equal to 0.999c. In this
        manner, it is hoped that unnecessarily high operating Drive
        Field Voltage may be avoided, by virtue of design (due to the
        finite level of unavoidable uncertainty in the relativistic
        values involved), without sacrificing device performance. </p>
      <p>(a) The amount of thrust (force) required to produce an
        acceleration of 1 g, thus exactly compensating the weight of the
        Impulse Drive Unit or its normal acceleration due to Earth's
        gravity, may be calculated by Newton's Second Law as follows: </p>
      <p>F = mg, where m = est. design mass* of 90.245 kg, and g = 9.8
        m/sec.sup.2. </p>
      <p>Thus, F = 884.4 nt. </p>
      <p>(b) Since impulse equals change of momentum, the electron
        thrust developed by the Drive Field equals the total
        relativistic mass of Field current times the incident current
        velocity (as the final electron velocity equals zero). The
        amount of impulse thrust which is equivalent to 1 g in this
        example is 884.4 nt. </p>
      <p>Therefore, let .SIGMA.M.sub.t.DELTA.V.sub.e = 884.4 nt. </p>
      <p>(c) The design goal for net linear thrust output of any given
        Impulse Drive Unit is 16.333 m/sec.sup.2 at the minimum standard
        operating value of Field Voltage and rated rotor ampacity
        (I.sub.max) Therefore, given the considerations of Field Current
        Bias values (as were outlined in an earlier section), total
        isometric thrust at Marginal Field Voltage must equal 5 g. The
        largest current available to effect a Field impulse equivalent
        to 1 g is then equal to: </p>
      <p>(d) Since .SIGMA. equals the total number of electrons
        comprising a Drive current of I.sub.g, we find: </p>
      <p>(e) Therefore, from [b] above: </p>
      <p>(f) Letting .DELTA.V.sub.e = 0.999c, where c =
        299.7925.times.10.sup.6 m/sec, we calculate M.sub.t =
        619.08.times.10.sup.-31 kg, or about 67.96 m.sub.o, where
        m.sub.o = the electron rest mass of 9.11.times.10.sup.-31 kg. </p>
      <p>(g) If m.sub.i equals the relativistic mass equivalent of the
        gained kinetic energy of each Drive Field electron, then M.sub.t
        = m.sub.o +m.sub.i. </p>
      <p>Therefore, m.sub.i = M.sub.t -m.sub.o = 619.08.times.10.sup.-31
        -9.11.times.10.sup.-31&nbsp; = 609.97.times.10.sup.-31 kg. </p>
      <p>(h) Each Drive Field electron's gained kinetic energy (E.sub.q)
        equals m.sub.i c.sup.2. Using a precise value of
        8.98755.times.10.sup.16 for c.sup.2, </p>
      <p>we obtain E.sub.q = (6.0997.times.10.sup.-29)
        (8.98755.times.10.sup.16) = 54.8214.times.10.sup.-13 joules. </p>
      <p>(i) Here, E.sub.q also equals W = q(est.V.sub.nf), where q =
        electron chg. @1.6.times.10.sup.-19 coul., and
        est.V.sub.nf&nbsp; = est. nominal Field Voltage. </p>
      <p>Therefore, E.sub.q /q = est.V.sub.nf, and est.V.sub.nf
        =34.2633.times.10.sup.6 volts (jouleslcoul). </p>
      <p>Thus, we find that the estimated nominal Field Voltage required
        to develop requisite thrust is in fact well within the thrust
        goal parameters discussed above, at 98.63% of the projected
        Marginal value (calculated in the preceding subsection B[4]). </p>
      <p>[6] The Nominal DC Field Voltage (nom.V.sub.f) should therefore
        be equal to the simple average of the Marginal Field Voltage
        projected earlier and the estimated nominal Field Voltage Oust
        computed), at 34.5018.times.10.sup.6 volts. </p>
      <p>[7] The Specification Field Voltage (spec.V.sub.f) should then
        be equal to the Nominal DC Field Voltage divided by the said
        design constant 0.982826, at 35.1047.times.10.sup.6 volts. This
        value shall constitute the Unit's standard operating value of
        field envelope voltage. </p>
      <p>[8] The design Primary Voltage Expansion Ratio for this model
        Impulse Drive Unit is therefore equal to
        (35.1047.times.10.sup.6)/2,899.8=12,106:1, as was referred to
        earlier. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description it will be observed that the
        present invention provides a remarkable level of electrical and
        thermal output in a lower-voltage corona discharge induction
        embodiment, which is intended for use in a utility or physical
        plant application. However, this invention also provides the
        potential for an appreciable level of net impulse thrust in a
        higher-voltage arc discharge induction embodiment intended as an
        electrically-propulsive aerospace vessel. It can be seen as well
        that the Electrodynamic Field Generator and the electromotive
        field of force produced thereby will moreover fulfill the stated
        objective of NASA's premier Breakthrough Propulsion Physics
        Program: to discover a method whereby "a vehicle can create and
        control an asymmetric force on itself without expelling a
        reaction mass" and which satisfies conservation laws in the
        process. Such a vessel could perhaps be made to attain a
        velocity commensurate with its collector field electron
        collision velocity, and affords hope that true interstellar
        travel might therefore become possible as well. While there is
        due cause for some concern as to the EDF Generator's production
        of high-frequency radiative emissions coincident with its
        production of heat and impulse thrust using the new means
        described, it is postulated that the electromagnetic
        characteristics of the device's field envelope can be suitably
        tuned in the manner(s) oulined hereinabove such that the field
        envelope is rendered largely opaque to such very-high-energy
        emissions -- by promoting continuous and adsorptive Compton
        effect interactions thereof with the field's impinging drive
        current electrons. When used in association with a ground-based
        utility or physical plant, a non-propulsive thermal and/or
        electrical power output model of the Generator may also be
        enclosed within a suitable Faraday "cage" or shielding structure
        to further minimize radiative emissions which are undesirable.
        Neverthless, the said field envelope tuning principles (related
        to controlling the amplitude, frequency, and/or phase
        relationships amid field AC voltage components) may moreover
        permit the development of the Electrodynamic Field Generator as
        a novel signal communications means. In pursuit of a new and
        more complete quantum gravity theory, experiments may be
        conducted involving the gravimetric coupling of two or more
        separate such devices: whose field envelopes will by design be
        able to exhibit a relativistic and oscillatory apparent mass
        effect that is artificially generated--at desired resonant
        frequencies -- by using alternating electromagnetic induction
        methods of the type described hereinabove to modulate
        electrodynamic field properties which are normally of constant
        polarity and magnitude or random frequency. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the
        invention herein described are merely illustrative of the

        to details of the illustrated embodiments are not intended to
