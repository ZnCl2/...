      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      The invention belongs to the field of traditional Chinese
      medicine, and relates to a new application of luteolin for
      preparing an anti-complement medicine. In the invention, the
      luteolin is separated and extracted from a traditional Chinese
      medicine formula used for preventing and treating severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS); the traditional Chinese medicine
      formula consists of <i>heartleaf houttuynia herb, wild
