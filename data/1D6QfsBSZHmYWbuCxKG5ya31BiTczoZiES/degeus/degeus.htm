          ...[T]he entire thing including the papers and books has
          apparently only been opened and uploaded 19 days ago. This is
          remarkable, as I had read in several sources that Arie M.
          DeGeus had been found dead in his car in an airport parking
          lot in November 2007 or somewhere around then... Unless he
          also invented back-from-the-dead technology, it seems quite
          difficult to open a personal page and upload papers 8 years
          after one's death...<br>
          <br>
          ... While looking into that I came across several mentions on
          different for a of a "Aries DeGeus" who according to some did
          things with plasma (As in his "PlasmaVolt" device I presume),
          and some even link to your page on him. It was clear that the
          info was copied from one forum, as the same misspelling of the
          name occurred in every instance. Anyway, this was what
          reminded me of Arie Melis DeGeus, and brought me back to the
          snippets of his patents that you have on your site. So I
          searched for his patents again. And finally did find them via
          Espacenet, but you really have to search for "Geus Arie Melis
          De". I found that the English references all seem to direct
          back to the original Dutch patents, and the coolest ones have
          no English version at all. Which is a pity, because to be
          honest I find his patents well written, clear, and containing
          some of his underlying theory as well as some decent criticism
          of "established science" ...<br>

          </b><br>
          This document originally formed Appendix 1 of the author's
          book Fluidum Continuum Universalis. It is now being provided
          as a stand-alone document, due to its significance in helping
          to demonstrate the existence of the Fluidum Continuum.<br>
          <br>
          A number severely flawed assumptions led the Michelson-Morley
          experiment of1887 to wrongly conclude that "aether" does not
          exist. This incorrect conclusion has subsequently led
          mainstream physics astray for over a century. This document
          provides a mathematical method for calculating the incoming
          velocity of the aether-wind, as part of a broader endeavor by
          the author to provide a comprehensive description of Fluid
          Mechanical Physics.<br>

          <p><i>Overview:&nbsp; </i>We’re joined by Arie DeGues, an
            independent inventor, scientist, and theoretician who's not
            only rewritten the book on nuclear &amp; particle physics,
            but has also used his theory's predictive powers to build a
            startling array of breakthrough energy technologies,
            including an IEC fusion generator &amp; ZPE electrical
            generator... </p>
          <p>This is a very special interview over three-years in the
            making. Arie was originally recommended by us by the late
            Dr. Eugene Mallove, who had repeatedly attempted to publish
            DeGeus research in “Infinite Energy Magazine” before DeGeus
            was ready to come forward. </p>
          <p>One of DeGeus most remarkable inventions is a device called
            the “plasmavolt” – an IEC fusion generator that supposedly
            uses a rotating plasma-vortex to create fusion between
            light-metal nuclei (Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron). The
            cathode containing these metals is the device's fuel, and
            experimental tester Michael McDonnough claimed that not only
            did it produce 80-watts of output energy for only 50-watts
            input, but that after running it on an oscilloscope for
            several months straight, the reaction byproduct that it
            generated was 6-grams of pure Potassium 40-19. </p>
          <p>We also discuss some of DeGeus other remarkable
            innovations, including several processes that he claims
            extract zero-point energy to produce useable electrical
            energy, and a form of cold-current that reverses the
            thermal-gradient of an electrical current to actually remove
            heat from a circuit, causing it to run cold. </p>
          <p>Because of the proprietary patent &amp; intellectual
            property issues surrounding DeGeus research, his work is
            known only to a few --- but among those who know him he’s
            considered to the leader in contemporary new-energy &amp;
            alt-science research. </p>

          <p><b>The Incident</b> </p>
          <p>An incident that occurred in the Charlotte Douglas
            International Airport in North Carolina earlier this month
            is at least a curious coincidence, or it may possibly even
            represent assassination and suppression of another highly
            important "energy from the vacuum" (EFTV) invention. At
            least such a possibility should be considered, and then if
            all the facts warrant questioning the autopsy finding of
            death from natural causes, the incident should be more
            deeply investigated. </p>
          <p>The victim's name was M. DeGeus. DeGeus was found slumped
            in his car in the long term parking area of the airport,
            totally unresponsive. He was rushed to the hospital, and was
            pronounced dead very quickly, according to
            &lt;http://www.wbtv.com/&gt;http://www.WBTV.com </p>
          <p>The resulting autopsy indicated heart failure, and thus
            concluded "death from natural causes". Hence police are not
            investigating it any further, and they are not considering
            it as a possible homicide. </p>
          <p><b>Some Background on the Victim and His Invention</b> </p>
          <p>DeGeus was in fact the inventor of a thin wafer-like
            material/device that somehow specially aligned the atoms or
            electron currents ongoing in that material, so that the
            wafer produced a constant amperage at a small voltage ­
            continuous real power, or in other words a strange kind of
            "self-powering battery". It is actually powered by the
            ongoing and continuous tremendous exchange of energy by the
            active vacuum with the charges of any material. This
            exchange is exceptionally powerful, and normally our
            electromagnetic systems and devices only use just a tiny bit
            of it. </p>
          <p>But as is known in physics, even simple materials (such as
            a simple short piece of ordinary copper wire) have
            extraordinary symmetrical cross currents ongoing
            perpetually, even when no ordinary "net" current is flowing
            since normally there is no asymmetry. E.g., quoting Swann: </p>
          <p>"Think of the cables which carry the telephone current in
            the form of electrons. In the absence of the current the
            electrons are moving in all directions. As many are moving
            from left to right as are moving from right to left; and the
            nothingness which is there is composed of two equal and
            opposite halves, about a million million amperes per square
            centimeter in one direction, and a million million amperes
            per square centimeter in the other direction. The telephone
            current constitutes an upsetting of the balance to the
            extent of one hundredth of a millionth of an ampere per
            square centimeter, or about one part in a hundred million
            million million. Then if this one part in a hundred million
            million million is at fault by one part in a thousand, we
            ring up the telephone company and complain that the quality
            of the speech is faulty." [W.F.G. Swann, Physics Today,
            June. 1951, p. 9.] </p>
          <p>However, if by special alignment of atoms and basic
            constituents one does provide an EM asymmetry in this
            naturally occurring "opposing huge EM power currents" always
            ongoing laterally in the matter itself, then a net lateral
            direct current (real EM power) can be freely provided by
            that altered material at a resulting voltage (indicating the
            asymmetry) because every charge in the material is
            continually involved in an enormous energy reaction with its
            local active vacuum. </p>
          <p>This continual giant energy interaction of every charge
            with the seething vacuum is already well-known in modern
            quantum field theory. E.g., quoting Aitchison: </p>
          <p>"...the concept of a 'single particle' actually breaks down
            in relativistic quantum field theory with interactions,
            because the interactions between 'the particle' and the
            vacuum fluctuations (or virtual quanta) cannot be ignored."
            [I. J. R. Aitchison, "Nothing's Plenty: The Vacuum in Modern
            Quantum Field Theory," Contemporary Physics, 26(4), 1985, p.
            357.]. </p>
          <p><b>A Little Corroborating Information</b> </p>
          <p>Indeed, I found an obscure bit of information that seems
            directly related to proving the concept. We urge other
            investigators to further investigate this effect. Quoting: </p>
          <p>"infrared Tourmaline is the only mineral to show permanent
            electricity on the earth and is also a natural
            (non-manufactured) source of negative ions and far infrared
            (FIR) rays. </p>
          <p>Around 1986, it was found in a research station in Japan
            that, even though tourmaline was broken down in smaller
            pieces, a positive and a negative electrode existed on both
            ends of the crystal, and the electrodes never disappeared
            unless tourmaline was boiled near 1000°C. </p>
          <p>In addition, when the positive and the negative electrodes
            of a tourmaline crystal were connected to each other, it was
            proven to show low electricity of 0.06mA." </p>
          <p>We suspect that the vast new phenomena uncovered in
            nanocrystalline research will also probably have similar
            "self-powering DC battery" capabilities in some cases. </p>
          <p>At any rate, altering the layering characteristics of the
            wafer material used by DeGeus provides a broken symmetry in
            its usual equal-and-opposite cross currents. This asymmetry
            results in the little DeGeus solid state wafer pouring out a
            net steady lateral DC current at a given steady voltage. In
            short, it becomes a "perpetual battery" type of device,
            gating and pouring out steady and directly usable net DC
            power, and fed by energy from the seething vacuum reaction
            due to that organized broken symmetry. </p>
          <p><b>Proposed Explanation of the "Self-Powering Battery"</b>
          </p>
          <p>Physics already tells us that, when we have a broken
            symmetry, then something previously virtual becomes
            observable. So when we have a power supply using the normal
            proven asymmetry of opposite charges (its dipolarity), it
            will be receiving input energy from the virtual state
            vacuum, cohering it to quantum size, and emitting it as
            real, observable EM energy. E.g., quoting Nobelist Lee: </p>
          <p>"the violation of symmetry arises whenever what was thought
            to be a non-observable turns out to be actually an
            observable." [T. D. Lee, Particle Physics and Introduction
            to Field Theory, Harwood Academy Publishers, Chur, New York,
            and London, 1981, p. 181.] </p>
          <p><b>DeGeus Wafers and the Purpose of his Planned Trip</b> </p>
          <p>DeGeus appears to have readily achieved different voltages
            and currents (different levels of power) by grouping,
            multiple-layering, etc. ­ much like connecting or grouping
            individual batteries. The novelty was that the inventor had
            discovered how to build these wafers extremely cheaply ­
            couple bucks each for a small one, with an assembly of them
            for greater power just requiring multiples of the basic
            cost. </p>
          <p>He is believed to have been from a well-to-do European
            family with significant assets in South America. His family
            is reported to have claimed the body and officially tied up
            all his assets, effects, records, etc. The legal ongoings
            are likely to permanently suppress any and all technical lab
            notes, descriptions, etc. </p>
          <p>Unknown to the authorities investigating his death, DeGeus
            was on his way to Europe to receive very substantial funding
            to put his invention into mass production and marketing. </p>
          <p><b>Importance of the DeGeus Invention</b> </p>
          <p>As an example of the importance of this probably-now-lost
            "free energy from the vacuum" invention, consider an
            electric car with a much smaller DeGeus wafer assembly
            "battery pack" using self-powering "batteries" taking all
            their energy output continually from the seething vacuum. As
            can be seen, suddenly one has eliminated the recharging of
            batteries for the electric car, and is now using a
            "permanent, self-powering battery" instead. Thus one has
            achieved the dream of a "self-powering electric auto",
            taking all its input energy cleanly from the active vacuum
            environment itself, without need of burning physical fuel to
            run the car or recharge the battery. In short, a car also
            without harmful emissions that damage and pollute the
            biosphere and contribute to global warming. </p>
          <p>Use of a larger DeGeus battery, together with an
            alternator, would also produce a self-powering unit capable
            of powering the average home with AC power. Many other
            applications are obvious, as is also the tremendous impact
            of such a developed technology upon our present consumption
            of hydrocarbon fuels, nuclear fuel rods, etc. </p>
          <p><b>If Assassination, Explanation of How It Was Done</b> </p>
          <p>So a question arises as to whether this was just a simple
            "accidental" heart attack, or whether it could have been a
            very professional assassination to suppress the inventor and
            his invention. While we cannot definitively answer that
            question, we can explain exactly how such an assassination
            could have been done, which would have given the victim a
            massive heart attack or stroke or both, resulting in his
            death. </p>
          <p>The standard method of assassination to provide a certified
            autopsy report of "death by natural causes" is the little EM
            beam "shooter" using the Venus ECCM technique --­ i.e.,
            warping of its wavefront ­-- to destroy the body's control
            of its heartbeat. There are two basic sizes: One is about
            the size of a dime-store pocketbook, and has an effective
            range of something like 30 feet or so. The other is the size
            of a bazooka (shoulder-held rocket launcher) and its beam is
            effective at a range of about 200 feet or so. It also is
            often used with infrared sighting, to fire through a wall at
            a person (say, in a room on the second floor) by aiming at
            his infrared change and signature detected outside the
            building. </p>
          <p>A person struck by this Venus-technique warped wavefront
            beam has a sudden interruption of all control of his
            heartbeat, and so his heart goes into instant, uncontrolled,
            and violent fibrillation. Exposure to the main beam for 10
            seconds or more is almost certain to result in death of the
            individual, by a resulting massive heart failure, stroke, or
            both. </p>
          <p>My colleague Ken Moore and I were struck with just such a
            beam from a small Venus beam shooter, in the inside breast
            coatpocket of the assassin, in a restaurant here in
            Huntsville several years ago. We both felt the beam and the
            instant fibrillation. I personally saw the assassin, about
            20 feet away from us and well-dressed in suit and tie, pull
            back his coat front and point that book-sized shooter at us.
            Fortunately we were seated right beside the emergency exit
            from the dining room, and I knew about Venus technique
            shooters and their drastic effects. So we just immediately
            jumped right through that exit, setting off all the alarms,
            but getting out of the beam in just a few seconds. So we
            lived to tell the tale. </p>
          <p>If this were indeed used in the DeGeus death case, it would
            have been very simple for the assassin to simply approach
            him while he was still sitting in his just-parked car, hit
            him with the beam and hold it on him for, say, 30 seconds to
            a minute, then close his coat and simply walk away. And no
            one would have been the wiser, till the victim was found by
            someone in his car, either dead or dying. </p>
          <p>There is the information for the reader's review. The
            reader will have to make up his own mind as to what probably
            really happened, and whether it was truly an act of nature
            (a normal heart attack) or a deliberately induced heart
            failure (an assassination using the standard Venus shooter).
          </p>
          <p><b>Other Similar Incidents</b> </p>
          <p>There are of course other incidents similar to this. Stan
            Meyer, a well-known inventor who apparently got his watergas
            working well, rushed from a restaurant and shouted "They're
            killing me!" (Some reports stated he shouted "They're
            poisoning me"), and then collapsed and died. Simply Google
            on the web, for many articles on Stan Meyer, his invention,
            the threats to his life, and his strange death. </p>
          <p>An Australian researcher and friend of mine also had a
            colleague who was assassinated in an upstairs room by a shot
            from the street below, using the larger bazooka-sized Venus
            shooter. The other persons there actually observed the
            assassin load the bazooka-shaped shooter back into his
            vehicle and speed away. </p>
          <p><b>In Conclusion</b> </p>
          <p>All we can state for certain is that (1) lots of inventors
            of successful watergas, self-powering systems, etc. have
            been severely warned or in some cases killed. (2) Many other
            "free energy from the active medium" inventors have been
            threatened, bought out, or killed ­ or experienced a
            mysterious death (we tell neophytes to be careful, else one
            can have a "sudden suicide" on one's way to the
            supermarket!) (3) The Venus electronic countermeasures
            technique is well-known and established. (4) I have
            personally experienced just such an assassination attempt,
            with my good friend Lieutenant Colonel (retired) Ken Moore
            with me and also experiencing the weapon effects and our
            very rapid escape in the nick of time. So I have a
            corroborating witness. </p>
          <p>Nonetheless, the interested reader will have to take it
            from there and draw his or her own conclusions about the
            DeGeus incident. Was it just a curious natural heart attack,
            or was it a deliberate assassination? </p>
          <p>Hopefully, time will tell. </p>

            <b>Pure Energy Systems News 2007</b></p>
          <p>WBTV reported death as "most likely not a homicide." </p>
          <p>On Nov. 11, inventor of a revolutionary, affordable, clean
            energy technology, Arie M. DeGeus was found slumped in his
            car, totally unresponsive, in the long-term parking lot of
            the Charlotte Douglass International Airport in North
            Carolina.&nbsp; He was taken to the hospital and died a
            short time later.&nbsp; The autopsy suggested heart failure,
            so officials were saying the death was a result of a medical
            problem or natural causes, and not likely to be a homicide.
            (Ref.; ref.) </p>
          <p>Those who were involved with his research are doubtful,
            citing, among other things, that he had been in good health
            at around age forty five.&nbsp; The timing is also
            suspicious.&nbsp; He was apparently on his way to Europe
            where he was to secure major funding for the development and
            commercialization of his technology, which could make oil
            obsolete. </p>
          <p>Charlotte Macklenburg Police detective, M. Conner, said
            that it would be a while yet before the toxicology report
            comes in on this case. </p>
          <p>Tom Bearden, a well-known figure in the cutting-edge, clean
            energy technology industry, wrote a lengthy report on the
            inventor, his death, and his technology.&nbsp; He said: </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "DeGeus was the inventor of a thin
            wafer-like material/device that somehow specially aligned
            the atoms or electron currents ongoing in that material, so
            that the wafer produced a constant amperage at a small
            voltage – continuous real power, or in other words a strange
            kind of “self-powering battery”. </p>
          <p>Bearden also speculates about the cause of death, citing a
            technology that shoots an electromagnetic beam that destroys
            the body's control of its heartbeat.&nbsp; He said there are
            two basic sizes of the Venus ECCM technique.&nbsp; One has a
            range of around thirty feet, and the other, about the size
            of a bazooka, has an effective range of around 200 feet. </p>
          <p>Bearden claims to have been hit with such a device along
            with his colleague Ken Moore while at a restaurant several
            years ago.&nbsp; They felt the fibrillation and saw the
            would-be assassin about 20 feet away, with his suit coat
            pulled back, exposing a book-sized shooter.&nbsp;
            Fortunately, they were near an emergency exit and were able
            to get away before a lethal dose was received. </p>
          <p>DeGeus had been in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago,
            demonstrating the technology to some people who were also
            seeking to raise money for its advancement.&nbsp; That group
            said that DeGeus was not the only person who knew how the
            technology works, and they hope to see it go ahead even
            though DeGeus is no longer around. </p>
          <p>The above information has been brought to the attention of
            the Charlotte media and police. </p>

          </p>
          <p><br>
            The background of this Invention relates mostly to
            astronomical observations, some of which are of the last few
            decades.<br>
            <br>
            It has been noted that when looking at the Abundancy<br>
            Curve of the elements, which are known to exist in our
            universe, that the elements Li, Be and B are very scarce in
            relation to their location in the Periodical System. (See<br>
            Fig. 1; the Abundancy Curve of the elements). There must be
            reasons for this. The factors: pressure, temperature and
            other parameters e. g. certain configurations in their
            respective nuclei, whereby these named elements are being
            converted, apparently are occurring rather frequently in
            many locations in the universe, wherefore we can assume that
            the values of the factors which allow conversions of these
            elements, either'upwardly'via nucleo-synthesis processes
            into heavier elements, or'downwardly'by means of fission to
            hydrogen or helium or isotopes thereof (He2, He2, H3, HI2,
            Hl) are favorable for such conversions to take place. Also
            it became clear to Inventor that certain isotopes of Li, Be
            and B can act as catalysts in certain processes. Whereas
            these elements carry few electrons, their nuclei are easily
            approachable by elementary "particles", e. g. protons. In
            this Invention use is made of the properties of certain
            isotopes of Li, Be and B, which carry an extra neutron, in a
            function as"nucleonic catalysts". This is a new concept; so
            far catalysts always only referred to actions by electrons
            in the outer shell of atoms.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore in a different category of astronomical
            observations in deep space, (in numerous locations by now)
            but also in solar flares in the corona of the sun, spectral
            lines were found which can be attributed to hydrogen in the
            extreme left W and in the Soft X-ray areas. These lines
            correspond with photon energies which are greater than those
            we are familiar with in the Lyman series. We hereby refer to
            observations which were made by Labov and Bowyer and by
            Golub and Pasachoff; (See: Labov, S., Bowyer, S.,
            1991,"Spectral Observations in the extreme Ultra-Violet
            background", The Astrophysical Journal, 371, pp. 810-819)
            and also: Golub, L., Pasachoff, J. M., 1997, The Solar<br>
            Corona", Chapter 9.3 and in particular p. 294 (Table 9.4),<br>
            The Cambridge University Press, all of which corroborate
            hydrogen lines in the extreme UV and Soft X-ray areas.<br>
            <br>
            Insertion'of these newly found energy data into the Rydberg
            formula, show correspondence with values for n, which are to
            be fractions instead of whole numbers. (n is the quantum
            level number). The Rydberg formula is shown herewith:<br>

            quantum-levels below the so called"ground-state"and for the
            forms of hydrogen whereby its electron is at quantumlevels
            below the"ground-state"a new name has come into place for
            the whole group, namely"fractional hydrogen''.<br>

            function of the quantum-level is valid: aH=. 053xn2x10-9m
            and for the orbit velocity as function of the quantum-level
            we have: v(n)=e 1 = 2.2x106x1m.sec-1. (5)<br>

            Laboratory runs with the processes, which are the subject of
            this Invention indicate that a mixture of various
            "fractional states''is simultaneously being formed and also
            that those states appear to be very stable. This was proven
            in many lab experiments during the second half of the year
            2000. Therefore we can say that the"ground- state''is that
            stable state with the highest possible energy. (The "excited
            states" have still more energy, but they are not stable). If
            various"fractional states"exist together or are brought
            together in process, then reactions between those states can
            occur, which result in further ionization and further
            lowering of quantum-level, while photons are being produced.
            The following general formulation for these reactions is: H
            ("J)(".)+"+'+/ (6) wherein ni#n and nk &lt; ni and nk &lt;
            nj<br>
            The phenominae of these processes as are described above and
            of the processes under this Invention in general, are novel.
            Neither fission, nor fusion or chemical reactions take
            place. This Invention shows the formation of photon energy
            in a frequency range, which is safe for all biological life
            forms, including for humans. The processes involve
            conversions of hydrogen, whereby in ultimo the net produced
            photon energy comes at the expense of the constitutional
            energy'of the electron itself. The constitutional energy'of
            the electron in the"groundstate''is about 511,000 eV. For
            the fractional states" this energy becomes less as the state
            is a lower one. (See book: Fluidum Continuum Unversalis,
            Part I, Chapter 4). At this time numerous laboratory runs
            have been made (more than 1,000 hours), during which
            fractional hydrogen and photon energy were being produced.
            To date, neither Gamma rays, nor Beta radiation, nor Alpha
            particles were ever observed with running these processes.
            The produced radiation in its totality is from Blue-Violet
            to Extreme<br>
            UV-Soft X-ray. This process technology has been certified by
            the well known national laboratorium: Applied Technical<br>
            Services Inc., address: 1280 Field Parkway, Marietta, Ga.,
            30066, USA. The report number is M14343 and is dated March
            01, 2001. This report is made part of this patent
            application as Exhibit A. The composition of the totality of
            the radiation depends on the various parameters to the
            process, including materials compositions of certain parts
            of the apparatus. Inside the enclosed reactor system, which
            contains hydrogen at pressures generally lower than
            atmospheric pressure, plasma is being formed, preferably in
            the presence of Tungsten (W) after the establishment of a
            certain electro-static and electro magnetic field
            combination between the cathode and the anode. The Tungsten,
            which is being applied as a catalytic item, can have a
            variety of shapes: e. g screen, (either length-wise or
            cylindrically length-wise), or as a plurality of strips, or
            as in the shape of a coil, which gave the best results. The
            plasma in the reactor tends to mostly stay within the coil.
            Better ionization can be obtained by applying a high
            frequency AC voltage of minute power to the Tungsten
            coiling. However in the second half of the year 2000 it
            became clear that by placing the ends of the coiling close
            to the cathode and anode, there was sufficient induction in
            the coiling (caused by the electromagnetic field component),
            that satisfactory ionization resulted. The application of
            coiled Tungsten also eliminated the need for
            electro-magnetic focusing by means of so called Helmholtz
            pairs. The start-up of the discharge through the reactor
            requires a voltage which is higher than the voltage which is
            in existence during normal operation.<br>
            <br>
            When more plasma gets formed (this takes only seconds in
            case of applying Be as"nucleonic catalyst", but many minutes
            if B is used for the same function in the cathode assembly),
            then the voltage differential is lowered to a level, which
            is just sufficient to maintain a continuous discharge, which
            means continuous operation of the reactor.<br>
            <br>
            As temperatures rise in the reactor system and all processes
            run easier, then a further gradual decline of the voltage
            differential is possible; this calls for a voltage control,
            primarily based on temperature.<br>
            <br>
            In common'discharge tubes'the protons travel to the cathode
            where they pick up free electrons at the cathode surface by
            which atoms of"ground-state"hydrogen are being formed again,
            or even"excited-states" (n &gt; 1) in case of plentiful
            available energy; (high temperatures and or high voltage
            differentials within such'discharge tubes'). However if: (a)
            a more or less pulsed DC voltage is being applied, the
            character timefunction of which is important and (b) an
            additional component is made part of the cathode or is at
            least present in the surface of the cathode and which
            component causes so called"electro-negative"areas, which
            attracts protons (provided that they are at close proximity)
            without the need of an electric field whatsoever, then a
            totally different course of events takes place.
            If'bonding'to the ""electro-negative''areas, which are an
            inherent part of the additional component in the cathode,
            takes place by a certain percentage of the protons, which
            arrived at close proximity of the cathode surface, then
            after the point in time when the voltage differential is
            minimal or zero (which is caused by the intermittently
            existing electrostatic/electro-magnetic field) when the
            field returns in full force, it will take more energy for
            free electrons to bond with those protons which are held by
            the"electronegative''areas of the additional component.
            To'free' these protons more attractive force needs to be
            exerted by the free electrons, which can only be achieved by
            moving in closer to those protons (the force increases with
            the reciprocal of the square of the distance between
            electron and proton) then the orbit of the ground-state".<br>
            <br>
            Therefore the electrons must'fall'through one or more
            quantum-levels. The energy conversions which take place
            correspond with the Rydberg formula, whereby then
            "fractions''e. g. n=-, 3,. etc are to be inserted in this
            formula in order to find the photon energy levels. This
            'falling'through quantum-levels produces energy levels of
            the photons which correspond with the'depth'of the 'fall'.<br>
            <br>
            When"fractional hydrogen"is being formed then this mostly
            occurs as a simultaneous formation of various states. A
            Table, which shows a number of-'fractional states''together
            with their energy levels and energy differentials between
            the states as well as the corresponding wavelengths has been
            taken up herein and is shown as Fig. 2. Reactions
            between"fractional states''also occur simultaneous with
            first time formation of "fractional states"out of protons,
            whereby further ionization, photon emission
            and"lower""fractional states''result. The related
            formulation is equation (6).<br>
            <br>

            For all practical purposes"fractional hydrogen"is inert and
            cannot react with Oxygen anymore. It has been observed that
            when an electron'falls'to a lower quantum-level, sometimes a
            second electron can attach to the same proton, but then at a
            different quantum-level (to satisfy the "Pauli exclusion
            principle"). In this manner"Bi- electronic hydrogen''is
            being formed, the ions of which are negatively charged<br>

            According to the website of Blacklight power Inc. of<br>
            Cranbury, N. J., this firm is active in the research and
            development of new materials, which are based on negatively
            charged hydrogen ions, which this firm obtains via a
            different process method. The discovery of"Bi-electronic
            hydrogen''might also become a matter of major advance in
            chemistry.<br>
            <br>
            The negative hydrogen ion is presently subject to research
            in a number of labs around the world (e. g. reporting about
            'Vacuum-UV spectroscopy of the negative hydrogen ion',
            refs.: P. Balling et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77,2905 (1996);<br>

            Inventor expects that as result of the launching of the<br>
            FUSE satellite, which occurred on June 24,1999 (FUSE stands
            for: Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer) much insight
            will be obtained with regard to the occurrence and frequency
            levels, which go with these occurrences of the high energy
            lines in the spectrum of hydrogen, which have been called
            herein :"fractional hydrogen''lines. A report on the mission
            of the FUSE program and description of the<br>
            IDS Computer which commands the FUSE instruments, has
            recently been given by B. K. Heggestad and R. C. Moore of<br>
            Johns Hopkins University, Applied Physics Lab., Laurel,<br>
            Maryland, 20723-6099. Other institutes involved in FUSE
            related research are: Center for Astrophysics and Space<br>
            Astronomy, University of Colorado, Boulder, Co., 80304 and<br>
            Space Sciences Lab of University of California, Berkeley,<br>
            Ca., 94720. Inventor expects that after practical
            applications of the process (es) as described in this<br>
            Invention, which center on fractional hydrogen", will be
            publicly known, there will be frantic research relative to
            "fractional hydrogen''by labs worldwide. Inventor has
            indicated in FCU, Part I, Chapter 4, that theoretically 83
            quantum-levels or states of"fractional hydrogen''are<br>
            Possible. However, the reaching of very low quantum levels
            with terrestrial experiments is unlikely; very low states
            are being reached in certain locations in the cosmos.<br>
            <br>
            Protons can be bound to so called"electro-negative areas''in
            or at the outer perimeter of nuclei. Neutrons,
            being"cigar-like"in shape are equally negative at one end as
            they are positive at the other end. Nearly always the
            neutrons have their negative end more or less pointed
            towards the"geographical center''of the nucleus, whereby
            this negative end functions in keeping two protons attracted
            and located in close proximity of this negative end, which
            means that two protons can be kept in close proximity of
            each other in a nucleus. No need for a "Strong Force". This
            is the mechanism by which nuclei exist and whereby many
            positive charges/protons are kept together in a small
            location. The so called"Strong<br>
            Force"is non-existing and is a physical artifact from the
            1930-ties, which came into being by way of assumption and
            because of a lack of understanding of nuclear structure.<br>
            <br>
            "Electro-negative areas''are such areas in or at the
            perimeter of nuclei, where there is a need for energy
            inflow; this inflow can be provided by a proton or by the
            positive end of a neutron and if the scenario of this
            mechanism is enacted then the proton or the neutron (with
            its positive end) is more or less strongly bound to this
            electro-negative area. See FCU, Part II, Chapter 10,
            'Nucleosynthesis and the Elements'. Part II will be
            published by www. qreatunpublished. com during the winter of
            2001-2002. In the event that a neutron is bound to an
            "electro-negative area" (which is with its positive end),
            then the negative end of said neutron points outwardly and
            away from the center of the nucleus. This negative end then
            can easily function as a proton catcher. Use is made of this
            characteristic for the workings of the process of this<br>
            Invention.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore for nuclei to be approached by protons, it is
            important that the element has as few electrons at its
            outside/perimeter as is possible. Logically the elements:
            Li, Be, B fulfill this requirement and these elements also
            have isotopes which have an extra neutron to their nuclei.<br>
            <br>
            These isotopes are resp. Li3, Be9, Bs'and nature apparently
            agrees with the theory of nuclear structure as mentioned
            above, because it shows that these isotopes are the
            prevailing isotopes in the compositions of these elements as
            they are found in nature. The respective prevalences are:
            Li3-92. 6% ; Be9-~ 96% ; and BS'- : 1. 5%.<br>
            <br>
            These isotopes have in fact the extra neutron attached so
            that the negative end is pointed outwardly, wherefore these
            elements react so easily with other protons or neutrons,
            which in turn explains the relative scarcity of these
            elements in our universe. For the better understanding of
            the fluid-mechanical structure of the neutron and of the
            nuclei of named isotopes Li3, Be4, Bsl reference is made to
            Fig.<br>
            <br>
            3 and Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c. These structures are logical
            results of fluid mechanical physics considerations. The
            likelihood of these structures are also indicated by A. G.<br>
            <br>
            Gulko in Vortex Theory (1980). A number of analogies also
            exist in the work of M. Planck; (see: F. Winterberg, 1990 in
            Z. Naturforsch. 45: Planck Aether Model of a Unified<br>
            Field Theory and Z. Naturforsch. 46: A Model of the Aether
            comprised of Dynamic, Toroidal Vortex Rings. There are also
            numerous publications, which carry elementary physics
            subject matters, which show some aspects which relate to the
            theoretical work of this Inventor.<br>

            Inventor has greatly expanded Fluid Mechanical Physics and
            has been able to determine the dimensions and energies of
            the rotational, irrotational and helical component flows of
            the elementary"vortex toroid''. The latter is the
            basic"Closed Vortex Entity". Composites thereof, which are
            known as the particles", are built up and constituted
            by"vortex toroids''. Also the dimensions, energies and other
            factors as charge and spin of the muon neutrino, electron,
            positron, proton, neutron and meson have been determined by
            Inventor. A listing of the energies, charge and spin
            characteristics of some of the here named "particles''is
            taken up herein and shown as Fig. 10.<br>
            <br>
            Inventor also laid a"bridge"to some aspects of the
            (unnecessary) Quark Theory, which comprises other artificial
            conceptions.<br>
            <br>
            Referring to Fig. 3: The neutron is a composite particle,
            consisting of a proton and an electron, which are held
            together and simultaneously kept apart by an anti-neutrino.<br>
            <br>
            More detailed description is in FCU, Part I, Chapter 4.3 and
            in Part II. Referring to Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c, which show the
            nuclei of Li37, Be49, Bs', the reader note the positioning
            of the extra neutron to the nucleus; how it is attached and
            how it is pointed outwardly, so that a positively charged
            entity, as the proton and the positive end of the neutron,
            can be attracted. Referring to Figs. 5 and 6: these show the
            double-vortex-ring structures (or vortex pairs) of the
            proton and the electron. See FCU, Part<br>
            I, Chapters 3.3 and 3.4.<br>

            Existing, accepted physics clearly has problems in certain
            areas of application of the Bohr Theory and also z with the
            Schrodinger equation. Sub. Bohr:With--=F, then at T =OK, the
            orbital energy would be 0 and the electron would spin into
            the proton and the charges would be annihilated. This does
            not happen; wherefore Bohr is certainly wrong in the low
            temperature range. Also citing a formulation as set up by M.

            <br>
            we see that at T = OK, that there is a remaining energy
            being equal to hv -. This is in full accordance with
            Inventor's work and this 2 energy equals the total of the
            rotational, irrotational and helical component flow energies
            of the electron, which is also its basic constitutional
            energy, which is 511KeV.<br>

            Fig. 7 shows a detail drawing of a proton being in a
            "bound''status to an 11 electro-negative end''of a neutron,
            while it is being approached by a"free electron''. Note
            the"fluid flows'' ; in order to overcome the"binding
            energy''with which the considered proton is bound to
            the"electro-negative end''of the extra neutron in Be4 ; it
            must come closer to the proton than with the normal bonding
            in the"ground-state''. Therefore this electron
            must"cross"or"fall through"one or more quantum levels, which
            causes the creation of fractional hydrogen''and a photon of
            related energy. Since the ""fractional hydrogen''atom has a
            smaller size, it is more difficult to contain ;"Lower
            fractional states''can leak through certain energy barriers
            or"walls". It was observed by Inventor in lab runs with the
            process of this<br>
            Invention, wherein"fractional hydrogen"was being formed,
            that the pressure inside the totally sealed reactor lowered
            somewhat even while the temperature had increased.<br>
            <br>
            The possibility for"fractional hydrogen"to react with other
            elements e. g. O and N is virtually nill. For all practical
            purposes, the"fractional states"of hydrogen are inert.
            However'-fractional states''can react with each other, which
            is reflected in the foregoing, by formula (6). Research and
            development is being done by Blacklight<br>
            Power Inc., a New Jersey, US company, with regard to
            reactions involving"fractional states"as well as reactions
            with"Bi-electronic hydrogen, the ions of which were named
            hydrino's by Blacklight Power Inc. An invention, patented
            under US nr 6,024,935 by R. N. Mills et al. shows that the
            invention and methods which are mentioned therein are very
            different and in a different area when compared with this
            Invention and this application for patent.<br>
            <br>
            Blacklight Power Inc.'s technology which is disclosed in US
            pat. nr. relates primarily to electro-chemistry and in
            particular to electrolytic processes with potassium
            complexes.<br>
            <br>
            In lab runs with the process of our Invention it has been
            shown that"fractional states"react with each other, which
            also results in further production of protons, which in turn
            minimizes the need for electric power for the purpose of
            ionization, which is an objective and which makes that
            process-'over-unity''is reached rather easily.<br>
            <br>
            In the following there is a comparison of energy yields
            between the process of this Invention with: a.
            Thermo-nuclear Fusion b. Conventional Combustion of hydrogen
            with oxygen.<br>
            <br>
            Assume"fractional hydrogen"is being formed from the
            "ground-state" to "state" n=1/6 ; then photon energy is
            emitted of about-KeV and if the"state"of n=-were<br>
            2 9 reached then about l. lKeV is emitted. E. g. if an
            electron were to go from n=-on=-then roughly 1KeV=1.6#10-16
            Joule energy becomes available. Considering: Thermo-nuclear<br>
            Fusion in the sun: (See many publications on this subject
            matter, e. g. in Scientific American, by John Bahcall of<br>
            Cal. Tech) reactions which likely take place are:
            proton+proton#deuterium+positron+420KeV,
            proton+electron+proton &gt; deuterium+1. 44 Me V.<br>
            <br>
            This shows that the energy yield of the process of this<br>
            Invention is in the 1/1000x category compared to the yield
            of thermo-nuclear fusion in the sun and which after many
            years of research and billions of dollars of expenses has
            never been copied on any sustainable basis on earth.<br>
            <br>
            Considering: Conventional Combustion of hydrogen with
            oxygen. The energy produced by molecular hydrogen combustion
            is 51,600 BtulLb, which is 118,700 kSlkg. One mole of
            hydrogen contains 6X1023 molecules (Avogadro nr.); molecular
            weight of hydrogen being 2, means that that the energy per
            hydrogen atom is 118.7 kJ/gr, divided by 6x1023, which is
            1.2516per hydrogen atom. The conclusion is that the process
            of this Invention is in the category of producing 500-1000x
            more energy per atom of hydrogen than the combustion process
            can produce, wherefore the technology of this Invention
            provides for a'quantum leap' in progress for the production
            of energy. Recent lab runs show substantial overunity
            Outgoing electric power and heat together are substantially
            (e. g. &gt; 4 x) greater than the required ingoing electric
            power. Two control mechanisms are desirable: a. The
            intermittent addition of hydrogen be controlled by the
            pressure and possibly also by removal of "fractional and
            bi-electronic hydrogen''for temporary storage for later use
            purposes. b. The voltage differential between cathode and
            anode be controlled majorly by temperature and minorly by
            the pressure. In a newer further improved process version,
            no addition of hydrogen during operations is needed, because
            of a secondary and simultaneously running nuclear
            transmutational process which produces protons. Also protons
            are produced if some "fractional states''convert into lower
            fractional states''according to formula (6), although this
            last named process would not produce enough protons to keep
            the process continually going, wherefore the need for the
            nuclear transmutational process.<br>
            <br>
            In the event that fractional and bi-electronic hydrogen''are
            removed during process operations, then a secondary
            evacuating pump and storage are needed. Such a sub-system is
            shown in Fig. 9."Fractional hydrogen can react again
            with"ground-state"in a reactor with cathode and anode and
            having a voltage differential between those and produce
            radiative energy. Bi-electronic hydrogen can (upon
            ionization to negatively charged hydrogen ions) form new
            molecules/materials hitherto unknown.<br>
            <br>
            One can logically assume that process conditions vary widely
            as to which"nucleonic catalyst"is being used.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore many dimensional parameters and alloy
            composition parameters greatly influence the energy
            production.<br>
            <br>
            Energy is being produced in two locations: a. In the cathode
            area 40-80% of the total energy.<br>
            <br>
            Radiation is Soft X-ray, extreme W and some violet to blue.
            This radiation can be directly converted into electrical
            power by using the photo-electric effect, wherefore there
            are a photo-cathode and a photo-anode around the cathode.
            The wavelengths of this radiation is such that the
            surface-exit-energy" (is the "workfunction") of the
            electrons in certain metals, e. g. Cs, Rb, Na, K, Ba, Srhas
            been surpassed.<br>
            <br>
            The first and second fractional series" radiation can also
            free electrons out e. g. Cu and<br>
            Zn. b. In the ionization area 20-60% of the total energy.
            Radiation is from the blues to pink. This radiation is best
            used as heat, either directly or for powering a
            thermo-dynamic cycle, including a Stirling cycle.<br>
            <br>
            With reference to a., two modes of construction have proven
            to be possible. One is featuring a chamber around the
            cathode area from which it is separated by a radiation
            transmitting material, e. g. quartz. Inside the chamber are
            the photo-cathode as a shield against the outer wall of this
            chamber and the photo-anode, which can be either against the
            sides of said chamber or be a screen diametrically inside of
            the photo-cathode. The photo-anode be made of an
            electro-conductor. If the photo-cathode is covered with an
            element with a relatively low energy "workfunction", e. g.
            Cs, Rb, Na, K, Ba, Sr, then this chamber must be void of
            oxygen, wherefore it must be first evacuated and then filled
            with an inert gas, e. g. Ar. The second mode of
            construction, which was discovered in the fall of 2000 is by
            bringing the photo-cathode and photoanode inside the
            reactor, but being electro-magnetically isolated from the
            electro-static and electro-magnetic fields which exist
            between the cathode and anode in the reactor. This isolation
            is established by constructing a so called Cage of
            Faraday''around the cathode assembly, which allows
            sufficient space for the electro-static and electro-magnetic
            fields, so that protons can approach the cathode unhindered
            at all locations. The openings in the "Cage of Faraday''as
            well as the openings in the photoanode are sufficiently
            large and best also aligned with each other, so as to allow
            that radiation from the cathode can easily reach the
            photo-cathode. In operation small voltage differentials are
            in effect between the photocathode and photo-anode,
            respectively"Cage of Faraday".<br>
            <br>
            Substantial electric currents then result if sufficient
            radiation of short enough wavelengths is available. This
            electric power is electronically converted to a DC status at
            a voltage level, so that it can be directly used for
            powering the primary electrical circuit (of which the
            cathode and anode are part) and/or be stored into the
            intermediate electric power storage (small battery). If the
            electric power production is greater than the electric power
            use ("overunity"), then the excess power is available for
            whatever use. Also electric power can be substantially
            produced from that part of the radiation in the ionization
            area, which is in the 400nm-900nm range, by using
            GaAs/Gephoto-voltaic cells. The electrical output efficiency
            runs up to 20% of all radiation in the ionization area which
            is in the 400nm-900nm range. The remaining 80% becomes
            available as heat.<br>
            <br>
            Some heat is produced in the cathode area although most
            radiation in this location is of sufficiently short
            wavelengths that direct photo-electric conversion can take
            place; the majority of the heat (80% plus) is produced in
            the ionization and anode areas. This heat can be used either
            directly or for powering a cycle system (e. g. a<br>
            Stirling system). Fig. 8 shows a reactor system with an
            annular space surrounding its cathode area, from which
            photo-electricity is being produced and a jacket around the
            ionization area for the collection of the convective heat,
            which is produced by this area. Fig. 9 shows a reactor
            system, which has a diametrically enlarged cathode area in
            which the"Cage of Faraday''and photo-cathode and photoanode
            are located and from which the photo-electricity is being
            produced as well as a jacket around the ionization area for
            the collection of the convective heat, which is produced by
            this area. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 have corresponding legends,
            which are indicated as Fig. 8a and<br>
            Fig. 9a.<br>

            PROCESS DESCRIPTION<br>
            Referring to the laboratory layout as shown in Fig. 8:<br>
            By means of variac (variable tranformer) (1), transformer
            (2), bridge rectifier or'half'rectifier (diodes) (3) and
            'filter' (4), a wide range of more or less pulsed DC is
            available between cathode and anode (5). The ionization area
            (6) is shown with a Tungsten coil and high frequency power
            source (7). The latter feature is optional. (if the ends of
            the Tungsten coil are placed close to anode and cathode,
            then electric induction takes place, which has proven to be
            sufficient for the further promotion of the ionization of
            hydrogen.<br>
            <br>
            Cathode (8) is surrounded by reactor tube section (9), which
            is preferably made of quartz, which allows high
            transmissivity for UV. The annular space around (9) is
            indicated by (10); inside it has at its outer perimeter the
            photo-cathode (11), which may be made of Cu or CulZn.<br>
            <br>
            These materials allow the'photo-electric'effect to occur
            from the first"fractional series"of hydrogen on down.<br>
            <br>
            For better utilization of some longer wave-lengths in the<br>
            UV an inner surface layer (11) made up of suitable element
            (s) e. g. Ba, K, Rb, Cs is applied. The photo-anode (s) (12)
            are shown imbedded in the sides of the annular space, but
            (12) can be placed as a concentric screen (inwardly from the
            photo-cathode) as well. Because of the low values for
            the"ionization constant"of the elements e. g.<br>
            <br>
            Ba, K, Rb, Cs the annular space is filled with an inert gas
            e. g. Ar, after first having been evacuated. Both the
            reactor system (00) and annular space (10) are hooked up to
            vacuum-pump system (13). The mV gauge (14); the mAmp gauge
            (15) and Watt-integrator (16) are part of the photoelectric
            circuit; the voltage for this circuit is being supplied by
            potentiometer (17); this voltage needs to be regular fairly
            constant DC, wherefore a'filter'might be taken up in this
            circuit. Volt-meter (18), Watt-meter (19), recorder (19a)
            and mAmp.-meter (20) are part of the primary electrical
            circuit of reactor system (00). The pressure sensor-gauge
            and motorized valve (21) can cause hydrogen to be supplied
            to the reactor system at a controlled pressure level. This
            hydrogen can be supplied by either an electrolysis unit (22)
            or by a bottle (23). Thermocouples (24) give read-outs at
            (25), which is also connected to voltage control (25a). A
            jacket type heat exchanger is positioned around reactor
            system (00) and is indicated by (26). This jacket can be
            extended to include the anode area as well, so as to utilize
            most of the produced heat.<br>
            <br>
            OPERATION (The operation described below refers to the
            laboratory set-up as is shown in Fig. 8 and with the use of
            Be4 as nucleonic catalyst). (The data given herewith differ
            from data given in an prior patent application with regard
            to a largely similar patent application in the USA, which
            involves the same Invention. Reason for the different data
            is, that with the high tempo research program, which is
            connected to the patent application of this Invention,
            several process parameters were already altered,
            particularly with regard to cathode and anode compositions,
            which makes for different and more up-to-date process data).<br>
            <br>
            After evacuation of the reactor system (00) and the multiple
            purgings with hydrogen, hydrogen is let into the reactor
            system at the'early'operating pressure of 1500 mT. Also the
            annular space is evacuated and then filled with Ar.<br>
            <br>
            After applying a DC voltage differential of 500-550 Volts
            and a simultaneous super-positioned AC voltage of specific
            character of about 900 Volts, plasma is formed and shows in
            all sections of the reactor system. After a few minutes the<br>
            Voltage can be regulated back by 50-100 Volts DC. After
            this, the pressure is allowed to -increase to 2500-3000mT. A
            current establishes itself in the range of 2-5 mAmps. This
            means a power consumption of the reactor system of 1-3
            Watts. In the ionization area the plasma colors from deep
            pink, to light pink, light blue into violet. In the cathode
            area there is blue (and violet if the element Ti is part of
            the composition of the cathode), furthermore in the
            (invisible for the eye) extreme left UV and soft X-ray there
            are the first and second fractional series" (n =-resp. n
            =-in the<br>
            Rydberg formula).<br>
            <br>
            With output voltages of 2-4 Volt between photo-cathode and
            photo-anode and about 1.5 Volt between photo-cathode and
            Cage of Faraday''and mAmps ranging from 3-20 mAmps, in total
            about 20-120 mW photo-electricity was produced in the test
            with ATS in Marietta, Ga. These results have been improved
            on in April 2001 by a factor 100% plus.<br>
            <br>
            (These results were obtained with a photo-cathode existing
            of Cu only). With using elements on the photo-cathode
            surface, which have a much lower ionization constant", the
            photo-electricity can greatly increase, e. g. a factor of
            lOx. Heat production in the ionization and anode areas has
            been far over-unity"; for a section of the ionization area
            alone, a value from the test referred to, shows a 2.19
            ""over-unity''versus the power input as a whole. In a test
            in April, 2001, about 5/1 heat"over-unity''was measured.<br>
            <br>
            Total heat and electric"over-unity''with a newer test unit,
            which has several parameters substantially improved, should
            exceed 7/1. Referring to the laboratory lay-out as is shown
            in Fig. 9: Better results were obtained with it. For the
            identification of the components of the layout of Fig. 9,
            consult the legend: Fig. 9a.. Less power input is required
            with closer proximity of anode and cathode and with proper
            electric induction in the Tungsten coil for the production
            of the same power output. It was recently established that
            after extending runs into many hours, the overall production
            of heat as well as of electricity increased substantially.
            The reason for this is that gradually more"fractional
            hydrogen''of the first "fractional series"reacts
            with"ground-state"hydrogen according to formula (6) and
            forms fractional hydrogen" of the second and
            third"fractional series''. In these conversions there is
            much more photon energy becoming available: respectively
            108.8 and 204.0 eVper atom of hydrogen. For the further
            utilization of heat produced in the ionization area,
            particularly if the temperature difference over the reactor
            wall exceeds 20 C a special<br>
            Stirling system can be employed (Rentz system), which is
            relatively quite effective if only low temperature
            differentials are available. This Stirling system then in
            turn provides for shaft power. Inventor however has opted
            for the utilization of GaAslGe instead, whereby a
            photoelectric conversion efficiency of 20% or better can be
            guaranteed. The Boeing, Spectrolab Division has already
            reached a maximum conversion efficiency level of 33.2%.<br>
            <br>
            Fig. 9 also shows a secondary vacuum pump system (12), which
            is there for the purpose of collecting samples of
            ""fractional hydrogen''and or of bi-electronic hydrogen"
            into storage tank (13), for the purpose of further testing,
            either for energy generation or for new materials research
            and development.<br>
            <br>
            Clearification on the subject"Electro-negativity"
            "Electro-negativity"is that characteristic of a nucleus of
            an atom, which expresses itself as a location at or in the
            nucleus where there is a need for fluid energy inflow.<br>
            <br>
            According to Fluid-Mechanical Physics, the Introduction to
            which is described in Fluidum Continuum Universalis, Part I,
            which is a book written by Inventor (this book is available
            at www. qreatunpublished. com # 270), electrons have a
            strong need for axial/polar fluid inflow.<br>
            <br>
            The electron is also part of the neutron, in that a neutron
            is composite entity which consists of a proton at one end
            and an electron at the other end, both of which are being
            kept apart as well as together by an anti-neutrino.<br>
            <br>
            Neutrons are quite unstable when on their own (11 minutes
            half-life), but when bound in nuclei, which is via their
            negative end, which can attract one or two protons
            simultaneously, neutrons are stable. All areas at or in
            nuclei which have an electronic end exposed, which is not
            supplied with fluid energy by a closely located proton are
            ""electro-negative''areas. If these areas are accessible by
            protons then bonding with protons will occur. This process
            is one of the two which are active and responsible for
            nucleo-synthesis. Particularly the isotopes Li7, Be4B51 have
            extra neutrons to their nuclei, which provide for a greatly
            exposed negative end; these nuclei have few electrons
            attached and can easily be approached by protons.<br>
            <br>
            The elements: Cd, In, As, Sb have prevailing isotopes, which
            also have electronegative areas, however they are less
            exposed when compared with Li, Be, B ; such is the case with
            the elements Pd, Pt, they have even more than one
            electronegative area in their nuclei, but they are not
            exposed.<br>

            stimulation of zero-point energy in and absorbed by tissue
            in a plant, animal and human being and involves a primary
            permanent magnetic field introduced through the tissue with
            a superimposed variable electro-magnetic field further fed
            through the tissue for creation of considerable health
            advantages. The variable electro-magnetic field is of a
            cyclic nature, which is wave-form, sinusoidal, triangular,
            trapezoidal or rectangular, dependent upon the passage of
            time. Its amplitude and frequency are variable and
            adjsutable. A living cell (0) is present in a tissue matrix
            (1), has cell walls (2) and a moving free electron (3). It
            has a spirally shaped movement trajectory (4), positively
            charged ions (5) which surround a more or less tunnel-shaped
            induction zone (6). The symbols (PM) and (EM) indicate the
            directions of the primary permanent magnetic field and the
            electro-magnetic field. Fringe fields (C1,C2) are the cell
            limitations shown as capacitor plates of a cell and there is
            a more or less tubular area (7) with a self-inductance (Lc).
            The ohmic resistance in the cell is indicated (R) as is the
            field strength of the permanent magnetic field (H). </p>

            zero-point energy to permanent magnetic energy, to
            electro-chemical energy, to electrical direct current, with
            a resulting durably available electrical energy source. In a
            layout of the processes, the regenerative mode is seen next
            to the discharge mode, whilst in fat both modes are located
            adjacently at inter-atomic distance. In the conversion into
            electro-chemical energy at the location of the permanent
            magnetic field, the two electrodes, together with the
            intervening membrane, are permeated by an electro-chemical
            cell. The electrode pair and the intervening membrane are
            located in an electrolyte, which can be a liquid, a gel, or
            fine powder. The conversions occur in an energy cell, in
            separate sections, next to each other. The electrons can
            flow through connectors provided between the separate
            sections. The sections are positioned at inter-molecular or

          <p><b>Abstract --- </b>The invention relates to a method of
            generating energy, comprising the steps of: a. introducing
            hydrogen in a reactor vessel, the vessel comprising a
            cathode, an anode and an ionization element, the cathode
            comprising a primary and a secondary transmutational
            element, the transmutational elements having in their

            of protons, and wherein at least one neutron has a preferred
            orientation; b. Ionizing at least a part of the hydrogen
            with the ionization element to form a plasma, c. Applying a
            voltage differential across the cathode and the anode,
            causing protons to travel to the cathode and to induce a
            transmutation of the transmutational elements which combine
            to form an element of higher mass number than the mass
            number of said transmutational elements under the release of
            energy; and d. collecting heat and/or on other energy formed
            in step c. In a preferred embodiment the primary
            transmutational element comprises formula (i) or any
            combination thereof, whereas the secondary transmutational
            element comprises formula (ii) or any combination thereof. </p>
