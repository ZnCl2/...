      "One day while wandering through the Saturday markets in Glebe,
      Sydney, I spotted an interesting book on one of the stalls. Bound
      in decaying leather, with loose pages spilling from within, and
      "The Household Cyclopedia" in faded gold on the frayed spine. The
      text inside was small, but quite legible. The pages where only
      slightly splotched with stains. It was only $10. I paid.<br>
      <br>
      What a bargain! It was soon evident that this was no ordinary
      book. It was the sort of book a pioneer of the old west would have
      packed carefully into his covered wagon before heading off for a
      boondock town. It was a book for people who need to be able, if
      the circumstances demand, to amputate a limb, grow their own fibre
      for material, take care of their horses, give birth to children,
      and build houses, concoct medicines, all with the minimum of help
      from others.<br>
      <br>
      I work as a web designer, freelancing, and recently my clients
      have often left me hanging for weeks without notification. This is
      not a good thing, if you are a nail chewing workaholic like me.
      Games, even excellent ones like Descent, Doom or Sim City, only
      satisfy me for so long. They leave no tangible residue, for all
      the effort they demand. There had to be something better to do, to
      stop from going mad. One day, looking around for something to
      justify the time I was spending with an idle computer and
      perfectly good net account, I noticed the Cyclopedia again. How
      good it would be, I thought, if the contents of this noble tome
      were freely available to the world..."<br>
