      "Currently, Dr. Shealy is conducting a 5 year study on the effects
      of his RejuvaMatrix device on telomere length. Telomeres are the
      tail ends of our DNA and they shrink at the rate of approximately
      1% per year throughout our lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      The RejuvaMatr ix consists of a mat connected to a Tesla coil. The
      study member lays on the mat with the Tesla coil turned on for 30
      to 60 minutes daily. The Tesla coil outputs a high voltage, low
      current that <br>
      generates a field large enough to cover a person laying on the
      mat.<br>
      <br>
      The activating principle is the frequencies issued by the mat when
      the Tesla coil is connected and on.<br>
      <br>
      These frequencies are in the 54 to 78 gigaHertz range, the range
      at which human DNA vibrates. Two white blood cell factors,
      granulocytes and ly mphocytes, are measured to determine telomere
      length.<br>
      <br>
      Based on preliminary test results for the use of the mat in the
      prescribed manner the RejuvaMatrix appears to not only stop the
      shortening of telomeres but lengthen them."<br>

      A copper screen placed between two one inch foam pads and covered
      with crushed sapphire crystal is connected to an activated Tesla
      coil. This leads to increased telomere length in normal white
      blood cells and can be used to increase the reproductive capacity
      of cells and to delay the onset of cellular senescence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to methods and devices for extending
      the telomeres and therefore the regenerative capacity of cells.
      The invention, therefore, relates to the fields of chemistry and
      medical therapeutic and diagnostic technology.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] A copper tubing pyramid or a copper screen is placed
      between two one inch foam pads. The copper screen is covered with
      crushed quartz or sapphire crystal. Either device is connected to
      a Tesla coil.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] When the Tesla coil is activated, a field of 50 to 75
      decibels at 54 to 78 GigaHz is created for total body immersion in
      these human DNA frequencies. In 6 individuals, I measured DNA
      telomeres at baseline and 3 months later after they had used the
      device 30 to 60 minutes daily at least 5 days each week.
      Ordinarily telomeres shrink 1% each year. In 4 of the 6
      individuals, telomeres lengthened 1% and in the other 2, they did
      not shorten. This has tremendous potential for health and
      longevity. In three of the individuals who continued to use the
      invention, telomeres increased an average of 5.6%, instead of the
      expected 2% decrease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Normal human somatic cells (i.e., fibroblasts, endothelial,
      and epithelial cells) display a finite replicative capacity of
      50-100 population doublings characterized by a cessation of
      proliferation in spite of the presence of growth factors. This
      cessation of replication in vitro is variously referred to as
      cellular senescence or cellular aging. See, Goldstein, 1990,
      Science 249:1129, and Hayflick and Moorehead, 1961, Exp. Cell Res.
      25:585. The replicative life span of cells is inversely
      proportional to the in vivo age of the donor, so cellular
      senescence is believed to play an important role in aging in vivo.
      See Martin et. al., 1979, Lab. Invest. 23:86, and Schneider and
      Mitsui, 1976, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73:3584.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Cellular immortalization (the acquisition of unlimited
      replicative capacity) may be thought of as an abnormal escape from
      cellular senescence. See Shay et al., 1991, Exp. Cell Res. 196:33.
      Normal human somatic cells appear to be mortal and to have limited
      longevity. In contrast, germline and malignant tumor cells appear
      to be relatively immortal and to have indefinite proliferative
      potential. Human cells cultured in vitro appear to require the aid
      of transforming viral oncoproteins to become immortal, and even
      then, the frequency of immortalization is 10.sup.-6 to 10.sup.-7.
      See Shay and Wright, 1989, Exp. Cell Res. 184:109. Cells obtained
      from murine sources immortalize at a relatively high frequency
      without the aid of transforming oncoproteins. A variety of
      hypotheses have been advanced over the years to explain the causes
      of cellular senescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Shay et al., 1992, Experimental Gerontology 27:477, and
      Shay et al., 1991, Exp. Cell Res. 196:33, describe a two-stage
      model for human cell mortality to explain the ability of Simian
      Virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen to immortalize human cells. The
      mortality stage 1 mechanism (M1) is a mechanism by which cells
      cease to proliferate after a certain number of population
      doublings, and the biological molecules that carry out this
      mechanism appear to be the target of certain tumor virus proteins.
      An independent mortality stage 2 mechanism (M2) produces crisis in
      cells that have bypassed M1, with crisis being typified by severe
      chromosomal abnormalities and ultimately cell death. The M2
      mechanism thus prevents tumor viruses from directly immortalizing
      human cells. The papers noted above describe experiments in which
      T-antigen expression was driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus
      promoter to cause reversible immortalization of cells. SV40
      T-antigen extends the replicative life span of human fibroblasts
      by an additional 40-60%. The M1 mechanism is overcome by
      T-antigen, perhaps by binding to various cellular proteins or by
      inducing new activities to repress the M1 mortality mechanism. The
      M2 mechanism then causes cessation of proliferation, even though
      the M1 mechanism is blocked. Immortality is achieved only when the
      M2 mortality mechanism is also disrupted. The M2 mechanism appears
      to cause a dominant repression of the immortal phenotype, because
      hybrids between mortal and immortal human cells are generally
      mortal. See Pereira-Smith and Smith, 1983, Science 221:964-966. As
      described above, such hybrids between murine cells immortalize at
      a much higher frequency, so it is relatively easy to obtain
      immortal hybrids between murine to lymphocyte and myeloma cells to
      obtain immortal antibody-producing hybridomas, for instance.
      However, such hybrids are not immortal when produced with human
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The finite replicative capacity of cells may reflect the
      work of a "clock" linked to DNA synthesis at the telomeres (ends)
      of chromosomes. Thus, Harley et al., 1990, Nature 345:458, state
      that the amount and length of telomeric DNA in human fibroblasts
      decreases as a function of serial passage during aging in vitro.
      Harley, 1991, Mutation Research 256:271, describes that telomeres
      of human somatic cells act as a mitotic clock, shortening with age
      both in vitro and in vivo in a replication dependent manner and
      proposes a hypothesis for human cell aging and transformation in
      which telomeres and telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein polymerase
      involved in telomeric DNA synthesis, play a causal role in cell
      senescence and cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] PCT patent publication No. 93/23572 describes therapeutic
      and diagnostic methods relating to telomerase and telomere length.
      The publication describes oligonucleotide reagents that either
      reduce loss of telomere length during passage of cells in vitro or
      increase telomere length of immortal cells in vitro.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] There remains a need for a device that can increase
      telomere length in mortal cells and methods for extending the
      regenerative or reproductive capacity of mortal cells and hybrids
      between mortal and immortal human cells. The present invention
      meets these and other needs, as described below, first in summary
      fashion and then in detail with examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0010] A 39 inch wide one inch piece of foam, 78 inches long, has
      inside it a 36 inch copper screen, 76 inches long, with a two foot
      copper wire welded to one corner. One pound of crushed quartz or
      sapphire crystal is spread over the screen.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] An identical piece of one inch foam is glued to the bottom
      piece so that the screen is enclosed between the two pieces of
      foam.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The foam is rounded at the 4 corners and covered completely
      with a sturdy plain fabric suitable for a mattress cover with the
      copper wire coming out a small button hole opening in one corner.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The copper wire welded to the copper screen extends out a
      small button hole opening in one corner of the cover. This wire is
      connected to the Tesla coil for operation.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] Referring now to FIG. 1, an embodiment of the mat of the
      present invention is depicted. In this embodiment of the mat, the
      bottom of the mat is formed by foam pad 102. In the corner of the
      mat which has been removed for clarity it can be seen that copper
      screen 104 is disposed on foam pad 102. Crushed crystal material
      106 is disposed on the copper screen 104. A second foam pad 108 is
      disposed on top of the crystal and adhered to the bottom foam pad
      102 along the adjacent edges. A cover 110 is disposed over the
      foam pads, typically with a zipper for ease of removing the cover
      for cleaning or as otherwise necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A copper wire 112 is electrically connected to copper
      screen 104 and extends out from between foam pads 102 and 108, and
      through a hole provided in cover 110. Copper wire 112 is
      electrically connected to a Tesla coil 114. Coil 114 may be
      electrically connected to a power source by conductors 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one embodiment, the RejuvaMatrix mat consists of a two
      inch thick mat, in the center of which is a copper screening
      similar to standard window screen, on which is scattered one pound
      of crushed sapphire crystal. A copper wire is attached to the
      copper screening and exits the center of the mat to be connected
      to a standard Tesla coil. The Tesla coil has an OUTPUT of 20,000
      to 50,000 volts at frequency of approx. [1/2] megahertz. This
      output produces an electromagnetic field two feet high at 54 to 78
      GHz, 75 decibels. The 54 to 78 GHz field is equal to the resonance
      frequency of human DNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The mat is covered with standard quilted mattress material.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The top and bottom polyfoam with copper screen and sapphire
      in the center are glued together with upholstery glue. The entire
      mat is enclosed with standard quilted mattress material with an
      opening for the copper wire leading to the Tesla coil.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Telomeres ordinarily shrink by 1% annually, from birth to death.
      The telomeres of people with unhealthy habits have much faster
      shrinkage, while those of people with the best habits and genes
      shrink at a slower rate, thus enabling such people to live to
      approximately 100 years. Ultimately, telomere health is a major
      determinant of health and longevity. Rejuvenation or regrowth of
      telomeres is, therefore, a major key to longevity and health.<br>
      <br>
      In a pilot study, telomeres in 6 individuals, 3 men and 3 women
      from 50 to 74 years of age, were measured initially in lymphocytes
      and neutrophils. Each participant then spent 30 minutes at least 5
      days each week sitting or lying in an electromagnetic field of 54
      to 78 GHz, 50 to 75 decibels, or 1 billionth of a watt per
      centimeter square.<br>
      <br>
      These same frequencies are reported to be present in ambient
      sunlight at an intensity of ten-billionths of a watt per
      centimeter square. Human DNA has been reported by Ukrainian
      physicists as resonating at 54 to 78 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      After 3 months of this electromagnetically generated solar
      homeopathic approach, average telomere length had increased 1%.
      After 10 months of use of the device, average telomere length had
      increased 2.9%. Theoretically this "reverses" 2.9 years of
      telomere aging.<br>
      <br>
      Using this approach, a 75 year old would theoretically reverse
      telomere aging by 50 years within a 14 year period. Obviously,
      many other parameters of health need to be evaluated as we
      continue these studies long term.<br>

      <b>Telomere Rejuventation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1925 a Russian engineer, Georges Lakhovsky, published his
      classic book, The Creation of Health, in French. It was translated
      into English in 1935 and is still in print. He stated that human
      DNA has a resonant frequency of 50+ gigahertz (GHz – billions of
      cycles per second).<br>
      <br>
      In the early 1980s, Ukrainian physicists determined that this
      frequency was 54-78 GHz and further reported that a majority of
      illnesses were "cured" by applying these frequencies to
      acupuncture points. Lakhovsky further reported "curing" many
      illnesses, including cancer, by applying a Tesla coil to two
      copper coils placed three feet apart with patients sitting in the
      center of these coils with the head near the center of the field
      induced by the Tesla coil. Tesla coils emit a random range of
      frequencies from 1 Hz up to at least 100 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 1. A modification of the Lakhovsky apparatus</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Figure 1. A modification of the Lakhovsky apparatus.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1994, under an IRB protocol, 75 patients were treated with a
      modification of the Lakhovsky apparatus.1 Twenty-five patients
      each had rheumatoid arthritis, depression or chronic back pain.
      They sat for 60 minutes daily, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, in a 24
      inch square cubicle, 48 inches high, with copper plates on the
      walls and a copper tubing pyramid over the base so that the copper
      pyramid and the copper base were physically connected. A Tesla
      coil was connected to the copper tubing and activated during the
      treatment. At the end of 2 weeks, 70% of the patients with
      depression or rheumatoid arthritis were markedly improved but only
      half of the back patients improved (Fig. 1).<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after that, a portable transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulator (TENS) was developed. This device included output of
      54-78 GHz at 50-75 decibels of energy, the same intensity used in
      the Ukraine. Five specific acupuncture circuits were activated
      with this GigaTENS device and specifically raised the DHEA,
      neurotensin, aldosterone or calcitonin, while the 5th one lowered
      free radicals significantly. All of these studies, except for
      aldosterone, have been published.2,3,4 The circuit that raises
      DHEA was subsequently proven to treat successfully 70 to 80% of
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis, migraine, diabetic neuropathy,
      or depression. Stimulation at these frequencies also increases
      calcitonin and lowers free radicals.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the neurochemical and potential clinical benefits, most
      individuals offered the opportunity to use these circuits would
      not spend the 30 minutes daily required for such treatment. Since
      the Ukrainians had stated that these Giga frequencies are absorbed
      through the skin, specifically through acupuncture points, it
      appeared that the only reasonable way to immerse the body in these
      fields, without great effort on the part of the individual, was to
      provide the field while participants were lying down. Eventually
      this led to the creation of a 2-inch thick polyfoam mat in the
      center of which is a copper screen with crushed sapphire crystal
      placed over it. Copper wire from the center of that mat leads to
      the Tesla coil. When the Tesla coil is activated, a field of 54-78
      GHz 2 feet high and around the mat is produced. Six individuals
      volunteered to participate in the study. Blood was drawn initially
      for analysis of telomere length of granulocytes and lymphocytes.<br>
      <br>
      Three and one half months later, telomere length was measured
      again and in 4 of the 6 subjects, telomere length had increased by
      approximately 1%. At the end of 10 months, blood was again drawn
      and telomere length had increased an average of 2.9%. Telomeres
      ordinarily shrink 1% every year from birth forward.<br>
      <br>
      Telomeres are responsible not only for the length of life but also
      the integrity of DNA and thus ultimately for health itself.
      Individuals using this approach can place the 2-inch mat on top of
      their mattress, plug it into a timer that can go off in 30 to 60
      minutes while they are sleeping and obtain the benefit of "lying
      in a field effect of human DNA." Continuing studies will be done.
      All telomere blood tests were done at a reference lab, Repeat
      Diagnostics.<br>
