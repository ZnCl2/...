        <p><b><font size="+1">A System which Generates Electrical Power
              via an Accumulator that Provides the Initial Motion for
              the System</font></b> </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>This is a portable system that generates electrical power via
        an accumulator that provides the initial motion for the system.
        Two batteries are used in this system and the system is kept
        working via the initial motion provided by these batteries.
        There is no need for another transformer. This device works
        using its own mechanism and there is no need for additional
        devices. In this way, a continuous electrical power generation
        is possible. This device can work without connecting it to a
        network so it is possible to use it at places where electricity
        does not exist. Moreover, when connected to the entry of a
        building, the need for a network is avoided. This system
        generates electrical power independent of a network. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>A system which generates electrical power via an accumulator
        that provides the initial motion for the system. </p>
      <p>This is a portable system that generates electrical power via
        an accumulator that provides the initial motion for the system.
      </p>
      <p>Already existing systems can generate electrical power of whose
        duration depends on the lifetime of the battery. In these
        systems, the battery has to be reloaded in order to restart the
        system. 12V electrical power provided by the batteries used in
        cars are increased to 220 V via transformers. </p>
      <p>Two accumulators are used in out invention. The system works on
        a continuous basis after initial startup via these accumulators.
        There is no need for another transformer. Our system, which
        generates electrical power, does not need any other devices and
        it keeps on generating energy via its own mechanism. Also, the
        system works without connecting it to a network. Thus, it can be
        used at any place where no electricity exists.&nbsp;
        Nevertheless, when this system is connected to the entry of the
        buildings, there is no need for an additional network. The
        system can produce electrical power independent of a network. </p>
      <p>Below are the explanations of the figures that provide a better
        understanding about this invention. </p>

      <p>This invention is a system that starts working via the motion
        of alternator. There exist two accumulators (1), and the first
        motion provided by the accumulator is carried to the regulator.
        Contractor (6) keeps the starter dynamo working by disconnecting
        the accumulator (1) once the regulator (2) is put in. The
        voltage coming from the accumulator (1) passes through the
        regulator and the start dynamo (3/1) starts working and thus the
        feedback alternators via the gears ( 4/1-2 – 5/1-23-3 ).
        Feedback dynamo starts sending pure DC current to regulator via
        shunt (12), capacitor (14) and diode (13). It connects all the
        current that reaches to the regulator in 4 seconds and sends to
        the contactor (6). Accumulator (1) is put out by this current
        that reaches to the regulator. This current is transformed to
        the started dynamo (3/1). There becomes a transformation within
        the system. In case of electricity shortage, it keeps on working
        by using the current generated by the commitatris (7/1). </p>
      <p>Via the starter dynamo (3/1), DC is generated in the
        alternators which are connected to the gears and this current is
        transformed to the commitatris (7/1-2) and DC voltage is
        generated at commitatris (7/1-2). </p>
      <p><i>Second System</i> </p>
      <p>3 x 24 DC voltage is transformed to the second starter dynamo
        (22). Once the start dynamo works (22), a feedback dynamo (23)
        having a pulley system and a feedback dynamo (24) generating
        alternative current starts working. The feedback dynamo (23)
        starts feeding back; the feedback dynamo (24) which generates AC
        is independently generating 6 KV, 18 Amp, 50 Hz current.
        Moreover, first system produces 24 DC and 580 DC current on its
        own. </p>
      <p>The bigger the gears are, the more current is generated. </p>
      <p>This system, which is subject to our invention, can be used at
        any place. You can use it at places where there exists no
        electricity, or at places such as villages, cities, buildings,
        greenhouses where there is not network. Moreover, network is no
        more a must. Instead of a network, you can use our system. There
        is no need for gasoline when this system is used in vehicles.<br>

      <p>This technical note aims at describing a test I personally
        conducted in Izmir, Turkey on July 17, 2005. The purpose of the
        experiment was to check the energy balance with respect to input
        and output of an apparatus, which was the embodiment of the
        invention described in international patent WO 2004/091083 A1. </p>
      <p>The apparatus was confined inside a metallic box, and I was
        allowed to inspect everything outside this box. However, in
        order to protect the core ideas of the invention, I was not
        supposed to check all the details of the internal parts.
        According to the inventor the apparatus is predominantly a
        mechanical system, without any kind of energy storage inside the
        box like batteries, accumulators, flywheels, combustion motors,
        chemical or radioactive reactions. I believe the intentions of
        the inventor were in good faith. </p>
      <p>The experimental setup was quite simple, as shown schematically
        in Figure 1. It consisted of placing the box with unknown
        contents, from which DC voltages and currents were expected to
        be generated, on a table in the middle of a room. From the box,
        a cable with two terminal contacts was available for connecting
        electrical loads. I placed measurement instruments between the
        box output terminals and the load. The load consisted of an
        ordinary AC-DC inverter, this inverter being connected to an
        incandescent lamp. The working principle of the inverter and the
        lamp type were not relevant for analyzing the results, because
        the output power delivered by the box was measured immediately
        after the output terminals. Photographs of the setup are
        included in Appendix A. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1: Experimental Setup</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="1fig1.jpg" height="173" width="497"></p>
      </center>
      <p>After a short start procedure, the metallic box together with
        the lead were fully isolated from the environment (in what
        concerns other physical contacts like cable connections to the
        public mains) during the whole duration of the measurements.
        This situation is in agreement with the description given in the
        international patent [ WO 2004/091-83 ] mentioned above. Since
        the energy input entering the apparatus was quite modest, as it
        will become clear further in this note, the main issue was then
        to measure the delivered energy output. </p>
      <p>I had prepared the power measurements with care, by using
        reliable instruments I personally brought with me from my own
        university laboratory. In order to measure the DC voltage
        directly out of the positive and the negative electrical
        terminals I used two different voltmeters in parallel, one
        analog (constructed with permanent magnets and wires) and
        another digital (that employs electronic circuits to acquire and
        to display the measured values). These instruments are based on
        completely different working principles. Also for measuring the
        DC current coming out the positive terminal and entering back
        into the negative terminal, I placed two ammeters in series,
        again one analog and the other digital. If electromagnetic waves
        would interfere with the measurements, they would disturb one or
        the other instrument, but not all four pieces at the same time
        in the same way. </p>
      <p>Before starting the experiment, no kind of audible noise was
        being produced by the apparatus. Also, I measured the voltage
        differences between the internal and external connection points,
        and no potential differences between the internal and external
        connection points, and no potentials were found. So far as I
        could observe, the apparatus was completely at rest. </p>
      <p>The start procedure consisted of connecting a small 12V DC
        lead-acid accumulator to two contact points inside the box,
        during a short time interval (see Figure B1 in Appendix B). I
        observed this time interval with the help of my own watch, and
        it was more than 5 seconds, but less than 10 seconds. In later
        calculations it is reasonable to consider this start time
        interval as being equal to 8 seconds. After that, no other
        energy input was connected to the box by means of cables. </p>
      <p>Immediately after the start procedure I could hear noise as
        produced by rotating parts inside the box. The inventor
        communicated that a stabilizing time interval of about 10
        minutes should be respected before switching on the load
        (inverter plus lamp). During this interval it was possible to
        observe in both voltmeters that DC voltage was being generated
        on the terminals, which decayed slowly from 12.9 V DC to 12.5 V
        DC. The displayed values in the analog and digital instruments
        were in good match. After 10 minutes I switched on the DC
        inverter. </p>
      <p>In the following hours I observed and registered by hand the
        values of voltages and currents displayed by the instruments.
        The displayed values were quite stable; therefore I decided to
        register them first after 15 minutes, later at each half hour. </p>
      <p>From time to time I sensed the internal parts in the box with
        my hands, looking for temperature gradients, but I could not
        perceive any noticeable temperature rise with respect to the
        ambient. After 5 hours I took the decision to stop the
        measurements. </p>
      <p>Results are given in Table 1. The displayed values of both
        voltmeters and both ammeters were in good agreement (in view of
        the precision&nbsp; of the instruments), as it can be seen in
        Table 1. For this reason, I dare to conclude that the results
        I’ve registered are reliable, to the best of my knowledge. </p>
      <p>From Table 1 it is possible to see that the generated output
        voltage and current remained fairly constant during the 5 hours
        test. </p>
      <p><b>Table 1</b> </p>

        <p><img src="table1.jpg" height="553" width="714"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Remarks:</b> </p>
      <p>So far the experiment has been described. The following
        comments are my own subjective interpretation. </p>
      <p>Power calculations based on the registered values of voltages
        and currents in Table 1 lead to the conclusion that much more
        energy is delivered by the box, which was completely
        isolated&nbsp; from the environment, than the possible initial
        energy input used to start the process. For instance, the energy
        output after 5 hours is approximately given by </p>
      <p>( 12.25 V ) x ( 2.3 A ) x ( 5 x 60 x 60 s ) = 507 kJ </p>
      <p>Therefore, in order to input this same amount of energy into
        the box during the start procedure, the current that would have
        been drawn from the small 12 V lead-acid accumulator for the
        duration of 8 seconds is found to be </p>
      <p>507 kJ / ( 12 V ) x ( 8 s ) = 5280 A </p>
      <p>which is physically not possible to realize considering the
        volume of the accumulator and the simple connector contacts
        shown in Appendix B! </p>
      <p>Considering the inventor’s assurance that the apparatus is
        mainly a mechanical device, and that no kind of energy storage
        was implemented inside the box, it isn’t clear where the
        measured excess of energy out of the box is coming from ---
        whether out of electromagnetic fields or as the result of some
        anomaly associated with rotating bodies in terms of inertia.
        This is a most interesting phenomenon, which deserves further
        attention. </p>
      <p>After analyzing the results in detail, together with the
        drawing and explanations provided by the inventor (see Appendix
        C), it was possible to recognize from the schematics certain
        mechanical structures, the so-called homopolar machines, turning
        at high speed of rotation. </p>
      <p>This is a really exciting idea because a link could be
        established between the apparatus under observation and a famous
        experiment performed in 1831 by Michael Faraday, the inventor of
        the electrical machines. In the academic literature this old
        experiment is known as the Paradox of Faraday’s Disk. </p>
      <p>Indeed, many other scientists hypothesize about the possibility
        of constructing homopolar machines with efficiency above 100%
        (see, for instance, the paper of Brice DePalma, "On the
        Possibility of Extraction of Electrical Energy Directly from
        Space" in the academic journal <i>Speculations in Science and
          Technology</i>, Sept. 1990, Vol. 13, No. 4…) [ see also:
        http://www.rexresearch.com/depalma/depalma.htm ]. However, up to
        the present time nobody has demonstrated in a convincing way a
        practical application of the principle. Perhaps the inventor has
        discovered the missing link in these machine; who knows?… </p>
      <p>Of course, the straightforward way to check this possibility
        would be to inspect the contents inside the box. However, the
        inventor is only willing to allow that after a solid commitment
        with a research institution or an industrial partner. </p>
      <p>So, the next step would be to exclude the possibility of some
        kind of conventional electrochemical energy processing inside
        the apparatus. For this purpose the realization of another
        experiment, similar to the one described above, would be
        advisable, but not without long run-time of measurements. The
        results should convince that, indeed, it is not possible to get
        the same energy output with the best commercially available
        battery. Therefore, a new experiment may take many days (about 4
        or 5) to be executed. </p>

              that interacts with a stationary magnetic field. The
              device comprises a rotor (1) and a stator (2) disposed
              coaxially to a rotatably mounted shaft (5). The rotor (1)
              comprises one or more first magnet sequences and the
              stator (2) one or more second magnet sequences. The first
              and second magnet sequences each comprise two or more
              dipole magnets, the arrangement and orientation of which
              may vary. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></b><br>
