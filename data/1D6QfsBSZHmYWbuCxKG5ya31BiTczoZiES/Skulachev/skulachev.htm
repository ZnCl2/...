      <b>SkQ (10-(6'-Plastoquinonyl)decyltriphenyl-phosphonium)</b>
      stands for a class of organic molecules composed of a large
      organic cation (often called "penetrating cation" for the ability
      to penetrate through lipid bilayer) with antioxidant plastoquinone
      attached to it. When added to a living cell, penetrating cations
      are distributed according to the transmembrane electrical
      potential difference. They traverse across the cell membrane
      (negatively charged from inside) and accumulate in mitochondria
      (also negatively charged inside). The concentration of a
      penetrating cation in mitochondria can be more than 1000-fold
      higher than its extracellular concentration.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><br>
      </div>
      <b>SkQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was proposed that penetrating cations can act as "electric
      locomotive molecules" and target molecules attached to them in
      mitochondria.[1] Monitoring the distribution of
      plastoquinonyl-decyl-rhodamine 19 (SkQR1), a fluorescent SkQ,
      confirmed that it accumulated almost exclusively in mitochondria.
      Measurements of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production
      revealed that SkQ is a very efficient antioxidant, even when added
      to the cells in the nanomolar concentration range.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SkQ as a potential anti-aging drug</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria may
      contribute to senescence. Reactive oxygen species damage
      mitochondrial DNA and other important cell component, leading to
      gradual impairment of cellular function. Antioxidants may slow
      this damage. Several studies indicate that SkQ can efficiently
      protect the cell from oxidative damage (see [2] for a review).<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Antioxidants specifically addressed to mitochondria have been
      studied to determine if they can decelerate senescence of
      organisms. For this purpose, a project has been established with
      participation of several research groups from Russia and some
      other countries. This paper summarizes the first results of the
      project. A new type of compounds (SkQs) comprising plastoquinone
      (an antioxidant moiety), a penetrating cation, and a decane or
      pentane linker has been synthesized. Using planar bilayer
      phospholipid membrane (BLM), we selected SkQ derivatives with the
      highest permeability, namely
      plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (SkQ1),
      plastoquinonyl-decyl-rhodamine 19 (SkQR1), and
      methylplastoquinonyldecyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ3). Anti- and
      prooxidant properties of these substances and also of
      ubiquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (MitoQ) were tested in
      aqueous solution, detergent micelles, liposomes, BLM, isolated
      mitochondria, and cell cultures. In mitochondria, micromolar
      cationic quinone derivatives were found to be prooxidants, but at
      lower (sub-micromolar) concentrations they displayed antioxidant
      activity that decreases in the series SkQ1=SkQR1&gt;SkQ3&gt;MitoQ.
      SkQ1 was reduced by mitochondrial respiratory chain, i.e. it is a
      rechargeable antioxidant. Nanomolar SkQ1 specifically prevented
      oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin. In cell cultures, SkQR1, a
      fluorescent SkQ derivative, stained only one type of organelles,
      namely mitochondria. Extremely low concentrations of SkQ1 or SkQR1
      arrested H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in human fibroblasts and HeLa
      cells. Higher concentrations of SkQ are required to block necrosis
      initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the fungus
      Podospora anserina, the crustacean Ceriodaphnia affinis,
      Drosophila, and mice, SkQ1 prolonged lifespan, being especially
      effective at early and middle stages of aging. In mammals, the
      effect of SkQs on aging was accompanied by inhibition of
      development of such age-related diseases and traits as cataract,
      retinopathy, glaucoma, balding, canities, osteoporosis, involution
      of the thymus, hypothermia, torpor, peroxidation of lipids and
      proteins, etc. SkQ1 manifested a strong therapeutic action on some
      already pronounced retinopathies, in particular, congenital
      retinal dysplasia. With drops containing 250 nM SkQ1, vision was
      restored to 67 of 89 animals (dogs, cats, and horses) that became
      blind because of a retinopathy. Instillation of SkQ1-containing
      drops prevented the loss of sight in rabbits with experimental
      uveitis and restored vision to animals that had already become
      blind. A favorable effect of the same drops was also achieved in
      experimental glaucoma in rabbits. Moreover, the SkQ1 pretreatment
      of rats significantly decreased the H(2)O(2) or ischemia-induced
      arrhythmia of the isolated heart. SkQs strongly reduced the
      damaged area in myocardial infarction or stroke and prevented the
      death of animals from kidney ischemia. In p53(-/-) mice, 5
      nmol/kgxday SkQ1 decreased the ROS level in the spleen and
      inhibited appearance of lymphomas to the same degree as
      million-fold higher concentration of conventional antioxidant NAC.
      Thus, SkQs look promising as potential tools for treatment of
      senescence and age-related diseases.<br>

      Our project is built around the concept of genetically programmed
      aging.<br>
      <br>
      Skulachev ions project (or SkQ project)&nbsp; is a coordinated
      effort to develop a pharmaceutical intervention that would able to
      slow down or even stop the execution of aging program in human
      organism. Our goal is to prolong the health span - period of
      healthy, productive and happy living. There is a lot of data
      indicating that the process of biological aging is mediated by
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated in the most important
      cellular organelle – mitochondrion. We based our work on the
      assumption that a controlled decrease in mitochondrial ROS
      production may result in deceleration of aging and at the same
      time may help with treatment of various age-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      We have created a potent mitochondrially targeted antioxidant SkQ1
      to counter excess of mitochondrial ROS and developed several
      pharmaceutical formulations based on this active compound.<br>
      <br>
      The project is based Moscow State University and operated by the
      university spin-off company Mitotech. Many laboratories, CROs,
      clinical hospitals in Russia, US, EU, Australia and other
      countries participate in the research and development of SkQ-based
      pharmaceuticals.<br>

      In 2004, a new substance called SkQ1 was synthesized in the group
      of professor Vladimir P. Skulachev in the Moscow State University.
      ” The name SkQ1 was given to the substance as the first
      representative of a particularly potent class of molecules named
      “SkQ” – the term introduced by the team to describe molecules
      containing ion Sk an a quinone.<br>
      <br>
      A part of SkQ1 coined “Skulachev ion” or Sk functions as a
      molecular “locomotive” or “towing truck” carrying the other part
      of the molecule – an extremely active antioxidant plastoquinone –
      into mitochondria. Both theoretical calculations and experimental
      results showed that SkQ1 is delivered into mitochondria in an
      extremely targeted and efficient manner. The physics of
      mitochondrial membrane and the unusual properties of “Skulachev
      ions” direct SkQ1 into the inner leaflet of the inner
      mitochondrial membrane with high precision.<br>
      <br>
      Presence of SkQ1 in mitochondrial membrane enables mitochondria to
      protect itself from reactive oxygen species (ROS) by breaking
      chain reaction of lipid destruction. This ability of our molecule
      to protect cells against oxidative stress plays a very important
      role in treating patients suffering from various age-related
      disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative
      disorders and various ophthalmic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      But our technology does not end there. Developing methods for
      effective delivery of mitochondrially addressed antioxidants into
      organism is another challenging task. Mitotech successfully solved
      this complex problem for a variety of therapeutic areas and
      designed several SkQ1-based pharmaceutical products going through
      various stages of clinical development.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Anti-Ageing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been hypothesized that age-dependent accumulation of
      oxidative damages in living organisms may be the main cause of
      ageing process. It might be possible to control this damage
      accumulation through controlling the level of ROS production in
      mitochondria. It is important to stress that ROS production should
      be controlled, not stopped, so that ROS can still fulfill a number
      of crucial biological functions. For instance they fight bacteria
      and viruses, both directly – via elimination of pathogens, – and
      indirectly – via regulation of the immunological response to
      infection through triggering apoptosis (cell death).<br>
      <br>
      Antioxidants are a well−developed pharmacological approach to
      fight against ROS. A possible role of antioxidants in controlling
      ageing process has widely and for a long time been discussed with
      ambiguous conclusions, ranging from the statement of the American
      biochemist Prof. Bruce Ames and colleagues on finding a new
      anti−ageing therapy with a 100% positive result to D. Howes’s
      implication of the utter barrenness of this method, and,
      therefore, of total failure of Harman’s “free radical” hypothesis.
      According to Dr. Skulachev the antioxidant−based ageing control
      approach has some significant flaws.<br>
      <br>
      The “ideal” antioxidant should be specifically targeted to
      mitochondria where ROS are produced and it should effectively
      remove not all the ROS but just their excess. It is also important
      for an antioxidant not to be toxic and not to be recognized and
      eliminated by cell enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      With these criteria fulfilled, a successful anti-oxidant compound
      should be able to prevent/repair oxidative damage in organism and
      prevent/treat many age-related disorders across various
      therapeutic areas. <br>

      healing of full-thickness dermal wounds in mice and rats.
      Treatment with nanomolar doses of SkQ1 in various formulations
      accelerated wound cleaning and suppressed neutrophil infiltration

      formation of granulation tissue and increased the content of
      myofibroblasts in the beginning of regenerative phase of wound
      healing. Later this effect caused accumulation of collagen fibers.
      Local treatment with SkQ1 stimulated re-epithelization of the
      wound. Lifelong treatment of mice with SkQ1 supplemented with
      drinking water strongly stimulated skin wounds healing in old (28
      months) animals. In an in vitro model of wound in human cell
      cultures, SkQ1 stimulated movement of epitheliocytes and
      fibroblasts into the "wound". Myofibroblast differentiation of
      subcutaneous fibroblasts was stimulated by SkQ1. It is suggested
      that SkQ1 stimulates wound healing by suppression of the negative
      effects of oxidative stress in the wound and also by induction of

      <br>
      Mitochondria generate a lot of free radicals so need a constant
      supply of antioxidants to keep these free radicals in check. MitoQ
      is an antioxidant that has been formulated to get past the inner
      mitochondrial membrane to end up deep within the mitochondria. It
      releases the active form of coenzyme Q10 right at the major site
      of free radical production, and reduces oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      Mitochondria are one of the most important components of a cell.
      Without them, many crucial biochemical processes would not happen.
      Not only do they host cellular respiration, the process by which
      our bodies convert food into energy for the cell, they also send
      messages to other components within the cell, tailor the cell to
      perform specific functions, and control both cell growth and cell
      self-destruction.<br>
      <br>
      Being responsible for so much comes at a cost. Biochemical
      reactions generate free radicals as by-products. While free
      radicals do have some important benefits when present in the right
      numbers, overproduction of free radicals can lead to severe damage
      of the cell. Unfortunately, over production commonly occurs.
      Aging, exposure to environmental toxins and pollution and a poor
      diet can all increase levels of free radicals in our body or cause
      underproduction of our body’s own antioxidants, such as coenzyme
      Q10 (Co Q10). When free radicals are left unchecked this can lead
      to oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      Which is why developing compounds that target mitochondria makes a
      lot of sense. Because so many different biochemical processes
      occur within mitochondria, they generate a lot of free radicals.
      Mito-Q is a revolutionary mitochondrial-targeted compound that
      acts directly in mitochondria as an antioxidant against free
      radicals.<br>
      <br>
      MitoQ is produced by binding a form of Co Q10 called ubiquinone,
      to a fat soluble, positively-charged molecule. This positively
      charged molecule is able to flow directly into the mitochondria
      and through the normally impermeable inner membrane to end up deep
      inside the mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      The inside of the mitochondria and inner membrane is the major
      site for biochemical reactions inside the mitochondria, including
      cellular respiration. This puts MitoQ exactly where it is needed
      the most, at concentrations several hundred-fold higher than if it
      just stayed in the blood. A reaction inside the inner membrane
      converts the ubiquinone in MitoQ into ubiquinol, the antioxidant
      and active form of Co Q10. This allows it to neutralise free
      radicals that accumulate within the mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      MitoQ is one of the most-studied mitochondrial-targeted
      antioxidants. Research has shown that after oral administration,
      MitoQ rapidly accumulates in mitochondria-rich tissue such as the
      heart, brain, skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney and supports a
      range of conditions associated with oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      You can boost your own natural levels of Co Q10 with MitoQ. When
      taken alongside a healthy diet and exercise it can reduce damage
      to your cells inflicted by free radicals.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Antioxidants specifically addressed to mitochondria have been
      studied to determine if they can decelerate senescence of
      organisms. For this purpose, a project has been established with
      participation of several research groups from Russia and some
      other countries. This paper summarizes the first results of the
      project. A new type of compounds (SkQs) comprising plastoquinone
      (an antioxidant moiety), a penetrating cation, and a decane or
      pentane linker has been synthesized. Using planar bilayer
      phospholipid membrane (BLM), we selected SkQ derivatives with the
      highest permeability, namely
      plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (SkQ1),
      plastoquinonyl-decyl-rhodamine 19 (SkQR1), and
      methylplastoquinonyldecyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ3). Anti- and
      prooxidant properties of these substances and also of
      ubiquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium (MitoQ) were tested in
      aqueous solution, detergent micelles, liposomes, BLM, isolated
      mitochondria, and cell cultures. In mitochondria, micromolar
      cationic quinone derivatives were found to be prooxidants, but at
      lower (sub-micromolar) concentrations they displayed antioxidant
      activity that decreases in the series SkQ1 = SkQR1 &gt; SkQ3 &gt;
      MitoQ. SkQ1 was reduced by mitochondrial respiratory chain, i.e.
      it is a rechargeable antioxidant. Nanomolar SkQ1 specifically
      prevented oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin. In cell
      cultures, SkQR1, a fluorescent SkQ derivative, stained only one
      type of organelles, namely mitochondria. Extremely low
      concentrations of SkQ1 or SkQR1 arrested H2O2-induced apoptosis in
      human fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Higher concentrations of SkQ are
      required to block necrosis initiated by reactive oxygen species
      (ROS). In the fungus Podospora anserina, the crustacean
      Ceriodaphnia affinis, Drosophila, and mice, SkQ1 prolonged
      lifespan, being especially effective at early and middle stages of
      aging. In mammals, the effect of SkQs on aging was accompanied by
      inhibition of development of such age-related diseases and traits
      as cataract, retinopathy, glaucoma, balding, canities,
      osteoporosis, involution of the thymus, hypothermia, torpor,
      peroxidation of lipids and proteins, etc. SkQ1 manifested a strong
      therapeutic action on some already pronounced retinopathies, in
      particular, congenital retinal dysplasia. With drops containing
      250 nM SkQ1, vision was restored to 67 of 89 animals (dogs, cats,
      and horses) that became blind because of a retinopathy.
      Instillation of SkQ1-containing drops prevented the loss of sight
      in rabbits with experimental uveitis and restored vision to
      animals that had already become blind. A favorable effect of the
      same drops was also achieved in experimental glaucoma in rabbits.
      Moreover, the SkQ1 pretreatment of rats significantly decreased
      the H2O2 or ischemia-induced arrhythmia of the isolated heart.
      SkQs strongly reduced the damaged area in myocardial infarction or
      stroke and prevented the death of animals from kidney ischemia. In
      p53−/− mice, 5 nmol/kg × day SkQ1 decreased the ROS level in the
      spleen and inhibited appearance of lymphomas to the same degree as
      million-fold higher concentration of conventional antioxidant NAC.
      Thus, SkQs look promising as potential tools for treatment of
      senescence and age-related diseases.<br>

      <br>
      In 2004, a new substance SkQ1 was synthesized by the group of
      professor Vladimir P. Skulachev in the Moscow State University. A
      part of SkQ1, coined “Skulachev ion”, functions as a molecular
      “tow truck” carrying the other part of the molecule – an extremely
      active antioxidant plastoquinone – into mitochondria. Both
      theoretical calculations and experimental results showed that SkQ1
      is delivered into the mitochondria in an extremely targeted and
      efficient manner. The physics of the mitochondrial membrane and
      the unusual properties of “Skulachev ions” direct SkQ1 into the
      inner leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane with high
      precision.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of SkQ1 in mitochondrial membrane enables
      mitochondria to protect itself from reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      by breaking the chain reaction of lipid destruction. This ability
      of our molecule to protect cells against oxidative stress plays a
      very important role in treating patients suffering from various
      age-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases,
      neurodegenerative disorders and various ophthalmic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      But our technology does not end there. Developing methods for
      effective delivery of mitochondrially addressed antioxidants into
      the organism is another challenging task. Mitotech successfully
      solved this complex problem for a variety of therapeutic areas and
      designed several SkQ1-based pharmaceutical products currently
      going through various stages of clinical development.<br>

            Theory</b><br>

      &nbsp;Vladimir Petrovich Skulachev is the chief of the
      Bioenergetics Department of Moscow State University, dean of the
      school of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics, and an Academician in
      the Russian Academy of Sciences, in addition to being director of
      the MSU Belozersky Institute of Physico-Chemical Biology.&nbsp; He
      proposed a theory of programmed aging based on evolvability in
      1997. His concept, similar to the earlier proposal by Weismann, is
      that programmed aging assists the evolution process by freeing
      resources for younger and therefore more evolved members of a
      population.<br>
      <br>
      Skulachev also suggested that gradual programmed aging, seen in
      most more complex animals and almost all mammals, has an
      evolutionary advantage over programmed sudden death seen in some
      animals such as salmon, octopus, and male marsupial mouse as well
      as many insects and plants. Unlike "acute" programmed death,
      gradual aging presents a challenge that can be partially overcome
      by a more fit individual. This increases the effective difference
      between a more fit and less fit individual thus aiding the
      evolution process.<br>
      <br>
      Abstract from Skulachev's Aging is a Specific Biological Function
      article:<br>
      <br>
      A concept postulating that aging is a specific biological function
      that promotes the progressive evolution of sexually reproducing
      species is reviewed. Death caused by aging clears the population
      of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful
      traits. Like any other important function, aging is mediated by
      several molecular mechanisms working simultaneously. At least
      three such mechanisms have been postulated thus far: 1) telomere
      shortening due to suppression of telomerase at early stages of
      embryogenesis; 2) age-related activation of a mechanism that
      induces the synthesis of heat shock proteins in response to
      denaturing stimuli; and 3) incomplete suppression of generation
      and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). None of these
      phenomena can kill the organism, but only weaken it, which becomes
      crucial under extreme conditions. This mechanism of age-induced
      death can be compensated for (within certain time limits) by
      several positive traits that greatly increase the evolutionary
      potential of species capable of performing this function.
      Similarly to apoptosis (programmed cell death), the programmed
      death of the body can be called "phenoptosis". Aging presumably
      belongs to the category of "soft" (extended in time and allowing a
      certain degree of compensation) phenoptosis, in contrast to
      "acute" phenoptosis; the death of salmon females immediately after
      spawning is a good example of the latter.<br>
      <br>
      Skulachev directs the SkQ Megaproject to study the effect of
      plastoquinone derivitives (SkQs) in inhibiting oxidation in
      mitochondria, interrupting the aging program, and consequently
      providing treatment agents for various age-related conditions. He
      also conducted a Homo Sapiens Liberatus Workshop in Moscow, May
      2010 to review the SkQ results and discuss aging theories.
      Preliminary results are exciting, especially regarding age-related
      diseases of the eye.<br>

      </b><br>
      In 1950 s I started in science by showing that non-phosphorylating
      respiration is critical for survival of an animal at low
      temperature. Later, in the 1960 s and 1970 s, I took part in
      verification of Mitchell’s chemiosmotic hypothesis postulating
      that (i)mitochondria transform energy of respiration to
      electricity and (ii) uncoupling of respiration represents
      discharge of this electricity by H+ cycling. Fifteen years ago I
      turned to a specific kind of mitochondrial respiration which
      produces O 2 -. , and I came to the conclusion that it plays an
      ominous role, killing mitochondria, cells, or even organisms. My
      present task is a “megaproject” with an ambitious goal of
      minimizing the damaging effect of O 2 -. and stopping senescence.<br>

      <br>
      In this group, a concept was put forward considering mitochondrial
      reactive oxygen species (mtROS) as key intermediates of programmed
      aging of organism. As a consequence of such a concept, it was
      suggested that aging program can be retarded (or even switched
      off) by mitochondria-targeted antioxidants [5]. To this end,
      10-(6’-plastoquinonyl) decyltriphenyl phosphonium cation (SkQ1)
      was synthesized. It was shown that SkQ1 (i) is good penetrant for
      model and mitochondrial membranes, (ii) has very high affinity to
      membranes, (iii) is reduced by center i of respiratory Complex III
      in the inner leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane, (vi)
      electrophoretically accumulates in this leaflet, being driven by
      the mitochondrial membrane potential, (v) prevents peroxidation of
      mitochondrial cardiolipin by mtROS, (vi) arrests the ROS-induced
      apoptosis and necrosis, (vii) prolongs the lifespan of various
      organisms (from fungi and plants to mammals), and (viii) retards
      development of many traits of age-related diseases [1-6]. In
      particular, it was found that drops of SkQ1 instillated to eyes of
      rats prevent aging of tear glands, an effect leading to cure of
      such a disease as the dry eye syndrome which is usually assumed to
      be incurable and can result in uveitis. Clinical trials of drops
      of 250 nM SkQ1 solution called “Visomitin” showed that the
      three-week treatment (3 drops per day) completely cure the dry eye
      syndrome in 60% patients. The following favorable changes were
      shown: an increase in the amount of tears, stability of tear film,
      acuity of vision as well as disappearance of inflammation in the
      eye tissues [7]. Drops of Visomitin are available in drugstores of
      Moscow and other places of Russia since July, 2012. By May 12,
      2013, about 50 000 samples of the SkQ1 drops were sold and no
      claims concerning an unfavorable side effect were sent to the
      producers. Clinical trials of Visomitin as potential medicine to
      treat two other age-related eye diseases, namely cataract and
      glaucoma, were completed. For one of them (cataract), results are
      already available. In particular, it was found that acuity of
      vision was increased in 80.5% cataract patients = 70 years.<br>
      <br>
      Preclinical trials of SkQ1 in treatment of the dry eye syndrome
      and uveitis were originally performed in Russia and are now
      confirmed in three laboratories in the USA (Ora Inc., Andover;
      Toxikon Corp., Minneapolis; Comparative Biosciences Inc., Sunny
      Vale). In the next future, clinical trials of Visomitin will start
      in the USA. <br>

      &nbsp;<br>
      A new breakthrough in longevity science may be well on its way.
      History has shown that significant scientific advances are often
      met with skepticism. Such is the case for Russian professor and
      biochemist, Vladimir Skulachev, as he closes-in on a cure for one
      of the main factors of aging: oxidative stress.<br>
      <br>
      Though his claims are lofty, he asserts that there is an
      antioxidant compound that can substantially extend the average
      human lifespan. His efforts over the past forty years do lend
      credibility to his claims.<br>
      <br>
      As head of the bioenergetics department at Moscow State
      University, Professor Skulachev has published numerous papers
      contributing to our collective understanding of the aging
      process.&nbsp; More recently he has studied a particular
      antioxidant substance SKQ1, and shown that it functions at a
      sub-cellular level to reduce harmful oxidative effects.&nbsp; If
      successful his current work on a cure for aging would truly be the
      culmination of a lifetime of study and research.<br>
      <br>
      Skulachev's new anti-aging compound has already undergone
      substantial animal testing and is now in the first stages of
      clinical trial on humans. He claims to have successfully tested
      the anti-aging compound on himself and hopes to make it available
      to the public within the next two years.<br>
      <br>
      This new antioxidant therapy does not claim to extend the maximum
      human lifespan. However, it does promise to help more of us live
      active, vital lives to 100 and beyond.<br>

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The invention relates to pharmacology, medicine and
      gerontology, in particular to a class of chemical structures (I)
      which can be used in the composition of medicines (preparations)
      in the fight against various senile diseases, decelerating the
      ageing, extending the life span of animals including humans.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Nowadays the ageing problem is no longer limited to
      biological and medical aspects and begins to reach the level of
      the universal economic problem. In developed countries elderly
      people are already quantitatively prevail over youth, and the next
      25 years the proportion of elderly people in the world will
      increase by 80% and the proportion of working-age population will
      decrease accordingly. (Dominguez L. J. Ageing, lifestyle
      modifications, and cardiovascular disease in developing countries.
      //J. Nutr. Health Aging, 2006, 10, 2, 143-9). It is obvious that
      such demographic changes will affect all spheres of life. Mankind
      will face an acute shortage of resources needed to address the
      ageing population problems and development issues in general, and
      therefore the problem of decelerating the human ageing and
      preventing the development of senile diseases is becoming
      increasingly important.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Ageing is a comprehensive and complex process accompanied
      by dysfunctions in the functioning of critical systems of
      regulation at the level of the whole organism, at the cellular and
      molecular levels. Such changes can be observed in various systems
      of the organism, such as the nervous system (decrease in brain
      mass, the size and density of neurons, the fall of the bioelectric
      activity of nerve cells, changes in behavior and learning ability,
      lipofuscin deposition), the digestive system (e.g., reduction of
      secretory activity of the digestive organs), the secretory system
      (reduction of basic renal function), the cardiovascular system
      (reduction of contractile capacity of the myocardium, increase in
      systolic blood pressure, slowing of heart rhythmic activity).
      Also, visual acuity and accommodative power of the eye are
      reduced, degenerative changes in the retina and cornea are
      accelerated. There are a slowdown and decrease in protein
      biosynthesis, increased fat content in various tissues and blood,
      change in lipid fractions ratio, increase in the frequency of
      lower tolerance towards carbohydrates and insulin supply to the
      organism. Degenerative processes in the skeleton (osteoporosis)
      are accelerated.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is generally accepted that the slow poisoning of the
      organism by toxic oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in the
      processes of ageing (V. P. Skulachev (2003) Aging and the
      programmed death phenomena. In: Topics in Current Genetics, Vol. 3
      (T. Nystrom and H. D. Osiewacz, Eds.) Model systems in ageing.
      Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 191-238; V. P. Skulachev
      (2005) Aging as an atavistic program that we can attempt to
      cancel. Herald of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in Russian) 75,
      831-843). High levels of antioxidants (such as vitamins A and E)
      in the organism are known to be characteristic of long-livers
      (Mecocci et al. Plasma antioxidants and longevity: a study on
      healthy centenarians //Free Radical Biology and Medicine, 2000,
      28, 8, 1243-48); on the contrary, genetically determined
      dysfunctions in the antioxidant systems of the organism lead to
      accelerated ageing and reduction of the average life expectancy
      (Liu, J. &amp; Mori A. Age-associated changes in superoxide
      dismutase activity, thiobarbituric acid reactivity and reduced
      glutathione level in the brain and liver in senescence accelerated
      mice (SAM): A comparison with ddY mice. //Mech. Aging Dev., 1993,
      71, 23-30). Attempts to fight against senile diseases, and,
      ultimately, postpone ageing and death of the organism have been
      made repeatedly. The approaches used so far to strengthen the
      antioxidant protection have a positive effect mainly on various
      ageing-associated diseases, however both average life expectancy
      and maximum life span usually does not increase (Holloszy J. O.
      Longevity of exercising male rats: effect of an antioxidant
      supplemented diet. //Mechanisms of Ageing and Development, 1998,
      100, 211-219; Orr, W. C. et al. Effects of overexpression of
      copper-zinc and manganese superoxide dismutases, catalase, and
      thioredoxin reductase genes on longevity in Drosophila
      melanogaster. //J Biol Chem., 200, 3 278 (29), 26418-26422). The
      data on antioxidant-induced extension of life span in the
      organisms with pathologically accelerated ageing, relative to
      normal members of their species, are the exception. For example,
      antioxidants can increase the average life expectancy of mice in a
      state of permanent oxidative stress due to dysfunctions in the ATM
      gene (Reliene R. &amp; Schiestl R. Antioxidants Suppress Lymphoma
      and Increase Longevity in Atm-Deficient Mice //The Journal of
      Nutrition, 2007, 37, 229S-232S). According to the theory implying
      that ageing is part of the program(s) of the individual organism's
      development, low efficiency of the antioxidants used so far can be
      accounted for by organism's intention to fulfill the ageing
      program encoded in its genome despite our attempts to stop it.
      Indeed, the introduction of large doses of vitamin E appeared to
      induce the cytochrome P450 enzyme in liver microsomes which
      removes the excess antioxidant (Y. A. Sidorova, A. Y. Grishanova,
      V. V. Lyakhovich (2004). Transcriptional activation of cytochrome
      P450 1A1 with alpha-tocopherol. Bull Exp Biol Med., 138(3),
      233-6.). Apart from the susceptibility to antioxidant-scavenging
      enzymes in the organism, traditional antioxidants have a
      disadvantage that they are uniformly distributed throughout the
      cell volume, rather than accumulate in the mitochondria
      responsible for generating the bulk of ROS in the organism.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Many known remedies increase the average life expectancy
      (ALE) of animals and humans. However the maximum life span (MLS)
      is not increased which implies that these remedies are aimed at
      correcting the pathological consequences of ageing, rather than
      the fundamental processes of ageing. Thus, mankind has almost
      exhausted the possibilities of extending the life span by
      traditional medicines, and in the first place there is a problem
      of developing means and methods of a radical impact on the ageing
      process. In this case, the term "the fight against ageing" implies
      decelerating, stopping or reversing the process of the entirety of
      the organism's dysfunctions causing the ageing, extending the life
      time, prevention or correction of dysfunctions that accompany the
      ageing process, in order to increase the length of productive
      life, and postpone these senile dysfunctions to a later date (or
      even cancel them).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The assumption of the possible effect of increasing life
      span and decelerating ageing induced by described compounds of
      structure (1) was also made in the patent application of the
      author of the given invention registered under the number RU
      2005132217 dated Oct. 19, 2005. However, the experimental examples
      shown in the given patent application are only vaguely related to
      both the problem of extending the life time in general and
      specific senile diseases, and do not allow to state the usefulness
      of compounds of structure (1) in the fight against ageing as such.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] The present invention suggests not only a theoretical
      possibility of the fight against ageing, but also a specific
      method based on the use of a set of compounds specifically
      addressed to the mitochondria by virtue of their positive charge.
      This charge is shielded by hydrophobic substituents that endows
      the compounds with the ability to penetrate through biological
      membranes without the aid of any carriers under the influence of
      electrical potential difference that is always available in the
      mitochondrion (the sign "minus"-inside the mitochondrion). The
      invention provides not only a potential ability for the fight
      against ageing with the use of said compounds, but also specific
      compositions, modes and procedures of their application for the
      fight against ageing.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] One aspect of the present invention is a new application of
      a pharmaceutical composition of cationic antioxidants to produce
      medicinal preparations that are intended for the prevention and
      treatment of various pathologies of ageing and extending the
      productive life time. Said composition comprises compounds that
      include targeting moiety, linker group and antioxidant, and the
      general chemical structure of these compounds can be described by
      the following structure (I):<br>
      <br>
      [0009] wherein A is effector moiety-antioxidant<br>
      <br>
      [0000] and/or reduced form thereof<br>
      wherein m is an integer from 1 to 3; each Y is independently
      selected from the group consisting of: lower alkyl, lower alkoxy;
      or two adjacent Y groups, together with carbon atoms to which they
      are attached, form a following structure:<br>
      <br>
      [0010] and/or reduced form thereof<br>
      <br>
      wherein R1 and R2 may be the same or different and are each
      independently lower alkyl or lower alkoxy;<br>
      L-linker group, comprising:<br>
      a) straight or branched hydrocarbon chain which can be optionally
      substituted by one or more substituents and optionally contains
      one or more double or triple bonds;<br>
      b) natural isoprene chain;<br>
      n is integer from 1 to 20;<br>
      B-targeting group comprising Skulachev-ion Sk:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Sk&lt;+&gt;Z''<br>
      <br>
      where Sk-lipophilic cation, Z-pharmacologically acceptable anion;
      with proviso that in compound of structure (I) A is not ubiquinone
      (e.g., 2-methyl-4,5-dimethoxy-3,6-dioxo-1,4-cyclohexadienyl) or
      tocopherol or mimetic of superoxide dismutase or ebselen; while
      L-divalent decyl or divalent pentyl or divalent propyl radical;
      and while B is triphenylphosphonium cation; or solvates, isomers
      and prodrugs; and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Another aspect of the present invention is the use of a
      pharmaceutical composition for manufacturing medicinal
      preparations that are intended for extending the life time of
      humans and animals, as well as for prevention and treatment of
      senile diseases, such as retinal dystrophy, cataract, uveitis,
      glaucoma, cardiac infarction, renal infarction, stroke, diabetes,
      trophic ulcers, mental disorders, anemia, osteoporosis, cancer,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] One more aspect of the present invention is a pattern of
      use (treatment course) suggesting the use of high doses of a
      preparation comprising a compound of structure (I), in the
      treatment of older patients, as well as a gradual increase in
      dosage preparation comprising a compound of structure (I), with
      increasing age of individual patient. Such procedure is intended
      to compensate for age-related reduction of natural antioxidant
      protection of the organism with ageing. Acceptable doses for oral
      administration are from 1 nanogram to 100 microgram per kg of
      patient body weight, 60 nanogram per kg of body weight of patients
      aged from birth to 10 years is more preferable; from 1 nanogram to
      500 microgram per kg of patient body weight, 600 nanogram per kg
      of body weight of patients aged 10 to 25 years is more preferable;
      from 5 nanogram to 1000 microgram per kg of patient body weight, 3
      microgram per kg of body weight of patients aged 25 to 40 years is
      more preferable; from 10 nanogram to 10000 microgram per kg of
      patient body weight, 30 microgram per kg of body weight of
      patients aged 40 years and older is more preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In the present invention, the wording "extending the life
      span" means extending the life span that can be achieved by
      decelerating the ageing, decelerating or reversing the
      age-dependent changes in the organism. Without wishing to be bound
      by any theory, solely to illustrate the possibility of
      implementing the present invention, a possible theoretical
      justification that mitochondria-addressed compounds of structure
      (I) may affect the ageing process is given below.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The said justification is based on the theory of programmed
      death of the organism (phenoptosis) (V. D. Longo, J. Mitteldorf
      and V. P. Skulachev (2005) Programmed and altruistic ageing.
      Nature Review Genetics 6, 866-872). According to this theory, in a
      large number of cases, the reason of "age-induced" death of the
      organism is not because the organism "exhausted its own resource",
      but is due to the action of the program encoded in this organism
      that specifically and actively limits its life span.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In nature, many cases of programmed death of the organism
      have been described, and for different species this program can be
      implemented in different ways. However, the scientific data
      available (see Background of the invention) suggest that ROS
      formed in the mitochondria play an important role in implementing
      this program. Hence, compounds of structure (I) may affect the
      said program.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Application of pharmaceutical compositions relating to the
      present invention can be both somatic and local. Procedures of
      administration comprise enteral, such as oral, sublingual and
      rectal; local, such as transdermal, intradermal and oculodermal;
      and parenteral. Suitable parenteral procedures of administration
      comprise injections, for example, intravenous, intramuscular,
      subdermal, intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, and other injections,
      and non-injecting practices, such as vaginal or nasal. Preferably,
      compounds and pharmaceutical compositions related to the present
      invention, are for parenteral or oral administration. In
      particular, administration can be given in form of intravenous
      injections or tablets, granules, capsules or other pressed or
      compressed form.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] When a compound of structure (I) is administered as a
      pharmaceutical composition, a compound of structure (I) should be
      mixed according to formula with a suitable amount of
      pharmacologically acceptable solvent or carrier so that to have
      the appropriate form for administration to a patient. The term
      "solvent" relates to diluent, auxiliary medicinal substance,
      filler or carrier which is mixed with a compound of structure (I)
      for administration to a patient. Liquors like water, and oils
      including petrolic, animal, vegetative and synthetic, such as
      peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil and other similar oils can be
      used as said pharmacological carriers. Normal saline solution,
      acacia pitch, gelatin, starch, talc, keratin, colloid silver, urea
      etc can serve as said pharmacological solvents.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Said composition can also include auxiliary substances,
      stabilizers, thickeners, lubricant and coloring agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Compounds and compositions related to the present invention
      can be administered in form of capsules, tablets, pills, pillets,
      granules, syrups, elixirs, solutions, suspensions, emulsions,
      suppositories or retarded release substances, or in any other form
      suitable for administration to a patient. One aspect of the
      present invention is application of compounds of structure (I) and
      compositions in form of solutions for oral and parenteral
      administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Therapeutically justified amount of a compound of structure
      (I) required for treatment of a specific disease or symptom,
      depends on the nature of disease or symptom and a procedure of
      administration and should be determined at consultation with a
      physician in charge. Acceptable doses for oral administration are
      from 0.025 to 120000 microgram per kg of patient body weight, 1.5
      microgram per kg of patient body weight is more preferable, and 3
      microgram per kg of patient body weight is the most preferable.
      Acceptable doses for intravenous administration are from 0.001 to
      10000 microgram per kg of patient body weight, 0.01 microgram per
      kg of patient body weight is more preferable, and 0.1 microgram
      per kg of patient body weight is the most preferable.<br>

      and methods will be apparent to the skilled person. The following
      examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of this
      disclosure. Apart from extending the actual life span, these
      examples show that the correct use of compositions based on
      compounds of structure (I) can extend the live time of animals,
      decelerate and in some cases reverse the development of several
      independent signs of ageing.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Increase of Life Span in SHR Mice by Means of
        Mitochondria-Targeted SkQ1 Antioxidant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] An experiment with outbred SHR mice was carried out. The
      mice were divided into four groups (25 animals per each group).
      The three groups received a certain amount of SkQ1 with drinking
      water throughout their lives, and the fourth (control) group
      received water without SkQ1. Data on the time of animal deaths in
      all groups are shown in FIG. 1. Dose of SkQ1 is given in nanomoles
      per kg of animal weight per day.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The data shown in the Figure conclusively demonstrate the
      ability of SkQ1 to extend the life span of SHR mice which are a
      generally accepted model for gerontological studies. (V. N.
      Anisimov, I. N. Alimova, D. A. Baturin, I. G. Popovich, M. A.
      Zabezhinski, S. V. Rosenfeld, K. G. Manton, A. V. Semenchenko, A.
      I. Yashin (2003) Dose-dependent effect of melatonin on life span
      and spontaneous tumor incidence in female SHR mice. Exp Gerontol.
      38, 449-461). Indeed, mice that received SkQ1 in optimal doses (1
      nanomole per animal per day) revealed much longer life span: in
      707 days of the experiment, in the control group, 8% of the
      animals remained alive, while in the test group-36%, 28% and 24%,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The same experiment showed that female SHR mice received
      SkQ1 are characterized by less pronounced age-related changes in
      estrous function, as compared to the control group. With
      increasing the duration of the observation period, tendency of
      decelerating age-related disorders in estrous function in
      experimental animals becomes more pronounced, which were expressed
      as increase in the duration of cycle and lowering the frequency of
      regular cycles. For example, in the 2&lt;nd &gt;cohort in
      15-month-old experimental animals received SkQ1 at a dose of 0.01
      nanomoles per day, the frequency of regular cycles was 94%,
      whereas in the control-67%. These data suggest decelerating
      age-related disorders in estrous function in SHR mice under the
      influence of SkQ1.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Increase of Life Span in Female Fruit Flies (Drosophila
        melanogaster) by Means of SkQ1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0047] Isogenous laboratory Drosophila line w&lt;1118 &gt;in which
      all individuals have the same genotype was chosen for the
      experiments, thus eliminating the influence of genetic differences
      between individuals on the results of experiments. The
      mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 at a concentration of 1.85
      nM was tested. Stock SkQ solution was diluted in distilled water.
      Adult flies were administered the compound throughout their lives.
      Since adult flies can feed on food located on the surface, it was
      decided to spread the SkQ1 solution of a corresponding
      concentration on the surface of freshly prepared medium poured
      into test tubes containing the flies.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Virgin females and males of line w&lt;1118 &gt;selected
      during the day were placed in tubes, each tube contained five
      individuals (males and females separately), in standard medium. In
      control tubes, 100 [mu]l of distilled water without SkQ was spread
      on standard medium surface; in test tubes, 100 [mu]l of the test
      compound at a selected concentration was spread on standard medium
      surface. The number of live flies in each tube was recorded daily,
      once a week flies were transferred to a corresponding fresh
      medium. All tubes were incubated at 25[deg.] C. In each
      experiment, 100 individuals (20 tubes) were analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Analysis of the survival curves for flies showed that SkQ1
      at a concentration of 1.85 nM resulted in reliable increase of the
      average life expectancy from 58 to 66 days (P=0.0012). A fraction
      of individuals aged 70 days and older in the group received feed
      with 1.85 nM SkQ1 is reliably higher than that in the control
      group (0.48 and 0.18, respectively, P=0.0056). The survival curves
      for flies are shown in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The results of this experiment indicate that the
      mitochondrial antioxidant of SkQ1-type increases the life span of
      flies D. melanogaster.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Increase of Life Span in p53 Gene Knockout Mice</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0051] Mice lacking the p53 gene (p53-/-) can not synthesize the
      p53 protein, so-called "guardian of the genome", and can serve as
      a model of accelerated ageing and death of the organism caused by
      cancer [for more details, see A. A. Sablina, A. V. Budanov, G. V.
      Ilyinskaya, L. S. Agapova, J. E. Kravchenko, P. M. Chumakov (2005)
      The antioxidant function of the p53 tumor suppressor //Nature
      Med., 11, 1306-1313)]. Within the framework of the aforementioned
      theory of phenoptosis implying the key role of mitochondrial
      reactive oxygen species in organism's aging, one may suggest that
      compounds of structure (I) can significantly extend the life span
      of p53 (-/-) mice. This example demonstrates the results of such
      experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Based on the previously conducted PCR analysis detecting
      p53-/-, p53+/- and p53+/+ mice in the progeny of heterozygous
      (p53+/-) animals, the two groups of mice were drawn up which
      received:<br>
      <br>
      clean drinking water;<br>
      water supplemented with SkQ1 (0.1 nmoles of the preparation per
      mouse per day (5 nM/kg/day)).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The experimental results are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The experimental curves clearly show a dramatic increase of
      the life span in animals received SkQ1 with drinking water.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0057] In support of the possibility of execution of the
      invention, this experimental example shows several protocols for
      clinical trials of pharmaceutical compositions based on compounds
      of structure (I) as a veterinary preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A) Patient-cat, breed-European Shorthair, age-15 years.
      Diagnosis-retinitis, papillitis, senile generalized progressive
      retinal dystrophy. Clinical signs-depigmentation of t. lucidum,
      the optic disk (OD) is violet. Retinal detachment. Vision is
      absent.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Treatment-daily instillation of 250 nM SkQ1 solution (in
      physiological solution at pH 6.5).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Results-after 10 days of the treatment the pupil began to
      respond to light, the cat began to play with the ball and see even
      small objects. In the study of eye fundus, only pinpoint
      hemorrhages were identified. Retinal detachment and dystrophy
      areas are absent. OD became pink. After 21 days of the
      treatment-vision retained; retinal detachment and dystrophy areas
      are absent. OD is pink.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] B) Patient-horse, gelding, not thoroughbred, age-20 years.
      Diagnosis-senile blindness associated with degeneration of the
      retina and its vessels. Clinical signs-shortening and thinning of
      retinal vessels emanating from the optic disk, depigmentation of
      t. lucidum t. nigrum, thinning of the retina over the entire
      surface of eye fundus. As a result, Choroid blood vessels in the
      form of straight lines are well visualized, posterior polar senile
      cataract is detected. The animal cannot see during the last eight
      months.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Treatment-daily instillation of 250 nM SkQ1 solution (in
      physiological solution at pH 6.5), and since the 3&lt;rd &gt;month
      of treatment-2 times a day.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Results after 90 days of the treatment-original color of t.
      lucidum returned, old vessels emanating from OD are filled with
      blood, highly convoluted, short. OD is pink. The growth of 40 new
      blood vessels from OD was detected. The vessels are long, filled
      with blood (similar to foal's vessels). The vision was restored in
      the animal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Preventing the Development of a Sign of Ageing</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Age-Dependent Decrease in Bone Mass (Osteoporosis) in Rats</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] Osteoporosis is one of the most common senile diseases
      manifesting itself as bone thinning and increase in bone
      fragility. Today, this disease has become so commonplace that it
      can be referred to as a quiet epidemic. In osteoporosis, entire
      sections of bone tissue disappear, bone loses its complex
      architecture. Traditional antioxidants are ineffective for
      osteoporosis prevention (Wolf R. L. et. al. Lack of a relation
      between vitamin and mineral antioxidants and bone mineral density:
      results from the Women's Health Initiative //American Journal of
      Clinical Nutrition, 2005, 82, 3, 581-588). The next series of
      experiments demonstrates the possibility of preventing the
      development of the main symptom of osteoporosis-reduced bone
      mineral density.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Experiments were conducted on the two lines of rats-Wistar
      and OXYS. Genetically determined metabolic defect, manifesting
      itself as decreased resistance of OXYS rats towards oxidative
      stress, leads to changes in their organism which may be regarded
      as accelerated ageing syndrome. In particular, reduced bone
      mineral density in OXYS rats, as compared to Wistar rats, is
      observed. Such changes are also observed in osteoporosis in humans
      that allows us to consider these animals as an adequate model of
      senile osteoporosis in humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Wistar and OXYS rats, -control rats and those who received
      two courses of SkQ1 (50 nanomoles per kg of body weight per day),
      were studied. The animals received the preparation since 1.5 and 4
      months of age for 45 days. At the age of 6 months, bone tissue
      state was studied by X-ray densitometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] It was shown that, in OXYS rats, the preparation reliably
      increased bone mineral density of femur and tibia (FIG. 4) and the
      total mass of bone tissue (FIG. 5). Thus, the preparation reduces
      the severity of osteoporosis in OXYS rats.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Preventing the Development of a Sign of Ageing</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Age-Dependent Reduction of Sexual Motivation in Rats</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0068] It is known that ageing in higher organisms is often
      accompanied by weakening of reproductive instincts and reduced
      sexual motivation. The next series of experiments demonstrates the
      possibility of preventing the development of such behavioral
      disorders with the previously mentioned Wistar and OXYS rats as an
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Both at the age of 3 months and at one year Wistar males
      show considerable interest in females. In the study of sexual
      motivation in OXYS rats at different age periods, somewhat
      different results were obtained. One year old OXYS males show less
      interest in females, as compared to OXYS males at the age of 3
      months.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The effect of monthly course of SkQ1 (50 nanomoles per day)
      on the extent of sexual arousal in one year old Wistar and OXYS
      males was investigated. To do this, an experimental model of
      sexual arousal was used-males were kept under conditions allowing
      them to see the receptive female, perceive the female's smell, but
      excluding physical contact with the female. Under these
      conditions, male rats and male mice show increase in blood
      testosterone level and typical motivational behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] It was shown that under the influence of SkQ1, interlinear
      differences between Wistar and OXYS rats by the main behavioral
      indicator of sexual arousal, -time spent by a male rat near a
      female rat separated by a barrier inserted between the rats,
      disappeared. SkQ1 reliably increased this indicator in OXYS rats
      administered 50 and 250 nanomoles of SkQ1 (as compared to the
      values for sexual arousal in the control (no SkQ1 was given) males
      (FIG. 6). Thus, long-term SkQ1 administration enhanced the sexual
      motivation of OXYS male rats with a genetic predisposition to
      premature ageing, bringing it to the level shown by Wistar male
      rats with a normal rate of ageing.<br>
      <br>
      7. The Effect of Long-Term SkQ1 Administration on "Investigatory
      Reflex" and the Ability of Animals to Learn<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The next series of experiments reveals SkQ1 ability to
      decelerate the development of age-related changes in learning
      ability, using Wistar and OXYS rats as an example.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The Morris water maze test is actively used for studies on
      learning and long-term spatial memory in animals. The method of
      Morris allows to evaluate strategies for behavior, dynamics of
      skill formation, to detect even weak differences in behavior. This
      test evaluates the ability of an animal, swimming in the opaque
      water of the pool and looking at the signs on its sides, to learn
      how to find the invisible, hidden platform under water, no matter
      from what point of the perimeter of the pool the animal was
      released. Progress in passing spatial orientation tests depends on
      the function of the hippocampus, and, in the development of senile
      neurodegenerative processes, this function is significantly
      reduced. Preliminary experiments showed that Wistar rats at the
      age of 3, 12 and 16 months do not differ in their ability to learn
      in the Morris maze, whereas in OXYS rats such ability decreases
      with age.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In subsequent experiments, 4 groups of 16-month-old
      animals: control Wistar and OXYS rats, and groups received the
      preparation since 1.5 months at a dose of 250 nanomoles per kg of
      body weight, were used. A latent period of time spent by rats to
      find the platform depended only on the genotype-it took longer in
      OXYS rats than in Wistar rats-OXYS rats coped worse with the task.
      Under the influence of SkQ1, interlinear differences between
      Wistar and OXYS rats disappeared-SkQ1 improved the ability of OXYS
      rats to learn (FIG. 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Thus, it was shown that prophylactic administration of the
      preparation SkQ1 has a positive effect on memory and prevents
      age-related decline in the ability to learn in the Morris maze in
      OXYS rats.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] A further series of behavioral tests "open field" and
      "elevated cruciform maze" demonstrated a positive effect of SkQ1
      on search and exploratory activity of rats. In addition, a clear
      stress-protective effect of SkQ1 administration was observed with
      Wistar rats.<br>
