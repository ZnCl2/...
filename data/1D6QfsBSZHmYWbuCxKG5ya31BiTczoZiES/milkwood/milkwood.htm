      A common weed could help cure skin cancers, claim researchers.<br>
      <br>
      The sap from a plant known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">petty





        spurge</span> or milkweed [ * a typo -- actually, it's " milkw<span
        style="font-weight: bold;">oo</span>d&nbsp; " ] - found by
      roadsides and in woodland - can 'kill' certain types of cancer
      cells when applied to the skin.<br>
      <br>
      It works on non-melanoma skin cancers, which affect hundreds of
      thousands of Britons each year.<br>
      <br>
      They are triggered by sun damage and, although not usually fatal,
      can be disfiguring without treatment.<br>
      <br>
      The plant has been used for centuries as a traditional folk
      medicine to treat conditions such as warts, asthma and several
      types of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      But for the first time a team of scientists in Australia has
      carried out a clinical study of sap from <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Euphorbia peplus</span>, which is
      related to Euphorbia plants grown in gardens in the UK.<br>
      <br>
      The study of 36 patients with a total of 48 non-melanoma lesions
      included basal cell carcinomas (BCC), squamous cell carcinomas
      (SCC) and intraepidermal carcinomas (IEC), a growth of cancerous
      cells confined to the outer layer of the skin.<br>
      <br>
      Patients had failed to respond to conventional treatment including
      surgery, or they refused or were unsuitable for surgery because of
      their age.<br>
      <br>
      The patients were treated once a day for three consecutive days by
      an oncologist using a cotton bud to apply enough of the E.peplus
      sap to cover the surface of each lesion. <br>
      <br>
      The initial results were impressive, says findings to be released
      this week in the British Journal of Dermatology.<br>
      <br>
      After only one month 41 of the 48 cancers had completely gone.<br>
      <br>
      Patients who had some of the lesions remaining were offered a
      second course of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      After an average of 15 months following treatment, two thirds of
      the 48 skin cancer lesions were still showing a complete response.<br>
      <br>
      Of the three types of skin cancer tested, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">the final outcome was a 75 per cent
        complete response for IEC lesions, 57 per cent for BCC and 50
        per cent for SCC lesions.</span><br>
      <br>
      Side-effects were low, with 43 per cent of patients in no pain as
      a result of the treatment and only 14 per cent reporting moderate
      pain, and only one patient encountered severe short-term pain.<br>
      <br>
      In all cases of successful treatment the skin was left with a good
      cosmetic appearance.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers, from a number of medical institutions in
      Brisbane, attribute the benefit to the active ingredient ingenol
      mebutate which has been shown to destroy tumour cells.<br>
      <br>
      British experts said further studies were needed and people should
      not try this at home as the weed sap can be harmful to the eyes
      and should not be eaten.<br>
      <br>
      More than 76,500 people are diagnosed with non-melanoma skin
      cancer in the UK each year, with 90 per cent caused by ultraviolet
      light exposure.<br>
      <br>
      Lesions usually appear on the areas most exposed to the sun, such
      as the head, neck, ears, and back of the hands.<br>
      <br>
      Kimberley Carter of the British Association of Dermatologists
      said: 'This is a very small test group so it will be interesting
      to see what larger studies and the development of the active
      ingredient in E. peplus sap will reveal.<br>
      <br>
      'Whilst it would not provide an alternative to surgery for the
      more invasive skin cancers or melanoma, in the future it might
      become a useful addition to the treatments available to patients
      for superficial, non-melanoma skin cancers.<br>
      <br>
      'Any advances that could lead to new therapies for patients where
      surgery is not an option are definitely worth investigating.<br>
      <br>
      'It is also very important to note that this is definitely not a
      treatment people should be trying out at home.<br>
      <br>
      'Exposure of the sap to mucous producing surfaces, such as the
      eyes, results in extreme inflammation and can lead to
      hospitalisation.<br>
      <br>
      'The concentration of the active ingredients in the sap also
      varies between different plants, with high doses able to cause
      very severe and excessive inflammatory responses.'<br>

      </div>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      Latin name: Euphorbia peplus <br>
      <br>
      Occurrence: Petty spurge is a small, branched annual, plentiful in
      gardens and arable fields.<br>
      <br>
      It is native and common throughout the UK, in any kind of soil.
      The plant exudes a milky sap when damaged, which is a severe
      irritant if applied to the skin.<br>
      <br>
      Biology: Petty spurge flowers from April to November. The seed
      number per plant ranges from 260 to 1,200.<br>
      <br>
      Petty spurge may be found in fruit for eight months of the year.
      Seedlings emerge throughout the year except for in winter but the
      main flush is from April to May. Most seed germinates within a
      year of shedding.<br>
      <br>
      Just a few seedlings emerge in the following 5 years. Germination
      occurs at 5 to 10 mm depth in soil.<br>
      <br>
      Persistence and Spread: Seed recovered from house demolitions and
      archaeological digs and dated at 20, 25, 30 and 100 years old has
      been reported to germinate.<br>

      Binomial name : Euphorbia peplus L.<br>
      <br>
      Euphorbia peplus (Petty spurge, Radium weed[1] or Cancer weed[2])
      is a species of Euphorbia, native to most of Europe, northern
      Africa, and western Asia, where it typically grows in cultivated
      arable land, gardens, and other disturbed land.[3][4][5]<br>
      <br>
      It is an annual plant growing to between 5–30 cm tall (most plants
      growing as weeds of cultivation tend towards the smaller end),
      with smooth hairless stems. The leaves are oval-acute, 1–3 cm
      long, with a smooth margin. It has green flowers in three-rayed
      umbels. The glands, typical of the Euphorbiacae, are kidney-shaped
      with long thin horns.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The milky latex sap is toxic, and used as a therapeutic agent for
      the removal of warts and sunspots on the skin.[1] Recent work also
      suggests that it may also be effective in treating superficial
      basal cell carcinomas.[6][7]<br>
      <br>
      Outside of its native range it is very widely naturalised and
      often invasive, including in Australia, New Zealand, North
      America, and other countries in temperate and sub-tropical
      regions.[3]<br>

      The white sap of petty spurge (Euphorbia peplus), also called
      cancer weed or radium weed, is excellent on skin cancers and
      insensitive external tumors. Skin cancers may also be destroyed by
      repeatedly applying a drop of 35% hydrogen peroxide, preferably
      protecting the surrounding skin with a barrier cream.<br>
      <br>
      However, the most effective way to remove skin cancer, melanoma
      and tumors close to the skin, possibly including breast tumors, is
      to apply an 'Escharotic'. These are caustic remedies, commonly
      with zinc chloride and the herb bloodroot as main ingredients.
      These may be available from some health shops or naturopaths. Skin
      cancers may become inflamed for a few days and then form dry pus
      (an eschar) and fall out after about 10 days.<br>
      <br>
      Before you rush out to buy the stuff, read this abstract on
      [negative] Consequences of using escharotic agents as primary
      treatment for nonmelanoma skin cancer. <br>

      Instructions for using Euphorbia peplus (petty spurge) - more from

      <br>
      Do not get in eye<br>
      <br>
      from email: [it has] different effects on different areas of the
      body... ...usually apply Betadine (Iodine) if any infection
      appears present. Typically (on the face eg) the spot will become
      "angry" looking, and break out into a weeping type sore. You may
      also see a line or "lines" moving out from the spot. These also
      may breakout through the skin. Both areas of reaction may take 2-3
      weeks to settle, and scab over, and it can look quite messy for a
      while. Past this point, the area should start to heal and return
      to normal without the cancer. Applying the sap daily for 3-4 days
      followed by every 2nd-3rd day may be a better approach for some
      people. Certainly, reactions can vary from person to person but
      the biggest risk is from secondary infection and it is surprising
      how many people miss this point.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to compositions of compounds
      obtainable from Euphorbia species and which are useful in the
      treatment of skin cancers.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The compound ingenol angelate can be isolated from various
      Euphorbia species, and particularly from Euphorbia peplus and
      Euphorbia drummondii. Ingenol angelate exists in three isoforms;
      ingenol-3-angelate (isoform `b`), ingenol-5-angelate (isoform `a`)
      and ingenol-20-angelate (isoform `c`). The first of these is also
      referred to herein as I3A and has the following structure:<br>
      <br>
      ##STR00001##<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Ingenol angelate has been found to be highly toxic for skin
      cancer cells via rapid mitochondrial disruption and cell death by
      primary necrosis, while leaving healthy cells unaffected.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. No. 6,432,452</span>
      discloses compounds present in an active principle derived from
      plants of the species Euphorbia peplus, Euphorbia hirta and
      Euphorbia drummondii, which show selective cytotoxicity against
      several different cancer cell lines. The compounds are useful in
      effective treatment of cancers, particularly malignant melanomas
      and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The compounds are selected
      from jatrophanes, pepluanes, paralianes and ingenanes. The
      preferred compound is an angeloyl-substituted ingenane obtained
      from the sap of Euphorbia peplus.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Microgram quantities of ingenol angelate are typically
      therapeutically effective. However, the tendency for isoform `b`
      to undergo rearrangement to isoform `a` and subsequently to
      isoform `c` presents a formulation problem, where it is desired to
      restrict the formulation to either a specific isoform or to a
      ratio of isoforms. This is particularly a problem with I3A, as the
      different isoforms have different solubilities.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] There is a need for an effective, topical treatment for
      skin cancer, as systemic treatments involving other drugs
      necessarily result in exposure of susceptible healthy cells, in
      non-target parts of the body, to cytotoxic chemicals. In addition,
      systemic anti-cancer treatments, whether administered orally or by
      injection, have lower patient acceptance.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] There is a need to provide a stable formulation of ingenol
      angelate, preferably for topical administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It has now, surprisingly, been found that ingenol angelate
      can be solubilised, substantially without rearrangement between
      isoforms, in an acceptable, aprotic solvent in the presence of an
      acceptable, miscible acidic buffer.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a
      formulation of ingenol angelate for use in therapy, wherein the
      ingenol angelate has been dissolved in a pharmaceutically
      acceptable, aprotic solvent, said formulation further comprising a
      pharmaceutically acceptable acidifying agent which is at least
      partially compatible with the solvent and which provides the
      formulation with an apparent pH of no greater than 4.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention envisages formulations of any of the
      isoforms of ingenol angelate, or mixtures thereof. At present, the
      preferred isoform is isoform `b`, also referred to herein as I3A.
      It will be understood that references to `ingenol angelate` and
      `I3A` include reference to other isoforms and mixtures thereof,
      unless otherwise apparent.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Ingenol angelate can be dissolved in many solvents, and
      various solvents are illustrated in accompanying Example 1.
      However, ingenol angelate is generally susceptible to
      rearrangement in protic solvents, and any substantial degree of
      rearrangement, typically beyond about 1% for plant derived
      products, but more preferably about 0.5%, is undesirable in a
      pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In aprotic solvents, which are generally solvents that do
      not contribute protons to a solution, such as polyethylene glycol,
      dissolution can take some considerable time and this, together
      with the temperatures required, can also lead to rearrangement to
      an extent above acceptable levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Substances such as acetone and acetonitrile are capable of
      dissolving I3A, but are not generally pharmaceutically acceptable,
      and may not be suitable for long term storage. More acceptable may
      be substances such as methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl acetate, or
      diethyl ether, but benzyl alcohol is generally most preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] A number of substances are suitable to dissolve I3A, but
      stability is not guaranteed, and generally unacceptable
      rearrangement levels may be observed after periods ranging between
      as little as 12 hours and as much as six months or a year.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In the absence of water, or other protic solvent, there
      will not be a measurable pH. Under such conditions, and especially
      at elevated temperatures, rearrangement is likely. Thus, it has
      been found that it is generally possible to inhibit rearrangement
      by the presence of a suitable acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Suitable acids are generally organic acids, as it has been
      established that I3A can decompose much below about a pH of 3,
      while rearrangement is likely to occur at above a pH of about 4.5.
      Where it is intended to store the formulation for periods of any
      length, such as a month or more, then it is preferred that the
      acid be in the form of a buffer. Suitable buffers include citrate
      buffer, phosphate buffer, acetate buffer and citrate-phosphate
      buffer, although other buffers will be apparent to those skilled
      in the art. In particular, it is preferred that the buffer
      provides an apparent pH to the formulation of no greater than 4.5
      and no less than 2.5. A formulation pH of less than 4 is more
      preferred, and it is particularly preferred that the apparent
      formulation pH be 3.8 or less, preferably around 3.5, or less. An
      apparent pH of around 3 is useful. A buffer having a pH of 2.75
      has been found to be particularly advantageous, conferring an
      apparent pH of about pH 3.5 to the final formulation when used in
      quantities as illustrated in the accompanying Examples. A
      preferred pH range of the buffer is between 2.6 and 2.85,
      preferably pH 2.7-pH 2.8, and is preferably a citrate buffer. It
      will be appreciated that the acid will generally be in the form of
      an aqueous solution, preferably in deionised water, unless
      otherwise indicated. Citrate buffer is preferred. Where acetate
      buffer is used, this may typically have a pH range of 3.5 to 5.5,
      while citrate-phosphate buffer may typically have a pH range of
      2.75 to 7.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It will be understood that a solution in which the solvent
      is aprotic cannot have a pH, as this is a measurement of the
      H.sup.+ ion. However, where such a solution is at least partially
      miscible with an acid, or acidic buffer, and such is present, then
      attempts to measure the pH will yield a result. Preferred
      formulations of the invention are made up as topical
      administration forms, and will generally comprise a majority of
      buffer, or ionic solution, but will always comprise aprotic
      solvent, so that only an apparent, rather than an absolute, pH can
      be measured, as the measured pH relates only to the ionic
      component. A suitable means for measuring apparent pH is with the
      Jenway 3320 pH meter. Accordingly, the result may not have the
      meaning normally ascribed to an ionic solution, especially where
      the amount of acid or buffer is small, but the significance is
      that, insofar as any ionic environment is present, that
      environment is acidic. As the amount of acid increases, so the
      apparent pH becomes more equivalent to pH. While not being bound
      by theory, it is likely that ingenol angelate is primarily
      dissolved in the aprotic solvent, as it has very low solubility in
      water. Subsequent addition of the ingenol angelate solution in
      solvent to an acidified ionic solution allows a suitable,
      optionally aqueous, ionic solution of ingenol angelate to be
      prepared, thereby avoiding dissolution of ingenol angelate
      directly in a protic solvent, which is when the greatest amount of
      rearrangement appears to take place. Thus, contact with a protic
      solvent can immediately result in the formation of the other
      isoforms, but this can be minimised if a small amount of acid or
      acidic buffer, which terms are used synonymously herein unless
      otherwise apparent, is added. Even the act of dissolution in
      protic solvents, given the length of time and conditions
      necessary, can lead to undesirably high levels of isoforms
      forming, such is the susceptibility of ingenol angelate to
      rearrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The aprotic solvent and the acid are at least partially
      compatible, in that a stable preparation of the two can be formed.
      The acid and solvent are preferably miscible, and are preferably
      miscible at all ratios. In particular, it is generally preferred
      to add a small amount of buffer to the solvent during, or shortly
      after, solubilisation of the ingenol angelate, in order to keep
      the apparent pH at a relatively low level. Subsequently, it may be
      desirable to make up the solubilised ingenol angelate in an excess
      of the buffer that was used during the initial solubilisation.
      Stable preparations made up with an excess of buffer are
      illustrated in Example 9, below.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] It will be appreciated that it is preferred that the acid
      and solvent be sufficiently miscible to be able to form a single
      phase, although immiscible, or less miscible, solvents and acids
      may be prepared in the form of emulsions or micro-emulsions. Such
      emulsions can be stable, but the provision of a mixture of solvent
      and acid as a single phase generally further minimises any risk of
      angelate rearrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Solvents that are particularly useful in the present
      invention are those which exhibit both hydrophilic and lipophilic
      traits, such as ring systems which are preferably homocyclic, and
      which have hydroxy groups substituted thereon but separated by at
      least one carbon atom from the ring structure. A particularly
      preferred example of such a solvent is benzyl alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Although it is possible to use an acid rather than a
      buffer, it is generally preferred to use an acidic buffer to
      minimise the fluctuation in pH. As such, it will be appreciated
      that, whilst the term `buffer` will generally be used herein, this
      term also encompasses acids and acid preparations, where
      appropriate. A particularly preferred buffer is citrate buffer, pH
      3 or lower, preferably pH 2.75. In benzyl alcohol, a 2.5% w/w
      quantity of pH 2.5 citrate buffer will generally yield an
      unmeasurable apparent pH but, at higher quantities, yields a pH of
      around pH 3. The relationship between pH of buffer and apparent pH
      is explored in the accompanying Examples. At low quantities of
      buffer when dissolving I3A in the solvent, it is simply preferred
      to keep the environment acidic, and the nature of the preferred
      buffer at these levels is similar to the nature of the preferred
      buffer when subsequently diluting the formulation for use. It is
      generally preferred to acidify the solvent, preferably benzyl
      alcohol, with an amount of acidic buffer, preferably between 1 and
      10% by weight, more preferably between 2 and 5%, prior to addition
      of I3A.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] While the formulation does not have to be diluted for use,
      it is generally the case that I3A is a potent substance, and stock
      solutions of I3A in solvent, preferably benzyl alcohol, may be
      made up for storage, preferably at 8.degree. C. or below. Such
      stock solutions may then be diluted, preferably with buffer, as
      desired, when making up any final formulation or preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The amount of buffer used when solubilising the ingenol
      angelate can vary between about 0 and 100%. When the amount is 0,
      it is preferred to add a quantity of buffer shortly after adding
      the ingenol angelate to the solvent, in order to minimise the
      likelihood of any rearrangement taking place. It is generally
      preferred to avoid using amounts of buffer greater than 100% by
      weight of the solvent, as dissolution directly into the buffer is
      generally not readily achievable. It is preferred to employ the
      buffer as a means to keep the apparent pH of the solvent at a low
      level, without providing any substantial amount of protic solvent
      during dissolution of the ingenol angelate. Once the ingenol
      angelate has been substantially dissolved, then it is possible,
      and may even be desirable, to make up the formulation with an
      excess of buffer comprising, if desired, other optionally protic
      constituents, such as antibiotics, for example. Preferred levels
      of buffer are in the region of 0.5%-10%, and preferably between 1%
      and 5%, with about 2-3% being most preferred during the
      dissolution phase. The dissolution phase comprises dissolving at
      least a majority of the ingenol angelate in the solvent, and
      preferably at least 95% w/w ingenol angelate in the solvent, more
      preferably at least 99% w/w.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Formulations of the present invention may be used directly,
      or may be stored for future use. In addition, formulations of the
      present invention may provide a base formulation which can then be
      further modified prior to use. For example, as described above,
      the formulation may be made up in an excess of buffer or may be
      formulated into a gel, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] It has also been found that formulations of the present
      invention are generally more stable at lower temperatures.
      Particularly preferred formulations of the present invention, such
      as those comprising benzyl alcohol and citrate buffer, may exhibit
      substantial stability at temperatures as high as 40.degree. C.
      but, in general, increasing stability is observed at temperatures
      below room temperature and pressure (RTP), and the greatest
      stability is observed at temperatures below about 8.degree. C.
      Freezing does not appear to enhance stability so that, in general,
      the greatest stability is achieved simply by placing formulations
      of the invention in a conventional refrigerator at a temperature
      of between about 2.degree. C. and 8.degree. C.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The present invention further provides a process for
      preparing a solution of ingenol angelate, comprising dissolving
      the ingenol angelate in a pharmaceutically acceptable, aprotic
      solvent, said formulation further comprising a pharmaceutically
      acceptable acidifying agent which is at least partially compatible
      with the solvent and which provides the formulation with an
      apparent pH of no greater than 4.5, said acid being added with,
      before, or after the ingenol angelate.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In an alternative, the present invention provides a process
      for preparing a solution of ingenol angelate, comprising
      dissolving the ingenol angelate in a pharmaceutically acceptable,
      aprotic solvent, said process comprising the addition of a
      pharmaceutically acceptable acidifying agent which is at least
      partially compatible with the solvent and which provides the
      formulation with an apparent pH of no greater than 4.5, said
      acidifying agent being added with, before, or after the ingenol
      angelate. The acidifying agent is preferably a buffer.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] It is preferred to add the acid, or buffer, sufficiently
      soon after addition of the I3A to ensure that no more than about
      1%, and preferably no more than about 0.5%, of the `b` isoform
      rearranges into the `a` isoform. Preferably, the acid or buffer is
      added to the solvent before adding the I3A, although all three
      ingredients may be combined at the same time. This latter is the
      least preferred option.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] This process may also be used for the preparation of
      ingenol angelate formulations using other compounds and solvents,
      such as polyethylene glycol, where direct solubilisation may be
      associated with an unacceptable level of rearrangement. Although
      I3A can dissolve in PEG, it takes in the region of an hour at
      elevated temperature, which generally leads to the generation of
      unacceptable levels of the `a` isoform. If the I3A is dissolved in
      buffered benzyl alcohol first, this can then be introduced
      directly into the PEG, without the prolonged exposure to heat. As
      only enough benzyl alcohol is needed to solubilise the I3A, then
      the total amount of benzyl alcohol in the final PEG formulation
      need only be in the region of 1% w/w or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] These formulations may be kept for sustained periods,
      especially when kept at temperatures of 8.degree. C. or lower.
      Preferred compositions see no more than about 1%, and preferably
      no more than about 0.5%, rearrangement of the `b` isoform to the
      `a` isoform after 3 months, more preferably 6 months.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] There is further provided the use of a formulation of the
      invention in the treatment of a skin cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The invention also provides the use of ingenol angelate in
      the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of
      a skin cancer, wherein the ingenol angelate is dissolved in a
      pharmaceutically acceptable, aprotic solvent, said formulation
      further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acidifying agent
      which is at least partially compatible with the solvent and which
      provides the formulation with an apparent pH of no greater than
      4.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Suitable cancers for treatment in accordance with the
      present invention include squamous and basal cell cancers.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It will be appreciated that `treatment`, as used herein,
      includes both therapy and prophylaxis.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The present invention also provides a method of treating a
      subject suffering from a cancerous skin condition, comprising the
      topical application of a therapeutically effective amount of a
      composition of the invention to the area of the cancerous
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Suitable subjects for treatment are mammals, including
      humans, primates, livestock animals (including cows, horses,
      sheep, pigs and goats), companion animals (including dogs, cats,
      rabbits, guinea pigs), captive wild animals, and laboratory
      animals, such as rabbits, mice, rats, guinea pigs and hamsters.
      The compositions of the present invention are particularly
      suitable for the treatment of human skin cancers.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] It will be appreciated that the formulations of the present
      invention may be used in any suitable cancer prophylaxis or
      treatment. Administration forms may be any suitable, and include
      creams, gels, ointments, lotions, sprays, lacquers and paints for
      topical application, powders, solutions and suspensions for the
      airways, solutions and emulsions for injection, capsules, syrups
      and elixirs for oral administration, and pessaries and
      suppositories. Other suitable administration forms will be readily
      apparent to those skilled in the art, and may include transdermal
      patches, for example. In a preferred embodiment of the present
      invention, the ingenol angelate formulations are formulated for
      topical administration.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In all cases, the initial formulation is as a formulation
      of the invention. The formulation may be made up into the final
      form either just before use as soon as desired after preparation
      of the formulation, but will usually remain a formulation of the
      invention at all times.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Formulations may comprise additional ingredients, as
      discussed below. It is particularly preferred to employ
      antioxidants, as these appear to provide enhanced stability to the
      formulations. Suitable examples of antioxidants include retinol,
      ascorbic acid, lycopene, butylated hydroxytoluene, and tocopherol.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The amount of ingenol angelate required for pharmaceutical
      efficacy will be apparent to those skilled in the art, and may be
      adapted according to physiological parameters, such as age, weight
      and sex of the patient, as well as the size of any lesion. In
      general, an amount of ingenol angelate suitable to provide between
      about 0.01 .mu.g cm.sup.-2 to about 1 mg cm.sup.-2 may be
      employed, with a range of 0.1 mg cm.sup.-2 to about 100 .mu.g
      cm.sup.-2 being more preferred. In the accompanying Examples, a
      formulation providing 15 .mu.g cm.sup.-2 was used, but
      formulations of 1 .mu.g cm.sup.-2, or less, have been found to be
      effective. In the alternative, formulations of the invention may
      contain I3A in an amount of from 0.001% (w/w) to 0.15% (w/w), more
      preferably up to about 0.1-0.12% (w/w).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Topical formulations are a preferred embodiment of the
      present invention. In this regard, a heretofore unrecognised
      property of the ingenol angelates is particularly useful, in that
      it has been found that they have vasoconstrictive properties.
      Accordingly, systemic distribution of the active ingredient is
      minimised, owing to the reduced blood flow in the vicinity of
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It will be appreciated that the nature of the formulation
      will determine the rate of permeation across the skin. As such, it
      is generally preferred that the formulation be prepared such that
      a rate of permeation of at least about 11 ng cm.sup.-2 h.sup.-1 is
      achieved. There is no special upper limit, although it is
      generally preferred that this not exceed around 1 .mu.g cm.sup.-2
      h.sup.-1.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Topical formulations may take any suitable form. In
      general, it is preferred that they exhibit some level of
      viscosity, in order that they can be targeted at the desired area
      without running off. Accordingly, it is generally preferred to
      formulate ingenol angelate as creams, gels, ointments, and paints.
      Given the potency of ingenol angelate, paints may be employed, as
      they may be applied sparingly, depending on levels of the active
      ingredient.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Poloxamers may be used in preferred formulations of the
      present invention. They are co-polymers which consist of a
      hydrophobic poloxypropylene (POP) molecule sandwiched between two
      hydrophilic molecules of poloxyethylene (POE). Thus, they have the
      ability to solubilise lipophilic drugs within the hydrophobic
      core. Furthermore, poloxamer based aqueous gel formulations
      exhibit thermo-rheological properties, which may be advantageous
      for localised, sustained delivery of drugs. Above a certain
      temperature, known as the critical micelle temperature (cmt), the
      viscosity of the poloxamer gel increases dramatically. An increase
      in viscosity leads to a decrease in the diffusion of any drugs
      dissolved in the gel which slows down the release of drug from the
      gel and leads to sustained delivery. The increase in viscosity may
      also provide a prolonged, localised `depot` at the site of action.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The cmt is dependent on a number of variables such as
      concentration of poloxamer and other additives such as propylene
      glycol. Ideally, the cmt should be at a temperature such that the
      formulation can be injected into the lesion as a liquid (ease of
      administration) and upon contact with body temperature a gel is
      formed with the aim of achieving a localised, sustained delivery
      of the drug. Five poloxamers are listed in the USP, and include
      poloxamer 188 and poloxamer 407. Poloxamer 188 has been approved
      as an excipient for IV formulations
      (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Poloxamer gels have been used for subcutaneous delivery of
      insulin (Barichello et al., 1999) and other drug delivery systems
      for percutaneous use (Tobiyama et al., 1994). One particular
      copolymer, poloxamer 407 has been administered subcutaneously for
      the slow release of peptides and therapeutics proteins, which
      included interleukin-2 and human growth hormone (Morikawa et al.,
      1987; Katakama et al., 1997). Following administration, the gels
      slowly released the entrapped protein molecules over a period of
      1-2 days. Furthermore, a substantial fraction of this poloxamer
      eventually underwent renal excretion.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Poloxamers are generally regarded as non-toxic and
      non-irritant materials. Animal toxicity studies, with dogs and
      rabbits, have shown poloxamers to be non-irritant and
      non-sensitising when applied, in 5% w/v and 10% w/v concentration,
      to the eyes, gums and skin. In a 14-day study of intravenous
      administration to rabbits, at concentrations up to 0.5 g/kg/day,
      no overt adverse effects were noted. A similar study with dogs
      also showed no adverse effects at dosage levels up to 0.5
      g/kg/day. Furthermore, no haemolysis of human blood cells was
      observed over 18 hours at 25.degree. C., with 0.001-10% w/v
      poloxamer solutions (Wade and Weller, 1994). However,
      hyperlipidemia in rats has been reported when an intraperitoneal
      (IP) injection (1.0 g/kg) of poloxamer 407 was introduced (Wasan
      et al., 2003).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Oils may also be used in the present invention. The use of
      an emulsion based intralesional formulation has been reported for
      the treatment of psoriasis (Ho et al., 1990). Prior to
      administration, a vehicle, such as polyoxyethylated castor oil, is
      normally diluted with saline to form the emulsion. However, our
      studies have shown that dilution of I3A with normal saline
      increases the conversion of isoform `b` to `a`. This conversion
      may be minimised if the administration time of the formulation is
      short.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] There are a number of lipophilic products that are
      formulated as oily solutions for intramuscular administrations
      (IM), for example Prolixin Enanthate (Bristol Myers Squibb). The
      vehicle (oil) used varies widely from vegetable oils such as
      arachis oil (used with benzyl benzoate in Dimercaprol Injection
      B.P.) and sesame oil (used in depot injections of Fluphenazine
      Enanthate Injection B.P). The use of oleaginous vehicles may slow
      absorption due to delayed partitioning of the drug from the oil to
      the aqueous body fluids (Ford, 1987). When injected into an
      aqueous environment (such as muscle tissue) a relatively
      lipophilic drug such as I3A, dissolved in an oil phase, will have
      a tendency not to leave the oil and `instantaneously` partition
      into the aqueous phase. In this way a sustained release effect can
      be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Buccal formulations may also be employed. Transmucosal
      delivery of therapeutic agents is a popular administration form,
      because mucous membranes are relatively permeable, allowing for
      the rapid uptake of a drug into the systemic circulation and
      avoiding first pass metabolism. Transmucosal products can be
      designed to be administered via the nasal route and oral/buccal
      route using mucoadhesives. In the development of these drug
      delivery systems, mucoadhesion of the device/formulation is a key
      element. The term `mucoadhesive` is commonly used for materials
      that adhere to the mucin layer of a biological membrane.
      Mucoadhesive polymers have been utilised in many different dosage
      forms in efforts to achieve systemic and localised delivery of
      drugs through the different mucosae. These dosage forms include
      tablets, patches, tapes, films, semisolids and powders.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] To serve as mucoadhesive polymers, the polymers should
      possess physicochemical features such as being predominantly
      anionic with numerous hydrogen bond-forming groups, suitable
      surface properties for wetting mucus/mucosal tissue surfaces and
      sufficient flexibility and length (molecular weight) to penetrate
      the mucus network or tissue crevices. Diverse classes of polymers
      have been reported as potential mucoadhesives such as carbomers
      (polyacrylic acids), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as well
      as naturally occurring polymers, such as hyaluronic acid and
      chitosan.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Preparation of suitable formulations is within the skill of
      those in the art, and suitable excipients for inclusion in any
      such formulation include, for example, gellants, viscosifiers,
      penetration enhancers, preservatives, such as antibiotics and
      antifungals, and cosmetic ingredients, such as scents and
      colourings.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Suitable gelling agents include: water soluble cellulose
      derived polymers, such as hydroxyalkyl cellulose polymers (e.g.
      hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,
      hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose),
      carboxymethyl cellulose, methylhydroxyethyl cellulose and methyl
      cellulose, carbomer (e.g. carbopol); and carrageenans. The gelling
      agent may be added in any suitable amount, such as 1-5% (w/w).
      Preferred gelling agents are cellulose derived, most preferably
      hydroxyalkylcellulose, particularly hydroxyethylcellulose.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Suitable preservatives will be apparent to those skilled in
      the art, and include the parabens (methyl, ethyl, propyl and
      butyl), benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol. Preservatives employed
      solely for that purpose will generally form 1% (w/w) or less of
      the final topical formulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Suitable penetration enhancers include isopropyl alcohol,
      sulphoxides (such as dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO), Azones (e.g.
      laurocapram), pyrrolidones (for example 2-pyrrolidone), alkanols
      (e.g. decanol), and glycols (for example propylene glycol).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Preferred compositions of the invention comprise:<br>
      <br>
      a) I3A;<br>
      <br>
      [0057] b) penetration enhancer;c) preservative;d) gelling agent;
      ande) buffer;wherein the composition has an apparent pH of between
      3 and 4, inclusive.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A particularly preferred composition comprises:<br>
      <br>
      a) 0.1% (w/w) I3A;b) 30% (w/w) isopropyl alcohol;c) 0.9% (w/w)
      benzyl alcohol;d) 1.5% (w/w) hydroxy ethyl cellulose; ande) 67.5%

      A story from the Australian Naturopathic Network notes the recent
      announcement that Euphorbia peplus (commonly known as Radium Weed)
      has been found “to cause sun spots, Basal Cell Carcinoma<br>
      (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) to disappear, and drop
      off!” Brian McDermott, the commentator presenting the story, said,
      “Our grandmothers taught us this over half-a-century ago, and it
      was well-<br>
      known in the bush, where we grew up!” He predicts the so-called
      experts will now be stumbling<br>
      over each other in the race to patent their “discovery.”<br>
