      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Despite their many environmental advantages, electric vehicles
      simply aren’t attractive to all consumers. Some say their
      operating range isn’t enough for their needs, while others think
      charging times are just too long. This second point may well be
      moot thanks to the brilliant invention of a Japanese researcher, a
      certain Mr Kanno.<br>
      <br>
      He has apparently patented a device that can recharge a Nissan
      LEAF or Tesla Roadster in about five minutes. That’s pretty darn
      close to the time it takes to fill up on gas with a conventional
      car.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Kanno says the only limitation of the current charging systems
      is the amount of energy that can travel through a cable. He
      developed a method of storing and distributing the energy in
      five-minute bursts.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Kanno hopes to create operational prototypes with the help of
      the industry’s main automakers in the not-too-distant future.<br>
      <br>
      Thirty-minute charging stations have already appeared on some
      European roads, but this latest innovation mimics today’s gas
      stations and seems quite promising.<br>

      circuit includes a generator, a step-down circuit for reducing an
      output voltage of the generator to a predetermined voltage, a
      current controller for controlling a charging current that is
      supplied from the step-down circuit to a secondary battery, based

      output of the generator, in charging, at a high voltage and a
      small current and is used to charge the battery at a low voltage
      and a large current.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Field of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a charging circuit for
      efficiently charging a secondary battery with electricity of an
      output of a generator and a charger using this charging circuit.
      More specifically, it relates to a charging circuit etc. using a
      small-sized manpower generator.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] Recently, such a small-sized manpower generator has
      appeared which utilizes a motor to improve environment
      consciousness or accommodate shutoff of a battery of mobile
      appliances. It is commercially available as a charger combined
      with a radio or for use in charging of a cellular phone.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Such a charger is generally used for charging in a charging
      circuit shown in FIG. 1. In <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIG.
        1</span>, a reference numeral 10 indicates a generator. In it, R
      indicates an internal resistor (output resistor) of the generator
      10, r indicates a current limiting resistor, D indicates a
      backflow preventing diode, and B indicates a secondary battery.
      Further, Ke indicates a counter-electromotive voltage constant and
      [omega] indicates an angular velocity. Vo indicates a generated
      voltage and Vb indicates a voltage applied to the secondary
      battery B and the diode D.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In the case of a charger having a small-sized man power
      generator that utilizes a motor, its power generating capacity is
      determined mainly by specifications of a motor portion (generator
      10). To increase the capacity, the electromotive voltage constant
      can be increased by increasing the number of turns of a coil wire.
      However, since in a case where a load is the secondary battery, an
      impedance at time when it is charged is small and cannot match an
      output impedance of the generator. As a result thereof, its power
      cannot be taken out effectively, so that it has been impossible to
      avoid a significant deterioration in efficiency only by increasing
      the number of turns.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] If a charging current is large in a case where an output
      resistance of the generator 10 is large, this resistance component
      causes power proportional to a square of the current to be
      dissipated. On the other hand, power of electricity with which the
      secondary battery is charged is determined by a ratio between a
      terminal voltage and a charging current. The terminal voltage
      changes with the charging current but at a very small rate and so
      is roughly constant as shown in FIG. 2. This is because the
      impedance at time when the secondary battery is charged has a very
      small value of 1[Omega] or less.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0008] FIG. 2</span> shows a
      relationship between a voltage of the secondary battery and a
      charging current when it is charged. As shown in FIG. 2, there is
      a linear relationship between the voltage of the secondary battery
      and the charging current. An equation of y=0.0004x+1.4051 is an
      approximate expression, which indicates the relationship between
      the voltage of the secondary battery and the charging current with
      which it is charged, and R&lt;2 &gt; indicates a degree of
      approximation. In this case, a resistance value of a
      nickel-hydrogen battery (Ni-MH battery) used as the secondary
      battery is 0.4[Omega]. In an actual circuit, to this resistance a
      resistance of the charging-current-limiting resistor and a
      resistance of the charging circuit are added, thus giving a total
      sum of about 1[Omega]. It is generally known that when a load
      resistance and an output resistance are equal to each other,
      impedances match each other, in which case the load resistance has
      a maximum dissipation power, with efficiency of 50%. Therefore, in
      a case where the output resistance of the generator 10 is large, a
      loss increases as a charging current increases, thus deteriorating
      the efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0009] FIG. 3</span> is a graph
      for showing relationships between a load resistance and each of
      the generated power, taken-out power, and charging current. Here,
      it is supposed that the generated power voltage of the generator
      10 is 14V and its output resistance is 90[Omega]. As shown in FIG.
      3, to increase the current, the load resistance must be reduced to
      be small, in which case the power that can be taken out and the
      efficiency therefor are deteriorated greatly.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] That is, to utilize generated power effectively, it is
      important to accomplish impedance matching, so that the number of
      turns of the coil wire is limited by a resistance component of the
      charging circuit including the battery. Conventionally, this
      problem has been coped with by first accomplishing impedance
      matching between the output resistor of the generator and the
      secondary battery and then increasing a revolution speed of the
      motor so that a larger amount of generated electricity may be
      generated. For example, to charge the nickel-hydrogen battery with
      electricity of a current of 0.5 A, the output voltage of the
      generator 10 is set to about 2.0V because a voltage at the battery
      terminal is 1.6V and Vf of the backflow preventing diode is 0.3V.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Therefore, according to this setting, the coil is wound so
      that the output resistance of the generator 10 may be 4[Omega]
      because of 2. 0V/0.5 A, and then the revolution speed of the
      generator motor is so set higher as to permit the current of 0.5 A
      to flow therethrough. However, such the setting significantly
      suppresses a degree of freedom in design of the generator, so that
      it has been difficult to keep the revolution speed low for
      low-noise design while obtaining required power at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Further, in a commercially available generator, a charging
      current or a voltage of generated power has been detected and a
      light emitting diode (LED) has been used as a power generation
      monitor, thereby prompting a user to generate power in a set
      condition. This is because operating time of an appliance when it
      has been run at a prescriptive revolution speed of 120 rpm for one
      minute is defined as a power generating capacity of the appliance.
      Thus, the user has had to generate power while keeping in mind the
      prescriptive revolution speed and time in order to store the
      prescriptive power. This has burdened the user greatly.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] From a viewpoint of environments it is important to utilize
      human energy effectively or, from a viewpoint of convenience of a
      mobile appliance, it is important to increase the operating time
      of the appliance for each unit of power generating time. That is,
      such a technology is necessary to acquire a required amount of
      generated electricity, at a smallest possible torque.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The amount of generated electricity can be obtained more by
      increasing the electromotive voltage constant of the generator,
      which means at the same time that the output resistance is
      increased. This leads to a need for a technology of efficiently
      taking out power to an outside even if the output resistance is
      large (e.g., in a case where a generator having a large internal
      resistance is utilized).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Further, a portable type manual charger has been proposed
      which has a constant voltage circuit for regulating a voltage
      generated by the generator to a constant value.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] This portable type manual charger comprises a rotary manual
      handle, a generator for generating a voltage by rotating this
      handle, a constant voltage circuit for regulating a voltage
      generated by this generator to a constant value, an output
      terminal for charging a secondary battery with electricity of an
      output of this constant voltage circuit, and a detection circuit
      for detecting a predetermined value of voltage or current applied
      to the secondary battery to be charged, wherein the constant
      voltage circuit is constituted of a step-down type DC/DC
      converter.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Although this portable type manual charger has a simple
      structure, and attains to low-cost one, a problem of a power loss
      due to the output resistance of the generator has not been solved.
      Further, it has been impossible to control a charging current
      based on an amount of generated electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0018] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      charging circuit for efficiently charging a secondary battery with
      electricity of an output of a generator and a charger using this
      charging circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] According to the present invention, the foregoing object is
      attained by a charging circuit for charging a battery. The
      charging circuit comprises a generator for generating an output
      voltage, a step-down circuit for reducing the output voltage of
      the generator to a predetermined voltage, and a current controller
      for controlling a charging current, which is supplied from the
      step-down circuit to the battery, based on an amount of
      electricity generated by the generator. In charging circuit, the
      step-down circuit receives an output of the generator, in
      charging, at a high voltage and in a small current and is used to
      charge the battery at a low voltage and in a large current.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] For example, this charging circuit further comprises a mode
      selector for selecting a mode for charging the battery, in which
      the mode includes a current-preferred mode for maximizing the
      charging current supplied to the battery and an
      efficiency-preferred mode for maximizing utilization of power
      taken out of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] For example, further, in this charging circuit, the current
      controller comprises a current-controlling element and a
      current-limiting resistor which are set so that a total sum of a
      resistance component of the battery and a resistance of the
      current-limiting resistor may not be less than a negative
      resistance component of the current-controlling element. Further,
      a coil of the generator is supposed to have a delta connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] For example, additionally, this charging circuit comprises
      a monitor circuit for monitoring an amount of stored electricity.
      The monitor circuit has a detector for detecting the amount of
      stored electricity by multiplying the charging current and a
      charging time.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a
      charger for charging a battery comprises a generator for
      generating an output voltage, a step-down circuit for reducing the
      output voltage of the generator to a predetermined voltage, and a
      current controller for controlling a charging current based on an
      amount of electricity generated by the generator, the charging
      current being supplied from the step-down circuit to the battery.
      In the charger, the step-down circuit receives an output of the
      generator, in charging, at a high voltage and in a small current
      and is used to charge the battery at a low voltage and in a large
      current.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] For example, this charger further comprises a mode selector
      for selecting a mode for charging the battery, in which the mode
      includes a current-preferred mode for maximizing the charging
      current supplied to the battery and an efficiency-preferred mode
      for maximizing utilization of power taken out of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] For example, further, in this charger, the current
      controller comprises a current controlling-element and a
      current-limiting resistor which are set so that a total sum of a
      resistance component of the battery and a resistance of the
      current-limiting resistor may not be less than a negative
      resistance component of the current-controlling element. Further,
      a coil of the generator is supposed to have the delta connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] For example, additionally, this charger comprises a monitor
      circuit for monitoring an amount of stored electricity. The
      monitor circuit has a detector for detecting the amount of stored
      electricity by multiplying the charging current and a charging
      time.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to the present invention, by providing the
      step-down circuit for reducing an output voltage of the generator
      to a predetermined voltage and the current controller for
      controlling a charging current, which is supplied to the battery,
      based on the electricity generated by the generator, the step-down
      circuit receives, in charging, an output of the generator at a
      high voltage and in a small current and is uses to charge the
      battery at a low voltage and in a large current. As a result
      thereof, impedance matching can be accomplished between the output
      resistor of the generator and the battery, thereby effectively
      taking power out of the generator and using it to charge the
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Therefore, a charging circuit including the battery can be
      constituted independently of the output resistance of the
      generator, thus greatly improving a degree of freedom in design.
      Even if the battery is charged using a low-revolution speed
      generator having a large electromotive voltage constant, good
      energy efficiency can be obtained, thereby conducting low-noise
      design for reducing a revolution speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Further, constant efficiency can be obtained even if a
      charging current is large, so that it is possible to avoid a
      running torque of a motor from increasing rapidly when an amount
      of generated electricity is increased, thereby obtaining good
      operationality.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Further, by selecting a mode for charging the battery,
      current-preferred charging or efficiency-preferred charging can be
      selected arbitrarily. Since the generator employs the delta
      connection, an output resistance of the generator can be lowered
      to improve efficiency of the step-down circuit. Further, since the
      monitor circuit for monitoring an amount of stored electricity is
      equipped, which detects and indicates that a constant level of
      power has been stored by generation, a user can store a
      prescriptive level of power by generating power at his or her
      desired revolution speed without knowing about a revolution speed
      in particular until it is indicated by the monitor.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The concluding portion of this specification particularly
      points out and directly claims the subject matter of the present
      invention. However those skill in the art will best understand
      both the organization and method of operation of the invention,
      together with further advantages and objects thereof, by reading

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
        EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0043] The following will describe embodiments of the present
      invention with reference to drawings. FIG. 4 is a block diagram
      for showing a configuration of an embodiment of a charging circuit
      100 according to the invention. Further, FIG. 6 is a circuit
      diagram for showing a configuration of the charger 200 using the
      charging circuit 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As shown in FIG. 4, the charging circuit 100 comprises a
      generator 10, a step-down circuit 11, a current controller 12, and
      a secondary battery B.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The generator 10 has a rotary manual handle so that it may
      generate a voltage when this handle is rotated. For example, a
      three-phase brush-less motor is used. A coil of this generator 10
      has a Y connection or delta ([Delta]) connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The step-down circuit 11 has a step-down type DC-DC
      converter. In charging, this step-down circuit 11 receives an
      output of the generator 10 at a high voltage and in a small
      current and is used to charge the secondary battery B at a low
      voltage and in a large current.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The current controller 12 controls a charging current based
      on an amount of electricity generated by the generator 10. Here,
      to explain a charging system by use of the step-down circuit 11,
      the current controller 12 is supposed to comprise a
      current-limiting resistor R3 and a backflow preventing diode D. In
      this case, when charging the battery using the generator 10 as a
      charging power supply, a charging current is regulated to a
      predetermined value by the resistor R3. Further, the diode D is
      adapted to prevent the charging current from flowing back to the
      step-down circuit 11 from the secondary battery B during charging.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] As the secondary battery B, an AA nickel-hydrogen battery
      is used for example. A voltage at an open terminal of this
      secondary battery B is, for example, 1.2V. It is to be noted that
      the secondary battery B may be comprised of a plurality of
      secondary batteries connected in parallel.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In FIG. 4, R indicates an internal resistance (output
      resistance) of the generator 10 and is supposed to be equal to
      90[Omega]. Further, Ke indicates a counter-electromotive voltage
      constant and [omega] indicates an angular velocity. Vy indicates a
      generated voltage and Vx indicates an output voltage of the
      step-down circuit 11. Further, Iy indicates an output current of
      the generator 10 and Ix indicates an output current of the
      step-down circuit 11, that is, a charging current. It is to be
      noted that E=Ke[omega] wherein E indicates generated power
      voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In the charging system by use of the step-down circuit
      shown in FIG. 4, the generator 10 is supposed to be equivalent to
      a battery having an output resistance of 90[Omega] and an output
      of the generator 10 is applied to the step-down circuit 11 having
      conversion efficiency of 80%. An output voltage of the step-down
      circuit 11 is supposed to be 2.0V. Under these conditions, the
      input applied to the step-down circuit 11 is given by the
      following Equation (1):Vy=E-90*Iy (1) Since the step-down circuit
      11 has the same input and output, the following Equation (2) is
      obtained:2.0*Ix=Vy*Iy*0.8 (2) Equations (1) and (2) are combined
      to give the following Equation (3):90*Iy&lt;2&gt; -E*Iy+2.5*Ix=0
      (3) From Equation (3), Iy can be obtained as
      follows:Iy={E+-{square root}(E&lt;2&gt; -4*90*2.5*Ix)}/2*90 (4) It
      can be seen that, for a content under the root sign in Equation
      (4) to have a solution, the generated power voltage E must have at
      least a certain value, which is determined by an output
      resistance, conversion efficiency, and a charging current. If the
      content under the root sign is 0, the output current Iy of the
      generator takes on a value obtained by dividing E by twice the
      output resistance (which current is received through a load
      resistance which is the same as the output resistance), thus
      meeting conditions for obtaining maximum power always irrespective
      of the conversion efficiency and the charging current. It is to be
      noted that if Ix=100 mA, E&gt;=9.5V. Further, if E=9.5V, Vy=4.25V
      and Iy=53 mA.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 5 shows a result of calculations performed in a case
      where the secondary battery was charged directly and a case where
      it was done so through the step-down circuit. The battery was
      charged under the conditions that the output resistance of the
      generator 10 is 90[Omega], the efficiency of the step-down circuit
      11 is 0.8, and the output voltage of the step-down circuit 11 is
      2.0V, and it was supposed that maximum power conditions are met.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] As shown in FIG. 5, in the case of direct charging, as
      generated power increases, the efficiency is deteriorated. In the
      case where it is charged using the step-down circuit 11, on the
      other hand, the efficiency is high and constant. As the generated
      power increases, a difference between these cases becomes
      remarkable, so that the efficiency of charging becomes constant
      when the step-down circuit 11 is used, thus indicating that the
      step-down circuit 11 is effective.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] With reference to FIG. 6, the following will describe a
      specific configuration of the charging circuit 100 used in an
      embodiment of a charger 200 according to the invention. As shown
      in FIG. 6, the charging circuit 100 comprises a generator 10A, the
      step-down circuit 11, current controller 12A, the secondary
      battery B, a monitor circuit 13 for monitoring an amount of stored
      electricity, a power generation monitor 14, and an over-voltage
      monitor 15. Of these, the current controller 12A comprises the
      current-limiting resistor R3 and transistors (current-controlling
      transistors) Q2 and Q3.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The generator 10A is supposed to be a three-phase
      brush-less motor and a coil of this generator 10 employs the delta
      ([Delta]) connection. Therefore, an internal resistance of the
      generator 10A is reduced to, for example, 21[Omega]. By thus
      reducing the internal resistance, the efficiency of the step-down
      circuit 11 can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As the step-down circuit 11, a step-down type DC-DC
      converter having an output voltage of 2V (XC9201C type step-down
      IC, which is hereinafter referred to as "step-down IC") is used.
      It is to be noted that an over-current protection terminal 2
      (second pin) of the step-down IC (U1) is not in use. Therefore, a
      resistance value of a resistor R1 is supposed to be 0.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The current controller 12A controls a charging current
      supplied to the secondary battery B using the current-limiting
      resistor R3 and the transistors Q2 and Q3 based on an amount of
      electricity generated by the generator 10A.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Further, the monitor circuit 13 comprises R11 and C7 shown
      in FIG. 6, to monitor an amount of the stored electricity. In this
      monitor circuit 13, an LED is adapted to emit light by using a
      timer constituted of R11 and C7 when a quantity of a current
      multiplied by a certain lapse of time is reached. In this case,
      the amount of the stored electricity is detected by multiplying
      the charging current by the charging time. For example, the
      charging current is monitored on the basis of a voltage applied to
      the step-down circuit 11 or an average value of pulses of a
      switching element driver.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] This monitor circuit 13 turns on a green LED D9 when an
      amount of electricity of 400 mA multiplied by one minute is
      stored. In this circuit, D9 lights up when generation at 400 mA
      for one minute is performed. If generation at 200 mA for two
      minutes is performed, the LED D9 also lights up.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Further, the power generation monitor 14 is a circuit that
      includes resistance R6 and an orange-color LED D7. In it, a
      current starts to flow when a generated voltage reaches 2V or
      higher, while the step-down IC (U1) requires at least 2.3V for its
      stable operation. At this voltage, the orange-color LED D7 in the
      power generation monitor 14 lights up in setting. A user can
      charge the battery securely by rotating the handle so that the LED
      D7 may light up. A luminosity of the LED D7 depends on a generated
      voltage.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The over-voltage monitor 15 turns on a red LED D10 if
      excess power is generated, for example, if a generated voltage
      reaches 16.5V or higher. A protection current flows through Q5 if
      a voltage applied to the step-down IC (U1) reaches 16.5V or
      higher, to prevent an excessive voltage from being applied to it
      because the revolution speed is too high. In such a case, the red
      LED D10 emits light to give a warning to the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In charging, power generated by the generator 10A goes
      through a rectifier circuit constituted of diodes D1-D6 to be
      converted into a DC voltage and then is provided to a step-down
      circuit 11 having the step-down IC (U1). A switching frequency is
      determined to about 300 klHz by a resistor R10 and a capacitor C5
      which are connected to a fifth pin of the step-down IC (U1). At
      this frequency, the switching element Q1 is switched, so that an
      output is provided through a coil L1. Its output voltage is
      returned to a seventh pin of the step-down IC (U1) by the feedback
      resistors R2 and R4 and compared with an internal reference
      voltage of 0.9V. An error voltage obtained after this comparison
      with the reference voltage undergoes pulse width modulation to be
      returned to a switching pulse and is controlled by changing its
      pulse duty ratio so that the output voltage may be kept constant.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] An output of the step-down IC (U1) is applied to the
      secondary battery B through the current limiting resistor R3 and
      the transistors Q2 and Q3. These two transistors having a low Vce
      (sat) value were selected and used to reduce a circuit loss.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Since an output voltage of the step-down IC (U1) is
      constant at 2.0V, if current control is not conducted, a current
      flows irrespective of a generated power, so that a voltage applied
      to the step-down IC is lowered to a value below the one met the
      operating conditions of the step-down IC (U1) owing to a feedback
      in order of a charging current (large in magnitude), generator's
      output current (large in magnitude), and the voltage applied to
      the step-down IC (low in level). Therefore, there occurs a need
      for controlling the charging current in accordance with the
      generated power. The transistors Q2 and Q3 respectively control a
      base current based on the generated voltage so that the charging
      current may be altered.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] A mode for charging the secondary battery B includes a
      current-preferred mode for regulating a charging current to be
      supplied to the secondary battery B to a predetermined value and
      an efficiency-preferred mode for maximizing utilization of power
      taken out of the generator 10A. This mode charge is controlled by
      altering a resistance value of a resistor R7. The resistance value
      of the resistor R7 is altered using, for example, a transfer
      switch S1 which functions as mode selector for selecting the mode
      for charging the secondary battery B.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] If the resistance value of the resistor R7 is lowered by
      the transfer switch, the current-preferred mode is entered. In
      this case, a larger base current flows through each of the
      transistor Q2 and Q3 to increase the charging current. For
      example, if the current-preferred mode is entered in which the
      base resistance of R7 is switched to 2 k[Omega] to set the
      charging current to a maximum value (e.g., 900 mA), take-out
      efficiency of generated power is about 50%. If the resistance
      value of the resistor R7 is increased by the transfer switch, on
      the other hand, the efficiency-preferred mode is entered. In this
      case, a smaller base current flows through each of the transistors
      Q2 and Q3, so that the charging current decreases but the take-out
      efficiency increases. For example, in a case where such an
      efficiency-preferred mode is entered that the base resistance of
      R7 is switched to 8.2k[Omega] to set the take-out efficiency of
      the generated power to a maximum value (e.g., 84%), the charging
      current is about 460 mA.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] FIGS. 7 to 11 show results of experiments conducted in a
      case where in place of the generator 10A an output resistor
      (68[Omega]) was connected to the DC power supply in the
      above-mentioned charging circuit 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] FIG. 7 shows properties of the current control transistor
      Q2 and Q3. It indicates a relationship between an actual charging
      current and each of the Vce voltage and base current of the
      control transistors Q2, Q3. An equation of y=-0.00073x+0.57421 in
      the graph is an approximate expression that indicates a
      relationship between a charging current and Vce voltage during
      charging, and R&lt;2 &gt; therein indicates a degree of
      approximation.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] As shown in FIG. 7, good linearity is maintained between
      the charging current and the Vce voltage and between the charging
      current and the base current. Further, in this example, Vce can be
      approximated by 0.57-0.73*current value (A) and a resistance
      component can be replaced by 0.73[Omega] with a negative polarity,
      that is, a negative resistance. In the charging circuit 100 shown
      in FIG. 6, this negative resistance (-0.73[Omega]) was canceled by
      the internal resistance of the secondary battery B of 0.4[Omega]
      and the current-limiting resistance R3 so as to provide 0[Omega].
      This avoids the output of the step-down IC (U1) from being
      influenced by a magnitude of the charging current. If a current
      flows so that such a combined resistance is negative, a feedback
      occurs in a further-current-flow direction, thereby resulting in
      flowing an excessive current. If a current flows so that the
      combined resistance is positive, on the other hand, a feedback
      occurs in such a direction that the current flow may be
      suppressed, thereby enabling safe charging.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A maximum current is permitted to flow when a sufficient
      amount of electricity is generated and the Vce voltage of each of
      the transistors Q2 and Q3 is reduced to a minimum. The maximum
      current and is mainly regulated by the output voltage and the
      current-limiting resistance R3 to 1A or lower in this circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIG. 8 is a graph for showing relationships between an
      amount of the generated electricity, and each of the amount of
      discharged electricity and energy efficiency. In FIG. 8, a
      horizontal axis representing power at time of power application
      indicates output power of the DC power supply used in place of the
      generator 10A. It is to be noted that the amount of discharged
      electricity (discharged power) was obtained by multiplying a
      charging current by 1.2V. Further, taking-out efficiency was
      defined by (1.2V/step-down circuit's output voltage) and overall
      efficiency, by (the amount of the discharged electricity/the
      amount of the generated electricity).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 8 shows that efficiency at which energy is taken out
      to an outside is 50-57%, which is a good value in the vicinity of
      a roughly maximum power value, and increases slightly as the
      discharged power increases in a region where the discharged power
      is at least 100 mW. The conversion efficiency of the step-down
      circuit deteriorates as a difference between input and output
      voltages increases and so decreases as the amount of the generated
      electricity increases. These two properties offset each other, so
      that the overall efficiency was a flat value of about 25%,
      exhibiting properties independent of the charging current
      (discharged power).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIG. 9 is a graph for showing a relationship between a
      generated voltage and a charging current. An equation of
      y=53.011x-107.54 in the graph is an approximate expression that
      indicates a relationship between the generated voltage and the
      charging current, and R&lt;2 &gt; therein indicates a degree of
      approximation.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 9 shows that good linearity is maintained between an
      output voltage of the generator 10A and a charging current.
      Therefore, it is possible to correctly detect an amount of the
      stored electricity even if the charging current has altered due to
      fluctuations in the generated voltage caused by fluctuations in
      revolution speed etc. A current starts to flow at 2V or higher
      because the step-down IC (U1) requires at least 2.3V for stable
      operation. It is so set that at this voltage the LED D7 in the
      power generation monitor 14 may emit light.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 10 is a graph for showing a relationship between a
      voltage applied to the step-down IC and a charging current. An
      equation of y=53.011x-107.54 in the graph is an approximate
      expression that indicates a relationship between the voltage
      applied to the step-down IC (U1) and the charging current, and
      R&lt;2 &gt; therein indicates a degree of approximation. As shown
      in FIG. 10, good linearity is maintained between a voltage applied
      to the step-down IC (U1) and a charging current. When the applied
      voltage reaches 2V or higher, a current starts to flow, thereby
      causing the step-down IC (U1) to operate.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 11 is a graph for showing a relationship between a
      base resistance and efficiency. In FIG. 11, efficiency values are
      those obtained in a case where generated power is 600 mW. Further,
      a mechanical loss (loss due to a gear portion) is an estimate and
      magneto-electric efficiency is 100%.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] As shown in FIG. 11, mechanical efficiency is 90%
      irrespective of the resistance value of the base resistor R7.
      Further, take-out efficiency decreases as the resistance value of
      the base resistor R7 decreases. Further, converter efficiency
      increases as the resistance value of the base resistor R7
      decreases. Further, when the resistance value of the base resistor
      R7 is 6.8 k[Omega], 8.2[Omega], or 4.7 k[Omega], the overall
      efficiency is comparatively high and, when the resistance value of
      the resistor R7 is 2 k[Omega], the overall efficiency is
      comparatively low. That is, the take-out efficiency and the
      converter efficiency cannot be consistent with each other. When
      the take-out efficiency is 50%, the charging current takes on a
      maximum value (e.g., 900 mA).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] As mentioned above, by inserting the step-down circuit 11
      (i.e., step-down type DC-DC converter) as an impedance conversion
      element between the output of the generator 10A and the secondary
      battery B, receiving power out of the generator at a high voltage
      and in a small current, and then using it to charge the secondary
      battery at a low voltage and in a large current, impedance
      matching can be accomplished to obtain high charging efficiency
      even if the output resistance becomes large.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] As described above, according to the present embodiment,
      there are provided the step-down circuit 11 for reducing an output
      voltage of the generator 10A to a predetermined voltage, the
      current controller 12A for controlling a charging current supplied
      from the step-down circuit 11 to the secondary battery B based on
      an amount of electricity generated by the generator 10A, the mode
      selector (not shown) for selecting a charging mode, and the
      monitor circuit 13 for monitoring an amount of stored electricity.
      The step-down circuit 11 receives an output of the generator, in
      charging, at a high voltage and in a small current and is used to
      charge the secondary battery at a low voltage and in a large
      current. Thus, impedance matching can be accomplished between the
      output resistance of the generator 10A and the secondary battery
      B, thereby taking power out of the generator 10A effectively and
      using it to charge the secondary battery B.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Therefore, it is possible to constitute a charging circuit
      including the secondary battery B irrespective of the output
      resistance of the generator 10A, thereby greatly improving a
      degree of freedom in design. Good energy efficiency can be
      obtained even if the secondary battery B is charged using the
      low-revolution speed generator 10A having a large electromotive
      voltage constant, thereby conducting low-noise design for reducing
      a revolution speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Further, constant efficiency can be obtained even if a
      charging current is large, so that it is possible to avoid a
      running torque of the motor from increasing rapidly when an amount
      of generated electricity is increased, thereby obtaining good
      operationality.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Further, by selecting a mode for charging the secondary
      battery B, current-preferred charging or efficiency-preferred
      charging can be selected arbitrarily. Since the generator 10A
      employs the delta connection, the output resistance of the
      generator 10A can be lowered to improve the efficiency of the
      step-down circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Further, the monitor circuit 13 for monitoring an amount of
      the stored electricity is equipped which causes a minute current
      proportional to a charging current to flow through a timer circuit
      constituted of a resistor and a capacitor by utilizing a
      relationship between the generated voltage and the charging
      current, to thereby always indicate that a constant level of power
      has been stored irrespective of a magnitude of a revolution speed
      of the generator. This permits a user to store a prescriptive
      level of power by generating power at his or her desired
      revolution speed without knowing about a revolution speed in
      particular until the monitor circuit 13 emits light.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The above-mentioned charging circuit 100 can be used to
      constitute a charger in which the generator 10A serves as a
      charging power supply. In this case, the generator 10A may be
      integrated with circuit portions such as the step-down circuit 11,
      the current controller 12A, and the monitor circuit 13 (for
      example, contained in the same casing) to thereby constitute the
      charger. Further, the secondary battery B is mounted detachably.
      It is to be noted that the generator 10A may be separated from the
      circuit portions such as the step-down circuit 11, the current
      controller 12A, and the monitor circuit 13.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Although the above embodiments have been described with
      reference to a case where the secondary battery B is a 1.5V
      nickel-hydrogen battery, the present invention is not limited to
      it. The present invention can be applied to any other kinds of
      batteries. Further, the present invention is applicable also to a
      case where a plurality of secondary batteries is used in series or
      parallel to constitute the secondary battery B to be charged. This
      modification can be accommodated by altering an output voltage or
      current of the step-down circuit 11. For example, if a plurality
      of secondary batteries is used in series, a step-down circuit
      having a higher output voltage can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Although in the above embodiment the generator 10A has
      employed the delta connection, the present invention is not
      limited to it. The present invention can also be applied to a
      generator employing the Y connection.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Although in the above embodiment the generator 10 or 10A
      has used a hand-cranked motor, the present invention is not
      limited to it. Any other kinds of rotary generators, for example,
      a small-sized wind generator may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] While the foregoing specification has described preferred
      embodiment(s) of the present invention, one skilled in the art may
      make many modifications to the preferred embodiment without
      departing from the invention in its broader aspects. The appended
      claims therefore are intended to cover all such modifications as
      fall within the true scope and spirit of the invention.<br>
