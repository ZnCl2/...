    <blockquote>Did you know that you qualify for another, much more
      powerful vote than the one which you cast on election day? This
      opportunity comes when you are selected for jury duty, a position
      of honor for over 700 years.
      <p>The principle of a Common Law Jury or Trial by the Country was
        first established on June 15, 1215 at Runnymede, England when
        King John signed the Magna Carta, or Great Charter of our
        Liberties. It created the basis for our Constitutional, system
        of Justice. </p>
      <p><b>JURY POWER in the system of checks and balances:</b> </p>
      <p>In a Constitutional system of justice, such as ours, there is a
        judicial body with more power than Congress, the President, or
        even the Supreme Court. Yes, the trial jury protected under our
        Constitution has more power than all these government officials.
        This is because it has the final veto power over all "acts of
        the legislature" that may come to be called "laws". </p>
      <p>In fact, the power of jury nullification predates our
        Constitution. In November of 1734, a printer named John Peter
        Zenger was arrested for seditious libel against his Majesty's
        government. At that time, a law of the Colony of New York forbid
        any publication without prior government approval. Freedom of
        the press was not enjoyed by the early colonialists! Zenger,
        however, defied this censorship and published articles strongly
        critical of New York colonial rule. </p>
      <p>When brought to trial in August of 1735, Zenger admitted
        publishing the offending articles, but argued that the truth of
        the facts stated justified their publication. The judge
        instructed the jury that truth is not justification for libel.
        Rather, truth makes the libel more vicious, for public unrest is
        more likely to follow true, rather than false claims of bad
        governance. And since the defendant had admitted to the "fact"
        of publication, only a question of "law" remained. </p>
      <p>Then, as now, the judge said the "issue of law" was for the
        court to determine, and he instructed the jury to find the
        defendant guilty. It took only ten minutes for the jury to
        disregard the judge's instructions on the law and find Zenger
        NOT GUILTY. </p>
      <p>That is the power of the jury at work; the power to decide the
        issues of law under which the defendant is charged, as well as
        the facts. In our system of checks and balances, the jury is our
        final check, the people's last safegard against unjust law and
        tyranny. </p>
      <p><b>A Jury's Rights, Powers, and Duties: But does the jury's
          power to veto bad laws exist under our Constitution?</b> </p>
      <p>Find out even more about the legal system, and pick up a
        certification to advance your career simply by taking a few
        online paralegal courses. Regardless of where you are employed,
        the fact is Paralegal studies have many practical applications
        that can help you advance. <br>
        It certainly does! At the time the Constitution was written, the
        definition of the term "jury" referred to a group of citizens
        empowered to judge both the law and the evidence in the case
        before it. Then, in the February term of 1794, the Supreme Court
        conducted a jury trial in the case of the State of Georgia vs.
        Brailsford (3 Dall 1). The instructions to the jury in the first
        jury trial before the Supreme Court of the United States
        illustrate the true power of the jury. Chief Justice John Jay
        said: "It is presumed, that juries are the best judges of facts;
        it is, on the other hand, presumed that courts are the best
        judges of law. But still both objects are within your power of
        decision." (emphasis added) "...you have a right to take it upon
        yourselves to judge of both, and to determine the law as well as
        the fact in controversy". </p>
      <p>So you see, in an American courtroom there are in a sense
        twelve judges in attendance, not just one. And they are there
        with the power to review the "law" as well as the "facts"!
        Actually, the "judge" is there to conduct the proceedings in an
        orderly fashion and maintain the safety of all parties involved.
      </p>
      <p>As recently as 1972, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
        of Columbia said that the jury has an " unreviewable and
        irreversible power... to acquit in disregard of the instructions
        on the law given by the trial judge.... (US vs Dougherty, 473 F
        2d 1113, 1139 (1972)) </p>
      <p>Or as this same truth was stated in a earlier decision by the
        United States Court of Appeals for the District of Maryland: "We
        recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury
        to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given
        by the judge, and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that
        must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in
        criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the
        jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury
        feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is
        unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of
        the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic of
        passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must
        abide by that decision." (US vs Moylan, 417 F 2d 1002, 1006
        (1969)). </p>
      <p>YOU, as a juror armed with the knowledge of the purpose of a
        jury trial, and the knowledge of what your Rights, powers, and
        duties really are, can with your single vote of not guilty
        nullify or invalidate any law involved in that case. Because a
        jury's guilty decision must be unanimous, it takes only one vote
        to effectively nullify a bad "act of the legislature". Your one
        vote can "hang" a jury; and although it won't be an acquittal,
        at least the defendant will not be convicted of violating an
        unjust or unconstitutional law. </p>
      <p>The government cannot deprive anyone of "Liberty", without your
        consent! </p>
      <p>If you feel the statute involved in any criminal case being
        tried before you is unfair, or that it infringes upon the
        defendant's God-given inalienable or Constitutional rights, you
        can affirm that the offending statute is really no law at all
        and that the violation of it is no crime; for no man is bound to
        obey an unjust command. In other words, if the defendant has
        disobeyed some man-made criminal statute, and the statute is
        unjust, the defendant has in substance, committed no crime.
        Jurors, having ruled then on the justice of the law involved and
        finding it opposed in whole or in part to their own natural
        concept of what is basically right, are bound to hold for the
        acquittal of said defendant. </p>
      <p>It is your responsibility to insist that your vote of not
        guilty be respected by all other members of the jury. For you
        are not there as a fool, merely to agree with the majority, but
        as a qualified judge in your right to see that justice is done.
        Regardless of the pressures or abuse that may be applied to you
        by any or all members of the jury with whom you may in good
        conscience disagree, you can await the reading of the verdict
        secure in the knowledge you have voted your conscience and
        convictions, not those of someone else. </p>
      <p>So you see, as a juror, you are one of a panel of twelve judges
        with the responsibility of protecting all innocent Americans
        from unjust laws. </p>
      <p><b>Jurors Must Know Their Rights:</b> </p>
      <p>You must know your rights! Because, once selected for jury
        duty, nobody will inform you of your power to judge both law and
        fact. In fact, the judge's instructions to the jury may be to
        the contrary. Another quote from US vs Dougherty (cited
        earlier): "The fact that there is widespread existence of the
        jury's prerogative, and approval of its existence as a necessary
        counter to case-hardened judges and arbitrary prosecutors, does
        not establish as an imperative that the jury must be informed by
        the judge of that power". </p>
      <p>Look at that quote again. the court ruled jurors have the right
        to decide the law, but they don't have to be told about it. It
        may sound hypocritical, but the Dougherty decision conforms to
        an 1895 Supreme Court decision that held the same thing. In
        Sparf vs US (156 US 51), the court ruled that although juries
        have the right to ignore a judge's instructions on the law, they
        don't have to be made aware of the right to do so. </p>
      <p>Is this Supreme Court ruling as unfair as it appears on the
        surface? It may be, but the logic behind such a decision is
        plain enough. </p>
      <p>In our Constitutional Republic (note I didn't say democracy)
        the people have granted certain limited powers to government,
        preserving and retaining their God-given inalienable rights. So,
        if it is indeed the juror's right to decide the law, then the
        citizens should know what their rights are. They need not be
        told by the courts. After all, the Constitution makes us the
        masters of the public servants. Should a servant have to tell a
        master what his rights are? Of course not, it's our
        responsibility to know what our rights are! </p>
      <p>The idea that juries are to judge only the "facts" is absurd
        and contrary to historical fact and law. Are juries present only
        as mere pawns to rubber stamp tyrannical acts of the government?
        We The People wrote the supreme law of the land, the
        Constitution, to "secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
        and our posterity." Who better to decide the fairness of the
        laws, or whether the laws conform to the Constitution? </p>
      <p><b>Our Defense - Jury Power:</b> </p>
      <p>Sometime in the future, you may be called upon to sit in
        judgment of a sincere individual being prosecuted (persecuted?)
        for trying to exercise his or her Rights, or trying to defend
        the Constitution. If so, remember that in 1804, Samuel Chase,
        Supreme Court Justice and signer of the Declaration of
        Independence said: "The jury has the Right to judge both the law
        and the facts". And also keep in mind that "either we all hang
        together, or we most assuredly will all hang separately". </p>
      <p>You now understand how the average citizen can help keep in
        check the power of government and bring to a halt the
        enforcement of tyrannical laws. Unfortunately, very few people
        know or understand this power which they as Americans possess to
        nullify oppressive acts of the legislature. </p>
      <p>America, the Constitution and your individual rights are under
        attack! Will you defend them? READ THE CONSTITUTION, KNOW YOUR
        RIGHTS! Remember, if you don't know what your Rights are, you
        haven't got any! </p>

      <p>A bill now pending in the Missouri state legislature has
        whipped up a firestorm of controversy. Judges and prosecutors
        there call it "a gut-punch to democracy," "an invitation to
        anarchy," and a bill that "flies in the face of everything this
        country stands for." One county prosecutor has even called for
        the resignation of the 20 state representatives who introduced
        the bill. </p>
      <p>What could have caused such calamity? This supposedly radical
        legislation would merely require judges to tell criminal juries
        the undisputed fact that they have "the power to judge the law
        as well as the evidence, and to vote on the verdict according to
        conscience." It is hard to remember the last time there was so
        much turmoil over a proposal to declassify a government secret
        during peacetime. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, out in Nevada, a 50-year-old florist and grandmother
        almost landed in prison for her efforts to help spread the word
        to jurors. When her son went on trial for drug charges in
        federal court, Yvonne Regas and a friend papered the windshields
        of nearby parked cars, hoping to let the jurors learn the
        completely unexpected fact that her son faced 450 years in
        prison for a single drug transaction nine years earlier. Federal
        authorities charged her with jury tampering and obstruction of
        justice, but eventually dropped the charges. Presumably, they
        gave up hope of figuring out how they could get jurors to
        convict her without showing them the contents of the pamphlets
        she had been distributing -- and then her jury would know the
        truth about nullification. </p>
      <p>Despite all the modern government resentment toward "jury
        nullification," its roots run deep in both our history and law.
        At least two provisions of the Constitution, and arguably three,
        protect the jury's power to nullify. They also explain why that
        power is limited to criminal cases, and has no analogy in the
        civil context. </p>
      <p>First, it is reflected in the Sixth Amendment, which grants the
        accused an inviolable right to a jury determination of his guilt
        or innocence in all criminal prosecutions for serious offenses.
        Because of this right, a trial judge absolutely cannot direct a
        verdict in favor of the State or set aside a jury's verdict of
        not guilty, "no matter how overwhelming the evidence." Sullivan
        v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277 (1993). Any violation of this
        rule is automatically reversible error without regard to the
        evidence of guilt. Id. Indeed, the point is so well settled that
        it was announced without dissent in Sullivan by a Court that has
        been unanimous on only a few constitutional questions in the
        past ten years. </p>
      <p>This rule is applied with a rigor that is without parallel in
        any area of civil practice. For example, it is reversible error
        to direct a verdict of guilty over the defendant's objection,
        even if he takes the witness stand and admits under oath that he
        committed every element of the charged offense! Bryant v.
        Georgia, 163 Ga. App. 872, 296 S.E.2d 168 (Ga. Ct. App. 1982).
        (Although one might fairly describe that particular defense
        strategy as a questionable use of direct examination.) </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Judicial Deference</font></b> </p>
      <p>Likewise, when a judge takes judicial notice of a fact in a
        criminal case--for example, that the defendant could not have
        boarded a train in New York and exited in Texas without somehow
        crossing state lines--he will tell the jury they "may" accept
        that fact as proven without further evidence. But he may not
        tell them that they are required to do so, or take the factual
        question away from them, no matter how obvious the fact might
        seem. See Advisory Committee Notes to Fed. R. Evid. 201(g). Even
        where the defendant and his attorney enter into a formal
        stipulation admitting an element of the offense, the jury should
        be told merely that they may regard the matter to be "proved,"
        if they wish, but the judge still cannot direct a verdict on
        that factual issue or take it away from the jury over the
        defendant's objection. United States v. Muse, 83 F.3d 672,
        679-80 (4th Cir. 1996). All of these rules are designed, in
        part, to protect the jury's inviolable power to nullify and to
        avoid the reversible error always committed when "the wrong
        entity judge[s] the defendant guilty." Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S.
        570, 578 (1986). </p>
      <p>Second, the roots of nullification also run deep into the
        (p.7)Double Jeopardy Clause. Even where the jury's verdict of
        not guilty seems indefensible, that clause prevents the State
        from pursuing even the limited remedy of a new trial. This rule,
        by design, gives juries the power to "err upon the side of
        mercy" by entering "an unassailable but unreasonable verdict of
        not guilty." Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 317 n.10 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the jury's power to nullify is protected by our
        abiding "judicial distaste" for special verdicts or
        interrogatories to the jury in criminal cases. United States v.
        Oliver North, 910 F.2d 843, 910-11 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Unlike in
        civil cases, where such devices are routinely employed, in
        criminal cases it has frequently been held to be error to ask a
        jury to return anything but a general verdict of guilty or not
        guilty. United States v. McCracken, 488 F.2d 406, 418-419 (5th
        Cir. 1974) (collecting cases). This rule is designed to
        safeguard the jury's power "to arrive at a general verdict
        without having to support it by reasons or by a report of its
        deliberations," and to protect its historic power to nullify or
        temper rules of law based on the jurors' sense of justice as
        conscience of the community. Id.; United States v. Spock, 416
        F.2d 165, 181-82 (1st Cir. 1969). The jury is given "a general
        veto power, and this power should not be attenuated by requiring
        the jury to answer in writing a detailed list of questions or
        explain its reasons." United States v. Wilson, 629 F.2d 439, 443
        (6th Cir. 1980). Although the issue is far from settled, a
        powerful argument can be made that this rule "is of
        constitutional dimensions," and a direct corollary of the Sixth
        Amendment's protection of the jury's power to nullify. Wayne
        LaFave v Jerold Israel, Criminal Procedure § 24.7(a) (2d ed.
        1992). </p>
      <p>These constitutional rules, in combination, give a criminal
        jury the inherent discretionary power to "decline to convict,"
        and insure that such "discretionary exercises of leniency are
        final and unreviewable." McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 311
        (1987). This state of affairs does not even have a rough
        parallel in civil cases, where the Seventh Amendment right to a
        "trial by jury" does not preclude judges from granting summary
        judgment, directed verdicts, and new trials. (In effect,
        although both amendments are written quite similarly, the
        Supreme Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment to give
        criminal defendants a right to a jury and a trial; the Seventh
        Amendment, where it applies, only gives civil litigants the
        right to a jury if there is a trial.) </p>
      <p>The existence of a criminal jury's power to nullify is
        currently as well settled as any other rule of constitutional
        law. It is a cornerstone of American criminal procedure. The far
        more controversial issue--and much more frequently litigated--is
        that perennial dilemma: What should we tell the kids? Should (or
        must) the judge tell the jurors anything about their power (or
        right) to nullify? Should the judge at least allow the defense
        to tell them? If so, how much should we tell them, and how
        should we do it? These issues lie at the very core of our
        criminal justice system, and have been debated by lawyers,
        journalists, philosophers, and patriots for two centuries. It is
        therefore ironic that these questions have, at least in recent
        decades, generated one of the most remarkable displays of
        unanimity ever orchestrated by state and federal courts on any
        issue of law in American history. </p>
      <p>It would take at most four words to fairly summarize the
        unanimous consensus of state and federal judges on the idea of
        telling jurors about their power to nullify: "Forget it. No
        way." Even while extolling the beauty and majesty of our
        commitment to the jury's constitutional role as a guardian
        against tyranny, no state or federal appellate court in decades
        has held that a trial judge is even permitted--much less
        required to explicitly instruct the jurors on their undisputed
        power to return a verdict of not guilty in the interests of
        justice. The federal courts are unanimous and have been for
        years, e.g., United States v. Manning, 79 F.3d 212, 219 (1st
        Cir. 1996) ("a district judge may not instruct the jury as to
        its power to nullify"). So are the state appellate courts, e.g.,
        Mouton v. Texas, 923 S.W.2d 219 (Tex. Ct. App. 1996); Michigan
        v. Demers, 195 Mich. App. 205, 489 N.W.2d 173 (Mich. Ct. App.
        1992). </p>
      <p><font size="+1">State Law</font> There is a pervasive myth that
        three states supposedly allow jury nullification instructions:
        Georgia, Maryland, and Indiana. See State v. Morgan Stanley Co.,
        194 W.V. 163, 175, 459 S.E.2d 906, 918 n.27 (W.V. 1995); Paul
        Butler, Racially Based Jury Nullification: Black Power in the
        Criminal Justice System, 105 Yale L.J. 677, 704 n.147 (1995).
        Some lists also include Oregon. This is presumably because those
        states have laws or constitutional provisions suggesting that
        criminal jurors are judges of the law and the facts. But the
        myth is false. Despite their differing constitutions, all four
        states have held that a jury has, at most, the power to acquit a
        guilty man, not the right, and should not be told that it may
        ignore or nullify the law. See, e.g., Miller v. Georgia, 260 Ga.
        191, 196, 391 S.E.2d 642, 647 (Ga. 1990). </p>
      <p>Resourceful defendants and their attorneys have tried every
        conceivable route around this immovable roadblock. All have been
        thwarted. Without exception, the appellate courts will not allow
        a defense attorney to use her closing argument to tell the
        jurors about their power to nullify, or to urge them to use it.
        See, e.g., United States v. Muse, 83 F.3d 672, 677 (4th Cir.
        1996). </p>
      <p>Nor can the defense offer evidence that is relevant to nothing
        (p.8)but the justness of a conviction or acquittal, or is
        otherwise designed to induce the jury to nullify. United States
        v. Griggs, 50 F.3d 17, 1995 WL 7669 (9th Cir. 1994). This
        includes, most notably, any information about the sentence faced
        by the defendant, even if it is a minimum mandated by law.
        United States v. Johnson, 62 F.3d 849, 850-51 (6th Cir. 1995). </p>
      <p>Judicial disapproval also extends to any evidence or argument
        designed solely to persuade the jury that the government was
        guilty of misconduct in its investigation or prosecution. United
        States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93-95 (2d Cir. 1984). </p>
      <p>Predictably, the battle is moving to the earliest stages of the
        trial, but the results are the same. Requests to ask jurors
        about nullification on voir dire have been denied. United States
        v. Datche,. 830 F. Supp. 411, 418 (M.D. Tenn. 1993). </p>
      <p>One pro se defendant tried to persuade the Supreme Court that
        her trial judge improperly refused to let her challenge for
        cause those prospective jurors who did know or understand the
        term "jury nullification." Mendonca v. Oregon, 55 U.S.L.W. 3362
        (1986) (petition for certiorari). The Court decided it might
        tackle that one later, and denied review. 479 U.S. 979 (1986). </p>
      <p>Defendants will go to any lengths to get this forbidden topic
        of discussion before the jury. In one recent case involving
        minor charges in traffic court, a pro se defendant offered the
        State of Pennsylvania a bargain of almost Faustian proportions.
        He asserted a right to execute a release of his property rights
        under state law and all of his privileges and immunities secured
        by the Fourteenth Amendment, subject to the condition that he
        would revert to the status of an "American Freeman" with all of
        the "common law rights thereof, including the right to a jury
        possessing the power of jury nullification." Phelps v.
        Pennsylvania, 59 U.S.L.W. 3522 (1991) (petition for certiorari).
        The Supreme Court passed up this chance to decide the issue,
        perhaps preferring to wait until it percolates a bit more in the
        lower courts. 498 U.S. 1088 (1991). </p>
      <p>Judicial hostility to jury nullification goes well beyond the
        stone wall of silence erected around the jury box. Case after
        case has approved jury instructions actually designed to imply
        that jurors do not have such power at all, or to "instruct the
        jury on the dimensions of their duty to the exclusion of jury
        nullification." United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1190
        (1st Cir. 1993). For example, criminal jurors are routinely
        ordered: "You must follow my instructions on the law, even if
        you thought the law was different or should be different,"
        Eighth Circuit Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction 3.02 (1991),
        and "even if you disagree or don't understand the reasons for
        some of the rules." Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal
        Jury Instruction 9 (1987). </p>
      <p>In extreme cases, this judicial hostility even extends to
        dishonesty. As Chief Judge Bazelon correctly observed, current
        law on this topic is tantamount to a "deliberate lack of
        candor." United States v. Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113, 1139 (D.C.
        Cir. 1972) (dissenting opinion). In one especially outrageous
        case, the jury deliberated for hours in a criminal tax case
        before sending the judge a note asking: "What is jury
        nullification?" The defendant was convicted shortly after the
        judge falsely told the jury that "there is no such thing as
        valid jury nullification," and that they would violate their
        oath and the law if they did such a thing. United States v.
        Krzyske, 836 F.2d 1013,1021 (6th Cir. 1988). Over a vigorous
        dissent, the Court of Appeals deemed the instruction proper and
        affirmed the conviction, id., even after the defendant furnished
        the court with an affidavit from a juror who swore he would have
        acquitted if "we were told the truth about jury nullification."
        United States v. Krzyske, 857 F.2d 1089,1095 (6th Cir. 1988). </p>
      <p>This widespread judicial pattern is highly ironic. The courts
        have unanimously (and erroneously) refused to let defense
        attorneys argue for nullification, typically by insisting that
        the jury has no power to consider what the law should be, and
        that juries have no lawful task but to decide whether the
        defendant broke the law. Yet, in a fit of sheer inconsistency,
        the same federal courts of appeals are also unanimous that it is
        permissible for prosecutors to urge juries to act as the
        "conscience of the community" and use their verdict to "send a
        message" about whether society should be willing to tolerate the
        defendant's alleged conduct. James J. Duane, "What Message Are
        We Sending to Criminal Jurors When We Ask Them to 'Send a
        Message' With Their Verdict?," 22 Am. J. Crim. Law 565, 576-79
        (1995). </p>
      <p>The Sixth Amendment creates a right for the defendant to insist
        on a jury to act as a community conscience and protect him from
        government oppression, and yet only the State is allowed, when
        it chooses, to ask the jury to consider matters of morality and
        conscience. Id. at 590-602. Thus have we witnessed a complete
        perversion of the constitutional priorities and structure. </p>
      <p>One might fairly summarize the case law this way: "You may hope
        that the jury will refuse to apply a harsh, unfair, or
        inequitable law, but you may not urge them to do so." Steven
        Lubet, Modern Trial Advocacy 436 (1993) (emphasis added). But
        why not? Why can't we tell the jury a little bit more than we do
        about the truth? Not since the storming of the Bastille have the
        forces of government been so tightly united in their opposition
        to a popular uprising. Numerous arguments have been advanced by
        judges around the country for this refusal, but not one stands
        up to serious analysis. </p>
      <p>1. "Jury nullification is an embarrassing glitch in our law."
        What should we tell jurors about their power to nullify? The
        answer depends largely on one's attitude toward a closely
        related issue: Just what is nullification anyway, and why is it
        protected by the Constitution? One of the most frequent
        justifications for refusing to tell juries about their power to
        nullify is the pernicious suggestion that this power is the
        product of some accidental or regrettable flaw in our system of
        justice. </p>
      <p>Jury nullification has been described in many ways, some of
        which cannot be repeated in respectable society. At one extreme,
        a federal judge recently hailed it as "one of the peaceful
        barricades of freedom." Jack B. Weinstein, "Considering Jury
        'Nullification': When May and Should a Jury (p.9)Reject the Law
        to Do Justice," 30 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 239, 254 (1993). Even
        courts declining to instruct juries about the doctrine have
        conceded that "the pages of history shine on instances of the
        jury's exercise of its prerogative to disregard uncontradicted
        evidence and instructions of the judge." United States v.
        Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 1972). Notable
        examples include the courageous refusal of northern jurors to
        convict "guilty" men who violated the fugitive slave laws. Id. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, some courts have suggested that the power to
        nullify is merely "a tolerated anomaly in the rule of law.'"
        Mayfield v. United States, 659 A.2d 1249, 1254 (D.C. 1995). They
        call it a void in the law, giving jurors "the power to do what
        they want in a given case because neither the prosecution nor
        the court has the authority to compel them to do what they
        should." State v. Bjerkaas, 472 N.W.2d 615, 619 (Wis. App.
        1991). (emphasis added). Others assert that the power exists
        only because "there is nothing to prevent" it, but that it "is
        not a legally sanctioned function of the jury and should not be
        encouraged by the court." State v. Weinberg, 631 N.E.2d 97, 100
        (N.Y. 1994). The sensational-sounding charges have been made
        that a nullification instruction would "encourage the jury to
        abdicate its primary function," id., or that it would "in
        essence direct juries that they could run amuck" Davis v. State,
        520 So. 2d 493, 494-95 (Miss. 1988). Scores of other cases have
        tried to capture this same point by insisting that juries always
        have the power to nullify, but never the right to do so. </p>
      <p>So who is correct? Is the institution of nullification
        deliberately enshrined and protected in the Constitution as a
        valuable political end in itself, as some have suggested? Or is
        it merely a regrettable byproduct of careless drafting, or an
        anomalous but necessary evil we "tolerate" because of our
        commitment to some greater good? And how could the courts be so
        very far apart in their responses? The answer to this confusion
        depends on how one defines "jury nullification," a term with
        various shades of meaning. </p>
      <p>In its broadest form, "nullification" has often been used to
        describe the jury's "raw power to set an accused free for any
        reason or for no reason," Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1190, even for
        reasons having nothing to do with justice or guilt. </p>
      <p><font size="+1">The Jury's Rights</font> An acquittal may come
        because the jurors found the defendant attractive, or were
        members of the same race, or harbored hatred toward the victim's
        race, or merely because they were tired of being sequestered for
        months. This possibility, which might fairly be called "lawless
        nullification," is protected by our Constitution not for its own
        sake, but because of our commitment to the secrecy of jury
        deliberations and the finality and unreviewability of their
        verdicts. (This is true in much the same way that the First
        Amendment protects the right to say many things that nobody
        would publicly hold up as a model of good civic behavior.) </p>
      <p>There is no compelling reason why a jury should learn every
        dirty little secret of our system of justice, especially if that
        knowledge would undermine the purpose of the proceeding or the
        jurors' perception of the seriousness of their role. See
        Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 323 (1985) (error to give
        jury misleading view of the extent of appellate review of their
        sentencing recommendation). Thus, the courts are correct to hold
        that the law should not require or encourage a judge to remind
        jurors of the regrettable fact that they have the raw power to
        acquit for any arbitrary or spiteful reason, or indeed for no
        reason at all. But in no reported case, to my knowledge, has any
        defendant or his attorney requested an instruction that would go
        even half that far. </p>
      <p>In the real world, outside the pages of appellate judicial
        opinions, defendants almost invariably make the far more modest
        request that the jury be told merely of its authority to acquit
        an accused if a conviction would conflict with their deeply
        seated sense of morality and justice. In this, its purest form,
        the possibility of "nullification" is not some accidental
        byproduct of careless drafting in the Constitution, nor of our
        commitment to some greater good. It is one of the very reasons
        for the existence of the Sixth Amendment's inflexible insistence
        that the accused has the right to a jury of his peers. </p>
      <p>The jury is there, by design, "to prevent oppression by the
        Government" and to "protect against unfounded criminal charges
        brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive
        to the voice of higher authority." Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.
        145, 155-56 (1968). The jury's role "as a check on official
        power" is in fact "its intended function." Batson v. Kentucky,
        476 U.S. 79, 86-87 n.8 (1986). The jury injects "a slack into
        the enforcement of law, tempering its rigor by the mollifying
        influence of current ethical conventions." United States ex rel.
        McCann v. Adams, 126 F.2d 774, 775-76 (2d Cir. 1942) (Learned
        Hand, J.). That is why a directed verdict for the state would be
        not merely unconstitutional--it "would be totally alien to our
        notions of criminal justice," since "the discretionary act of
        jury nullification would not be permitted." Gregg v. Georgia,
        428 U.S. 153, 199 n.50 (1976) (plurality opinion). </p>
      <p>This is also the defect in the long line of cases that
        disparage (p.10)nullification by claiming that the jury has only
        the "power," but not the "right," to do it. That may be a fair
        description of the jury's latitude to acquit for any lawless
        reason that pleases them--its "power to bring in a verdict in
        the teeth of both law and facts." Horning v. District of
        Columbia, 254 U.S. 135, 138 (1920). But the jury's power to
        acquit out of justice or mercy is a constitutionally protected
        right. If not their right, it is at least the defendant's firmly
        settled right that he insist on a jury with such power,
        regardless of whether the proof of his technical legal guilt is
        literally overwhelming and uncontradicted. Sullivan v.
        Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277-82 (1993). Any judicial
        instructions that would prevent the exercise of this right are
        unconstitutional. </p>
      <p>These considerations about the historical roots of the right to
        a jury trial, by themselves, do not dispose of the question
        whether the jury should be instructed about nullification. But
        they easily suffice to dispatch the absurd suggestion that the
        latitude allowed for an acquittal based on the jury's sense of
        justice should be kept from the jury because it is only a flaw
        in the system's design, or that it is not a legally sanctioned
        function of the jury. </p>
      <p>2. "Nullification instructions encourage the jury to violate
        the law." Some courts have reasoned that a nullification
        instruction would permit, if not encourage, the jurors to
        disregard or break the law. One court even held that it is
        proper to affirmatively instruct the jurors that they would
        "violate the law" if they engaged in nullification or if they
        violated any of the judge's instructions on the law. United
        States v. Krzyske, 836 F.2d 1013, 1021 (6th Cir. 1988). Another
        has reasoned that "anarchy would result from instructing the
        jury that it may ignore the requirements of the law." Powell,
        955 F.2d at 1213. Such assertions are baseless. </p>
      <p>Contrary to the widespread myth popular among judges, there is
        no "law" that requires juries to convict every man shown to be
        technically guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. "The power of the
        courts to punish jurors for corrupt and incorrect verdicts,"
        Dougherty, 473 F.2d at 1130, that darling of the Star Chamber's
        nursery, was banished from the pages of Anglo-American law
        centuries ago. Today, at its very core, our system of justice is
        unflinchingly committed to the liberty of criminal juries to
        "err upon the side of mercy," Jackson, 443 U.S. at 317, or to
        "refuse to convict even though the evidence supported the
        charge." Gregg, 428 US. at 199 n.50. Any system that restricted
        such liberty "would be totally alien to our notions of criminal
        justice." Id. In this respect, nullification is every bit as
        lawful as leniency extended by the prosecutor, or the judge, or
        the governor. Id. </p>
      <p>Nor does any "law" forbid a jury from pardoning a man who
        violated an unjust statute, even if an acquittal requires them
        to ignore the court's instructions on the law. The Constitution
        does no such thing; it actually protects the jury's right to
        acquit based on their sense of justice. The penal code does not
        criminalize such conduct, and would be clearly unconstitutional
        if it did. Not even the Bible imposes any such rule. See
        Deuteronomy 16:20 ("Follow justice and justice alone"). If there
        is any such "law," it is true only in the narrow sense of
        illegitimate case law made up by judges acting well beyond the
        scope of their lawful authority. </p>
      <p>Judges who tell each other that "nullification is illegal" are
        more than vaguely reminiscent of the judge who once told a
        criminal defendant: "Rule Forty-Two. All persons more than a
        mile high to leave the court! It's the oldest rule in the book."
        Lewis Carroll, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 256 (Bramhall
        House 1960). As the defendant adroitly responded: "Then it ought
        to be Number One"--or it ought to be, at the very least, written
        down in the Constitution, or the penal code, or somewhere
        besides judicial opinions. </p>
      <p>3. "The Supreme Court said not to tell the jury about it." A
        surprising number of courts have tried to blame the Supreme
        Court for their refusal to tell juries about the power to acquit
        on moral grounds. That myth is also false. The Supreme Court has
        never said such a thing. </p>
      <p>In the two cases widely cited for this proposition, the Court
        merely declared that a jury is not entitled to decide what the
        law is or should be, and that "a judge always has the right and
        duty to tell them what the law is upon this or that state of
        facts that may be found." Horning v. District of Columbia, 254
        U.S. 135, 138 (1920) (Holmes, J.); accord Sparf and Hansen v.
        United States, 156 U.S. 51 (1895). This language has been widely
        cited by lower courts as authority for their refusal to permit
        any argument or instructions on nullification. E.g., Krzyske.
        836 F.2d at 1021. </p>
      <p>In fact, however, Horning and Sparf have nothing to do with
        this matter. It would indeed be improper to tell a jury that
        "they are to determine the rules of law." Dougherty, 473 F.2d at
        1136. In Sparf, for example, the Supreme Court properly refused
        a murder defendant's request that his jury be told they could
        convict him of manslaughter out of leniency, even though he
        conceded that there was no evidence to support a finding of
        guilt on such a lesser charge! 156 U.S. at 99. If that were the
        law, of course, we ought to read the jury the entire penal code,
        just in case manslaughter seems too harsh, so they could perhaps
        convict him of driving with a bad muffler instead, or maybe
        acquit him on the grounds of intoxication.(p.11) </p>
      <p>Our entire system of justice would be undermined if jurors had
        the liberty to return a false verdict--even for benign motives
        of mercy--convicting a defendant of a lesser offense she simply
        could not have committed, or acquitting her because of some
        legal defense with absolutely no basis in the evidence. </p>
      <p>But that straw man has nothing to do with the typical case of a
        defendant seeking an instruction on nullification. Such
        instructions need not suggest that jurors be told they can
        decide for themselves what the law is or should be, or that they
        can convict the defendant of some lesser offense (or acquit on
        the basis of some affirmative defense) with no basis in the
        facts. Our law does not countenance such contrivances and should
        not encourage them. But a proper nullification instruction or
        argument would merely tell the jury the fact -- or at least
        confirm their intuitive suspicion that our law intentionally
        allows them the latitude to "refuse to enforce the law's
        harshness when justice so requires." LaFave and Israel, Criminal
        Procedure § 22.1, at 960. Whether that information should be
        given to the jury has never been considered or decided by the
        Supreme Court. Id. But it is the height of hypocrisy to refuse
        to report that truthful information about our constitutional law
        to the jury on the pretense that the judge "has the right and
        duty to tell them what the law is." Horning, 254 U.S. at 138
        (emphasis added). That language, taken literally, would require
        the judge to tell the jury much more than we do about
        nullification. </p>
      <p>There is one variant of nullification, however, that appears to
        have been recently foreclosed by the Supreme Court. Without
        specifically addressing the topic of nullification, the Court
        recently held that jurors should not be given distracting
        information about the sentencing consequences of their verdict,
        even when that evidence might serve to correct inconsistent and
        erroneous beliefs the jury is likely to harbor about the effect
        of their verdict. Shannon v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 2419,
        2427 (1994). That reasoning would also appear to apply where the
        defendant seeks to tell the jury about sentencing information
        solely to persuade them to acquit out of compassion and mercy,
        as the lower courts have already acknowledged. See United States
        v. Johnson, 62 F.3d at 850. Limiting the Jury's Discretion </p>
      <p>The reasoning of Shannon, consistently applied, would take a
        big bite out of the jury's power to nullify. An oppressive
        political regime could achieve some surprising results by
        persuading a jury to convict an accused of some seemingly minor
        offense that carries a surprisingly draconian penalty. Without
        accurate sentencing information, jurors would be unable to
        nullify such a monstrous law--or worse yet, might even end up
        playing right into the government's hands by guessing
        incorrectly. </p>
      <p>Heidi Fleiss, for example, was convicted of consensual sex
        offenses by jurors who were "outraged" to later learn she faced
        a minimum three-year prison sentence. Despite several jurors'
        belief that she was innocent, the jurors had struck a deal after
        four days of deliberating and acquitted her of drug
        charges--where the evidence was stronger--because they were
        "under the mistaken impression that the narcotics charge carried
        a stiffer penalty." Shawn Hubler, "Court Overturns Fleiss'
        Conviction, Orders New Trial," L.A. Times, at A1 (May 30, 1996).
        (Of course, trials like this one--and many others--undermine the
        Supreme Court's crucial assumption that jurors can be trusted to
        heed our standard instruction to disregard possible punishment
        when reaching their verdict.) </p>
      <p>Shannon did not close the door to most forms of nullification,
        however. As the Court properly reasoned, it would be difficult
        to decide where to draw the line once we open the jury room door
        to even truthful information about the long-run sentencing
        consequences of their verdicts. Shannon, 114 S. Ct. at 2427-28
        n.11. But that logic does not apply to the normal case of
        nullification, where the accused desires an acquittal based only
        on the moral implications of the evidence already properly
        before the jury concerning the details of his conduct, and does
        not seek to smuggle into the record any facts they did not
        already learn from the prosecutor. </p>
      <p>4. "We can't encourage the jurors to violate their oath."
        Perhaps the most threadbare judicial objection to nullification
        arguments is that "neither the court nor counsel should
        encourage jurors to violate their oath." United States v.
        Trujillo, 714 F.2d 102, 106 (11th Cir. 1983). These cases
        routinely assume that a jury's oath forbids them from nullifying
        for any reason, even if based on their firm belief that a
        conviction would be a terrible miscarriage of justice. One
        prosecutor recently reiterated the age-old complaint that "jury
        nullification gives status and dignity to what is basically
        violating your oath as a juror to follow the law." Tony Perry,
        "The Simpson Verdicts," LA. Times, at 5 (Oct. 5, 1995). </p>
      <p>Moreover, it has been recommended that federal judges go one
        step further and routinely tell jurors, "You are bound by the
        oath that you took at the beginning of the trial to follow the
        instructions that I give you, even if you personally disagree
        with them." Sixth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction 1.02. If the
        jurors explicitly ask about nullification, we are told that the
        judge should warn them of the supposed "fact" that acquittal of
        a guilty man for any reason would be a breach of their solemn
        oaths as jurors. Krzyske, 836 F.2d at 1021. </p>
      <p>This ominous-sounding charge has no logical substance, although
        it naturally carries much emotional appeal. Jurors know that
        oaths are serious business, see Exodus 20:7, 16, and the law
        never permits or encourages anyone to do anything contrary to
        his oath. But despite its tremendous popularity among judges,
        this argument is by far the most misshapen stone in the
        barricade judges have been erecting around the jury box. </p>
      <p>To begin with, it is usually false. The typical oath taken by
        jurors today does not forbid them from refusing to convict based
        on their sense of justice. In fact, many oaths administered
        today are barely even intelligible. At the beginning of
        (p.12)the trial, jurors are typically asked to swear that they
        "will well and truly try and a true deliverance make between the
        United States and the defendant at the bar, and a true verdict
        render according to the evidence, so help [me] God." United
        States v. Green, 556 F.2d 71 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1977). </p>
      <p>Nobody still alive today knows for sure what it means to "make
        a true deliverance." But nothing in this oath would forbid
        jurors from acquitting if they are convinced--based solely on
        "the evidence"--that the accused's actions were morally
        blameless and that a conviction would be unjust. In such rare
        cases, no jurors could be said to have decided a case "well and
        truly" if they had to disregard their sense of justice to
        convict. And an acquittal in that case would certainly sound
        like a "true deliverance." See Proverbs 24:11 ("Rescue those
        being led away to death"); Isaiah 61:1 ("He has sent me to
        proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for
        the prisoners"). </p>
      <p>If a jury refuses to convict a man because of overwhelming
        feelings of mercy or justice, they are not returning a "false"
        verdict. A verdict of "not guilty" based on a jury's notions of
        justice is not affirmatively declaring that he is innocent. (The
        same is true of an acquittal based on their conclusion that he
        has only been shown to be probably guilty, but not beyond a
        reasonable doubt.) The general "not guilty" verdict is merely a
        shorthand way of allowing the jury to express, for reasons they
        need not explain, "we do not choose to condemn the accused by
        pronouncing him guilty." </p>
      <p>The standard objection to nullification instructions might
        carry at least superficial plausibility in those jurisdictions
        where the jury is sworn to render "a true verdict according to
        the evidence and the charge of the Court." United States v.
        Pinero, 948 F.2d 698, 699 n.3 (11th Cir. 1991). If those same
        jurors are later instructed by the court that they "must
        convict" where there is proof of legal guilt beyond a reasonable
        doubt, it probably would be a violation of such an oath to
        disregard the court's charge and acquit the man because his
        conduct was morally blameless. </p>
      <p>But this objection to nullification instructions utterly begs
        the question. It is clear that defendants can make at least a
        plausible claim to a moral (and perhaps constitutional) right to
        appeal to the jurors to acquit out of justice or mercy. That
        argument must either stand or fall on its own merit, without any
        regard to the present wording of the jurors' oath. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Constitutional Protection</font></b> </p>
      <p>It is a colossal red herring to dismiss such claims with the
        rejoinder that nullification acquittals would "violate the
        jurors' oath." No judge can brush aside a plausible
        constitutional argument by saying "You might be right, but we do
        not decide the question, because we have already extracted a
        solemn vow from the jurors to abide by a different procedure
        that arguably violates your moral and constitutional rights."
        That "logic" could lead to some remarkable results in
        jurisdictions determined to defeat other constitutional
        provisions as well. </p>
      <p>A jury's latitude to nullify is deliberately protected by the
        Constitution. Neither the tradition nor the wording of the oath
        administered to the jurors, on the other hand, is so dictated.
        In federal court it is not even prescribed by statute. It is
        simply an old tradition judges have made up. If the wording of
        the oath poses some conflict with the jury's constitutional
        prerogative to nullify, it is clear which one must yield the
        right of way. Courts simply have no business (much less lawful
        authority) asking jurors to swear to anything that would violate
        the Constitution or the jury's deeply held convictions about
        justice. </p>
      <p>Besides, while we are on the subject of oaths, it is well to
        remember that there is always one party in the courtroom who is
        required to take an oath prescribed by federal law--and it is
        not the jury. Before ascending to the bench to try his first
        case, every federal judge is required by law to swear or affirm
        to uphold the Constitution (which includes the Sixth Amendment),
        and "that I will administer justice without respect to persons."
        28 U.S.C. § 453. That is a most peculiar-sounding oath for
        anyone who intends to browbeat jurors into putting aside any
        notions of "justice" that might stand in the way of their
        willingness to condemn a morally blameless man. </p>
      <p>Beyond all this, perhaps the most blasphemous aspect of the
        invocation of the oath is the simple fact that we really do not
        expect jurors to refrain from nullifying in all circumstances.
        That being the case, it ill-behooves us to place jurors under an
        oath that they will not nullify (much less lie to them about
        whether they have taken such an oath). </p>
      <p>At least for those jurors who take their oaths seriously, it
        places them in an intolerable and totally unnecessary conflict
        between deeply held moral scruples. It demeans the seriousness
        of the oath, which stands at the very bedrock of our system of
        justice. United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 97 (1993). </p>
      <p>And when citizens and jurors gradually get wind of the fact
        that we really don't expect them to always refrain from
        nullifying, despite their alleged oaths to the contrary, who can
        blame any of those people from cutting corners with their future
        oaths as witnesses or elected officials? </p>
      <p>5. "We give them enough hints already." Perhaps the most
        baffling excuse for refusing to tell jurors about nullification
        is the excuse that we already give them a few ambiguous
        (p.13)clues about their power to nullify. In the seminal
        Dougherty case, for example, which remains the most influential
        opinion ever written on this topic, the Court of Appeals
        reasoned that explicit instructions would be superfluous, in
        part because juries get the message in a variety of subtle ways.
        The court based this holding, in part, on its axiomatic
        assumption of "the fact that the judge tells the jury it must
        acquit (in case of reasonable doubt) but never tells the jury in
        so many words that it must convict." 473 F.2d at 1135 (emphasis
        added) </p>
      <p>The first problem with this justification is that it proceeds
        on a premise that is no longer generally true. Contrary to the
        Dougherty court's assumption about what a criminal trial judge
        would "never" do, the United States Judicial Conference has
        instructed federal judges to tell every criminal jury that "if
        you are firmly convinced that the defendant is guilty of the
        crime charged, you must find him guilty." Federal Judicial
        Center, Pattern Jury Instructions 21 (1987). Several courts have
        formally approved similar instructions telling the jury they
        "must" convict. See People v. Bernhard Goetz, 73 N.Y. 2d 751,
        752, 532 N.E.2d 1273 (N.Y. 1988). Indeed, one Circuit Court of
        Appeals recently went so far as to state (in an unpublished
        decision) that instructing jurors any other way--for example,
        that they "should" convict--is at least "arguably" forbidden by
        the supposed "rule" that a jury is not to be told that
        nullification is a permissible course to take. United States v.
        Fuentes, 57 F.3d 1061, 1995 WL 352808 at **2 (1st Cir. 1995). </p>
      <p>The reasoning of these cases is indefensible. Telling a jury
        they "must" convict where guilt has been proven beyond a
        reasonable doubt is a serious misstatement of the law and "an
        error of the most egregious nature." Proceedings of the 53rd
        Jud. Conf. of the D.C Circuit, 145 F.R.D. 149, 175 (1992)
        (Remarks of R. Kenneth Mundy, Esq.). Under our Constitution, by
        design, a defendant is entitled to have his fate decided by a
        jury even if the evidence of his guilt is undisputed and
        decisive. Sullivan, 508 U.S. at 277. This is because criminal
        jurors are entitled to "refuse to convict even though the
        evidence supported the charge," and any legal system which would
        strip jurors of that discretion would be "totally alien to our
        notions of criminal justice." Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153,
        199 n.50 (1976). </p>
      <p>Besides, even if we gave jurors the instruction that they
        "should" convict, it would hardly suffice to convey to the jury
        the solemnity of their awesome responsibility to acquit on the
        grounds of justice in exceptional cases. The Dougherty court
        candidly conceded that the pregnant implications of that
        ambiguity "would on their face seem too weak to notice." 473
        F.2d at 1135. And even if some jurors could be fairly trusted to
        pick up on the subtle ambiguity left open in the contrast
        between instructions as to when they "should convict" and "must
        acquit," others will not. Far too much is at stake here to trust
        such nuances to a haphazard system of instructing jurors with
        hints. It violates both the Due Process and Equal Protection
        Clauses to let the outcome of criminal cases turn on "coded
        instructions" that we hope and pray a few jurors will be clever
        enough to notice and decipher on their own, all for the benefit
        of a select and arbitrarily chosen group of lucky defendants.
        Such a system of "justice" is no better than a judge who thinks
        too many jurors are relying on the insanity defense, so he
        sticks that portion of his instructions in one of eight empty
        drawers under the table in the jury room. </p>
      <p>We see a similar fallacy in another bizarre compromise struck
        by several lower courts. Caught between the conflicting commands
        of the Sixth Amendment ("juries exist to protect the accused
        from the Government") and the appellate courts ("tell the jury
        they must ignore the demands of justice"), several trial judges
        have adopted the pathetic compromise of allowing the defense
        attorney to talk about nullification in closing arguments, but
        have refused to endorse such arguments in their instructions,
        even after the jurors predictably ask for further guidance from
        the judge. E.g., Krzyske, 836 F.2d at 1021. This, too, is no
        solution. </p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that "arguments of
        counsel cannot substitute for instructions by the court." Carter
        v. Kentucky, 450 U.S. 288, 304 (1981). "The former are usually
        billed in advance to the jury as matters of argument, not
        evidence, and are likely viewed as the statements of advocates;
        the latter, we have often recognized, are viewed as definitive
        and binding statements of the law." Boyde v. California, 494
        U.S. 370, 384 (1990). </p>
      <p>No matter how infrequently we hope to see juries exercise their
        constitutionally protected power to nullify the operation of
        unjust laws, there is simply far too much at stake to entrust
        that important possibility to the implications of "cryptographic
        instructions," or to closing arguments that seem to conflict
        with the charge of the court. In the final analysis, the best
        answer to all this nonsense was written long ago by Judge
        Cardozo. He observed in a related context that he had no
        objection to giving a jury greater latitude with their verdicts
        in a case that "seems to call irresistibly for the exercise of
        mercy, but it should be given to them directly and not in a
        mystifying cloud of words." "What Medicine Can Do for Law," in
        Law and Literature 70, 100 (1931) (quoted in McGautha v.
        California, 402 U.S. 183, 199 (1971)). </p>
      <p>6. "If the case is important enough, they will figure out we're
        not too serious about all this anyhow." There have been many
        silly excuses for refusing to tell juries the truth about their
        lawful authority to nullify. But the most frightening of all
        teaches that jurors are most likely to nullify only on rare and
        special cases just as we secretly hope they will--if we falsely
        suggest to them that they have no such power or moral authority.
      </p>
      <p>The reasoning here is that the lawful power to nullify is least
        likely to be abused, and most likely to be reserved for the rare
        cases when it is truly appropriate, if we structure our rules to
        make nullification "an act in contravention of the established
        instructions." Dougherty, 473 F.2d at 1136-37. After all, the
        argument goes, jurors always draw their understanding about the
        operation of the system from a variety of (p.14)sources in the
        popular culture, even apart from the judge's instructions. Id.
        at 1135. This will, in theory, allow nullification to rear its
        ugly head only when the inequities of the case are sufficiently
        compelling to persuade the jurors to cook up the idea and
        violate the judge's instructions on their own initiative. Id. at
        1136. </p>
      <p>This "reasoning" was never persuasive even when it was first
        handed down to the lower courts more than 20 years ago, as Chief
        Judge Bazelon noted in his dissenting opinion in Dougherty. But
        it is indefensible today. Even if one could possibly hope that
        "nullification" might be a secret to most jurors two decades
        ago, those days are now gone. Everyone who followed the key
        events in O.J. Simpson's criminal trial -- which means everyone
        -- understands by now at least this much: jurors in a criminal
        trial can listen to ten months of evidence that the government
        has publicly proclaimed to be overwhelming and conclusive, and
        still acquit after three hours of deliberating without being
        stopped on their way to the parking lot. That is, in the main, a
        pretty fair description of the rough contours of the jury's
        power to nullify. </p>
      <p>At about the same time, a law professor has quickly risen to
        fame with his remarkable plea that black political and spiritual
        leaders join his quest to inform their constituencies of their
        undisputed power to acquit black defendants solely because of
        their race. Paul Butler, Racially Based Jury Nullification:
        Black Power in the Criminal Justice System, 105 Yale L.J. 677,
        723-25 (1995). That dirty little secret about our criminal
        justice system was subsequently featured in countless
        newspapers, articles, and television shows. Professor Butler has
        appeared to discuss this fact on 60 Minutes and Geraldo Rivera.
        If there was anyone who hadn't heard before this summer, the lid
        was blown off the story once and for all when it ran in the June
        1996 issue of Reader's Digest. </p>
      <p>Joining in the fray with gusto, of course, is the Fully
        Informed Jury Association (FIJA), a tax-exempt educational group
        with thousands of members devoted to informing future jurors
        about their power to nullify. They even have an impressive and
        thoughtful site on the Internet with hundreds of visitors each
        day. (Although I am naturally loath to admit having visited it
        in a journal the FBI may be reading.) Members have passed out
        pamphlets about nullification by the thousands outside of key
        trials. Legislation to require judges to issue such instructions
        has been introduced in dozens of state legislatures, as yet
        unsuccessfully, generating even more public attention to the
        topic. The group complains -- with some justification -- that
        they desire only to see to it that judges, like everyone else in
        the courtroom, are required to tell the truth and the whole
        truth. </p>
      <p>With all this amateur mass legal education going on in earnest,
        "barber shops and beauty parlors everywhere are all abuzz with
        talk of 'jury nullification,' whether they call it by its proper
        name or not." Clarence Page, "Jury Nullification Can Create
        Justice," Dayton Daily News, A10 (Nov. 27, 1995). Our judicial
        system needs to take stock of this reality, and fast. The
        integrity and credibility of the system will be stretched to the
        breaking point as more and more jurors bring to their secret
        deliberations "inside knowledge" about the way the system really
        works, and about the reasons for the judge's refusal to share or
        confirm those details. </p>
      <p>To make matters worse, imagine what will happen when even a few
        people bring into the jury room the secret knowledge that our
        system conceals the facts about nullification in the explicit
        (but unshared) hope that the jurors will see through our
        standard instructions and ignore them when that is called for!
        At that point, we will have no reliable protection against the
        danger that some jurors will reason, perhaps privately, that
        maybe some of our other hard and fast "rules of law" are also
        there for public relations purposes, designed to be ignored in
        special cases by jurors sophisticated enough to know how the
        system really works--or can be worked. The integrity of our
        court system will then be shattered beyond repair. </p>
      <p>But for the fragile good faith of jurors, for example, we have
        no logical or moral basis for our otherwise rash assumption that
        a juror can be trusted to acquit, rather than convict, a
        defendant who has not quite been proven guilty beyond a
        reasonable doubt, "even if he is convinced the defendant is
        highly dangerous and should be incarcerated." Shannon, 114 S.
        Ct. at 2427. When jurors get wind of the appearance that at
        least some of our most fundamental rules are really just window
        dressing, what protection will we have against "nullification
        convictions" by jurors who refuse to release dangerous or
        despicable villains entitled to acquittals on the basis of
        seemingly unjust legal technicalities? </p>
      <p>More and more legal essays are starting to surface with the
        rather casual assertion that "nullification convictions" can
        never be a real danger, in part because the judge and the Court
        of Appeals supposedly have the power to overturn a guilty
        verdict that is not supported by the evidence. E.g., Gail Cox,
        "Feeling the Pressure: Jurors Rise Up Over Principle and Their
        Perks," Nat'l law J., A1 (May 29, 1995). Those assurances, if
        repeated often enough, will make the problem even worse. </p>
      <p>This supposed "fact" about our system of justice is the most
        nefarious of all, and will do irreparable damage if it falls
        into the wrong hands in the jury room. It is hard to imagine a
        clearer illustration of the maxim that a little knowledge can be
        a dangerous thing. Any jurors will be far more inclined to
        convict in close cases if they have picked up the mistaken
        impression that a judge is both empowered and likely to correct
        any mistakes in their assessment of the evidence. (That is
        especially true if one of the jurors advises the others that a
        mistaken verdict of acquittal, on the other hand, is final and
        unreviewable, which is now fairly common knowledge after the
        Simpson trial.) That would only enhance the already great
        temptation for them to abdicate their solemn responsibility by
        passing the buck to the judge. </p>
      <p>In fact, a judge's power to enter a judgment of acquittal
        despite a contrary jury verdict is merely a token safeguard
        against the unjust conviction of the innocent (and anyone
        (p.59)else not proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt). It
        serves to overturn unjust convictions only after the extremely
        rare trial where there is no evidence that could satisfy any
        rational jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In all other cases, one
        seeking to overturn a guilty verdict based on the sufficiency or
        quality of the evidence against him "follows in the footsteps of
        countless criminal defendants who have made (p.60)similar
        arguments," and "faces a nearly insurmountable hurdle." United
        States v. Hickok, 77 F.3d 992, 1002 (7th Cir. 1996). The judge
        cannot reweigh the evidence, and challenges to a witness's lack
        of credibility are "wasted on an appellate court." United States
        v. Pulido, 69 F.3d 192, 206 (7th Cir. 1995). Once the jury
        chooses to convict, regardless of the reason, its verdict will
        stand as long as it is based on any evidence in the record they
        might have chosen to believe, even testimony that "is totally
        uncorroborated and comes from an admitted liar, convicted felon,
        large-scale, drug-dealing, paid government informant." Pulido,
        69 F.3d at 206. Heaven help us all if the jurors of the nation
        get word of these exaggerated suggestions that federal judges
        stand guard against "nullification convictions"! </p>
      <p><font size="+1">Inadequate Solution</font> Besides, even if we
        radically restructured federal law to give a judge plenary
        authority to reverse a conviction she thought was not proven
        beyond a reasonable doubt, it still would not solve the problem.
        Even that arrangement would not be adequate to protect the
        constitutional rights of the accused. "It would not satisfy the
        Sixth Amendment to have a jury determine that the defendant is
        probably guilty, and then leave it up to the judge to determine
        whether he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." Sullivan, 508
        U.S. at 278. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as more Americans get the justifiable impression
        that the courts are not being perfectly candid with jurors, they
        are naturally and gradually losing their normal inhibitions
        about lying to judges. Prior to sensational trials, jurors'
        rights activists now give everyone entering the courthouse
        pamphlets advising of them of their power to nullify, warning
        them that the judge will deny it, and pleading with them to deny
        any "knowledge of this material" during jury selection. Joe
        Lambe, "Bill Would Let Juries Decide Law in Cases; Legal
        Establishment Reacts to Measure with Shock, Dread," Kansas City
        Star, at A1 (April 8, 1996). An outspoken law professor has
        publicly declared his willingness to lie under oath during jury
        selection, if necessary, to conceal his true attitudes toward
        nullification and get the chance to nullify death penalty cases.
        Paul Butler, Racially Based Jury Nullification: Black Power in
        the Criminal Justice System, 105 Yale L.J. 677, 724-25 n.236
        (1995). That same law teacher has also invited Americans by the
        thousands to decide for themselves whether perjury during jury
        selection might be "morally justifiable" for some greater good
        such as racial justice. Id. </p>
      <p>If our criminal justice system is to retain some semblance of
        integrity in the long run, it is vital that we treat jurors with
        greater candor about the moral and legal contours of their power
        to nullify. Fortunately, it wouldn't take long. A clear and
        adequate instruction could be conveyed in a single sentence,
        explaining that the jury should (not "must") convict anyone
        proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, unless the jurors have
        a firm belief that a conviction would be fundamentally unjust.
        Such an instruction would give defendants all the protection
        they deserve against wrongful prosecution. It would preserve the
        jury's constitutionally protected veto power over unjust
        prosecutions. It would minimize the terrible danger of jurors
        persuading each other that the judge is withholding (or
        concealing) crucial facts about the way the system is designed
        to work. And it would, at long last, permit us in good
        conscience and good faith to ask jurors to take a solemn oath to
        abide by the court's charge. </p>
      <p>Proper instructions on nullification are now quite like sex
        education to youth in many different ways. There may well have
        been a time, several decades ago, when it was feasible to avoid
        both subjects altogether, hoping that our young wards would
        never even hear much about them until a truly pressing need
        might arise for them to divine a few things on their own
        initiative. But now there are precious few secrets about either
        subject that cannot be found on the Internet and in every major
        magazine--along with many dangerous falsehoods and half-truths.
        If we persist in our refusal to confront these delicate topics
        head-on, jurors and children will continue making terrible
        choices as they learn for themselves what a dangerous thing a
        little knowledge can be. And in the process, judges and parents
        alike will continue to lose much of their credibility in the
        eyes of those who correctly perceive their right to honest
        guidance from us. </p>
