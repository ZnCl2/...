of the Thirteen Colonies</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Congress, July 4, 1776</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The unanimous Declaration of the
thirteen United States of America,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When in the Course of human events,
it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which
have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the
earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and
the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute
new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
Safety and Happiness.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prudence, indeed, will dictate that
Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient
causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But when a long train of abuses and
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce
them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to
throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such has been the patient sufferance
of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them
to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present
King of Great Britain [George III] is a history of repeated injuries and
usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute
Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid
world.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has refused his Assent to Laws,
the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has forbidden his Governors to
pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
operation till his Assent should be obtained, and when so suspended, he
has utterly neglected to attend to them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has refused to pass other Laws
for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people
would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right
inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has called together legislative
bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository
of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
with his measures.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has dissolved Representative Houses
repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights
of the people.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has refused for a long time, after
such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative
powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large
for their exercise; the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all
the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has endeavoured to prevent the
population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization
of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither,
and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has obstructed the Administration
of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has made Judges dependent on his
Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment
of their salaries.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has erected a multitude of New
Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people, and eat
out their substance.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has kept among us, in times of
peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has affected to render the Military
independent of and superior to the Civil power.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has combined with others to subject
us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by
our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For quartering large bodies of armed
troops among us:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For protecting them by a mock Trial
from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants
of these States:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For cutting off our Trade with all
parts of the world:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For imposing Taxes on us without
our Consent:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For depriving us in many cases of
the benefits of Trial by Jury:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For transporting us beyond Seas to
be tried for pretended offences:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For abolishing the free System of
English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary
government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an
example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
these Colonies:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For taking away our Charters, abolishing
our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For suspending our own Legislatures,
and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all
cases whatsoever.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has abdicated Government here
by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has plundered our seas, ravaged
our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He is at this time transporting large
Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation
and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely
paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of
a civilized nation.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has constrained our fellow Citizens
taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become
the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by
their Hands.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He has excited domestic insurrections
amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers,
the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In every stage of these Oppressions
We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated Petitions
have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is
thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the
ruler of a free people.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nor have We been wanting in attentions
to our British brethren.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have warned them from time to
time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction
over us.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have reminded them of the circumstances
of our emigration and settlement here.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have appealed to their native
justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common
kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt
our connections and correspondence.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They too have been deaf to the voice
of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity,
which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We, therefore, the Representatives
of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing
to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions,
do, in the Name, and by the authority of the good People of these Colonies,
solemnly publish and declare.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That these United Colonies are, and
of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved
from all Allegiance to the British Crown,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and that all political connection
between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally
dissolved;</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and that as Free and Independent
States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
establish Commerce,</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and to do all other Acts and Things
which Independent States may of right do.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And for the support of this Declaration,
with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually
pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.</font>
